"Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher pulled no punches in their scathing assessment of Manchester City's performance during the 2-1 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. Neville felt Sunday's showing was far from what is to be expected of title challengers and indeed of last season's champions. Meanwhile Carragher, who also writes a column for Sportsmail, has questioned the suitability of City manager Manuel Pellegrini's tactics. Sky Sports pundit and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher laid into Manchester City's poor performance . Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson (left) pressures Manchester City's James Milner for the ball . Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho (right) had an outstanding game against Manchester City . 'If I was a Manchester City player, I'd be embarrassed how easy it is to play through them,' Neville said during live commentary on Sky Sports. 'We're judging Manchester City as champions of the Premier League. There has to be progression year on year, you have to get better. But this team, we keep seeing the same mistakes being made' Prior to the Liverpool game, questions had been raised over Pellegrini's decision to play with two strikers and leave his midfield exposed. With flair players David Silva and Samir Nasri also not fulfilling their defensive duties, the Chilean's bold selections appeared to have signalled some oversight. And in the post-match analysis, Carragher offered his opinion: 'To employ that system (4-4-2) in the big games is so naive. It's embarrassing really for a manager at that level to go into a game against Barcelona two years running and then again at Anfield like this. 'Something is not right about City and there has to be changes at the end of the season.' City sit second in the Premier League table but they are five points off the pace of leaders Chelsea having played a game more.

"Pakistan boosted their chances of reaching the Cricket World Cup quarter-finals by defeating the United Arab Emirates by 129 runs in Napier. A second-wicket partnership of 160 between Ahmed Shehzad (93) and Haris Sohail (70) and a quick-fire 65 from captain Misbah-ul-Haq helped Pakistan amass 339 for six in their 50 overs, and although the UAE lost only eight wickets in their reply, they made just 210, leaving them well short of their target. Victory at McLean Park moved Pakistan up to fourth in Pool B at the expense of Ireland, with the two sides going head to head in Adelaide on March 15. Pakistan's Ahmed Shehzad hits out during his innings of 93 in their World Cup victory over the UAE . Shehzad anchored the Pakistan innings with 93 as his team posted a total of 339 for six in Napier . Haris Sohail also made 70 runs as Pakistan set a large total in Napier, ultimately winning by 129 runs . Pakistan captain Misbah Ul Haq chipped in with a quickfire 65 as the runs racked up . Pakistan's total would have been challenging for an established nation, let alone an associate, although they did not get off to the best of starts. The match was only 3.3 overs old when Nasir Jamshed went looking to pull and succeeded only in skying Manjula Guruge's short delivery to mid-on to depart for four. Sohail joined Shehzad at the crease and it was not long before the scoreboard began to tick over, with the Pakistan total passing 100 in the 23rd over. Shehzad, dropped in the seventh and eighth overs, lifted Amjad Javed over the ropes for the first six of the match at the end of the 16th over and was raising his bat to celebrate fifty - his 11th in ODIs - in the 24th over. Sohail joined his batting partner in passing the half-century mark in the very next over off Mohammad Tauqir - which also pushed their partnership past the 100-run mark. Pakistan celebrate at the end of their 129-run victory in Napier, which boosts their quarter-final chances . Pakistan moved up to fourth in Pool B ahead of Ireland, whom they play in Adelaide on March 15 . Misbah-ul-Haq pulls the ball away for four during Pakistan's innings as the UAE were batted out of the match . Sohail clubbed Krishna Chandran to the mid-wicket boundary as the partnership passed 150 at the start of the 32nd over but his time at the crease came to an end in the next over as he mis-hit Mohammad Naveed to mid-on to depart for 70 from 83 balls. Shehzad was run out for 93, from 105 balls, shorty afterwards but with captain Misbah joining Sohaib Maqsood in the middle, Pakistan were well set on 176 for three with 15.5 overs to play. Misbah and Maqsood put on 75 runs in 8.5 overs for the fourth wicket, but their quick-fire partnership ended in the 43rd over with Pakistan on 251 as Maqsood, having made 45 from 31 deliveries, clubbed to backward point where Rohan Mustafa juggled repeatedly before taking the catch. Misbah continued to score freely after Maqsood's departure and brought up his 41st ODI fifty at the end of the 46th over before he and Umar Akmal (19) fell to Guruge in the penultimate over. UAE opener Andri Berenger walks off after being dismissed by Sohail Khan for two runs . Sohail Khan celebrates after taking one of his two wickets as the UAE were reduced to 210 for eight . Pakistan's Rahat Ali (left) celebrates with his team-mates after removing Amjad Ali for 14 runs . Shahid Afridi clubbed 21 runs from seven balls in the closing stages to pass 8,000 runs in ODI cricket as Pakistan set UAE an unlikely target of 340 to win the match. Rahat Ali drew first blood for Pakistan in the seventh over of UAE's innings when Amjad Ali (14) chopped on to his own stumps to leave the associate nation on 19 for one. The score had not changed when Sohail Khan tricked Andri Berenger into edging behind five balls later to leave UAE two down and facing an uphill battle. Their challenge became even more difficult when Krishna Chandran offered a leading edge to give Khan his second wicket and leave UAE struggling on 25 for three after 10 overs. Shehzad's innings came to an end when he was run out by Shaiman Anwar . The UAE players celebrate after taking the wicket of Pakistan batsman Sohaib Maqsood . But Khurram Khan and Shaiman Anwar posted 83 to steady the ship, before the former was caught at backward square leg off Maqsood, going for 43. Anwar progressed for a third ODI 50 off 75 balls, but when he holed out to Afridi for 62, the score was left on 140 for five and the game was close to being up. Rohan Mustafa did not help matters, caught at short fine leg off Afridi for a second-ball duck, but a 68-stand between Amjad Javed and Swapnil Patil at least added some credibility. Javed (40) took on one shot too many and was caught at long on off Wahab Riaz, while Patil was cleaned up by the same bowler for 36, leaving the UAE out of time and hope.","Pakistan posted a total of 339 for six from their 50 overs in Napier .

"Pakistan finally got their World Cup campaign up and running as they beat Zimbabwe by 20 runs in a low-scoring contest in Brisbane. Batting first they made 235 - recovering from four for two - and were then able to restrict Zimbabwe to 215 all out in their chase, meaning they picked up a first victory after defeats to India and West Indies. Captain Misbah-ul-Haq's 73 underpinned the Pakistan batting, while Mohammad Irfan (four for 30) and Wahab Riaz (four for 35) shone with the ball. Pakistan's Mohammad Irfan celebrates the wicket of Solomon Mire; the bowler took four wickets for 30 runs . Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq top-scored for his side, managing 73 runs before being dismissed . Ul-Haq plays a shot, while Zimbabwe wicket keeper Brendan Taylor watches on from behind the stumps . They shackled Zimbabwe, with Brendan Taylor's 50 not enough to get the job done. Irfan removed the top three for a combined 46, having Chamu Chibhabha (nine) and Sikandar Raza (eight) edging him to second slip, while Hamilton Masakadza holed out to mid-on (29). Taylor had made good progress but nicked Riaz behind for a 72-ball 50, and the wickets continued to fall as Sean Williams hit Rahat Ali to backward point (33). Solomon Mire made just eight before Irfan got rid of him, and Craig Ervine 14 nicked Riaz to Umar Akmal - one of five catches for the keeper. The Pakistan players celebrate after taking the wicket of Zimbabwe's Wahab Riaz during their Pool B match . Earlier in the day, Shahid Afridi was dismissed for a duck, but Pakistan managed to put together a total of 235 . Tendai Chatar (second left) is surrounded by his Zimbabwe team-mates after dismissing Nasir Jamshed . Tuwanda Mupariwa went for a duck, Tinashe Panyangara was run out for 10 and then, when Elton Chigumbura edged Riaz behind, the game was done. It was fortunate for Pakistan that they were not facing a more dangerous side considering their own score. Their innings got off to a terrible start and they found themselves reeling on four for two after only 23 balls. Nasir Jamshed was the first man out, caught at square leg off the bowling of Tendai Chatara. Elton Chigumbura suffered a suspected torn quadricep while fielding, but managed to bat later on in the day . Chigumbura lies on the turf in Brisbane, but the Zimbabwe captain later took to the field, scoring 35 runs . Taylor (left) watches on as Afridi dives low to his left to stop the ball going past him during the match . The same bowler took the second wicket too, inducing an edge off Ahmed Shehzad who nicked behind for an 11-ball duck. Haris Sohail joined up with Misbah and the duo put on 54 until the former was caught at short mid-wicket, Raza doing the job. Another healthy stand, this time of 69, pushed the team score behind a hundred, before Akmal (33) was cleaned up by Williams. Afridi (centre) walks from the crease after being dismissed for a duck off the bowling of Sean Williams . Tawanda Mupariwa (centre) celebrates after he caught and bowled Sohaib Maqsood of Pakistan . It had been a fine performance by Zimbabwe at that point and it got better when Shahid Afridi holed out for a second-ball duck on his 35th birthday, bowled by Williams. Sohaib Maqsood added 21, having been dropped by Ervine on eight, while a substitute fielder also shelled Riaz when he was on 41, with the number 10 going on to make his first ODI half-century from 45 balls. He was left unbeaten on 54 at the end, with Sohail caught and bowled by Mupariwa and Misbah removed for an excellent 73 when he was caught at long on, giving Chatara his third scalp for 35 runs. Zimbabwe's Sikandar Raza avoids a short delivery from Pakistan's 7ft 1 bowler Irfan, who impressed .

"Lewis Hamilton's unrivalled speed was on show as he dominated the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. But Formula One's reigning world champion chose a different gear when he visited Sydney, the Victorian capital's fierce rival to the north. Hamilton got behind the wheel of a luxurious yacht on Sydney Harbour after a day of interviews in which he supported talk of a street circuit grand prix in the city in the near future.

"A shocking video has emerged of a Canadian police officer smashing a car window and dragging the driver onto the road during a traffic stop. The unidentified Vancouver sergeant pulled over the man, identified as Bodhi Sattva on YouTube, because he and his colleague 'smelled marijuana'. The motorists refuses to roll down the window and instead asks the officer why he had been stopped. 'Hit the brakes you moron. Open the door,' the cop says, but Sattva insists he has done nothing wrong. 'I'm not playing this game,' the officer warns. 'I'm gonna break the window now in two seconds.' Sattva contests he has done nothing wrong and tells the officer he is on the phone to his lawyer. The officer threatens to break the window again while Sattva says he 'does not consent'. Just seconds later the burly officer smashes pane of the glass and drags him out onto the tarmac. He can be heard: 'What are you doing?' He then complains that the cop is hurting his should as he is dragged along the ground. The Vancouver Police Department told CBC the driver was charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession for the purposes of trafficking and obstructing a police officer. The force also reportedly said that if drivers don't want their windows smashed in, they should just cooperate with police. The incident took place in November but was only released at the weekend.

"When England crashed out of the last global limited-overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the Netherlands to complete what had been a hugely disappointing World Twenty20. Fast forward 10 months and here we are again amid more recriminations over another lost campaign and a final match, this time against Afghanistan, where England have far more to lose than just a meaningless group match. Ashley Giles will not need reminding that a dispirited England lost to Holland in Bangladesh and any hope he had of becoming head coach disappeared along with their chances of making an impact on yet another world stage. England coach Peter Moores and batting coach Mark Ramprakash watch over training on Wednesday . The World Cup flops form a huddle on the Sydney Cricket Ground as they prepare to face Afghanistan . Indications are Peter Moores will keep his job, at least for the Test series in the Caribbean, whatever happens at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday morning but the last thing he needs is another humiliating loss against another of the ‘minnows.’ The fact England turned up early on Wednesday for what used to be known as naughty boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their desperate need to take something, anything, from their worst ever World Cup. England are the laughing stock of world cricket again and there is no body of people who enjoy that scenario more than an Australian nation who cannot believe their luck that the old enemy have gone out of their World Cup so soon. Moores (centre back) looks set to keep his job at least until after the Test series in the West Indies . Victory against an Afghanistan side who have made a remarkable journey from the refugee camps of Pakistan to be here would barely regain any pride for an England team who are still coming to terms with what they have done. But for Moores it would perhaps keep the wolves away from his door for just a short while before he helps put the finishing touches to a squad for the three-Test series in the West Indies next month that will be named on Tuesday. England will be without Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two players who can still expect a one-day future, when they face Afghanistan and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to St Kitts on April 2. Moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the fateful defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide while Woakes has a ‘stress reaction’ in his third metatarsal of his left foot. Both will be assessed when England get home. Senior England paceman Stuart Broad warms up with a rugby ball on the SCG during their session in the sun . In their absence it is to be hoped England give games to the two players yet to appear in this World Cup in James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara, not least before both could then be making their final one-day international appearances. If England are serious about ever making an impact in one-day cricket they have to start from scratch after this tournament with a squad full of players who will be at or near their peak in 2019. That means there is little point in them persevering in 50-over cricket beyond Friday with the likes of Tredwell, Bopara and the senior trio of Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, who yesterday insisted he wants to play on. A dead rubber against Afghanistan is hardly the way all of them would have wanted to bow out but at least they will be meeting a team with an identical World Cup record as themselves – just a single victory against Scotland. There was a familiar figure at the helm of the Afghan team at the SCG yesterday in the avuncular form of coach Andy Moles, the former Warwickshire batsman who has ignored security advice to work in Kabul. History repeating? England will be eager to avoid a repeat to their loss to Netherlands (pictured) in their World T20 group dead rubber when the same scenario is presented to them on Friday against Afghanistan . Moles has been in charge of a team who have defeated England before – when he coached New Zealand in the Champions Trophy – and would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland. ‘England are not in the best of nick and we still believe we’ve got a scare in us in this World Cup, especially if we show composure at the top of the order,’ said Moles. ‘If we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock. ‘I’m obviously sad to see England’s demise but I’m delighted to be here with Afghanistan. We’ve had some great learning experiences, had our first win and gave Sri Lanka a scare. This has been a shop window for Afghan cricket and I think we’ve made friends. We play with a freedom that I’ve tried to enhance.’ It is the ability to play with freedom that has been so badly lacking in England’s cricket but they have one more chance to get it right before they slink off on an early flight home. Otherwise they will lose as many friends as the Afghans have gained.","England face Afghanistan with more to lose than a World Cup dead rubber .

"Celtic manager Ronny Deila has insisted that he has no regrets over publicly targeting a domestic treble in his first season as Celtic boss. The Norwegian has set the bar high and riled opponents by repeatedly saying he wants nothing less than a clean sweep. Jock Stein and Martin O’Neill are the only Parkhead managers in the club’s history to have achieved the feat. Celtic boss Ronny Deila will be hoping to get his hands on the Scottish League Cup this weekend . Deila believes he set his side a realistic target in trying to win a domestic treble . However, Deila defended the treble talk, saying: ‘What’s the worst thing that can happen? That you don’t reach your goals? ‘I can say I am happy to win one title this year and reach a goal. But that’s boring. You can say something else, but everybody knows the demands of this club. I have said that all season and there is so much hard work and so many games but we have a good chance to win a trophy on Sunday and we have prepared for that.’ The accepted practice for managers is to try to remove pressure and expectation from the shoulders of their players by playing down trophy talk, but Deila rejects that idea completely. ‘I learned at Stromsgodset that if you say you are satisfied to be number six then you come sixth. ‘If you say then that you only want to get to the cup final then you lose the cup final. ‘You have to say you want to win the league or League Cup. You have to reach for something. It’s in your head mentally. Martin O'Neill was the last manager to win the domestic treble at Celtic . ‘This club is so big and has such a good team that it’s possible. If I didn’t think it was possible I wouldn’t say it. But I know it’s possible and that’s why I set high goals and make high demands.’ Desperate to win his first trophy as Celtic manager, Deila has removed a ban on his daughters attending games following some early setbacks when they attended. ‘I have to be fair with them. They were at the Aberdeen game, away, standing with the supporters. It was a crazy experience for them. They just said that the supporters were crazy and they don’t look at the football match. They smelled of smoke and beer. But they will be here on Sunday.’ Famously pictured removing his clothes on the pitch after Stromsgodset avoided relegation, Deila says he has no plans to embarrass his daughters by repeating the feat if he wins on Sunday. ‘They are used to it. They’ve seen their father doing stupid things before. They are 15 years old and they are probably a little embarrassed about that. ‘They were there when I took off my clothes after that game. We were sitting on the couch the day after that game, watching it on television. It was not a great sight. If we win on Sunday you can expect a good celebration with the others. I will not take off my clothes.’ Celtic’s rearranged Premiership fixture with Dundee at Dens Park will now be played on April 22, with a 7.45pm kick-off, because of the Parkhead side’s Scottish Cup quarter-final replay.","Ronny Deila insists it would be boring to just focus on winning the league .

In what proved to be Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene’s final one-day international matches for Sri Lanka, South Africa showed they are not a side willing to hold on to the tag of ‘chokers’. An immense display with the ball, from spinners Imran Tahir and JP Duminy, and in the field helped South Africa bowl out their opponents for a paltry 133, before the under-pressure Quinton de Kock hit a sublime unbeaten 78. JP Duminy leaps in celebration as he claims the wicket of Tharindu Kaushal on his way to a hat-trick . South Africa celebrate the opening wicket of Kusal Perera in their dominant quarter-final win over Sri Lanka . Proteas fast bowler Kyle Abbott jumps for joy after catching the edge of Sri Lankan opener Perera . Keeper Quinton de Kock claims the catch as Sri Lanka's first wicket falls for just three runs . With all the pre-game talk being dominated about South Africa’s failure to win a single knock-out match since their reintroduction into international cricket 20 years ago, they looked like a team intent on proving they have the ability and nerve to go all the way. After Rangana Herath was ruled out for rest of the tournament, Tharindu Kaushal became only the second player ever to make his one-day international debut in a World Cup match as he took his place. Following Sri Lanka winning the toss, captain Angelo Matthews drew a likeness between the mystery spinner and Muttiah Muralitharan. But it was tough introduction to international cricket for the 19-year-old as Sri Lanka wilted under the pressure of a knockout game, a scenario South Africa are more than accustomed too. At a sun-bathed Sydney Cricket Ground, choosing to bat first seemed like it gave the 2011 World Cup finalists the edge but they collapsed to 4-2 after just four overs. Lahiru Thirimanne showed intent to reach 41 from 48 deliveries against a quality South African attack . Leg-spinner Imran Tahir  celebrates after taking a catch off his own bowling to dismiss Thirimanne . Kusal Perera, who had been pushed to the top of the batting order in an attempt to take the attack to the South African bowlers, fell to the increasingly impressive Kyle Abbott. De Kock took a sensational one-handed diving catch, at the second attempt, after Perera edged behind for just three. And fellow opener Tilakaratne Dilshan fell for a duck as he edged a sharp Dale Steyn delivery that was caught by Faf du Plessis at slip, despite the ball dying on him. Lahiru Thirimanna then joined Sangakkara as the pair looked to resurrect and rebuild Sri Lanka’s innings. Despite having four consecutive hundreds to his name coming into the match, Sangakkara looked more like a player terribly out of touch and searching for runs. Having taken 16 balls to score his first run, it took 42 to hit his first boundary as the South Africans pushed for further breakthroughs. At the other end, Thirimanne was batting far more fluently and despite his partner’s troubles, Sri Lanka were finding their way back into the quarter-final. However, the introduction of the South African spinners proved to be the turning point. Kumar Sangakkara, in his last ODI match for his country, attempts to hold the inning together as wickets fall . Also in his final World Cup match, Mahela Jayawardene fell cheaply to the South African spinner for four . Jayawardene trudges off the Sydney Cricket Ground after Faf du Plessis took the catch from Tahir's bowling . South African all-rounder JP Duminy celebrates as he takes the wicket of Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews . Kumar Sangakkara's incredible form continued as the Sri Lankan veteran got off to another top start . But after three successive hundreds at the World Cup, Morne Morkel ended his innings on 45 off 96 balls . The constantly excitable Tahir took a simple caught-and-bowled as Thirimanne threw away his wicket to bring Jayawardene to the crease. Despite being 69-3, with two Sri Lankan legends at the crease playing alongside each other in an ODI for the 150th time, there was a feeling that they could still post a competitive total. But having made just four off 16 balls, Jayawardene walked off the cricket field for the last time in his career as Tahir had him caught at short midwicket. And it was South Africa’s fifth bowler, Duminy, who caused the greatest damage as he became the eighth player in World Cup history to take a hat-trick. A poor shot from Matthews, after he looked set, as he tried to whip a flighted delivery from outside off through midwicket was the 30-year-old’s first scalp from the last ball of his eighth over. Nuwan Kulasekara walked after the thinnest of edges was caught by De Kock before debutant Kaushal tried to play around the ball and was trapped plumb in front. Quinton de Kock opens up his shoulders as the South Africa opener takes to the Sri Lankan bowling . The left-hander sweeps on his way to 78 runs from just 57 balls as the Proteas chase down 133 . De Kock, keen to hit his way back in to form, celebrates reaching a sublime half-century . With Sangakkara’s batting partners deserting him the left-hander attempted to open up but having made 45 he holed out to deep mid-wicket off Morne Morkel. As Sri Lanka’s leading run-scorer trudged off the SCG in his last one-day international for his country there was a sudden downpour, as if even those in heaven were crying tears of sadness. Even with South Africa’s dismal knockout record, failing to score 134 seemed even beyond them and when Hashim Amla hit the first ball of the innings for four the omens seemed to be good for them. Despite having a previous high score of just 26 thus far in the World Cup, De Kock played fluently, hitting 12 fours on the way to making 78 off 57-balls. At the close of the match, South African captain AB de Villiers asked for Jayawardene’s shirt, a sign that every player knew the magnitude of losing a great player. For South Africa they executed their game plan perfectly, ticking every single box possible to show the watching world that they are serious World Cup contenders.","Sri Lanka was bowled out cheaply for 133 from 37.2 overs .

"Pakistan's Cricket World Cup revival continued with a 29-run Duckworth/Lewis win in a close encounter against South Africa in Auckland on Saturday - a third successive victory which boosts their chances of reaching the quarter-finals. Pakistan batted first at Eden Park and, after their innings was twice interrupted by rain, they lost their last five wickets for 25 runs to slump to 222 all out with a top score of 56 from Misbah-ul-Haq from their 46 overs. In reply, a score of 77 from 58 balls by AB de Villiers steadied the ship but South Africa failed to meet their victory target as they were bowled out for 202 after Mohammad Irfan, Rahat Ali and Wahab Riaz claimed three wickets apiece. The Pakistan team celebrate their 29-run victory over South Africa at the Cricket World Cup in New Zealand . Pakistan captain Mibah Ul-Haq (left) and team-mate Shahid Afridi smile as they leave the field . Pakistan openers Ahmed Shehzad and Sarfraz Ahmed had made a collective 30 when Shehzad was dismissed thanks to an exquisite catch from Dale Steyn off Kyle Abbott's bowling in the ninth over. The fast bowler, fielding at mid on, had to back-pedal considerably but made up enough ground before diving and snaffling a two-handed catch a mere inches from the ground. The Eden Park crowd roared excitedly when Sarfraz clubbed JP Duminy for successive sixes early in 16th over before adding a third maximum with the final ball of the over. AB de Villiers gave South Africa some hope but they were unable to record the required total against Pakistan . Wahab Riaz (left) celebrates with Ahmad Shahzad after claiming the last wicket of Imran Tahir (right) Pakistan has reached to 90 for one at the start of the 17th over, but a moment of madness saw Sarfraz run out attempting a second run to depart one run short of his fifty. Skipper De Villiers brought himself into the attack and was celebrating in his third over when Younus, having looked extremely comfortable, tamely chipped to cover to depart for 37 in the 27th over. Sohaib Maqsood (eight) lasted just 15 balls before he clipped Abbott to point as Pakistan's innings stalled somewhat at 156 for four at the end of the 32nd over. Umar Akmal (13) was undone by the bounce of Morne Morkel, top-edging to mid-wicket, to restrict Pakistan for 175 for five before rain delayed play for half an hour or so. Pakistan bowler Muhammad Irfan (left) and Sohaib Maqsood celebrate their win against South Africa . Francois du Plessis of South Africa crashes into the wickets during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match . Misbah collected his 42nd ODI half-century when play resumed before the players were forced from the field once again as the showers returned. The second interruption did Pakistan no favours as they lost their last five wickets for just 25 runs, crumbling from 195 for five in the 41st over to 222 all out in their allotted 47 overs. Shahid Afridi edged Dale Steyn to deep-backward square-leg to depart for 22 in the 42nd over and, three balls later, they were seven down when Riaz was pinned leg before by Imran Tahir. Steyn removed Misbah in the next over for a team-high 56 and Ali and Sohail Khan fell shortly after as Pakistan collapsed spectacularly. Dale Steyn of South Africa celebrates the wicket of Misbah-ul-Haq of Pakistan with his team . Rilee Rossouw dives to his left but is unable to stop the ball from reaching the boundary . South Afrcia's innings was only two balls old when they lost Quinton de Kock, caught behind off Irfan, without scoring and they were two down in the 10th over when Ali tricked Faf du Plessis (27) into edging behind. Pakistan wicketkeeper Sarfraz picked up his and Pakistan's third dismissal in the very next over when Riaz forced Hashim Amla into a leading edge to depart for 38 from 27 deliveries. Riaz accounted for Rilee Rossouw (six) in the 13th over to leave South Africa four down with just 74 runs on the board and things went from bad to worse when they lost David Miller (nought) moments later. Pakistan bowler Rahat Ali (left) lifts his arms to the sky after taking the wicket of Du Plessis . Rossouw reacts after being dismissed by Riaz during the Pool B World Cup match in Auckland . De Villiers and Duminy (12) guided South Africa past the hundred-mark in the 20th over but the latter carelessly gave his wicket away when he tried to hook Wahab but succeeded only in top-edging to fine leg. Steyn lost his wicket for 16 as he became Irfan's third victim after scoring three fours from his 17 balls to leave his side needing 94 runs for victory. De Villiers celebrated his half-century after claiming his third maximum from 45 balls which also included four boundaries as he continued battling on with some big hits before Kyle Abbott (12) was caught by Younus at second slip off Ali as South Africa continued to collapse. Khan finally claimed the big wicket of De Villiers for 77 in the 33rd over after he was caught behind by Ahmed and Imran soon followed to leave his side with 202 and handing Pakistan a 29-run victory.","Pakistan recorded their third successive win, against South AfricaÂ .

"Scotland bowler Majid Haq has been sent home from the World Cup after breaching the team's internal code of conduct, Cricket Scotland have announced. No further explanation was given but Haq, who is Scotland's all-time leading wicket-taker, posted a race-related tweet after he was not selected for the 148-run defeat to Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Haq tweeted: 'Always tougher when you're in the minority! #colour #race', before later deleting the post. Scotland's Majid Haq has been sent home from the Cricket World Cup after posting a race-related tweet . Haq bowls during the Cricket World Cup match against Bangladesh in Nelson last Thursday . A Cricket Scotland statement read: 'Following a breach of Cricket Scotland's internal code of conduct, international team member, Majid Haq, is travelling home from the ICC World Cup. 'No further statement will be issued until internal processes have been completed in due course.' Haq, who was born in Scotland but is of Pakistani descent, has played more than 200 times for Scotland and taken 258 wickets. The 32-year-old has, however, only managed three wickets in four matches at the World Cup and was replaced against Sri Lanka by fellow off-spinner Michael Leask. Scotland have lost all five of their group matches so far, leaving the team one more chance to register a win when they face Australia in Hobart on Saturday.

"In a video recorded just before he attacked, the gunman who killed a Canadian soldier and then stormed Parliament said he did it because of Canada's military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. In a cellphone video, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau said his attack was 'in retaliation for Afghanistan and because [Prime Minister Stephen] Harper wants to send his troops to Iraq'. The 32-year-old Canadian made the video in his car just before last October's attack in Ottawa. Scroll down for video . In the video he made, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau said he opened fire in retaliation for Afghanistan and Iraq . Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, killed a man and opened fire on Parliament before he was gunned down himself in Ottawa . RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said he believes Zehaf-Bibeau (pictured both) was influenced by others . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police released the transcript from the video today. Police edited out the first 13 and last five seconds of the video for operational reasons. The edited sections were not included in the transcript. Releasing the entire video would have hurt the investigation, according to police. To those who are involved and listen to this movie, this is . in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper wants to send . his troops to Iraq. So we are retaliating, the Mujahedin of this world. Canada's officially become one of our enemies by fighting and . bombing us and creating a lot of terror in our countries and . killing us and killing our innocents. So, just aiming to hit . some soldiers just to show that you're not even safe in your own . land, and you gotta be careful. So, may Allah accept from us. It's a disgrace you guys have . forgotten God and have you let every indecency and things . running your land. We don't, we don't go for this. We are good . people, righteous people, believers of God and believing his law . and his Prophets, peace be upon them all. That's my message to . all of you in this, Inshallah, we'll not cease until you guys . decide to be a peaceful country and stay to your own and I-, and . stop going to other countries and stop occupying and killing the . righteous of us who are trying to bring back religious law in . our countries. Thank you. Victim: The 24-year-old Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was killed in the rampage . Zehaf-Bibeau's rampage began at Canada's war memorial, where he shot and killed Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. The gunman was later shot to death by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons just steps from where Canada's prime minister and members of Parliament were meeting . Prime Minister Harper called it a terror attack and the bloodshed raised fears Canada was suffering reprisals for joining the US-led air campaign against Islamic State extremists in Iraq. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said he believes Zehaf-Bibeau was influenced by others and that the investigation is ongoing. He said: 'I wouldn't characterize it as network as it is commonly understood but I am persuaded that he was influenced by other individuals toward these crimes so in that sense I am of the view that others were involved.' Paulson said anybody who aided Zehaf-Bibeau in the attack will be charged with terrorism offenses, according to the CBC. He said: 'It's not relevant to us, or our investigation, what kind of terrorist Zehaf-Bibeau was, or if he was a particularly intelligent, sophisticated, influential or personally disciplined terrorist. 'To us, it all turns on the evidence we collect which we compare against the statute. 'What was he doing and why was he doing it?' Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau was likely influenced by others . A photo released by the RCMP shows the .30-30 Winchester Model 94 rifle used by Zehaf-Bibeau in October . More than 130 full-time investigators and staff from the RCMP are working on the case. Other details from the investigation were also made public. Police revealed Zehaf-Bibeau used the internet and payphones to stay in contact with people in Ottawa and in British Columbia. Police have identified some of these individuals. The autopsy toxicology report showed Zehaf-Bibeau, who struggled with crack addiction, wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack. The evidence also 'does not speak to any mental health issues'. The gunman, who also held Libyan citizenship, became increasingly aligned with terrorist ideology in recent years while living in British Columbia and Alberta. Royal Canadian Mounted Police intervention teams responded to the shooting after gunfire was heard . Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a crack problem, wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack . Zehaf-Bibeau was involved with shootings at the War Memorial and at the Parliament. Police initially thought there was a shooting at the Rideau Centre mall, but have since said that was not the case . When Zehaf-Bibeau was killed in Parliament, he had a long knife tied to his wrist. He had toured the main Parliament building while posing as a tourist a couple of weeks before the attack. The attack in Ottawa came two days after a man described as an 'ISIL-inspired terrorist' ran over two soldiers in a parking lot in Quebec, killing one and injuring the other before being shot to death by police. The man had been under surveillance by Canadian authorities, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey. Unlike the attacker in the Quebec case, Zehaf-Bibeau was not being watched by authorities. In addition to the video, commissioner Paulson also revealed other details from the investigation today . 9.52am: Gunfire reported to emergency services at the National War Memorial. One reporter there said he saw a man shot and fall to the ground and another run. 9.54am: Gunfire breaks out in the Ottawa Parliament's Centre Block building . 9.56am: Multiple gunshots ring out inside the Parliament building and a reporter says he witnesses a body lying motionless on the ground outside the Library of Parliament. At the same time it is reported that a soldier has been shot at the War Memorial . 9.58am: Passersby witness CPR being urgently performed on the soldier as he lies stricken on the ground . 9.59am: A police source confirms that there is an 'active shooter' situation currently underway inside the Canadian Parliament. 10.00am: Heavily armed rapid response teams arrive at the Parliament Hill building . 10.04am: A number of witnesses at the War Memorial claim to see the soldiers assailant running towards Parliament Hill carrying a large rifle . 10.05am: Officers at the War Memorial shout 'there is a shooter on the loose' to the public and tell them to clear the area . 10.12am: Parliament Hill is put into official lockdown . 10.13am: Those who saw the shooter at the War Memorial say that he had dark hair, a dark complexion and a scarf on his head and was armed with a rifle. 10.18am: A grey Toyota Carolla is found with no front or back license plates.

"Captain of St Mirren at 17 the course of Tony Fitzpatrick’s life altered on a January morning in 1983. The day he lost his six-year-old son. His previous existence had been blinkered, revolving around the mainstays of family, football and faith. His family was shattered by the death of son Anthony following a two year battle with acute myeloid leukaemia. Somehow, the football and faith - subjected to anguished, grief stricken examinations in the months which followed - survived. “I have always believed in God"" reflects Fitzpatrick, sipping fizzy water in a coffee shop in Glasgow's west end. “But what happened to little Tony made me angry. I wondered how something like that could happen. Tony Fitzpatrick wants his book to serve as a legacy for the six-year-old son he lost to leukaemia . “It challenged my faith for a wee spell. It challenged how I felt. “There was anger, bitterness, every emotion you might associate with bereavement. “I just couldn’t understand why God had done it. Even to this day I still ask myself the question.” He sought refuge and answers in writing. Scribbled notes on his experiences and emotions became a habit. The outcome of his jottings is ‘The Promise, Together Again’, the 59-year-old’s first book. It features the adventures of Babakoochi Bear, the pet name he used for the son lost 32 years ago. The memories are undimmed by the passage of time. He remembers the awful weather most. Through the grey clouds and rain enveloping Glasgow’s Hospital for Sick Children he grasped for a silver lining. “I always remember my wife and I coming out to the car park after Tony died and there being most stunning rainbow I had ever seen. “Maybe I was looking for something. But the colours were so vibrant, it was stunning. To me it was a sign. A sign of.... something."" A committed, church goer he interpreted the rainbow as a token of hope. Some kind of message from above. Yet in the months which followed he examined his faith and found it wanting. Rationalising what kind of kind of God might take the life of an innocent six-year-old child proved impossible. An uneasy, restless peace descended slowly. “Listen, after a time faith became a great comfort again. You don’t know where it comes from. But when you are in despair your beliefs offer you peace and help when you need it most. “But was that challenged for a time? Yes. Yes, it was. They say time is a healer. You hear that all the time. And it probably is to some degree. “But when you lose a child you never ever get over it. “You learn to live with it. But that’s all. “Tony died in 1983. But every day he is with me in my life. “I feel him all the time in the room. “I can sit with my eyes closed in a quiet space and I don’t see him. But I take comfort from the fact I feel he is there. “It never gets any easier. There are times all these years on when I still break down for no reason.” Former St Mirren captain Fitzpatrick (right) in action for his club against Celtic . When religion was no comfort for his loss, professional football filled the void. Fitzpatrick was just 24 when his child’s illness was diagnosed and 26 when he died. In the course of two and a half years maturity was thrust upon his shoulders in brutal fashion. “I had been very, very selfish,” he reflects now. “What the illness of my son did was make me realise there were things in life more important than football. “For 90 minutes you would play and then as soon as the game was over it was ‘right, I have to get to the hospital.’ “Ach, I still played after he died. But something was missing.” His career, until then, had been on an upward trajectory. He started under Sir Alex Ferguson at Love Street, appointed skipper as a teenager, before a move to Bristol City, where Roy Hodgson was the manager . He returned to Paisley after two years, flirting with a Scotland cap and winning a Scottish Cup winners’ medal in 1987. Fitzpatrick managed St Mirren twice and remains a respected, likable figure in Scottish football. His 642 appearances for St Mirren make him a club icon, yet grief took a yard from his legs. “I always tried my best. I played in a good St Mirren team with guys like McAvennie, Frank McDougal and Peter Weir – really good players. “We had good teams, we were in Europe and we won a Scottish Cup. “But I had always had a deep desire to be the best player I could be. When Tony took ill it wasn’t the same. “I remember beating Celtic 3-1 and things were going great. It was looking good. And then ‘bang.’ “He had been unwell for a couple of weeks. One night he was really bad and I came down for training the next morning and saw he wasn’t right. “I went back to the doctor and told him Tony had purple spots. That’s when the alarm bells rung. “Within minutes of taking him in we were sent to Yorkhill Sick Kids’ hospital. “He had septicaemia, meningitis and then they found the leukaemia. His prospects were awful. “We spent all our time in Yorkhill. We slept there. “In the course of two and a half years we had Tony at home for no more than three months.” Tuesdays and Thursdays were spent donating blood to improve the quality of his son’s remaining days. With Elizabeth went on to have another boy and a set of twins before the couple went their separate ways. A product of the West of Scotland before counselling became the fashiom, however, Fitzpatrick found it difficult to express himself beyond the football pitch. He wasn't the only one. “I remember when little Tony died that neighbours and friends didn’t know what to say to us. “They would cross the road because they couldn’t deal with it. “I was very conscious of it and later they would explain they didn’t want to cry or break down. “My daughter was nine when it all happened and I regret that I couldn’t express my feelings to her either. “The little soul was left to cope because I couldn’t speak about it. “It occurred to me then that a book might be a way of breaking down the barrier.” Babakoochi Bear, the star of ‘The Promise, Together Again’, dedicates himself to pursuing peace on earth while adressing the themes of grief, loss and the rainbow which appeared over Yorkhill in January 83.. Fitzpatrick concedes that writing was also a form of catharsis. His way of finding some inner peace. “People feel their grief in different ways,” he admits. “I’m not educated in any way, but I started to jot down ideas about Babakoochi Bear and that developed. “I waited a long time – but this was the right time. I had a huge urge to do it.” An initial print run of 1000 books, with professional illustrations, cost money and when it sells out Fitzpatrick will use the funds to print more. Further stories of Babakoochi Bear’s travails bulge from notebooks in his Glasgow home and the Waterstones branch closest to Paisley have agreed to stock the book aimed at 7-11 year olds. “I did it for Tony,” explains Fitzpatrick. “Listen, he was a normal wee boy – he could be a wee nightmare at times like any child. “But he made a big impact on a lot of people in a short time. And more than anything I want this book to serve as his legacy.” ‘The Promise; Together Again’ by Tony Fitzpatrick is available from www.babakoochibear.com .","Tony Fitzpatrick lost his six-year-old son in 1983 after a leukaemia battle .

"Manuel Pellegrini's problems are mounting but he refused to concede the title despite suffering a hugely damaging defeat at Anfield. Coming so soon after losing 2-1 to Barcelona in the Champions League City needed a show of character against Liverpool but got the opposite, and the Manchester City manager admitted the performance was not good enough. The defeat leaves City five points behind Chelsea having played a game more, but Pellegrini saw City pull their dream of becoming champions out of the fire last season and he hopes history will repeat itself, even though time is running out. Manuel Pellegrini is refusing to accept defeat in the title race despite seeing Manchester City lose again . Pellegrini (left) looks on despondently as he shakes the hands of Brendan Rodgers (right) at full-time . ‘I think we never give up about the title,’ said Pellegrini. ‘We must try to improve our play first and after that try to win our next game. You never know in football what will happen. 'It is more difficult when you have less games and you continue with the same points. ‘But I don’t think the team can think about that. The team must think about how we can win the next game. 'There were a lot of problems. There were two goals from Liverpool, very good goals in the top corner. We missed three clear chances. It was a close game. ‘Liverpool played very well and they deserved to win. I am concerned about the whole team. We were playing very well against Stoke and Newcastle. Philippe Coutinho lets fly from range to score the winning goal for Liverpool against City . Hart is left helpless as Coutinho's effort rises above his outstretched hand and hits the back of the net . Liverpool were pegged back as Edin Dzeko finished off a delightful team passing move . 'We start this week against Barcelona and then (here), it was not our team, we cannot lose so many balls with the technical players we have. ‘That is more important to analyse than the performance of one player. It is more important to think as a team.’ If Pellegrini was disconsolate, Brendan Rodgers was exultant and he hailed Philippe Coutinho’s latest magical display as the Brazilian catapulted Liverpool firmly into the Champions League race. Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in the Barclays Premier League to an 11th game and Coutinho’s role in inspiring the win was crucial, not least when he scored a sublime 75th-minute goal. Coutinho’s influence on the team has grown in recent weeks, with three goals in his last seven appearances, and Rodgers feels the key to this consistency stems from him having peace of mind after signing a long-term contract last month. Liverpool boss Rodgers can't hide his joy at the final whistle as Liverpool edged out City . He had been spared the long trip to Istanbul for the Europa League tie against Besiktas in midweek and the benefits were obvious as his passing and movement tormented Pellegrini’s side. ‘It was a brilliant result and an equally brilliant performance,’ Rodgers enthused. What made Liverpool’s performance all the more meritorious, according to Rodgers, was that their preparations had been disrupted by the Europa League. They only returned to Merseyside at 4.30am on Friday yet finished the stronger side on Sunday. ‘It is a big win but we still have a lot of games to go,’ said Rodgers. ‘But it is a significant win for us, another three points. 'To prepare yourself for a game against the champions is no mean feat. You have to take your hat off to them, the performance was at a real top level.’","Manchester City lost 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday afternoon .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has made the stunning claim that his side would be better off in the Europa League next season, after repeatedly failing to make an impact in the Champions League. Tuesday night's 2-0 win in Monaco was not enough to prevent a last-16 exit as Arsenal lost out on away goals rule following their 3-1 first-leg defeat at the Emirates last month. And Wenger, who has been in the competition for 17 straight seasons, says that his side might even be better away from the top-tier competition in future given their recent trend of exiting almost as soon as the knockout stages have begun. Arsene Wenger had admitted that Arsenal might have a better chance of winning in the Europa League . Wenger's Arsenal side could only find two goals in Monaco on Tuesday, when they needed at least three . After repeated Champions League failure, Wenger has speculated about winning the Europa League in future . The third-placed team in each Champions League group - a fate that Wenger has never suffered - move into the Europa League rather than a total exit from Europe, and the Arsenal boss believes that might be a better silverware opportunity. When asked if these early exits were eating away at him, Wenger replied: 'Yes, but we were eliminated by teams who reached the final. Maybe it would be better not to pass the group phase and play the Europa League than to be eliminated in the last 16. We would have more chances to win a title.' When pressed for clarification, the Arsenal manager insisted this was meant to be a comment about the abrupt and unforgiving nature of the Champions League in its sudden-death phase rather than a serious realignment of ambitions. Olivier Giroud opened the scoring for the Gunners as they looked to fight back from their first-leg defeat . Giroud celebrates putting Arsenal in front at the Stade Louis II to give the away side a bit of hope early on . Aaron Ramsey added a second goal for the Gunners but they could not find a third to send them through . The Welsh midfielder was a substitute on the night but came on to help Arsenal in their late charge . Wenger has never won a European trophy but perhaps the Europa League would offer a better opportunity . The Arsenal boss also told L'Equipe that he thought his team's performance was good but that they left themselves too much to do after a poor showing in London last month. 'The performance was good, it was a difficult task,' Wenger said. 'They surprised us in the first game because subconsciously we were too sure of ourselves. 'In the second half, we lacked a bit of freshness. I am very disappointed to be knocked out, of course, but I will remember a lot of positives from this game.' Alexis Sanchez went down under the challenge of Nabil Dirar in the penalty area but was booked for diving . Wenger was unhappy with the performance of referee Svein Oddvar Moen (second right) during the game . Wenger made it clear he was unhappy with the performance of referee Svein Oddvar Moen during a first half where Arsenal could have won a penalty when Alexis Sanchez went down inside the area and the home side were allowed to commit multiple fouls with no bookings handed out. 'I think his (Moen's) first half was very poor,' Wenger said. 'I just told him at half-time that I was not happy with some decisions.' 2015 - beaten by Monaco, last 16 . 2014 - beaten by Bayern Munich, last 16 . 2013 - beaten by Bayern Munich, last 16 . 2012 - beaten by AC Milan, last 16 . 2011 - beaten by Barcelona, last 16 . 2010 - beaten by Barcelona, quarter-final . 2009 - beaten by Manchester United, semi-final . 2008 - beaten by Liverpool, quarter-final . 2007 - beaten by PSV Eindhoven, last 16 . 2006 - beaten by Barcelona, final . 2005 - beaten by Bayern Munich, last 16 . 2004 - beaten by Chelsea, quarter-final . 2003 - Knocked out, second group stage . 2002 - Knocked out, second group stage . 2001 - beaten by Valencia, quarter-final . 2000 - Knocked out, first group stage . 1999 - Knocked out, first group stage .

"England fans should hide behind the sofa rather than watch the Ashes this summer, says Mark Butcher. After a humiliating World Cup exit, England face a Test series in the West Indies, followed by series at home to New Zealand and Australia. Speaking to Radio 5 Live, the former England opener warned fans to expect an ‘absolute hiding’ and a ‘horrendous six months’. Butcher, who played in 71 Tests for England and scored eight centuries, added: ‘When Australia come, just don’t watch, hide behind the sofa.’ England's under siege captain and coach Eoin Morgan (left) and Peter Moores speak at the SCG . Former England opener Mark Butcher (right) has predicted the worst for the national team in the near future . Here England are preparing for a dead rubber against Afghanistan, with Peter Moores’ men having far more to lose than just a meaningless group match. The indications are that Moores will keep his job, at least for the Test series in the Caribbean, whatever happens at the Sydney Cricket Ground tomorrow, but the last thing he needs is another desperate defeat by minnows. The fact England turned up early yesterday for what used to be known as naughty-boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their need to take something from their worst-ever World Cup. Victory against Afghanistan would perhaps give Moores breathing space before the squad is announced on Tuesday for the three-Test series in the West Indies next month. England will be without Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two players who can still expect a one-day future, and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to St Kitts on April 2. Moores attempts to rally his troops on the SCG on Wednesday ahead of their match against Afghanistan . Moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the defeat by Bangladesh while Woakes has a ‘stress reaction’ in his left foot. It is to be hoped England give games to the two players yet to appear in this World Cup: James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara, who could then be making their final ODI appearances. After the World Cup England must start from scratch with a one-day squad who will be at or near their peak in 2019. That means there is little point in persevering in 50-over cricket beyond tomorrow with the likes of Tredwell, Bopara, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad or Jimmy Anderson, who said on Wednesday he wants to play on. His is not a view shared by former England wicketkeeper Matt Prior. Young England quick Chris Jordan works up a sweat during a tough day of training in the Sydney sunshine . In his Evening Standard column Prior wrote: ‘Men like Ian Bell, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad... remain key members of the Test side, so perhaps it is time for them to concentrate solely on that form of the game, especially with an Ashes summer approaching.’ There is a familiar figure at the helm of the Afghan team in coach Andy Moles, the former Warwickshire batsman. He would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland and said: ‘We still believe we’ve got a scare in us in this World Cup, especially if we show composure at the top of the order. If we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock.’","Former England opener Mark Butcher told fans not to watch the Ashes .

"Scotland newcomer Matt Ritchie has revealed he thought he was the victim of a prank when Gordon Strachan first rang him about a call-up. The Bournemouth winger was the surprise name in the 26-man pool announced on Monday for the forthcoming friendly against Northern Ireland and Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar. Ritchie was born in the Hampshire town of Gosport but qualifies for Scotland through his father Alex. Matt Ritchie, pictured celebrating against Derby County last month, has been named in the Scotland squad . Ritchie, who has scored 11 goals for Bournemouth this season, thought he was the victim of a prank call . The 25-year-old admits he has never actually been north of the border but – once he had recovered from his initial shock - convinced Strachan he was passionate about wearing a dark blue jersey. ‘I had a call a couple of weeks ago from the manager,’ said Ritchie. ‘That was a massive surprise and at first I thought it was a prank call. ‘I’m absolutely delighted to be involved and it’s a proud moment for me and my family. ‘To be involved with a national football team is a great achievement and a dream come true as a young footballer.’ Ritchie – who has scored 11 goals for the Championship leaders this season - also explained the background that made him eligible to be Strachan’s latest recruit. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe recently handed Ritchie (centre) a new three-year contract . Scotland manager Gordon Strachan, pictured on Monday, rates Ritchie highly . ‘My dad was born in Edinburgh and so were my grandparents,’ he said. ‘My granddad was in the Royal Navy and they moved to England after he had been posted to Portsmouth, which is where I grew up. ‘I’ve still got relatives in Scotland but my aunties and uncles always seem to come down here to see my nan and granddad so I haven’t actually been to Scotland. But I’ve got family there and I’m sure they will come to the games if I’m involved. ‘My dad is over the moon. Hopefully he’ll be able to come to the games and watch me if I’m involved.’ Ritchie revealed his dad is 'over the moon' Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe recently handed Ritchie a new three-year contract and believes his record in terms of both goals and assists make him a genuine international contender. ‘We were aware that Gordon (Strachan) rates Matt highly,’ said Howe. ‘I’m really pleased for him because he has been consistent for us for a long time now. ‘There are only a few goal scorers and goal creators around and I think he deserves his call-up. It’s a good moment for him.’ Recent Celtic recruits Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven were notable omissions from Strachan’s squad, with both having impressed since their January moves from Dundee United. The Scotland boss, though, seemed to suggest the pair were simply carrying on at the same level they had been performing at while at Tannadice, asking: ‘Have they kicked on? Or are they the same players they were five or six months ago?’ But Celtic assistant manager John Collins admitted he thought they had done enough to earn a place in the squad, saying: ‘I have got to be honest, I am surprised that they were not called up. ‘They have done very well for us but the their time will come. They are young players and I have no doubt they will get themselves into Scotland squads of the future. ‘In the six or seven weeks they have been here, their performances out on the pitch and in training have been excellent. ‘They have lots of talent and are only going to get better with age. ‘Gordon has got lots of good players to pick from and it’s a tough job. But their time will come.’","Matt Ritchie was named in Scotland's 26-man squad announced on Monday .

"Liverpool may be forced to play on their deteriorating pitch for another season because of Anfield's redevelopment. Manager Brendan Rodgers has frequently bemoaned the state of the iconic playing surface which is struggling to withstand the wear and tear of the season. Opposition players have also complained. Rodgers has called the surface 'awful' and this week said: 'We need to do something about the pitch because we need a better pitch if we are going to play the game we are playing.' The Anfield playing surface was given a ten-year lifespan but is now 14 years old . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes a new playing surface would hugely help his side out . There is no sprinkler system with a hose to water the pitch before matches at Anfield . Liverpool's owners acknowledge the problem but cranes are scheduled to be on the pitch during June as contractors step up work on the new £100million main stand to add 8,500 extra seats to Anfield’s capacity. The current pitch is a Desso GrassMaster but it was given a ten-year lifespan and is now 14 years old. Groundstaff have been forced to to patch it up each season. The drainage and irrigation system dates back even further to 1998. There is no sprinkler system with a hose used to water the pitch before matches. Anfield's redevelopment work could mean that the pitch cannot be replaced anytime soon . Even if Liverpool were able to put in new drainage prior to the cranes moving in there are fears the weight of the machinery could potentially burst the piping. Consequently, Liverpool may have to continue playing on the same surface in 2015/16 before it can be ripped up and replaced when the stand is completed in the summer of 2016.","Brendan Rodgers has regularly criticised the state of the Anfield pitch .

"Few people expect Manchester City to go to Barcelona and overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first leg and reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League. But here's 10 good reasons Manuel Pellegrini's men should travel in hope... 1 - CHELSEA PROVED MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN . Chelsea were 2-1 down on aggregate to Barcelona and down to only 10 men in their second leg at the Nou Camp in 2012 – and still went through. Goals from Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta put Barca in control even before John Terry was sent off. Then, incredibly, Ramires scored on the stroke of half-time and after surviving immense pressure, Fernando Torres scored to book Chelsea's place in the final, which they went on to win. Chelsea sealed a place in the 2012 Champions League final by drawing 2-2 with Barcelona at the Nou Camp . 2 - PELLEGRINI CAN TAP INTO MALAGA . Barcelona lost their last game at the Nou Camp on February 21 to Malaga, the team that Manuel Pellegrini managed between 2010 and 2013. Pellegrini will be able to get all the inside info on how they did it and also used to work with the winning goalscorer, Juanmi. If Juanmi can slay Barcelona, there's not reason why Sergio Aguero can't follow suit. 3 - NO REASON TO FEAR . City captain Vincent Kompany knows what it feels like to score at the Nou Camp, Joe Hart saved a penalty from Lionel Messi three weeks ago and Yaya Toure won the Champions League with Barca alongside the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique. While the rest of the world regard Barca's players as demi-gods, City have been up against them before and shown they are human, or played with them. Joe Hart saved a late Lionel Messi penalty to keep his side in with a chance of progressing to the next round . 4 - EL CLASICO AWAITS . Coach Luis Enrique won't be thanking La Liga for the way they've worked out their fixture list because an even bigger match lies in store on Sunday when Barca meet Real Madrid in a potential title decider. The temptation not to play at 100 per cent against City will be there particularly as they already hold a 2-1 advantage from the first leg. It will be up to Pellegrini's side to take advantage if the Barca players have half an eye on the weekend. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique will have one eye on his side's upcoming match against Real Madrid . 5 - CITY BEST IN ADVERSITY . If there is one thing Manchester City have proved in recent times it's that they should never be written off. They were eight points behind Manchester United with six games to play in 2012 – and won the title. In 2014, they were three points behind Liverpool with three to play, and again came out on top. Most significantly, they have shown 'bouncebackability' in Europe too. They qualified from the group stages despite taking two points from their opening four matches and trailing 2-1 against Bayern Munich in their fifth match. Manchester City showed on the final day of the 2011-12 season that they are capable of springing a surprise . 6 - PROLIFIC AGUERO . Aguero has scored six goals in six Champions League ties this season, at a ratio of a goal every 76 minutes. If he scores again in the Nou Camp, City will be halfway there to overturning the first-leg deficit. Pellegrini believes Aguero has the ability to be considered the third-best player in the world behind Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. A match-winning performance to rank alongside his hat-trick against Bayern earlier in the tournament would go a long way to making that come true. City forward Aguero (he's at the bottom) has scored six goals in the Champions League this season . 7 - HISTORY ON THE SIDE OF ENGLISH CLUBS . It's not impossible for English clubs not to be represented in the last eight of the Champions League – but history shows it's very rare. Only once since 1996 have the quarter-finals taken place without a Premier League team. With Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal gone, all hopes rest on City now. They haven't always been the most popular team since Sheik Mansour's takeover but the club might thrive on the need to restore some national pride. Manchester City are England's last hope following Arsenal's exit from the Champions League on Tuesday . 8 - ALL ROADS LEAD TO ROME . Manuel Pellegrini has been criticised for rigidly sticking to 4-4-2 in Europe and being outplayed in midfield, as he was against Barca in the first leg. But when Aguero was injured for the critical final group game away to Roma, he played Edin Dzeko as a lone striker and City comfortably won 2-0. If Pellegrini repeats the tactics – but with Aguero replacing Dzeko – and City crowd Barca in the middle of the park, there's no reason they shouldn't threaten the Catalans with the talent they've got in the team like David Silva. Spanish playmaker David Silva (centre) may be given the licence to roam if he plays behind Aguero . 9 - MANAGERIAL MIS-MATCH . Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is a Champions League novice as a manager – this is his first campaign in the tournament and he's never experienced a knockout second leg. In contrast Pellegrini has guided Villarreal to the semi-final, Malaga to the quarters and took City the Nou Camp last season where they lost 2-1 with 10 men. The Chilean knows what to expect – Enrique doesn't. Enrique is a novice when it comes to managing a side in the Champions League knockout stages . VIDEO Barca will attack - Enrique . 10 - YAYA MOTIVATION . Yaya Toure is available for Manchester City are serving a three-match European ban and couldn't be more motivated. For all the stealth of Barcelona's midfield with Ivan Rakitic, Busquets and Andres Iniesta, they haven't got the power to live with Toure if he is allowed to run at them. The Ivory Coast international has proved he's a big-match player – remember his incredible goal at Wembley in last season's Capital One Cup final – and this could be his defining match in a City shirt. Yaya Toure is available for selection after missing the first leg against his former side through suspension . PS here's three reasons why Manchester City should be fearful of Barcelona .","Manchester City face Barcelona at the Nou Camp in Champions League .

"Ben Stokes has been recalled by England on Wednesday in a Test squad for the Caribbean which also includes six Yorkshiremen. England have  named a 16-man party for the three-Test series next month that  includes the Durham all-rounder who was left out of the disastrous World Cup campaign. Stokes emerged as the most exciting young talent in the English game when he scored a maiden Test century in the third Ashes Test in Perth but then endured a miserable year after breaking his wrist when punching a locker in frustration after being dismissed in Barbados.

The World Cup winner left Stamford Bridge for Wolfsburg in a £22million deal in January, having previously starred for Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen in the German league.

Andre Schurrle is introduced to ice hockey by girlfriend Montana York at a Grizzly Adams match . Speaking to Bild, Schurrle suggested his poor form was a repercussion of his time spent at Stamford Bridge under Jose Mourinho. 'I'm still missing the last per cent,' he said. 'At top English clubs during the season the players are hardly loaded with any training, since it's almost all about regeneration and tactics. 'In England you can get your fitness through the season with the games. At Chelsea because we had the championship, Champions League and the different club competitions, we played every three days.' The German forward has made an unimpressive return to the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg . Schurrle has suggested that a lack of training under Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge is to blame . The 24-year-old left the Blues for rising Bundesliga team Wolfsburg for £22million in January . 'In England there is no winter break. In the summer I had after the World Cup just two weeks of preparation. In January I had in the two weeks of the change almost no training because of back problems.' Former Chelsea midfielder and Wolfsburg team-mate Kevin de Bruyne empathises with the German forward after suffering his own struggling start before impressing with 14 goals this term. 'I know it is hard for him, it was no different for me so I am not worried,'  De Bruyne told Wolfsburger Nachrichten. However, Mohamed Salah has taken no time to settle at Fiorentina after joining the Italians on loan from Chelsea in February, scoring six goals in eight games for his new club. Meanwhile, Schurrle's girlfriend Montana York appears to be taking her beau's mind off things by introducing him to ice hockey at a recent Wolfsburg Grizzly Adams game. The pair shared pictures wearing the team's colours on their Instagram accounts, with York commenting: 'finally a sport where I can teach him all the rules and terms'.

"Kevin Pietersen would 'love' to return to county cricket and the England set-up - and has hinted he could change his Indian Premier League commitments to make it happen. Former England captain Michael Vaughan has challenged him to turn his back on that contract to prove his desire to play for England again and Pietersen's comments on the BBC's Test Match Special on Wednesday suggest he is considering that option. 'I have expressed my interest in trying to get back into the fold, it's something I want to do,' he said. 'There's a few things that need tinkering with, but I do want to make the right decision.' Kevin Pietersen has hinted he could change his IPL contract in a bid to push for an England place . After playing for the Big Bash League's Melbourne Stars, Pietersen's signed with the Sunrisers Hyderabad . 'I've got to explore the options, I would have loved to have had it done sooner. I don't know how it's going to happen; I just have to wait and see. 'I'm in no rush because I really want to make the runs. I would love to get county runs. 'If I can do anything that can help me get back into it for England then it's something I want to do. I love playing for England.' Pietersen's return to county cricket appears to be more imminent than he suggests though after Kumar Sangakkara revealed he is expecting to play alongside him at Surrey this summer. Kumar Sangakkara appeared to confirm Pietersen's return to Surrey this season after Sri Lanka bowed out of the World Cup in a convincing defeat by South Africa . No deal has yet been confirmed, but after his Sri Lanka side bowed out of the World Cup with defeat by South Africa, Sangakkara appeared to let the cat out of the bag when he told Sky Sports World Cup: 'I'm looking forward to playing at Surrey and working with (coach) Graham Ford, and KP's coming back I hear so that'll be very exciting in the dressing room.' Pietersen has not played for England since the Ashes tour of 2013/14, after which he was sacked and labelled 'disengaged' by England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton. Pietersen has not played for England since the Ashes tour of 2013/14 after which he was dropped . His controversial autobiography set him further on a collision course with many in the dressing room but incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves appeared to open the door to a recall in a recent interview. Graves told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme on March 1 that 'the first thing he has to do if he wants to get back is start playing county cricket', adding that the decision is 'down to the selectors and I will support their decisions'. Pietersen has since been linked with several counties, among them Leicestershire and his most recent employers Surrey. He has signed with Sunrisers Hyderabad for this year's IPL, which would significantly affect his availability for the start of the English domestic season. South African-born Pietersen, 34, has played 104 Tests for his adopted country and scored 8,181 runs, adding another 5,616 in 173 limited-overs appearances.","Kevin Pietersen was talking as a pundit on BBC's Test Match Special .

"Aston Villa face a major FA inquiry, a substantial fine and the threat of a ground closure after West Bromwich Albion players appeared to be assaulted as the FA Cup quarter-final at Villa Park descended into chaos with an unrestrained pitch invasion joined by thousands of Villa fans. In alarming scenes, which were a throwback to the football hooliganism of the Seventies and Eighties, West Brom players were left defenceless as fans rushed on to the pitch. Scorer Fabian Delph claimed he was bitten, while Boaz Myhill, Craig Dawson and Callum McManaman all appeared to be barged aggressively, and the latter seemingly struck on the back of the head by one fan as Dawson attempted to shepherd him off. VIDEO Scroll down to see the moment a match official ran for his life during pitch invasion . Aston Villa supporters stormed the pitch following the club's FA Cup victory over West Brom on Saturday . Police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after Aston Villa booked their place in the semi-finals . The Midlands club could face an FA probe after hundreds of fans stormed the Villa Park pitch . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . The West Brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way off the field following the full-time whistle . In a comprehensive breakdown of crowd control, Villa fans had even invaded the pitch in injury time with their team leading 2-0, with referee Anthony Taylor having to stop the game and West Brom forced to play the final minutes with fans spilling on to the pitch and gathered on the touchline. On the final whistle, thousands of fans came on and even Villa players were threatened by the melee. Villa captain Delph, who scored the first goal in the 2-0 win, said: 'It was very, very scary. My armband got nicked, some got my boot but I could appreciate the relief the fans are feeling after a result like that. People tried to kiss me, and were biting me. It was dangerous.' Villa seemed to exacerbate the problem by playing the celebratory song 'Que Sera Sera' over the PA while fans were still streaming on to the pitch, and put a video of fans celebrating on the pitch on their official Twitter feed. Meagre numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play . A club statement read: 'The club does not condone supporters invading the field of play under any circumstances. 'We are very disappointed that what should have been a very memorable and proud moment for our fans was marred by the actions of those who could not control themselves. 'They have let both themselves and their club down. 'The club extends its sincere apologies to the Football Association, the West Bromwich Albion directors, manager Tony Pulis and all his staff and players.' West Brom manager Tony Pulis said: 'It's disgraceful. We don't want to see those scenes. They've beaten us and for that to happen, that's just mindless idiots. If you're Villa, you need to look at the stewards as they came over to our fans and there was nobody there. 'Aston Villa should look at the stewarding. It's a quarter-final, it's a full house and you know it's going to be tasty. So you should have stewards both ends of the pitch. 'Supporters were coming on with a few minutes to go. They were congregating at the ends anyway a few minutes from time, so it puts player at danger and you don't want to see that. We were seeing that in the Seventies and Eighties and we don't want to see that. 'I'm sure the FA will look at it without be poking my nose into it. If you ask me from a football point of view, if you had a load of stewards then it would be sorted out. Most of the grounds in the Premier League are well stewarded. I'm sure Villa are disappointed this has happened.' Scorer Scott Sinclair (second left) is mobbed by a fan and team-mates Ashley Westwood and Jack Grealish . Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood admitted he could understand the fans' emotions after the victory . Asked whether any West Brom players had been assaulted, Pulis said: 'I don't know. I didn't ask them. Everyone looked as though they had their heads and arms on. They looked OK to me. They got in, intact. It's happened. I'm more concerned with trying to stop it before it happens.' West Midlands Police confirmed on Sunday that they had arrested 17 men for various public order offences, including one on suspicion of assaulting an officer, and authorities are also investigating an incident in a nearby pub before the game. A police statement read: 'We carried out a large policing operation for the FA Cup yesterday evening (March 7) to ensure supporters could enjoy the game in a safe environment. 'During the course of the operation 17 men were arrested for various public order offences. An investigation has been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the Witton Arms pub. 'Anyone who saw what happened should contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. 'We will also be supporting the Football Association to identify people involved in pitch invasions that happened at the end of the match.' The FA, who are believed to have had a 'crowd control advisor' present, will begin investigations tomorrow, asking Villa for their observations and their plans for stewarding. West Midlands Police will also submit evidence and the report of referee Taylor will be taken into consideration. Though Villa had a significant presence of stewards by the West Brom fans, there were far fewer by the Holte End where the Villa fans sit and they were quickly overcome by the scale on the invasion. West Brom boss Tony Pulis believes Aston Villa need to look at their stewarding following Saturday's incidents . Fans sing and chant on the pitch following Aston Villa's win during what has been a disappointing season . The FA can impose a range of sanctions from ground closure to fines, if the club have been considered negligent. There is no prospect of Villa being thrown out of the tournament but any ground closure or reduction in capacity could affect the team in their fight against relegation. The most likely outcome would seem to be a fine in the region of £100,000. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood said: 'I didn't know West Brom players had been hit. I can understand the emotions of the fan beating their local rivals twice in a week but you can't condone fans coming on the pitch. We don't condone it, especially if anyone was touched. 'What can you do? The stewards did their best. I saw them rugby tackling a few guys. But when they're coming in such numbers it's difficult to stem it. 'It has been a good week. I'd rather talk about the football. The players want to dedicate the victory to the fans because they've had some hard times here. And we're going to need those fans. It's been a very good week but here's stil a lot of hard work and we need those fans every step of the way.' Mark Lawrenson, who was co-commentator for BBC1's coverage added: 'It's like a scene from the 1980s all over again. Absolutely ridiculous.' West Brom fans also acted irresponsibly, ripping out several seats in the away section and launching them onto the Villa fans below when Scott Sinclair scored the second goal.

"A desperate woman tried to smuggle her baby past airport security in Papua New Guinea in a backpack, as she did not correct immigration papers for her son to leave the Philippines.

"Manchester City will ramp up their interest in Kevin de Bruyne when director of football Txiki Begiristain watches Wolfsburg's Europa League match with Inter Milan on Thursday night. The Barclays Premier League champions have long been interested in the 23-year-old Belgian playmaker, who joined the Bundesliga side from Chelsea in January 2014, and Wolfsburg are braced for an offer. De Bruyne is enjoying an excellent season, scoring 14 goals and contributing 23 assists across all competitions and Wolfsburg understandably want him to commit until 2020. Manchester City have stepped up their interest in Wolfsburg's £35m-rated Kevin de Bruyne . The Belgian has been in excellent form in his first full Bundesliga season since joining from Chelsea . Jose Mourinho deemed De Bruyne surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge last year . But City are impressed and could be willing to pay up to £35m to bring him back to the Premier League. French champions Paris Saint-Germain would also like to sign him. Meanwhile, the former Nottingham Forest, PSV Eindhoven and Holland goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen believes De Bruyne has matured into the 'most complete midfielder in the world.' Van Breukelen, who serves on the PSV board, believes De Bruyne is better than their own star Memphis Depay. He said: 'Everyone in the Netherlands adores Memphis Depay but then I calm them by saying that Kevin De Bruyne is doubly good. He is not the perfect No 10, nor the ideal winger, but I think De Bruyne currently is the most complete midfielder in the world.

'Even among the three best clubs in the world at the moment - Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - he would be a starter. Why not? Tackling, scoring, passing, running, fighting, he can do it all and he does it all with much flair. 'It is said that you do not win the Champions League with 11 Messis.

"Christian Benteke is out of Aston Villa's FA Cup clash with local rivals West Bromwich Albion after sustaining a minor hip injury in training. The Belgian striker scored a nerveless stoppage-time penalty to inflict defeat on West Brom in the Premier League on Tuesday and Tim Sherwood hoped he would carry the momentum into the repeat tie at Villa Park. But he picked up a knock before Saturday and is missing from the Villa squad entirely, with Scott Sinclair coming in as a replacement. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke will miss the FA Cup quarter-final clash with rivals West Brom . Benteke has been removed from Villa's match-day squad entirely due to a minor hip injury . Writing in the match day programme, Sherwood said: 'It's unusual to play the same team twice in the space of a few says, never mind your local rivals, but having won the first one we remain just as determined to win this one. 'We know it will be a difficult game but with a sell-out crowd behind us we are hoping to win the game and make sure we are in the hat for the next round.'

"Tim Sherwood has called on Gabriel Agbonlahor to repeat his derby heroics and insisted he is crucial to Aston Villa's survival bid. The forward scored just his fourth goal of the season in Villa's 2-1 win over West Brom on Tuesday, which lifted them out of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone.

Gabby Agbonlahor salutes the Villa Park crowd in celebration after opening the scoring against West Brom . Agbonlahor threads the ball through Ben Foster's legs to give the hosts the lead in the Midlands derby . Agbonlahor has been criticised for inconsistent performances in recent years but Sherwood believes he can now be Villa's trump card. He said: 'It's about this time when Gabby normally comes out and starts keeping this team in the league. 'I had a lot of chats with him, a lot of chats with Christian and every player. The strike partnership outside the top six, they've got to be the best two. 'But on paper doesn't make any difference, you have to go and prove it and go and do it. 'It shouldn't be ignored and I think it was appreciated by the fans the other night, they were singing his name, you can't imagine how much players grow from that. I've managed one of the hottest strikers in English football at the moment, Harry Kane, he had to win over those Tottenham fans.' Tim Sherwood said that Agbonlahor would be key to Aston Villa's Premier League survival . The Villa manager said he thought his strikers were the bets outside of the Premier League's top four . Sherwood wants to tap into Agbonlahor, Villa's record Premier League goalscorer with 70, and admitted he made special plans to combat the 28-year-old while Tottenham boss last season. 'Absolutely,' he said, when asked whether he identified Agbonlahor as key to Villa. 'Every game I've told him to play on the shoulder and look to get in behind, because once he gets in behind you he's very quick and hard to stop. 'He's had a lot of games now, a lot of experience, and I'm saying: 'Just go out there and play where you think you can hurt them, you take up positions'. Agbonlahor beat Foster for a second time but Joleon Lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line . Agbonlahor reacts after Foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line in their recent match . 'I brought Sandro back into the team (last season) to sit in that pivot, everyone else went forward. We had three defenders to look after the counter-threat of Agbonlahor.' Sherwood is without the suspended Alan Hutton but could welcome back Ron Vlaar after a calf problem, with the skipper being assessed. Aly Cissokho, Kieran Richardson and Nathan Baker are out but Sherwood will take a repeat of Tuesday's drama against the Baggies. He added: 'If I knew the outcome of the script, I would have taken that, win 2-1, local derby, 94th minute, two strikers scoring, blooding a young kid (Jack Grealish) for 35 minutes - the longest he's played on the pitch - I don't think I could have dreamt it up.'","Gabby Agbonlahor scored in Aston Villa's 2-1 win against West Brom .

"Manchester City go into Wednesday night's Champions League game against Barcelona knowing that only a win - and a win in which they score twice - will be enough to secure progress. It might therefore worry them to know that beating Barcelona is something that their manager, Manuel Pellegrini, has failed to manage since 2008. Pellegrini has now managed three clubs without any successes against Barca, losing all of his games so far as manager of City to match his record at Real Madrid, and managing just a single draw when in charge of Malaga. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has lost 12 of his last 13 games against Barcelona . The last time Pellegrini beat Barcelona, in 2008, Yaya Toure was playing for the Spanish club . In fact, you have to go back to March 2008, more than eight years ago, to find Pellegrini's last win over Barcelona, on a day that his star man Yaya Toure was lining up for the Nou Camp outfit. As Villarreal boss Pellegrini did manage four wins against Barca, while drawing three times and losing the remaining five of his twelve games. However, only the last of those wins came away from home, and none of them in the Champions League, while his career record against Barcelona sees him triumph only 16 per cent of the time. City know they need to produce something special to progress - if they do beat Luis Enrique's team by the required margin, it will not just be a remarkable achievement for the club, but also for their manager.

"A dentist investigating a schoolgirl with swollen gums was horrified to discover more than a dozen maggots living inside her mouth. Ana Cardoso, 10, had been taken to the clinic in Brazil after complaining of a tingling sensation in her gums and things 'moving around'. Her stunned mother Adriana, 35, said: 'She had been saying for a few days that she felt something moving around in her mouth and at first I thought she was joking. 'I couldn't see anything and she didn't seem to be in pain. Ana Cardoso, 10, had been taken to the clinic in Brazil after complaining of a tingling sensation in her gums and things 'moving around' 'But then it started getting worse and no matter how much we brushed her teeth she said she still felt something. 'I know my daughter and she is not one to make up stories or lie, so eventually I took her to see a dentist.' There, Ana, from the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, was diagnosed with a rare form of oral myiasis. This is a fly lava maggot infection that grows in humans and animals. 'I couldn't believe it when they said she had a disease and then started pulling the maggots out,' said Ms Cardoso. 'I thought I was going to be sick.' A spokesman for the dental surgery said: 'There were 15 maggots in her mouth so we videoed the removal for our records as it is a rare occurrence. 'We also wanted to show the girl's family what had happened and warn others.' The video shows Ana's reaction as a surgeon in white gloves takes out one maggot at a time with a pair of tweezers. Ms Cardoso said: 'She was actually very calm throughout the whole process but I suspect that was more out of helplessness. 'I mean, what else could she do?' Myiasis comes from the Latin word 'myia' meaning fly and 'iasis' means disease. The flies' larvae can feed on the host's living or dead tissue, liquid body substance, or ingested food. When the tissues in the oral cavity are invaded by parasites, this is known as oral myiasis. Those at risk of the rare condition include those from poorer social backgrounds and people who have suffered wounds or other injury to the face. It is also more common in regions with a warmer climate. Infestations of the nose and ears are dangerous because of the possibility of penetration into the brain, the fatality rate is 8 per cent in such cases.","Ana Cardoso, 10, had been taken to the clinic in Brazil's capital, Brasilia .

"Manchester City's prospects of success in the Champions League next season could be damaged after crashing out of the competition at the last-16 stage in Barcelona. City are borderline whether they are placed in either the second or third group of seeds for the 2015-16 group stages and risk a potential draw with Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, or Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid, if they don't improve their UEFA coefficient and drop into pot three. Pellegrini's men - who lost 1-0 in the Nou Camp on Wednesday and 3-1 overall on aggregate - are currently ranked the 16th best team in Europe but that could fall after they failed to make this season's quarter-finals. A Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona edged out City with a 1-0 win in the Nou Camp to end their Euro dream . Manchester City could drop down into pot three after crashing out of the Champions League . Vincent Kompany and his Manchester City team-mates could not overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit . Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Atletico Madrid, Benfica, Schalke, Arsenal, Porto, Manchester United, Paris St Germain, Borussia Dortmund, Valencia, Zenit St Petersburg, Bayer Leverkusen and Manchester City . *Liverpool are only ranked 40th so are guaranteed a tough draw if they finish in the top four. Coefficients are based on European performances over the last five seasons which is why Manchester United are placed higher than City despite not qualifying last season. Arsenal's ranking also remains high because they have reached the Champions League knockout stages every year in the time span. City have complained in the past of unfavourable draws in the Champions League group stages hampering their progress. Despite more than £1billion invested into the club since 2008, the Abu Dhabi owners have not seen their side progress beyond the first knockout stage of the competition. They failed to qualify from a tough group in 2011-12 after being paired with Napoli, Bayern Munich and Villarreal and suffered the same fate the following season against Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax. Their co-efficient has risen since and they were able to finish second in their group this season after being placed among the second seeds and being drawn against Bayern Munich, CSKA Moscow and Roma. However, UEFA have changed their seeding policy for next season and the domestic champions of England, Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Portugal and Russia will automatically be top seeds alongside the winners of this year's competition. Man United will be placed in pot two if they finish inside the top four despite last season's poor campaign . Chelsea are ranked the fourth best side in Europe - behind Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich . The second pot will be made up of the next eight highest-ranked clubs – and City can't be certain of that. Among the clubs just below them in the listings are Juventus who look certain to be top seeds as Italian champions and Sevilla, Inter Milan and Napoli who are all still in the Europa League and can improve their coefficient in that competition. There are still a lot of twists and turns in the domestic leagues before next season's seedings are announced and of course City still have to confirm their own participation by finishing in the top four of the Premier League. But there is no doubt the outcome in the Nou Camp, where they have to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit, could have an effect on City. This is how next season's Champions League group seedings would look if the season ended during the current stage of the campaign: . Top seeds: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Lyon, Benfica, Zenit St Petersburg and Juventus . Second pot: Atletico Madrid (ranked 5th), Arsenal (8th), Porto (9th), Manchester United (10th), Paris St Germain (11th), Valencia (13th), Bayer Leverkusen (15th) and Manchester City (16th) City are particularly vulnerable because they could be replaced by Schalke in the second pot if the German side, currently fifth in the Bundesliga, finished in the top four.

"Jonas Gutierrez has signalled his readiness to step into the depths of a crisis which is threatening to end Newcastle's season with a whimper. The 31-year-old Argentinian has been used as a substitute in the Magpies' last two games after his return to the squad following a successful battle against testicular cancer. However, as head coach John Carver prepares for Saturday's Barclays Premier League fixture against Arsenal at St James' Park with suspension and injury severely limiting his options, Gutierrez is offering his services in whatever role he is needed. Jonas Gutierrez posted this picture to his official Instagram account on Wednesday morning . The Newcastle midfielder made his second substitute appearance in the defeat by Everton on Sunday . He told the Journal: 'Three years ago when we finished fifth, I played in many positions. I was playing in different positions because we had problems with injuries. 'I'm here to help.

A winger by trade, Gutierrez played as a full-back for his country at the 2010 World Cup finals, and that ability could come in useful during the remaining weeks of the season. Skipper and close friend Fabricio Coloccini will miss the next three games after failing in a bid to have the red card he received at Everton on Sunday overturned on appeal, and with Steven Taylor and Paul Dummett out for the rest of the season through injury, Mike Williamson is the club's only recognised senior central defender.

Gutierrez and his Newcastle team-mates applaud the travelling fans after the 3-0 defeat by the Toffees . VIDEO Bringing Jonas on wasn't sentimental - Carver . That could mean a move inside for right-back Daryl Janmaat against the Gunners, and with the Dutchman currently the club's only fit specialist full-back, Gutierrez could be required to slot into a re-shaped back four, as Ryan Taylor has done in recent weeks, although Carver will hope to have Massadio Haidara ready for the weekend. Newcastle have won only one of their last six games and scored just three goals in the process, and with leading marksman Papiss Cisse just one match into his seven-game ban, their hopes of a top-10 finish appear to be receding. Gutierrez said: 'We don't have enough players at the moment. Colo is banned for three games. But we have to keep together and work hard for the manager. 'The manager will tell us what we have to do. We have to do it right on the pitch. No excuses, we have to do it better.'","Newcastle play Arsenal at St James' Park in Premier League on Saturday .

"Boxing's knockout king Gennady Golovkin has claimed he now wants to beat his next opponent by going all 12 rounds, rather than inflict the 30th stoppage of his burgeoning career. The Kazakh warrior is on the brink of becoming boxing's next superstar after causing a trail of destruction. In his 32-fight career, Golovkin has 29 knockouts, meaning his 90.6 per cent KO rate is the highest in the history of the middleweight division. Golovkin's next opponent will be Willie Monroe Jnr on May 16 in Inglewood, California - just three months after his latest brutal KO, of Britain's Martin Murray in Monaco. And the IBO/WBA and WBC interim middleweight champion said he hoped to be taken the distance for the first time in 20 fights and seven years. Gennady Golovkin (left) faces off against Willie Monroe at a press conference ahead of their fight . Boxing's knockout king said that he wanted to win over 12 rounds rather than by his trademark stoppage . Golovkin gives the thumbs up, and the WBC have done the same for his hopes of fighting Miguel Cotto . '(Monroe) is great opponent for me. I need a decision fight,' Golovkin told Seconds Out. 'I need to win by decision in a big fight.' Asked if that means he hopes Monroe will last the full distance, Golovkin said: 'I hope so - my goal is to beat any style. He has good style.' He added: '(Monroe) is southpaw, he is a very smart guy. Every champion has trouble with a southpaw.' Golovkin has amassed an incredible 29 knockouts in 32 middleweight fights . Britain's Martin Murray (right) was the latest victim of Golovkin's phenomenal power . The 32-year-old Kazakh is calling for a middleweight unification fight against WBC champion Cotto . The other leading middleweights have been reluctant face up to Golovkin's awesome power - the 32-year-old is now widely regarded as the biggest pound-for-pound puncher in the business. But Golovkin has his sights firmly set on Miguel Cotto, unless Monroe (19-1, 6 KOs) is able to pull off a huge upset. VIDEOS: Watch Golovkin face off with Monroe and call out Andre Ward . 'Miguel is WBC champion, I have the interim belt. (A fight would be) very good for us,' he said. 'He is a great name, Miguel is a big name. I respect him, he is a great champion.' And the WBC last month ordered Cotto to take their world middleweight title into a unification battle with Golovkin. He was told to do so within three months of a voluntary title defence this spring, against an as-yet-unnamed opponent. 'We have instructed Miguel that he must fight Gennady, as his mandatory challenger, next after his April fight, assuming of course that he wins,’ said WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman.

"A Chicago man accused of stabbing his roommate and biting off a piece of his ear has been found in Texas. Ross Jacobs, 27, is charged with attempted murder after allegedly stabbing his roommate with a butcher's knife multiple times as he slept around 3am in their apartment near the University of Chicago. The former graduate student at the institution, who is originally from the city's northern suburbs, is mentally ill and on medication, according to the Chicago Tribune. Ross Jacobs,  27, was arrested in Dallas County on Monday (right) for an incident last week in which he allegedly stabbed his roommate multiple times and bit off a piece of his ear . Jacobs's roommate survived that attack in their apartment on South Hyde Park (pictured) near the University of Chicago . Jacobs had seen his father in Memphis on Saturday before heading further south, investigators said. He was arrested in Dallas County, more than 900 miles and 14 hours driving from Chicago, on Monday after withdrawing money from an ATM . The suspect's roommate, also 27, survived the  attack on Friday but had serious injuries. His neighbor described Jacobs as having 'his own mind in his own world.' 'I've always encountered this guy and I'm always on alert when I see him or approach him or whether he's approaching me,' Delaney Gentle told ABC7. Chicago police believed that Jacobs could have been armed and dangerous. Chicago police have been looking for Jacobs since Friday, and he is believed to have seen his father in Memphis on Saturday before heading to Texas . The circumstances behind his arrest are not known. Despite the suspect's everyday behavior being described as 'not of a normal person,' he had an impressive academic track record before leaving University of Chicago in 2013. Jacobs was an undergraduate at Bowdoin College in Maine, where he graduated with a major in political philosophy in 2010. He won a scholarship from the conservative Phillips Foundation and wrote a column for the student newspaper in addition to reviving the college's literary debate society. The student attended New Trier High School, part of a district that regularly ranks among the best in the country.","Ross Jacobs, 27, arrested in Texas three days after 3am Chicago incident .

'It's a big step in my rehab starting running again. I am very happy to be outside again instead of staying inside in the gym all the time. It's hard work but it's worth it.' Vermaelen said Barca had been fully aware of the extent of his injury, which had not initially been diagnosed in tests conducted at the World Cup. 'Barcelona did notice the seriousness of the injury when they did the medical and there were two options,' he said. 'You could do surgery but they said it's not necessary you can do it with preventative exercises, make it as strong as you can and then it shouldn't be a problem. 'We spoke to a lot of specialists and they all said it's possible to do without surgery so for me it was an easy choice to go that way. 'It didn't work out.

The Bosnia international is valued at £15million by Stoke and regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in Europe.

"South Africa coach Russell Domingo is keeping his faith with out-of-form Quinton de Kock despite the opener's lack of runs. De Kock's 26 against United Arab Emirates in their last World Cup pool game was his highest score in his last seven one-day internationals, a run that followed his century against Australia in November. The difficult patch, including five single-figure scores, is a far cry from De Kock's early career form, which once saw him score three straight centuries against India in December 2013. Quinton de Kock looks to the skies in dejection after being caught out against the UAE for 26 runs . The out-of-form opener leaves the field after being dismissed against Pakistan for a duck . While AB De Villiers and Hashim Amla currently lead the run charts for the Proteas, ahead of their quarter-final against Sri Lanka on Wednesday at Sydney, Domingo is confident De Kock is closer than ever to a match-winning innings. When asked if De Kock was facing a mental barrier, Domingo told a press conference: 'I am not a sports psychologist but I don't know how a player can be perceived to be mentally shot. It's a little bit nasty. 'It's going to be a tough selection (meeting). On the one hand we know Quinton has got the ability to win games. But it's often difficult to have all six batters in form at the same time. 'We just sort of have this gut feeling that Quinton has got a big score around the corner. He's done well against Sri Lanka. I'm sure he'll have a good feeling playing against Sri Lanka.' One player De Kock can look up to outside of his own dressing room is Kumar Sangakkara, with the Sri Lankan currently leading the World Cup run-scoring charts at 496 - he has four successive centuries to boot and is fighting for the number one ranking with De Villiers. De Kock is set to continue at the top of the South Africa batting order for the quarter-final against Sri Lanka . South Africa coach Russell Domingo believes De Kock is due a big score . For Domingo, though, the law of averages again is a handy way to look at things, as he added: 'He's in the form of his life. You've got to think his low score is just round the corner I suppose. 'But we have worked on some plans that we feel we need to execute well against him.' And while South Africa hope they have 'learned from the lessons' of past sides, Sri Lanka are getting political in their approach to the knockout stage. No less than Sri Lanka's president and prime minister have offered their vocal support, with the latter unsurprisingly keen to claim his successful election campaign from January as the benchmark for aiming high. In quotes paraphrased in a statement on Sri Lanka cricket's website, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed on the need to study South Africa's weaknesses, adding: 'That's what some of us did last December.'","South Africa play Sri Lanka in the World Cup quarter-final on Wednesday .

'I just love taking pictures of the seals - they're just such fun creatures,' he said. 'I went up there to see if I could get something different and stand out rather than the same old images of seals on rocks.' Flipper facepalm: The seal was later seen trying to cover his face with a furry flipper as it lay among the crowded colony . The seal gave a furtive glance and a cheeky grin to the camera, held by amateur wildlife photographer Mark Reeve . The mental health carer added: 'I managed to get these shots of the big boy within just a couple of seconds. 'I got as close as I could without messing with him and we made a real connection - I'm really happy with the results.' It is not the first time Mr Reeve has caught an animal guffawing on film, after his pictures of wild horses appearing to snort with laughter at Reydon Marshes, near the Blyth Estuary, in 2009 received international recognition.","The hilarious photographs appeared to show a seal in guffaws of laughter .

"Dave Whelan was the victim of an embarrassing gaffe in his final programme notes as Wigan chairman. The 78-year-old businessman handed over control of the relegation-threatened club to his grandson this week after 20 years at the helm. But in his last written address to fans, he started by welcoming the supporters and staff of Cardiff City - when Wigan were actually playing Leeds! Dave Whelan leaves the pitch after addressing the crowd in his final game as Wigan Athletic chairman . David Sharpe is the new chairman of Wigan Athletic after taking over from his grandfather Dave . Cardiff are the last club of Wigan's current boss Malky Mackay - he was sacked by them in December 2013. And the Scot is currently under investigation by the Football Association amidst allegations of sending racist, sexist and homophobic text messages while in charge at Cardiff. Whelan started his programme notes by saying: 'Welcome to the DW Stadium for our second home match in five days. 'Tonight we welcome Cardiff City and their supporters who have travelled from South Wales for another important Sky Bet Football League Championship fixture.' Shortly before kick-off, Whelan strode onto the pitch to deliver an emotional final address to the fans in person. Whelan was given a standing ovation by the home supporters then walked alone to the centre-spot with a microphone in hand. Whelan looks emotional before heading onto the pitch - and in his programme notes he welcomed Cardiff . 'Thank you for everything,' he said. 'For the last 20 years, you have been magnificent supporters. 'We all remember when we first played at Springfield Park and I bought the club and we were third from bottom of the old fourth division. 'With your support, and all the players and staff we build this stadium and fought our way up to the Premier League. 'We had eight fantastic years in the Premier League and two years ago we brought the FA Cup back to Wigan.' At this point, the large travelling contingent from Leeds began barracking Whelan. But he responded with a put-down which brought raucous applause from the home fans. 'Leeds have not won the cup for 25 years,' he added. 'However, everyone from Leeds we welcome you to Wigan. You are a great club and a great bunch of supporters. 'I am still going to be the greatest supporter Wigan has and I will be at every match I can get to. 'Thank you for every single thing and all your fabulous support.' Whelan said he is still going to be the 'greatest supporter Wigan has' and will be at every match he can get to .

"Families crossing the Channel by Eurotunnel or ferry face Easter misery after ministers insisted on introducing new exit checks during one of the busiest getaways of the year. Queues of up to five miles and lengthy delays are predicted when the new regime starts on April 8. Under the new rules, the passport of every passenger in a car or coach will have to be individually scanned. Ministers insist that knowing who is leaving the country is vital for counting the number of immigrants in Britain and fighting crime and terrorism. Nightmare journeys: P&O Ferries has claimed new border control rules will cause huge delays leaving the country with 'coachloads of little old ladies  bearing the brunt' But even though no checks have taken place over the past 17 years, the Home Office decided the best date to reinstate them should be on the second week in April – when vast numbers of Britons head to the continent during the Easter school break. Ferry companies warn that holidaymakers will be held in queues on the A20 in Kent, blocking the route between Dover and Folkestone during one of the busiest times of year. MPs on the home affairs select committee were sent a letter from the UK Chamber of Shipping claiming trials had shown that queues of at least 650 vehicles would form on busy days. Tim Reardon, the chamber’s policy director, said: ‘The model showed that, with tourist and freight check-in transactions extended by exit checks, the queue of traffic heading for the port of Dover would extend at least 8km, blocking the A20 almost as far as Folkestone.’ Eurotunnel calculates the new system will quadruple the time taken to get vehicles onto shuttle trains. Buses with 30 or more passengers on board will take even longer. Checking a car on to a cross-Channel train takes 15 seconds at the moment. But passport checks on up to five passengers will stretch that closer to two minutes, adding to delays. Eurotunnel public affairs director John Keefe said: ‘You only have to multiply the number of people in each vehicle – five six or seven in a car or 30 or more in a coach – to see how this will play out. Protective measures: The checks start on April 8 and Eurotunnel and ferry companies will be checking the passports of all those leaving the country to tighten national security . ‘That increases the risk of congestion and delays. That’s the risk we are trying to mitigate. But the risks are significant.’ Advice: Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told the Today programme that people should set out on their journeys earlier to avoid delays . Ministers were last night under pressure from MPs to make exceptions to the rules, such as large coach parties. Interviewed on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme yesterday, immigration minister James Brokenshire twice hesitated before saying passengers should set out early on their journeys. Quizzed a third time, he said: ‘On busy days I think it is advisable for anyone to set out earlier to ensure that they are at their ports of departure on time.’ He denied there would be chaos, insisting: ‘There are often queues at both Eurotunnel and also Dover in terms of their day-to-day operations.’ In the event of huge queues, managers on the ground will not have the authority to relax the checks. They would have to seek personal approval from a minister or government official. Transport bosses say the April 8 deadline has been imposed for political reasons so ministers can say they have exit checks in place before the general election. The original date they had in mind was April 1 – just two days before Good Friday – but implementation was delayed by a week when the Home Office was warned the consequences would be even worse. Despite the inconvenience caused by the checks, the Home Office will still not have a full picture of who is in the country. The checks do not apply to journeys to Ireland or travel by private aircraft or boats. Airports are not likely to be hit by the checks. Heathrow said it did not anticipate ‘any disruption or any visible changes to passenger journeys’. A spokesman for the hub said 96 per cent of flights already collect advance passenger information.","Unpopular new measure to be introduced at British borders in Easter break .

"Danny Ings has shown his kind side by vowing to help a little girl with a life-threatening illness to complete her bucket list, reports the Manchester Evening News. Burnley striker Ings arranged to meet Harlee-Jae Procter, four, and her family, after reading about her story on Twitter. Harlee-Jae suffers from a rare genetic condition and is a huge fan of Ings' team Burnley. Danny Ings poses with four-year-old fan Harlee-Jae Porter as he attempts to help her with her bucket list . Ings and his 'new best friend' pose together while meeting at Burnley's training ground and making plans . The striker, tipped as a future England international, was so moved by her plight that he met her at his club's training ground and promised to help her tick off as many of the items on her wishlist as possible. Ings said he had made 'a new best friend' after meeting with the schoolgirl. The Clarets hotshot has now promised to take Harlee-Jae to the zoo, to Turf Moor as his mascot and even joked he would dress as Elsa from the film Frozen to entertain her. Harlee-Jae became a fan of Ings after playing the video game FIFA. During their meeting, she told him about her hopes to be a cowgirl, ride an elephant and eat breakfast with Barney the Dinosaur. Ings told the M.E.N.: 'It's a nice feeling for me to meet her. Hopefully we can work together and tick off as many things as we can. I think we can do most of them. Ings has been excellent for Burnley recently and his form earned him a kiss on the cheek from his super-fan . Burnley beat Manchester City 1-0 at Turf Moor last weekend and the fight against relegation is still alive . 'We're going to contact the zoo and see if we can go there for the afternoon and we're going to see some animals so I'm really looking forward to that. 'I've never been to a zoo so I'm looking forward to it just as much as she is. I'm really excited for it. 'I've got myself a new best friend. And she gave me a kiss on the cheek as well which was nice.' Thorn Primary School pupil, Harlee-Jae suffers from microdeletion 17 q12, which causes her health problems including kidney disease. She is likely to need liver and kidney transplants before adulthood. Mum Sasha Procter, 25, said Danny's efforts to help Harlee-Jae were overwhelming. She said: 'All she's said all weekend is ""Danny Ings"". We never ever expected him to do anything like this – she just wanted to meet him. 'You don't see many Premier League footballers doing something like this. Hopefully we can tick off some items from the list together.' Since creating her list, Harlee-Jae has flown in an airplane cockpit, travelled in a police car with Bacup officers and is due to visit the Lancashire Police Mounted Section. Ings and Harlee-Jae have already planned a trip to the zoo, which is a first for both of the two friends .","Burnley's Danny Ings met with a fan suffering from a rare genetic disorder .

"Ronnie O'Sullivan has again voiced his disaffection with snooker, claiming he is just 'using' the game and has not yet committed to entering next month's World Championship. The 39-year-old, who has won the UK Championship, the Masters and the Crucible title five times each, has struggled for much of his career with the mental aspect of the game and the demands of the tour circuit. His achievements in recent years are outstanding, winning the 2013 World Championship having barely played all season and the 2014 UK Championship despite suffering with a fractured ankle. Ronnie O'Sullivan claims that snooker does not offer the financial reward and security that it once did . O'Sullivan also said that he has contemplated not entering the snooker World Championship next month . O Sullivan celebrates winning the 2014 UK Championship but hit out at the prize money on offer to players . VIDEO O'Sullivan Into Last 16 . But as this year's Crucible build-up begins, his commitment is once more in question. 'Snooker is no longer what it once was for me. I just use snooker, rather than letting it use me,' he told the Guardian. 'I know it sounds crazy but I wasn't even sure if I was going to enter the worlds. I probably will but it's got to the point where I want to give snooker only 20 per cent of my time. 'It's not something I'm that bothered about. It's probably one of my least favourite tournaments. Seventeen days is too long. 'But as a kid, I dreamed of being world champion. (Then) I thought if I can win three or four, that would be great. Three? You're getting to be a great player. Four? You're on a level with John Higgins, who is a master of the game. So I'm really happy to have won it five times.' It is a familiar refrain from O'Sullivan. He threatened not to take up his place in the 2014 Masters, polling his Twitter followers for advice only to announce his entry around an hour later. The switch in the world rankings format, from points to a money list, played into O'Sullivan's hands by allowing him to 'play the system' - as he put it in 2013 - by focusing on the more lucrative tournaments. O'Sullivan claimed  the World Championship tournament is one of his least favourite events due to its length . O'Sullivan has won the World Championship five times already in a highly decorated career . But he remains unhappy and even said he cannot achieve financial security through snooker's 's***' prize money - an extraordinary claim even for O'Sullivan, especially as he has already noted: 'I could get by the rest of my life if I never worked again.' He said: 'If you go back five or 10 years I used to get good sponsorship for my logos. I was on £350,000 even before I hit a ball. Now there is no money in snooker. The top players are suffering now. 'I don't want it to come across as if I'm doing this for money. I just want what's fair. They can say 'you're getting this amount of prize money'. But if you're a top player it's f****** s***. I want my security, and snooker isn't going to give me that security.'","Ronnie O'Sullivan believes snooker does not offer him financial security .

"Graeme Souness will not be changing his opinion of Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, despite criticism from the Portuguese coach. In the aftermath of Chelsea's Champions League exit to Paris St Germain, former Liverpool manager and current Sky Sports pundit Souness was highly critical of them, referring to some of Chelsea's actions as 'pathetic'. He continued his complaints, with Mourinho responding in a press conference on Friday, calling the Scot a 'frustrated man'. Graeme Souness labelled Chelsea's gamesmanship during PSG defeat as 'pathetic' The Sky Sports pundit, pictured with Thierry Henry (right), has refused to back down over criticism . Using his hands to gesture, Mourinho raised his left hand above his head to illustrate Souness' high level as a player and whacked his left on a low desk to signify his own career. When it came to management, the Portuguese's right hand was raised high and his left, for Souness' management career, wavered just above the desk. Mourinho said: 'The difference between me and Souness is this - Souness as a player, up there. Jose Mourinho as a player, down here. Jose Mourinho as a manager, up here. Souness as a manager, down there. 'With another difference: I was not a frustrated man because I was not a top player. He is clearly a frustrated man.' Blues manager Jose Mourinho responded by saying Souness is 'a frustrated man' Nine Chelsea players surrounded the referee to demand that Zlatan Ibrahimovic (not pictured) was sent off . Diego Costa trains at Cobham ahead of Chelsea's Premier League clash with Southampton on Sunday . But writing in the Sunday Times, Souness was sticking to his guns. 'He had his say about me at his press conference on Friday and he is entitled to his opinion, but it won't change mine,' he said. 'When he reflects on what went wrong against PSG and addresses it , I hope - yet doubt - that will include the obsession with gamesmanship. 'It seemed more important to Chelsea than getting on the ball and taking on PSG in a game of football, which they were more than capable of winning. They are a far better team than they showed. Getting the opposition booked by their excessive reaction to fouls became their priority. I was angered and saddened by that approach.'

"Former referee Keith Hackett has called on Howard Webb to come out of retirement in a bid to improve the standard of officiating. Webb, widely considered one of England's best ever referees, retired in August 2014 to become the technical director of the Professional Games Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). His first season out of the game has been littered with refereeing controversies, the most recent of which have come inside the last week. Howard Webb, who is widely regarded as one of England's greatest ever referees, retired in August 2014 . Burnley's Ashley Barnes was not punished for a horror challenge on Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic . Martin Atkinson's decision not to punish Burnley's Ashley Barnes for a tackle on Chelsea's Nemanja Matic attracted widespread criticism, while on Saturday Roger East sent off Sunderland's Wes Brown for a foul John O'Shea committed against Manchester United. East claimed on Saturday, through a PGMOL statement, that he had considered Brown to be the guilty party, hence his dismissal. Hackett, who used to head up the PGMOL - a job now done by Mike Riley - wants Webb, 43, to return. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: 'Referees are making big mistakes, week in, week out. They need some leadership and with that leadership the guy who is at the top needs to front up. 'He should be encouraging Howard Webb to come back into the game as a referee. I don't know what Howard is doing behind the scenes with the referees.' Hackett has not been shy in criticising standards over recent weeks and says officials are giving away cards 'like confetti'. John O'Shea fouled Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao in the box, but Wes Brown was sent off instead . The Sunderland players crowded round referee Roger East but the incorrect decision was allowed to stand . On the East decision, he said: 'I think it was another error in refereeing that we've seen, we're seeing it pretty often. 'I don't know if the referee was trying to be too clever or naive. He's guessed, incorrectly, dismissed the player which is a real cardinal sin. 'Sending a player off is belittling at any stage of play. I worked hard to reduce the number of yellow cards and red cards when I was the position of the general manager of PGMOL. These guys seem to be pushing them around like confetti and in their eagerness and forgetting that their job is to get decisions correct.' The East incident came on the very day that the International Football Association Board delayed trials of further use of video technology. The Dutch FA wanted to conduct live trials in the Dutch Cup next season, but were delayed by at least 12 months. The Football Association is also keen for further technology to be trialled, but chairman Greg Dyke told 5 Live he understood the problems referees were facing. 'I saw it (the East incident) briefly, mistakes happen, but what this shows is that referees make mistakes,' he said. 'If you could help that referee with video technology, then you should. There are still mistakes, they get highlighted, that's life.' Webb has been backed to come out of his retirement in order to improve the standard of refereeing .","Former referee Keith Hackett has called Howard Webb to return to football .

"London Welsh have parted ways with head coach Justin Burnell and confirmed Rowland Phillips will take charge of team affairs. Former Wales back-rower and defence coach Phillips joined Welsh's staff in 2014 and is now promoted to the main role at the Aviva Premiership's bottom club.

The kiss happened Tuesday when the judge and jury were out of the courtroom.

Outside the courtroom during a lunch break Wednesday, Lloyd's family quietly and calmly spoke to the officer and told him they no longer have a son to kiss. The officer listened, then left to a back hallway while Lloyd's family departed in the elevator. On Wednesday, more surveillance camera footage played that showed headlights moving away from the crime scene the night of the killing. Lloyd was shot to death in an empty lot in an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough. Prosecutors on Tuesday played four grainy surveillance video clips that showed lights moving toward and from the scene. On Wednesday, they played two more that showed headlights leaving the industrial park at 3:27 a.m., four minutes after Lloyd sent his last text message. The grainy videos were taken from so far away that it is unclear how many passengers were inside or what kind of car it was. In some, it is not even clear that it was a car. Hernandez, 25, has pleaded not guilty in the June 17, 2013, killing of Odin Lloyd. Lloyd, 27, was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Also Wednesday, Massachusetts State Police Lt. Steven Bennett testified about footprints found at the scene. Among them was one made by what he said appeared to be a left shoe with three or four waves of a herringbone-type design in the middle. An expert from the shoe company Nike testified Tuesday that Hernandez could be seen in surveillance video shortly before and after the killing wearing a Nike shoe with a herringbone design on the bottom. However, he also said that that is one of the oldest designs for shoe soles in the industry. Bennett testified that the shoeprint was found a few feet from Lloyd's body and on the other side of two tire tracks.

"West Bromwich Albion midfielder Chris Brunt has been suspended for one match and fined £8,000 after accepting a Football Association misconduct charge. The 30-year-old had requested a personal hearing after being charged with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a match official in or around the tunnel area after the final whistle following Albion's 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa this month. Brunt is banned with immediate effect and will miss Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Manchester City. West Bromwich Albion midfielder has been handed a one match ban and an £8,000 fine by the FA . Brunt  argues with referee Anthony Taylor after he sends off Claudio Yacob during the game at Villa Park . The Northern Ireland international faced the threat of a two-game ban and Albion's director of football administration Richard Garlick believes the punishment reflected the circumstances in which the game finished. Villa fans invaded the pitch at the final whistle and had also run onto the surface while the game was still in play, with the invasions the subject of an FA investigation. Referee Anthony Taylor had also sent off Albion's Claudio Yacob and Villa's Jack Grealish towards the end of the match. Thousands streamed on to the pitch after the match, which helped make Brunt's an 'extraordinary case' 'We had a fair hearing and feel the punishment is an acknowledgement by the Commission that this was an extraordinary case,' said Garlick, after the Independent Regulatory Commission in London on Tuesday.

"Newcastle have announced the signing of Tonga international prop Taione Vea from London Welsh. The Auckland-born 26-year-old, who has won six caps for Tonga, will join the Falcons on a two-year deal in time for the 2015-16 season. Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards said of the former Wasps and North Harbour front-rower: 'We're pleased to be able to add Taione to the squad for the next season. He's a quality prop who is a great scrummager and equally strong on the loose work too. Taione Vea (centre) has signed for Newcastle Falcons on a two-year deal from current club London Welsh . Vea breaks through a challenge for London Welsh against Northampton Saints last year . 'As a Tongan international he brings a powerful and skilled head to our front row, although he's also a very humble guy who I know will fit in well with our squad.' The 6ft2in 20-stone Vea, who joined London Welsh from Wasps last summer, said: 'I've spoken with Dean about his plans for Newcastle Falcons and his vision on where the club is going and it sounds like something I want to be involved with. 'I'm still learning a lot and want to get more Premiership experience so I'm looking forward to doing that at Newcastle Falcons.'

"Hull KR scored 40 unanswered second-half points to claim a remarkable 50-20 comeback win over Catalans Dragons and climb off the bottom of the Super League table. Rovers looked set for another defeat as they trailed 20-4 during the first half but they staged an unbelievable rally to take the spoils as Catalans were blown away after half-time. Slick passing and determined defending kept the French side out as Chris Chester's men, who ran in nine tries - seven after the interval, enjoyed their best day of the season so far. Ken Sio celebrates after scoring in a game where he grabbed a hat-trick for Hull KR at home to Catalans . It had all looked so different when Willie Tonga put the Dragons ahead early on . Ken Sio led the way with a hat-trick of tries while Ben Cockayne and debutant Shaun Lunt notched braces. Albert Kelly and Liam Salter were also on the scoresheet for the hosts, with Josh Mantellato slotting over seven conversions. Catalans ran in four tries, but all of them came during the first half as they could find no way through in a one-sided second period. Few would have predicted the final scoreline as the Dragons opened the scoring just two minutes in through Willie Tonga. Rovers responded with a try from Sio in the 16th minute but the Dragons restored their lead when Michael Oldfield scored the third unconverted of the half in the 25th minute - two minutes after KR prop Mitch Allgood was sin-binned for his part in an off-the-ball flare-up with Scott Dureau. Albert Kelly breaks between two Catalans players on the way to a superb individual score . The Dragons capitalised on their numerical advantage when Remi Casty stretched over the line to score in the 28th minute before Eloi Pelissier further increased their lead. Dureau converted both tried to put the visitors 20-4 ahead with five minutes of the first half remaining. At that point it looked as though there was only one outcome to the match, but Rovers had other ideas. They gave themselves a timely boost when Cockayne scored on the stroke of half-time after great work by Kris Welham, allowing the hosts to reduce the deficit to 20-10 at the break thanks to Mantellato's conversion. Catalans would still have been in optimistic mood at the midway point of the match, but that would not have lasted long as KR staged an incredible second-half onslaught. Liam Salter breaks away from Morgan Escare to score as Hull KR ran in seven second-half tries . Albert Kelly added to his try collection with a superb 40 metres try converted by Mantellato, who four minutes later added the extras to Sio's second try of the game to give Rovers the lead for the first time at 22-20. Rovers never looked back as the tries continued to flow, with Sio completing his hat-trick in the 57th minute. Newcomer Lunt then got in on the scoring with his first Rovers try in the 59th minute following up good work by Terry Campese. Salter was next over as Rovers continued to run riot before Lunt got his second. Cockayne also doubled up with his second try of the afternoon in the 75th minute with Mantellato converting to seal a breathtaking win. Shuan Lunt celebrates with Terry Campese after his second try on his debut .","Hull KR came back from 20-4 down to score 46 unanswered points .

"Felicity Bassouls is charged with persistently emailing and phoning her son-in-law Ben Cohen . The mother-in-law of Rugby World Cup winner Ben Cohen is to stand trial accused of harassing the Strictly Come Dancing star. Felicity Bassouls is accused of persistently emailing and phoning the former England player between September and October last year. Bassouls, 67, turned up for a hearing of the case at Northampton Magistrates' Court today, but had not been called on to attend. A three-day trial was set down to start at Corby Magistrates' Court on August 12, with the agreement of defence lawyers and the Crown Prosecution Service. Bassouls, of Ardross, near Alness in Highland, Scotland, is also accused of harassing her own son, Austen Blaney, with emails and phone calls, between September 1 and October 29. She was unconditionally bailed after the hearing. Asked if she had any comment to make outside court, Bassouls said: 'I have nothing to say at this time.' Cohen split with his wife Abby  but denied that it was due to a relationship with his Strictly Come Dancing on-screen partner Kristina Rihanoff. The BBC show is said to have a 'curse' with its steamy routines believed to have a hand in ending celebrities' relationships. Cohen is pictured with his wife Abby in 2003 at the International Rugby Board Awards - they split last year . Bassouls, Cohen's mother-in-law, was unconditionally bailed and offered no comment outside the court .

"London Broncos have released two of their overseas close-season signings, just five weeks into their Kingstone Press Championship campaign. The Broncos say 31-year-old prop Josh Cordoba, who had a brief spell in Super League with Hull in 2009, has left the club with immediate effect after they agreed to his request to be released from his contract.

"As India and Bangladesh relaxed with games of football before their World Cup quarter-final, the underdogs came out swinging. Defending champions India are almost everybody's overwhelming favourites to sweep aside Bangladesh in Melbourne. But Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, however, knows what it feels like to score an important victory over India and is confident the underdogs can cause a shock. India captain MS Dhoni (centre) celebrates scoring a goal as India's players relaxed with a game of football . India's players are preparing for their World Cup quarter-final with Bangladesh in Melbourne . Suresh Raina (left) controls the ball during the practice game on Tuesday . Dhoni (right) shows his skill by avoiding the challenge of the lunging Raina . He was only months into an outstanding international career, which currently places him at the top of the International Cricket Council all-rounder rankings, when he made a half-century in the five-wicket success in Trinidad which sent India out of the 2007 World Cup - almost exactly eight years ago. Shakib, and Bangladesh, have had little success against their super-power neighbours in the intervening years and were beaten by their fellow co-hosts as India steered their championship route in this tournament in 2011. But as Bangladesh enter unchartered territory, as quarter-final debutants, Shakib warns anything is possible. 'This is the first time we're playing in a World Cup quarter-final - but at the same time we need to understand it's another game of cricket,' he said. 'Obviously, on paper, India are a better team than Bangladesh - no one has any doubt about it. 'But on the day, it's a one-off game - and if we have a good day and they have a bad day, you never know.' Shakib Al Hasan (left) is confident Bangladesh have what it takes to beat India .

While Mahendra Singh Dhoni's India, as is their wont, declined to speak publicly until they must on the eve of the match - and even chose not to play any cricket either at the MCG, preferring football practice - Shakib was not minded to make too much of Bangladesh's 2007 win. 'It will be in our memory,' he said. 'But it's a new game, and we all know it. India are a very good side - they have some world-class players. Obviously, it's going to be hard for us. We know that, but we're up for the challenge.' The indications in Bangladesh's campaign so far, according to Shakib, are encouraging. He said: 'I think we played fearless cricket [in 2007], and we all want to play that brand of cricket. 'So far in this World Cup, I think we're doing it. India are the defending world champions - they've got some world-class players - but we're doing well in this World Cup.

"Maria Sharapova was dumped out of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells by defending champion Flavia Pennetta - but world No 1 Serena Williams did manage to reach the quarter-finals. Fresh from beating Victoria Azarenka in Monday's third round, Sharapova looked ready to continue her fine run of form and took the first set against Pennetta, who looked distracted and emotional throughout the opening games. The Italian rallied, however, forcing Sharapova into a decider before tightening her grip on the match and closing out a 3-6 6-3 6-2 victory. Maria Sharapova reaches for a forehand in her defeat by Flavia Pennetta at the BNP Paribas Open .

The world's best player dropped her first two service games in the fourth career meeting between two former friends, whose relationship had cooled in the wake of Stephens' solitary win at the 2013 Australian Open.

"League Two high-flyers Luton Town will rename their home ground the Prostate Cancer UK Stadium for one match to raise awareness of the disease, the club said on Wednesday. The former top-flight club, now playing in the fourth tier, said the 10,000 capacity of their 110-year-old Kenilworth Road ground represented the amount of men who die of prostate cancer each year in Britain. The name change will take effect for the match against Wycombe Wanderers on Tuesday. Luton's Kenilworth Road ground will be renamed the Prostate Cancer UK Stadium for one match . Luton are chasing promotion from League Two and currently sit sixth in the table .

"Jonathan Trott convinced England's selectors he was ready to return to the Test arena with his mature Lions captaincy, and runs, this winter. It is 16 months since Trott had to leave the 2013/14 Ashes with a stress-related problem, and it was not until the second half of last summer that he began to demonstrate he was capable of producing his best form again. The man once inked in at No 3 for England duly returned to the squad on Wednesday, although he is now likely to be competing for an opening slot alongside captain Alastair Cook in the West Indies next month. Jonathan Trott celebrates hitting an unbeaten double century for the Lions in South Africa . Trott's captaincy of the Lions against South Africa in January led to an England recall . The top order batsman has not played for England since leaving last year's Ashes for stress related reasons . Trott was included alongside three prospective debutants in the 16-man squad - Yorkshire pair Adam Lyth and Adil Rashid, plus Durham's Mark Wood. Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes was also named on Wednesday morning, returning to the fold as England seek to erase the embarrassment of their early World Cup exit and start an Ashes year of Test cricket by winning in the Windies. However, it is the inclusion of Trott which dominated the agenda after his return to form with Warwickshire and the Lions. 'Really well done for all the efforts he's put in for the last 12 months,' national selector James Whitaker told ecb.co.uk. 'He seems to be enjoying his cricket again, which is the main thing we wanted to see, and he's very relaxed.

'He's worked hard for Yorkshire, and been part of a championship-winning team.' It is more than five years since Rashid - one of six Yorkshire players in England's squad - won the last of his 10 limited-overs caps. But at 27, the selectors believe the leg-spinning all-rounder is an improved cricketer. Whitaker said: 'We sense a growing maturity with him ... and we hope he can now take that next step into the international stage and contribute to winning Test matches for England.' There is excitement too to have a 'young, quick bowler in our midst' in the shape of 25-year-old Wood - who said: 'I am delighted. 'Especially when I haven't played that many games, it is good that people have seen something in me.' England are in need of some experience after Eoin Morgan's side's disastrous Cricket World Cup . Alastair Cook will return as Test captain after losing his role to Eoin Morgan at the World Cup . Cook picks up the reins again after being replaced as World Cup captain before Christmas, only for England to then endure a miserable early exit from the tournament under Eoin Morgan. Eight of those who fell short in the 50-over format are retained for the Test trip to the Windies. Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, who both finished the World Cup injured, are not among them as they recover from their respective side and foot problems - although the Worcestershire all-rounder may join the tour later, depending on his progress. James Anderon's place was all-but assured, and his inclusion means he can prepare for his 100th Test in Antigua, where he will need just four more victims to go past Ian Botham as England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker.

"Novak Djokovic gives the thumbs up at Indian Wells . Novak Djokovic progressed to the fourth round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells with a comfortable 7-5 6-3 victory over Albert Ramos-Vinolas. The world No 1 rarely looked troubled as he put together a straight sets triumph over Spaniard Ramos-Vinolas, who is yet to win an ATP Tour title. Djokovic, who would collect a 50th career gong should he defend his championship in the Coachella Valley, must now challenge home favourite John Isner for a place in the quarter-finals. The big-serving American fired down 18 aces as he found his way past Kevin Anderson 7-6 (8/6) 6-2 in a touch under one hour and 20 minutes. Fourth and fifth seeds Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori are safely through after overcoming Philipp Kohlschreiber and Fernando Verdasco respectively. Murray took a first set in 25 minutes but in the end needed the best part of two hours to overcome Kohlschreiber 6-1 3-6 6-1 while Japan's Nishikori recovered from an early wobble to edge out Verdasco 6-7 (6/8) 6-1 6-4. Awaiting Murray is Adrian Mannarino following the Frenchman's 6-4 6-4 triumph over Ernests Gulbis and Nishikori's next opponent is Feliciano Lopez.

In the women's draw, second seed Maria Sharapova battled her way past fierce rival Victoria Azarenka to reach the last 16. The Russian was inferior on her percentages throughout a bruising encounter between two multiple grand slam champions but nevertheless it was Azarenka who found herself saving five match points before succumbing to a 6-4 6-3 defeat.

"Manchester City defender Micah Richards, who is currently on loan at Serie A side Fiorentina and is out of contract at the end of the season, has said that the chances of first-team football will be the main factor in deciding his next move. Richards told TalkSport on Wednesday, 'It's difficult to say [where I will play] at the moment.' He added, 'Every footballer can go to a bigger club on a free contract but for me, I'm still only 26 and I just want to play every game, that's what's important.' Richards has recently been linked with a switch to Inter Milan, now manged by his former City boss Roberto Mancini. Manchester City defender Micah Richards is currently on loan at Serie A side Fiorentina . The 26-year-old is out of contract in the summer and is keen to secure regular first-team football . Richards has been linked with a move to Inter Milan, managed by his former City boss Roberto Mancini . The England international, who has 13 caps for his country, graduated from City's academy in 2005 and for a few years commanded a regular starting berth for the Sky Blues. However, thanks to a mix of injuries, squad rotation and a string of high profile defensive signings sanctioned by the club's wealthy owners, Richards' opportunities at the Etihad Stadium gradually became more limited. On a possible return to English football Richards admitted, 'Everyone wants to play in the Premier League, it's still the best league in the world and the most entertaining.' And surely when he does become a free agent in the summer, the right-back will not be short of potential suitors both at home and abroad.

"Serena Williams recovered from a nightmare start to overcome her compatriot Sloane Stephens and reach the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. The world No 1 dropped her first two service games in the fourth career meeting between two former friends, whose relationship had cooled in the wake of Stephens' solitary win at the 2013 Australian Open. Despite dropping the opening set on a tie-break after rallying to recover the double break, Williams became increasingly dominant as the game went on and secured a 6-7 (7/3), 6-2, 6-2 win in two hours and seven minutes.

It proved a much tougher challenge for Williams - making her first appearance in Indian Wells in 14 years - than her 53-minute triumph over Zarina Diyas in the previous round. Shocked by Stephens' strong start, Williams battled back to level but the world number 42 dominated the tie-break to raise hopes of levelling the career wins between the pair at two apiece. Williams had other ideas, breaking her opponent early in the second set and refusing to allow Stephens a single break point chance before she served out confidently to level the match.

"Russian prosecutors are examining shocking footage of a football coach kicking a seven-year-old boy in the air during a Lokomotiv Moscow youth match.

'I was explaining to the child how to use his foot in a more robust manner,' claimed the coach, who claimed the camera was at the wrong angle. 'I started showing him - and just then the child jumped. So I sort of touched him, and he flipped in the air. 'Of course, there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him. This is a coincidence.

"Former Barcelona forward Ronaldinho has been dropped by Mexican side Queretaro while unhappy supporters have dubbed him 'Robberdinho' for producing sub-par displays amid media reports of too much partying. The Brazilian signed for the club in September but has only showed glimpses of the form that won him two FIFA World Player of the Year awards with Barca in 2004 and 2005. Ronaldinho missed a penalty on his debut and has been unable to win over the fans since. Ronaldinho has been dropped by Mexican side Queretaro following a string of poor performances . The former Barcelona forward has also come under scrutiny for his lavish off-field lifestyle . He was axed for Sunday's game at Toluca by new coach Victor Manuel Vucetich, a renowned disciplinarian, after he reportedly missed training in the week. Queretaro lost 1-0 and are second from bottom in the league with eight points from 10 games. 'They (the fans) are calling him 'Robberdinho' ... and it is undeniable the Brazilian star's time in Mexican football has left a lot to be desired where it matters most: on the field,' said the Estadio newspaper. 'The world champion has not dropped his party lifestyle in the land of the Aztecs.' Ronaldinho, who turns 35 next week, has always been known for his love of night life but Queretaro appear to be losing patience with him. An executive who declined to be identified told Reuters the club had no intention of extending his two-year contract and expected him to head to the United States once his time in Mexico was over.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has furiously denied talk of a problem between himself and assistant manager Ryan Giggs and has absolved defender Jonny Evans of any blame in the spitting incident with Newcastle's Papiss Cisse on Wednesday night. United win 1-0 at St James Park on Wednesday was notable for the fact Giggs did not appear keen to celebrate Ashley Young's late winner. Van Gaal said on Thursday: 'I am very irritated with this question. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal insisted he and assistant Ryan Giggs (left) are on good terms . The Dutchman refuted claims that there were problems between himself and the former United player . Giggs (left) appeared subdued after Ashley Young scored a late winner against Newcastle on Wednesday . 'Everybody can see we have a good relationship. 'We work very hard together me with the players and the staff. 'I am very irritated about this. I am not pleased. A suggestion about a poor relationship is wrong. 'I am a fact man.' Minutes before Thursday's press conference, United defender Evans had denied spitting at Cisse on Wednesday night in a statement released by the club. Cisse, on the other hand, has apologised for his actions. Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse clash after the unsavoury incident at St James' Park on Wednesday night . Cisse has apologised to Evans after reacting while the Man United defender has denied all allegations . Van Gaal said: 'I have spoken with Jonny and that is why I am late. 'When he was spitting on the ground maybe it was a human reaction. It was not his intention and I believe him.' The FA are waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the FA can retrospectively punish the pair. Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games. Asked about whether he feared the FA would charge Evans, Van Gaal replied briefly. He said: 'I think the FA is very wise.' Evans released a statement on Thursday, denying the allegations that he spat at the Newcastle striker. The statement on Manchester United's official website read: 'Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night's match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. 'I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. 'It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.' Conversely, Papiss Cisse has said since apologised to his team-mates, fans, and even Evans, saying he spat back at the Northern Irishman as a reaction to something 'very unpleasant.'","Louis van Gaal insisted he has a good relationship with Ryan Giggs .

"Everton boss Roberto Martinez feels the poor condition of the pitch at Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium is 'a concern' - but he is sure it will be just as problematic for one side as the other in Thursday's Europa League last-16 second-leg encounter. Rather than training on the pitch at their opponents' stadium as they normally would, Martinez' men did a session on the running track surrounding the playing surface - while the turf was covered by a protective sheet - following their arrival in Ukraine on Wednesday. And when asked about the state of the grass, the Spaniard said at his pre-match press conference: 'The pitch is a concern for both teams.

"Louis van Gaal arrived at his press conference on Thursday apologising for still being in what he called his 'work clothes'. That, however, transpired to the least of his worries. Soon after, he was embroiled in what we can politely describe as a lively exchange about the nature of his relationship with his assistant Ryan Giggs. Pictures of a rather underwhelmed Giggs at St James' Park on Wednesday and some quotes from his old friend Paul Scholes had given weight earlier in the day to some recent chatter about the United icon's thoughts on Van Gaal's style of play and indeed his own future. Louis van Gaal was not best pleased after his relationship with Ryan Giggs was questioned . Giggs did not respond to Van Gaal's in-your-face celebrations after United's late win against Newcastle . The Manchester United boss gave a tetchy press conference ahead of Monday's FA Cup clash with Arsenal . And then there was the Jonny Evans issue. Caught on film spitting towards the ground during a clash with Newcastle centre forward Papiss Cisse, the United central defender now stands accused – rightly or wrongly - of one of the most frowned upon acts in sport. All in all, it was another challenging day at the office for United's manager. No wonder his mood was rather spiky. 'No, we have a very bad relationship,' said Van Gaal of Giggs, rather sarcastically. 'I'm very irritated because of this question. 'Everyone can see we have a very good relationship and work very hard together, not only Ryan Giggs but all the staff and players. 'This [your question] is a way of suggesting things. 'So now I am very irritated and I take my message against the media. I'm not pleased. 'I think 90 per cent [of everything you say] is not happening.' Van Gaal and Giggs share their views during the Premier League clash with the Magpies on Wednesday . Ashley Young wheels away after scoring a late winner to keep United in the chase for a top four finish . The former Holland manager laughs from the dugout at St James' Park while his No 2 remains stony faced . Giggs (2nd left) did not appear to join in his manager's celebrations after United's late victory at Newcastle . Images of Giggs failing to join Van Gaal's celebrations after Ashley Young's 89th minute goal at St James Park on Wednesday were certainly peculiar. So, too, were quotes from Scholes on TV before kick-off. 'There's no doubt, he had that little taste of it for the last three weeks of last year and he definitely wants to be a manager,' Scholes told BT Sport. 'You can see that. Over the next two or three years, will he have the patience to be a No 2 for that long? I'm not sure he will.' Giggs is reportedly angry after former team-mate Paul Scholes (right) questioned his contentment at United . Giggs is understood to have been non-plussed by David Moyes' style of play at Manchester United . The United icon took charge at Old Trafford for the final games of last season following Moyes' sacking . Giggs and Scholes worked together at United when the former was handed the reins last season in the wake of David Moyes' sacking. Former team-mates, they know each other very well. Nevertheless, it is understood that Giggs views his friend's comments as unhelpful and is furious that anyone should voice doubts about his relationship with Van Gaal. It is not hard to wonder, though, what Giggs does make of the Dutch coach's style. Giggs grew frustrated at Moyes' reluctance to play on the front foot last season and immediately sought to change it during his spell as interim manager last April and May. Giggs instinctively went back to what he emotively called 'the United way'. So have things improved that much this season? It is hard to say that they have. For now, though, United fans will listen to Van Gaal's words and learn of Giggs' irritation and perhaps be soothed. If performances pick up - starting with a home FA Cup tie with Arsenal on Monday - then the subject will be allowed to melt away. United defender Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse have been charged with spitting during the game . ‘Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night’s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. ‘I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. ‘It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.’ THE GAMES HE COULD MISS FOR UNITED: Arsenal (h), Monday; Tottenham (h), March 15; Liverpool (a), March 22; Aston Villa (h), April 4; Man City (h) April 12; Chelsea (a) April 18. Evans and Cisse were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on Wednesday night . ‘I have apologies to make to a lot of people today. Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny. ‘I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be a positive role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down. ‘I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.’ THE GAMES HE’LL MISS FOR NEWCASTLE: Everton (a), March 15; Arsenal (h), March 21; Sunderland (a), April 5; Liverpool (a), April 13; Tottenham (h), April 19; Swansea (h), April 25; Leicester (a), May 2. Cisse has accepted a possible seven-game ban while Evans has until 6pm on Friday February 6 to respond . As for Evans, he will clearly tell the FA that he didn't mean to spit at Cisse on Wednesday but may still be fortunate to escape a ban of six games. Footage would appear to be inconclusive and it is easy to sympathise with the Irishman's claim in a statement on Thursday that he was not spitting at his opponent. His manager clearly believes him, too, but whether the FA will feel they can prove the case against one player - Cisse - and not the other will perhaps worry Van Gaal as he contemplates playing much of the remainder of the season without his centre half. 'Of course I've spoken with Jonny Evans,' said the United manager. 'It is like what I said in the press conference after match that he was not aware he was spitting. 'And when he was spitting on the ground, maybe it's a natural thing from a human being. 'I think it was not his intention and that I said already. 'I cannot imagine that Jonny Evans could do that. 'And he has said this also so I believe him. 'So for me the matter has done.' United will renew their rivalry with Arsenal when Van Gaal takes on Arsene Wenger in the FA Cup quarter-final . With Monday's game at Old Trafford so important to United in terms of their chances of not only winning a trophy but also of finding the required confidence to take in to some tough Barclays Premier League fixtures, Van Gaal may have hoped for a rather less eventful build-up. Amid it all, at least he can cling to results. United remain fourth in the Premier League and, somehow, on course for the Champions League qualification that was stated as a pre-requisite at the start of the season. Criticism has been a constant companion throughout his time in England and, indeed, during previous spells in Holland and Spain. It is partly because of this that it was surprising to see him so irked. He is usually a little more phlegmatic. One imagines that passage to the last four of the FA Cup on Monday night would put much of it right.","Ryan Giggs did not celebrate Manchester United's 1-0 win at Newcastle .

"It says something for the way things have changed in English football that Arsene Wenger admitted only last week that Arsenal have no chance of winning the Barclays Premier League. The same, of course, could be said of Manchester United. It is, we should remind ourselves, only the start of March. Given United’s enduring financial capacity, it should not be too long before the most successful club of the Premier League era are competing with Manchester City and Chelsea at the top of the table once more.

As for Arsenal, it is more difficult to say. Arsene Wenger’s team have been a peripheral concern for quite a while now. Whatever the case, on Monday night at Old Trafford, these great modern rivals come together with something more at stake than a place in the last four of the FA Cup. With United not involved in Europe this season and Arsenal staring at likely Champions League expulsion in Monaco next week — they trail 3-1 after the last-16 home leg — victory tonight would at least keep one of them relevant from a domestic point of view. No wonder United staff have been encouraging supporters to bring flags and banners to Old Trafford in a bid to bolster tonight’s atmosphere. This may not be a cup final but it may feel a little bit like one. ‘United and Arsenal are placed third and fourth in the Premier League so it’s almost like a final, I think,’ said United manager Louis van Gaal. ‘It is a big event with two good teams. I hope we can give a fantastic match for the fans. United boss Louis van Gaal is targeting his first piece of silverware since arriving at Old Trafford last summer . Wayne Rooney during United's training session at Carrington on Sunday ahead of the game . ‘I think if we beat them it is a big blow for them but if they beat us it is a big blow for us. It is a very important game, not only for the FA Cup but also for the rest of the season.’ United have not won the FA Cup for 11 years. Arsenal are the holders after last season’s victory over Hull but, prior to that, their previous success in the competition had come back in 2005. This says much for the manner in which both clubs’ focus has been elsewhere for so long. Arsenal and United have always valued the FA Cup but, during the years they disputed the league title and had grand aspirations in Europe, it was occasionally allowed to slide down the priority list. That is no longer the case. Van Gaal in particular has been respectful towards the game’s most famous cup competition ever since he arrived in Manchester last summer and has made no attempt to hide what it would mean to him — and his club — if United could win it. The first trophy Van Gaal ever won as a coach was Holland’s KNVB Cup with Ajax in 1993. He still considers his first Dutch championship, which arrived a year later, as the most important trophy of his coaching career. But he admitted he understood Jose Mourinho’s view that his most crucial success in England was his first — the 2005 League Cup triumph.

The Gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach Wembley for the third time in two years . Laurent Koscielny puts in the effort with a sprint as Wengers' team got ready for the vital game at Old Trafford . ‘You can say you play for your profession but that is not enough,’ said Van Gaal. ‘You want to win something. That is why you play and coach. The players want to win something and also the manager and also the fans. ‘When you win a title like the FA Cup, which in England is very important, and when you fight for something and you get it, you are pleased and that is why Jose Mourinho is saying what he says about his first one. ‘When you compare coaches with one another then titles are very important. And when a player wins something, they then have the experience of winning a final so there are a lot of positive things.’ Van Gaal was not hired last summer to win the FA Cup. He knows he must get United back into the Champions League. No Premier League club with aspirations of winning the league can afford to be locked out of money-spinning European competition for more than the odd season. Similarly, Wenger knows what his true responsibilities are. French centre forward Olivier Giroud is finally looking capable of scoring consistently for the Gunners . On Monday night, however, the expectation is that this should feel like the most important night of these teams’ seasons so far and the contest should benefit from that. Arsenal have been playing reasonably well for some time and have won 10 of their last 11 domestic games. With their French centre forward Olivier Giroud finally looking capable of scoring consistently, the holders will head north knowing they have the capacity to trouble their great rivals. They also have a league defeat from early winter to avenge. Arsene Wenger's side are current FA Cup champions after their dramatic victory against Hull last season . United’s football, on the other hand, has been more patchy but Van Gaal will hope that inspiration can be taken from an away win at Newcastle last Wednesday that had an important feel about it. He will also hope his captain Wayne Rooney can use his own rather sketchy FA Cup past as a motivating factor. ‘He has not won the FA Cup,’ said Van Gaal. ‘And that is something that is missing for him. ‘My first championship with Ajax was very important for me, it was also an emotional thing. It will be the same for Wayne.’","Manchester United face Arsenal in the FA Cup sixth-round on Monday .

"Harry Kane is expected to receive his first senior international call on Thursday and England's decision to train at Tottenham next week will present Roy Hodgson the chance to discuss future plans for the young striker with Mauricio Pochettino. Hodgson has promised England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate the first choice on the players he wants to select for the European Championships in the Czech Republic in June. Harry Kane is expected to be named in Roy Hodgson's England squad on Thursday . The Tottenham striker has made a huge impact in scoring 26 goals in his breakthrough season . After his 26-goal breakthrough season, 21-year-old Kane is at the top of Southgate's list but Spurs boss Pochettino would prefer him to rest after the club's post-season tour to Australia. 'Tottenham, the FA and Harry Kane all need to share our opinions and take the best decision,' said Pochettino. 'All players want to play for their country, but we need to speak because we care about Harry and want him to develop in the best way.' Both Hodgson and Pochettino are scheduled to be at the Spurs training base, near Enfield, next Thursday as England prepare for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley and a friendly in Italy on Monday week. Southgate will not be present but discussions are already open about Kane's availability for the U21 Euros, with an idea forming that he could be given a short break after his return from Australia and before reporting late to the England camp to ease Tottenham's concerns about burnout. Those selected by Southgate for the tournament – England's first game is on June 18 - will be excused games with Hodgson's senior team in June against the Republic of Ireland and Slovenia. Kane's value to his club and country are illustrated by the remarkable statistics he has generated this term (see graphic). His 26 goals have been vital in Spurs' push for Champions League football, but among those strikes are five that have been equalisers and seven that have put his side ahead. His conversion rate for headed shots at goal is 27 per cent, a Premier League high. And, perhaps most tellingly, Spurs have won just won game out of six when Kane has not played.","Harry Kane is set to be named in England squad for first time .

"Up in the expensive seats, Steven Gerrard looked down on another fruitless appeal for a Liverpool penalty and blew out his cheeks. This was one of those days at Anfield. For all their improvement in the second half of the season, Liverpool are still capable of throwing in a performance like this from time to time. There are still days when the cogs in the machine don’t run smoothly, days when the absence of any kind of Plan B hurts Liverpool and hurts them badly. Blackburn were terrific here. They defended brilliantly, ran hard and stuck to a game plan devised by manager Gary Bowyer to deny Liverpool the space between the defensive and midfield lines that their playmakers love to work in. Blackburn defended stubbornly to stop players such as Philippe Coutinho (centre) from having an impact for Liverpool . Steven Gerrard (left) was in the stands watching the game at Anfield, as was former team-mate and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher . Gerrard did not play for Liverpool due to injury but the supporters are desperate to get to Wembley in his final season at the club . Martin Skrtel (right) landed awkwardly and play was halted for eight minutes as he was treated by medical staff . Skrtel  lies on the ground after contesting a header with the Blackburn Rovers forward Rudy Gestede . Emre Can (centre) stands over Skrtel before calling for medical assistance for his Liverpool team-mate . Skrtel was moving his arms as he was carried off on a stretcher in the 11th minute of Liverpool's FA Cup tie . A week earlier here at Anfield, Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City found it impossible to plug those gaps. As a result, Liverpool’s Brazilian Philippe Coutinho won that game almost on his own. Here, though, Blackburn found the key and, as a result, Liverpool ran out of ideas. The visitors’ formation squeezed the life out of Liverpool while their two central defenders Alex Baptiste and Matthew Kilgallon cleaned up everything that Brendan Rodgers’ team did manage to throw in to the penalty area. On the break, Blackburn were dangerous too. Without their much-discussed centre forward Josh King – who was injured - the Championship side relied heavily on the imposing figure of Rudy Gestede and he worried Liverpool’s back three all afternoon but especially in the first half. Perhaps Liverpool were unsettled by a nasty injury to their own defender Martin Skrtel in the very first minute. A header from Alex Baptiste (second left) brought a fine save from Simon Mignolet at the start of the second half . Mignolet (centre) made a superb save to tip the header from Baptiste away at the beginning of the second half . Kolo Toure (left) hit the back of the net in the first half but his strike was ruled out for offside . Toure (right) replaced the injured Skrtel and also hit the post with a header in the second half . Mario Balotelli came on in the second half for Liverpool but was unable to find a way through the Blackburn defence . Liverpool: Mignolet 6.5, Johnson 6, Skrtel 6 (Toure 11, 6), Lovren 6, Markovic 6.5 (Balotelli 59, 6), Henderson 6.5, Can 6, Lallana 5, Sterling 5.5, Sturridge 6.5, Coutinho 5.5 . Subs not used: Lambert, Sakho, Moreno, Williams, Ward. Bookings: Can . Blackburn: Eastwood 7, Henley 6.5, Baptiste 7, Kilgallon 7.5, Olsson 6.5, Cairney, Marshall 6 (Taylor 68, 6), Williamson 7.5, Evans 6.5, Conway 6, Gestede 8 . Subs not used: Spurr, Brown, Rhodes,  Henry, Lenihan, Steele. Bookings: Cairney . Att: 43,820 . *Ratings by CHRIS WHEELER at Anfield . The Slovakian fell awkwardly in a challenge with Gestede and was treated for what looked like a neck injury for eight minutes. Happily he was okay by half-time and able to watch the rest of the game. No doubt he found it as frustrating as the majority crammed inside Anfield. Liverpool were not dreadful. They were the better team. But by their own improving standards, their football lacked crispness and rhythm and as such they found it difficult to ever gather momentum. Blackburn were actually the first to show after Skrtel’s injury and Gestede was the game’s most influential player for 25 minutes. The manner in which he forced Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in to a mistake under a high ball seemed portentous while the dummy he sold Raheem Sterling to give Craig Conway a sight of goal on the overlap soon after was terrific. Sadly for Blackburn, Conway’s shot flew high and wide. There was the occasional moment of cohesion from the home team but far fewer than we would have expected. Liverpool may have had a penalty in the 19th minute when Kilgallon appeared to bundle over the largely ineffectual Adam Lallana in the penalty area. Did the defender’s toe just touch the ball first? Perhaps. That apart, there were a couple of long shots from Coutinho. After his recent success from distance, nobody could blame the Brazilian for having a go. On this occasion, his range was set too high, however. Skrtel’s replacement Toured did have the ball in the net in the 34th minute after a free-kick dropped invitingly to him six yards out but he was a yard offside. Then, during the eight extra minutes added for Skrtel’s injury, Lazar Markovic and Daniel Sturridge brought saves from Simon Eastwood. It was notable that they were the first two the Blackburn goalkeeper had been asked to make all half.

Raheem Sterling leaps over the challenge from Adam Henley (left) of Blackburn but the ball rolls out of play . After the interval, Liverpool did build pressure. As Blackburn’s energy levels dropped, they found it harder to break. Still, though, Blackburn had the best chance as Baptiste’s header from a corner in the 48th minute was brilliantly touched over by Mignolet. Beyond that fright, Liverpool’s football was undeniably quicker, neater and indeed more progressive. Still, though, they found it hard to penetrate the wall of blue. Indeed, all that Rodgers’ team really had to show for their efforts as the game reached the last 20 minutes was a shot by Sturridge that was blocked by Baptiste and a follow up from Coutinho that must have landed somewhere in the environs of Goodison Park. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer shouts instructions to his players during the FA Cup game against Liverpool . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers  will be frustrated by his team's lacklustre performance on a frustrating afternoon . Amid all this, though, there was a more convincing penalty shout, Sturridge going down as Kilgallon sought to impede his run with an outstretched arm. It was the type of penalty appeal that generally tends to be ignored. Heaven knows why. The use of the arm by defenders is not in the rules. In the last ten minutes there were two more saves for Eastwood to make, one from substitute Mario Balotelli and one from Jordan Henderson. In all, Liverpool had 21 shots. That, however, suggests Liverpool were better than they actually were. There were some bright spots, such as the performance of Emre Can at the base of the midfield. The German has a superb passing range and it will be a surprise if he doesn’t develop in to a very good player. On this occasion, however, the glory was all Blackburn’s. They may have to be slightly more expansive when it comes to the replay in April but they deserved this draw and will relish 90 minutes against Liverpool at Ewood Park. By then Gerrard will expect to be back in the thick of it. If he wants to get to Wembley for his birthday FA Cup Final, he is going to have to do his bit.","Liverpool's Martin Skrtel was carried off on a stretcher early on after landing awkwardly .

"Andy Murray moved level with Tim Henman's British career-wins record after beating France's Adrian Mannarino in straight sets at Indian Wells. Murray eased past Mannarino 6-3, 6-3 in California to book a quarter-final match-up with Spain's Feliciano Lopez who edged past Japan's Kei Nishikori. The victory means Murray has now equalled Henman's 496 career wins, which represents an Open era record for a British man. Andy Murray celebrates as he seals his place in the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells . Murray plays a forehand on his way to a straight-sets victory against Frenchman Adrian Mannarino . Murray (right) pictured alongside Tim Henman ahead of their first meeting in Basel in October 2005 . Murray was made to work hard by Mannarino's aggressive ground strokes but the Frenchman was too inconsistent and Murray took full advantage. A double fault in Mannarino's first service game presented the world number four with a break point but Mannarino held his nerve on a high smash and sealed the game unscathed. The first break of the match arrived soon after but it was Mannarino who took it, as this time Murray's second serve went long to give his opponent a surprise 3-2 advantage. A superb forehand pass from Murray in the following game, however, seemed to jolt the Scot into life as he won the next three games in succession to lead 5-3. Mannarino continued to come on the offensive, pinning his opponent back with an aggressive forehand, but Murray was clinical on the counter-attack and sealed the first set in 45 minutes. The second began as tightly as the first as Mannarino halted Murray's momentum with two holds of serve and the world number 38 could have broken at 2-2 but squandered two break points. Mannarino allowed his frustration to get the better of him in the following game and a wild forehand wide gave Murray the decisive break and a 4-2 lead. With victory in sight, Murray showed no signs of letting up and another Mannarino unforced error at 5-3 allowed the Scot to convert a second match point and seal a convincing win.

Feliciano Lopez gives the Indian Wells crowd the thumbs up after beating Kei Nishikori to reach the last eight . Murray praised Mannarino after the match, admitting the 26-year-old had proven a difficult opponent. 'It was a very tough match, he's playing very well this year and he's got a very tricky game,' Murray told Sky Sports. 'He's a lefty but he has a very flat backhand and a short take-back on his forehand so it's hard to read. 'He moves well and he has good hands around the net - in both sets though he played one or two loose games which helped me and I stayed solid throughout. 'I was frustrated to get broken in the first set, I thought I started well but he came out firing. 'I tried to make a lot of balls and he didn't play a great game in the next game and that stopped his momentum. 'I started to feel more comfortable after that and went for my shots more.' On equalling Henman's record, Murray joked: 'That's one of the few records Tim still had over me. 'I wasn't actually aware of the record so that's nice. Hopefully I can get through the next round and get past him.'","Andy Murray beat Adrian Mannarino in the BNP Paribas Open fourth round .

De Boer said: 'The way they played against Monaco is the way we would like to play as well. High pressure, get the ball back very quickly. I really love the way Arsenal play.

"When Manuel Pellegrini was asked on Tuesday about Manchester City players not believing in their coach, he told the Spanish journalist asking the question that the same enquiry could easily have been made of Barcelona’s manager Luis Enrique just two months earlier. He was spot-on too. Back at the start of January Barca’s head coach sat ghost-like through press conferences – a condemned man after a fall-out with the one man at Barcelona you don’t fall-out with – Lionel Messi. Barcelona had just been beaten 1-0 by David Moyes' Real Sociedad, the president Josep Bartomeu had sacked sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and called elections for the end of the season. Lionel Messi's (left) fall out with manager Luis Enrique was the pinnacle of Barcelona's drama behind the scenes before the first game of the season . Enrique seemed a condemned man but, given his team's form, he's a happy man ahead of his side's Champions League second leg clash with Manchester City . Serve and protect: Neymar gives a serious salute next to the Barcelona logo in this Instagram post . And Javier Mascherano had gone on a one-man media mission to convince everyone that all talk of training ground bust-ups and sour air in the Barca dressing room was the product of reporters’ fertile imagination. It wasn’t. And off-message French defender Jeremy Mathieu admitted as such in an interview with French radio saying that Messi had indeed had a heated argument with Enrique in a training session before the first game of the year. Since that defeat by Real Sociedad, Barcelona have devoured all that has been put before them barring one slip against Malaga. Luis Suarez is still setting up team-mates as he was towards the end of last year but he is now in the kind of scoring form that saw him win the Golden Boot last season, and Messi has gone from being 12 goals behind Cristiano Ronaldo in the La Liga scoring stakes to two goals in front him. Real Sociedad celebrate their victory over Barcelona on January 4 that coincided with the sacking of sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and president Josep Bartomeu calling for elections for the end of the season . French defender Jeremy Mathieu (left) admitted Messi and Enrique had a heated argument during training . What happened? Player power is what happened. What most upset squad members at the start of the year is that three of their number – Dani Alves, Messi and Neymar – had been given permission to come back slightly later than the rest from the mid-winter break but were then left out of that first game of the new year because, according to Enrique, they had not trained sufficiently. The players had had enough of the mixed messages and of the constant changes in starting line-ups. And they made themselves heard. Suarez (left) and Messi (right) laugh during training on Tuesday ahead of their meeting with City . From that moment on Luis Enrique’s team changes were drastically reduced. He began to leave out one star-player at a time instead of making wholesale changes and with the emphasis now on the players to deliver because they had won their internal battle with the coach they began performing at a level not seen since Tito Vilanova was in charge two seasons before. There are still disagreements between coach and players. Suarez was unhappy about being taken off two weeks ago and at the weekend Neymar responded in the same way when he was taken off at Eibar. Neither would it be fair to say that Luis Enrique is now a puppet being made to dance solely to Messi’s tune. One of his strengths as a manager is that he gets the players fit and keeps them fit throughout the season, and Barca players look strong with 11 games left to play plus the Copa del Rey final. One of Enrique's strengths is keeping players fit and Barca's squad looks strong with 12 games left to play . The manager has loosened the reigns since January's blow up and his team is now difficult to stop . His assistant Juan Carlos Unzue should also be credited with the transformation in the way they take and defend corners. Barca had taken over 100 set plays at the start of the season without making a training ground routine render a single goal on the pitch. But all that has changed of late with ‘unusual’ suspects Jordi Alba and Messi both getting their heads to important corners – Alba with an assist and Messi scoring his first header from a corner in his Barcleona career. Luis Enrique has played his part in the revival but it’s also been a change in him that has seen Barça’s form transformed. It seemed he was trying too hard to put his stamp on the team towards the end of last year; trying to hard to show his multimillionaire players who was boss. Since January he has loosened the reigns – and in response his thoroughbred team have hit the front and will be difficult to stop.","Luis Enrique and Lionel Messi fell out on the training ground .

"Five pounds doesn't get you a lot these days. Barely a pint of beer, let alone a square meal. But those who parted with a fiver at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night were handsomely rewarded. For their admission money, they saw a quite brilliant FA Youth Cup semi-final. The academies of Chelsea and Tottenham boast some of the most-gifted teenage players in the country and how they delivered here - 90 minutes of end-to-end football and seven goals. And on the day Chancellor George Osborne promised the public would soon have a few more spare fivers in their wallets and declared Britain the 'comeback country' in his Budget, Chelsea were the 'comeback kids'. Chelsea Charlie Colkett scores from the penalty spot against Tottenham Hotspur . Chelsea: Collins; Aina, Tomori, Clarke-Salter, Dasilva; Sammut (Scott 77), Colkett (c), Boga (Musonda 71); Brown (Palmer 90+3), Abraham, Solanke . Subs not used: Thompson (GK); Grant . Scorers: Solanke 40, 51; Brown 44; Colkett 54, 71 (pen) Booked: Collins, Scott .

Scorer: Harrison 32, 83 (pen) Booked: Amos, Harrison . Referee: Graham Scott . Attendance: 3,666 . Trailing by two from the first leg at White Hart Lane, the defending champions were on the ropes when Shayon Harrison extended Tottenham's advantage with a spectacular opener. But thanks to doubles from Dominic Solanke and Charlie Colkett, plus another from Izzy Brown, Chelsea roared back to recover the deficit, offset Harrison's late reply, and reach a fourth consecutive final. And with talents such as this, they'll be in the black for many years to come. Manchester City are likely to be their opponents, they lead Leicester City 3-0 from the first leg. But, as was shown here on Wednesday night, that kind of lead can count for little. Somewhat bizarrely, Chelsea's head of youth development Neil Bath was formally presented with the Youth Cup trophy for last season's triumph by two FA suits in the press room ahead of the match. It was a very belated coronation, some 10 months after they edged Fulham in a rollercoaster final here. This game definitely had echoes of that memorable occasion. Dominic Solanke scores against Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge . Solanke scored either side of half-time as Chelsea fought back from 3-0 down in tie . But while Bath had another addition for the burgeoning academy trophy cabinet, Chelsea's grip on their crown had been loosened by Spurs in the first leg, goals from Josh Onomah and Kazaiah Sterling gave the north London a commanding lead at tie's midway point. And in the opening stages, the visitors looked the more likely to extend that advantage as long-range sighters from first Onomah and then Harrison forced goalkeeper Bradley Collins into evasive action. But as they had in the first leg, Chelsea soon began to dominate possession, largely reducing Spurs to a counter-attacking role. Jay Dasilva, the England under 17 international, was fleet-footed down the left, swapping lightning-quick passes with his colleagues and darting beyond Kyle Walker-Peters at every opportunity. Isaiah Brown rammed the ball home from close range for Chelsea's third goal . Brown's strike just before half-time put Chelsea level at 3-3 in the tie . His whipped crosses were causing a headache for Spurs keeper Harry Voss - one in the sixth minute was comically bundled into his own net under pressure from Tammy Abraham, the referee sparing his blushes. And another on the half-hour had to be acrobatically pushed to safety. But that agility was matched by the impressive Harrison moments later. When Zenon Stylianides hooked a half-cleared corner into the danger zone, the Spurs starlet watched the ball's flight like a hawk before pivoting and volleying it home left footed while falling backwards. It was a goal that had the Vine-makers reaching for their smartphones, rushing to share the moment on social media. Harrison appreciated his goal's importance in the context of the tie, Spurs now three goals to the good. Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori looks composed in possession . But we have learned never to write off any Chelsea team and, as half-time approached, they suddenly snapped out of the malaise and raised their game to another level. Five before the break, Solanke gave them hope of a comeback when he turned in Brown's accurate delivery from the right-side and the crowd was buzzing when Brown rammed the ball home from close range minutes later. It will have delighted those charged with nurturing a new generation of English talent to see those two names on the scoresheet. It also continued Solanke's marvellous run of scoring in every round of this season's Youth Cup, eight goals in total. Spurs were shell-shocked and simply couldn't stem the Blue waves at the start of the second period. Eight became nine when Solanke powered home a header to level the aggregate score on 51 minutes. Colkett celebrates his second goal and Chelsea's fifth during Youth Cup semi-final . And when the excellent Chelsea captain Colkett caught Voss dozing with a smart curling free-kick from 30 yards, they led for the first time after 144 minutes of the tie. The hosts were rampant though Spurs may have levelled things again when Charlie Owens fired against the post from a low Stylianides cross. Chelsea knew they would feel more secure with a fifth goal and it duly arrived when Anton Walkes clumsily clipped Aina inside the box. Colkett, who didn't put a foot wrong all night, coolly stroked home the penalty. But that security was short-lived. With eight minutes to play, Fikayo Tomori was adjudged to have handled on the floor as Harrison tried to weave his way to goal. The Spurs man ultimately found it from 12 yards but they couldn't get another to force extra time. Incredibly, this was the fourth time these two teams have met at under 18 standard in the past 19 days. Spurs must be well and truly sick of their blue-shirted foes.

Leading 2-1 from the last 16 first leg in Turin, the visiting side nullified Dortmund's attacking threat to leave Bayern Munich as the Bundesliga's only remaining side in the competition, with the final to be played in Berlin on June 6. It was Dortmund's fourth loss in four European games against Juventus. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri had promised his side wouldn't sit back despite the first leg advantage. His players stayed true to his word and Tevez got the visitors off the mark with an effort that stunned the home fans. Juventus then pushed high up the pitch and snuffing out Dortmund's response before it could even begin. The home side harried and fought, yet was unable to trouble Gianluigi Buffon in goal. The veteran goalkeeper reacted quickly to extinguish the danger with Marco Reus lurking in the 36th but it was a rare intervention. Midfield marshal Paul Pogba had gone off injured before that, prompting a period of Dortmund pressure. The visitors were the only ones who created chances however, with Vidal firing over. Fans made their frustration known in the first half, with confidence-hit midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan a particular target. There were more loud whistles at the break.

"The art of management is to create an aura, to brainwash the players into believing that they can routinely beat a team every bit as good as Barcelona. It is to inspire, to send Manchester City’s players into the tunnel at the Nou Camp in the minutes before kick-off and look down their noses at Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Luis Suarez or Neymar. Out on the training pitches, where the real work is done, the coaches must come up with a plan to squeeze the pips out of the players over two legs in the Champions League. That is the job. It can be done. Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp took his team to the Champions League final at Wembley against Bayern Munich; last year Atletico Madrid reached the final under their clever coach Diego Simeone. Unfortunately for Manuel Pellegrini, he has come up short. This is no disgrace and there is no need to make his life a misery just because he cannot find a way to beat Barcelona. He just isn’t good enough. Manuel Pellegrini has not taken Manchester City forward and looked clueless in the Nou Camp . Pellegrini could not alter the game or put the shackles on Barcelona as City's Euro dream died . Ivan Rakitic lifts the ball over the onrushing Joe Hart and into the empty net to give Barca the advantage . Read Martin Samuel's match report from the Nou Camp as Barcelona beat Manchester City 1-0 to progress to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League. The temptation, in the shakedown that will follow this Champions League elimination for yet another English club, is to start over again. In the aftermath the cry now will be to send for Simeone, to send for Pep, to send for Ancelotti, or to send for someone else to have a go. The brutal truth is that it’s coming to that. Bayern Munich’s exalted coach Pep Guardiola was here, settling down to watch his former club pass City off the park in a series of dizzying spells. Possession football is anathema to English football. City spilt their guts here, exposing the size of the task to turn the current champions of the Barclays Premier League into a team capable of living with a group of players who can change the pace of a game at will. Barcelona’s tempo is soothing and reassuring. If City want to dominate in Europe, in a way that Barcelona did when they won the Champions League in 2006, 2009 and 2011, then Pellegrini is not the man. That much is clear. Since he arrived at City he has had four chances to beat Barcelona and has yet to even secure a draw. Team and coach are not up to it. City need innovation, a man with stature and the confidence to redevelop the team with some clever signings over the next couple of years.

Messi attempts to dribble past Joe Hart as the Barca man shows his mastery once more . The Manchester City wall attempts to do its job as Messi fires in a free-kick . That dressing room isn’t right, it can’t be when a player of Yaya Toure’s supposed class can play as badly as this on a big night back at the Nou Camp. He gave up on his man Ivan Rakitic as he roamed into City’s penalty area and the ball inevitably needed up in the back of Joe Hart’s net. That aside, Hart was immense here. If this is to be a slow, painful death for Pellegrini, then the job is to breathe some life into this team for the final nine games of the league season. West Brom this weekend is some homecoming. They will need leadership in the run-in, something that was missing from the sidelines as Iniesta and Rakitic splayed the ball out to the wings for Neymar and Messi to slice their way through City’s defence. At times it was shambolic back there. When you come up against Messi, the three-time winner of the Ballon d’Or, it is down to the coach to come up with a specific tactic to stifle his impact. Here he set up the goal for Rakitic with a ball that had a golfer’s draw on it when it pinged off his left boot to meet the Barca midfielder’s run at the back post. The accuracy was frightening.

Sergio Aguero’s miss from the penalty spot in the 78th minute is no more than a footnote because City were outclassed over two legs. The main man in Abu Dhabi will demand answers, a natural consequence of another premature elimination in the Champions League. To Pellegrini’s great credit, he is always unmoved by the speculation about his future, but the ball is now in Sheik Mansour’s court. Sadly for a man of integrity and honour, he has lost his appeal.","At the elite level of European competition, Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has come up short.

"Chelsea continued their attack on Premier League referees after the club's official website published an article complaining that they have not been awarded enough penalties this season. The piece called 'penalty puzzle' analysed how many spot-kicks the Blues have been given in each of the last five years. The argument, that the number is 'abnormally low', echoes manager Jose Mourinho's view that there is a 'campaign' against the club. Chelsea were angered last weekend by referee Mike Dean's refusal to award Branislav Ivanovic a penalty . Referee Dean had some tough calls to make in Chelsea's draw with Southampton but made most correctly . Chelsea have been awarded five penalties in eight Champions League games, including against PSG . The 'penalty puzzle' article leads the way on Chelsea's official website . At Old Trafford in October defenders John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic were denied a spot kick despite being wrestled to the ground. Former Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas was tripped during Chelsea’s game against Southampton at St Mary’s Stadium, but instead he picked up a yellow card for diving. Jose Mourinho’s side appealed for a penalty against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, only for the north London side to get away with handling the ball in their own box. A blocked arm again denied the current Premier League leaders at home to Burnley despite the shot being clearly stopped by a raised arm. Ivanovic was again left perplexed last Sunday at Stamford Bridge when visitors Southampton got away with yet another clear penalty against the Blues. The article, with no byline, comes after Branislav Ivanovic was denied a penalty in last weekend's draw with Southampton, an incident the Chelsea website described as 'a clear spot-kick'. However, general consensus, as outlined by Sportsmail's Graham Poll, was that the contact on Ivanovic, while undoubtedly present, was too slight to spot with the naked eye. The article also notes that Chelsea have received five penalties in just eight Champions League games, which they cite as evidence that the 'campaign' is limited to Premier League officials. Mourinho has been vociferous in his criticism of officials all season, first suggesting there was a campaign against his team in December, before appearing on Sky Sports last month after a challenge by Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Nemanja Matic went unpunished. It is not the first time in recent weeks that the club's online team have sought to back up their manager's controversial view.

'I don't think they think that the project is ready. If you are eliminated, it is because we saw a very good Barcelona, better than our team, and not because we've seen a poor Manchester City team.' Speaking after the game, Pellegrini added: ‘Maybe it was not our best year to continue in Europe. 'We've had important restrictions about amount of players, amount of money that we can spend, so it was a difficult year for us.'","Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini feels the 'project' is not ready .

"Radamel Falcao’s miserable stint at Manchester United hit a new low on Tuesday night when he was dumped into the reserves by manager Louis van Gaal. Falcao has not played a minute for United’s first team since being dragged off in the home win over Sunderland last month and was left on the bench as Van Gaal’s team were knocked out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday night. Now the £250,000-a-week loan signing from Monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the Under 21s against Tottenham. He didn’t score and was taken off as it ended 1-1. Radamel Falcao was humiliated by being dumped in Manchester United's Under 21s team on Tuesday night . Louis van Gaal could be waving goodbye to Falcao in the summer after dropping him to the reserves . The Colombia striker’s demotion underlines Van Gaal’s concern over his fitness. The United manager usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury. Falcao has been injury-free since recovering from a thigh strain in November and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level when he is desperate to prove he is worth a permanent deal. Falcao did not manage to get on the scoresheet against Tottenham Hotspur's Under 21s and was poor . The £250,000-a-week loanee tries to escape from Tottenham's Gongani Khumalo (left) and Grant Ward (right) Having scored only four times in six months, Falcao’s chances of being retained in the summer are almost nil.

"After a six-month hiatus from golf over alleged cocaine and alcohol abuse, Dustin Johnson appears to be back on form. On Sunday the 30-year-old claimed victory at the elite World Golf Championships-Cadillac Championships in Miami, telling reporters that fatherhood was behind his improved focus. Following his win, Johnson was greeted at the 18th hole on the Trump National Doral course by his model fiancée Paulina Gretzky - daughter of former NHL great Wayne - and their son Tatum, who was born in January. The new parents shared a passionate kiss in front of cameras, while cradling their newborn between them. Gretzky described her husband-to-be as the 'best dad' and 'best friend' she could ever wish for. Scroll down for video . Passionate embrace: After claiming victory at the elite World Golf Championships-Cadillac Championships in Miami on Sunday, Dustin Johnson was greeted at the 18th hole by his family . Doting dad: He was overjoyed to see his model fiancée Paulina Gretzky - daughter of former NHL great Wayne - and their son Tatum, who was born in January . Perfect match: The new parents shared a passionate kiss in front of cameras, while cradling their newborn between them . She continued to ABC News: 'He's been so supportive with me and we're just there for each other. I couldn't be happier for him.' Talking about how fatherhood had changed his life for the better, Johnson added: 'It's hard to describe, but just from the first day he's born, your perspective on life completely changes. 'Things that were important aren't important anymore. 'It kind of makes life a lot easier I think, just because there's just one thing that's kind of all you think about. It definitely simplifies stuff.' When Johnson announced his decision to step away from golf last July due to 'personal challenges', rumors about his lifestyle swirled, including the suggestion that he may have been suspended by the PGA Tour. Indeed, Golf.com reported that Johnson had failed three drug tests: one for marijuana in 2009 and two for cocaine, in 2012 and 2014. Johnson celebrates with Donald Trump as he holds the Gene Sarazen Cup after winning the WGC-Cadillac Championship WGC at Trump National in Doral . Career success: Johnson turned professional as a golfer in late 2007 in his early twenties . However, the Tour - which had initially said it did not comment on rumors or speculation - released a statement saying Johnson had taken a voluntary leave of absence and had not been suspended. And in a news conference on Sunday when if he had ever failed a Tour drugs test, Johnson replied: 'No. Thanks'. In a candid interview with Sports Illustrated this January, Johnson revealed that alcohol was his real vice. He said he would excessively drink and party to relieve stress, with his tipple of choice being Grey Goose, soda and lime. In a bid to get clean, Johnson said he took time out from sport and concentrated on home life. Bundle of joy: Johnson's son Tatum Gretzky Johnson was born on January 19 . Changed man: The golfer says fatherhood has helped him to put his bad boy party days behind him . Love birds: Johnson proposed to Gretzky in August 2013 - as of now, there are no reports of where and when a wedding will take place. Commenting on his time out, he said: 'I got to spend a lot of time with Paulina and help her as much as I could through her pregnancy, and then the birth of our son. 'I really enjoyed being able to be home and not having to leave or do anything. 'I was in the gym every single day, every morning, and then spend the rest of the time either I would go practice a little bit or just hanging out with Paulina.' Johnson returned to the green in Febuary at the Farmers Insurance Open in Torrey Pines. As he won big on Sunday night, the two most important people in Johnson's life were waiting for him. He concluded: 'Paulina and Tatum were waiting for me when I got done. That was the best part of the day for sure.' 'My game is in good form. I feel really confident in my golf swing. I need to do some work with the putter and short game, especially leading into Augusta.' Johnson proposed to Gretzky in August 2013.

"Michael Schumacher's 15-year-old son has crashed while test driving a Formula 4 car at 100mph in east Germany. Mick Schumacher was racing through the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, when he skidded out of control and onto the gravel, it was reported. The young protege began karting seven years ago, and this year reached the German Formula 4 - the racing category used as a stepping stone by junior drivers. Michael Schumacher's 15-year-old son crashed while testing a Formula 4 car on a race track in east Germany . Mick Schumacher finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season . However, German newspaper Die Welt reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who is still recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races. Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4 earlier this month. At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. Michael Schumacher (pictured in 2000) is still recovering from a ski accident that left him with head injuries . He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend. Philippe Streiff, a former Formula 1 driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'. However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said. 'He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation.","Mick Schumacher crashed while testing a car on a race track in Germany .

Asked about his relationship with the City board, Pellegrini added: ‘It’s not about relationships. I could have a bad relationship with the owners but it’s about how you manage this project. ‘Every project can have difficult moments. You have the wrong opinion about the owners.

"The agony for Nottingham Forest is that there are only eight games left in their late pursuit of the play-offs. The ecstasy is Michail Antonio.

Booked: Smallwood, Arnason . Referee: Michael Bull . Attendance: 20,569 . His goal, as the interval approached, was a combination of his talents. Picking up the ball well inside his own half, he turned and galloped. He checked inside Jack Hunt, sped clear of Kari Arnason, cut across Farrend Rawson and unleashed a shot from 25 yards that flew into the bottom corner. There was an inevitability about it all. Eric Lichaj will be credited with the assist but in much the same way a tee might aid a 300-yard drive by Rory McIlroy. It was Antonio’s 13th goal of the season since a £1.5million move from Sheffield Wednesday. What a bit of business that now looks.

The striker crept behind Kirk Broadfoot and lobbed a finish that goalkeeper Adam Collin got a hand to but in vain. The result extends Freedman’s record to seven wins, two draws, and one defeat since taking over from Stuart Pearce. Brentford, in sixth, are eight points ahead. It seems just too much, but you never know. Rotherham are in a similar predicament at the other end. Steve Evans’ team sit six points above the drop zone. They mounted a challenge of sorts in the second half, and very nearly pulled one back when Lee Frecklington sent a sweet shot against the post.

Evans said: ‘It’s a cruel game, we were the better side in the first half for long spells.’ But the night belonged to Antonio. ‘Every team needs a bit of magic and certainly Michail gives us that,’ said Freedman. He added a thinly veiled call to neighbours Derby, who have not won in five games. ‘Of course the season is finishing too early but we need to make sure we take care of business and keep on winning,’ Freedman said. ‘It’s a fierce competition like I’ve never seen. Teams above us are really panicking. Certain teams that are not too far away from us location-wise.’ Antonio has scored 13 goals since his £1.5 million move from Sheffield Wednesday last summer .

But the Argentina had one of his better games for Manchester United and covered plenty of ground on the right wing. CLICK HERE for more brilliant stats and heat maps from Old Trafford. His United, though, the one that he knows, used to bully teams late in games. As his old manager Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted, United teams of yore used to practice scoring late goals in training. They won games like this by sheer force of will, belief and personality. This United team, on the other hand, the one with Van Gaal's uncertain hand on the tiller, stumbles its way in to opportunities. Somehow it manages to win despite itself. If it continues like this for another two months then it may yet find itself in the Champions League places come the season's end. At the moment, though, it is hard to see it. This, in many ways, was the modern United at their worst. Facing a home team devoid of purpose, energy and intelligence, United really should have taken hold of this game, won it comfortably and used it as a platform ahead of tougher challenges to come. Instead, they saw Newcastle miss two golden opportunities and wasted their own with inept work in front of goal. The home team, meanwhile, were somehow denied a clear early penalty by a referee that we can only presume – generously – was unsighted. And then there was the winning goal. A gift. A shambles. Three points handed to United on a black and white tray. There was no late cavalry charge by United here. They had settled for a point. The game was drifting towards a conclusion that had seemed inevitable for so long. But then Wayne Rooney's run in to the penalty area was halted by Mehdi Abeid, the subsequent back pass sold goalkeeper Tim Krul short and when the clearance – born of panic and terror – landed at the feet of Ashley Young, the goal waited – empty – just ten yards away. Marouane Fellaini came close to scoring for Manchester United but he was denied by a brilliant stop from Tim Krul . Ashley Young had a chance to convert the rebound but took too long and was also denied by Newcastle's Dutch goalkeeper . Angel di Maria was replaced early in the second half by Adnan Januzaj as United struggled to break down a stubborn Newcastle side . Wayne Rooney has scored more Premier League goals against Newcastle than any other club, although he failed to add to his tally of 12 on Wednesday night. It was an astonishing moment. This great stadium has witnessed plenty of drama over the years and no little pantomime. It hasn't witnessed much like this, though. In the home dugout, manager John Carver stood aghast. This was some way to lose a football match and it was hard not to feel some sympathy for him. His team had been pretty lousy but they didn't deserve to lose. His thoughts understandably were still with the early penalty shout, somehow denied him when Chris Smalling hacked down Emmanuel Riviere in the eleventh minute. 'That would have set us up nicely,' he said. Had Newcastle scored first then it’s questionable whether United would have had it in them to respond. As it was, nothing much else happened in the first half, apart from what may have been an unpleasant exchange of saliva between Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse. Rooney, playing as a lone centre forward, missed two chances around the half hour mark, clipping one wide when face to face with Krul and then falling over when a slip by Fabricio Coloccini presented him with another sight of goal. There was not a shot on target from either team, however, until Marouane Fellaini’s header required Krul to parry in the 44th minute. Newcastle were poor enough to allow United the majority of the possession but Van Gaal’s team, not unusually, didn’t have the wit to do much with it. Emmanuel Riviere ghosted in at the post but could not force the ball beyond United's goalkeeper Dave de Gea . De Gea made himself wide in the United goal to deny Newcastle the opener at St James' Park . Pappis Cisse has words with Jonny Evans after the pair appeared to spit at each other during a heated exchange in the first half . Cisse wipes his eye after he and Evans were later shown to have spat at each other during an unsavoury incident . Evans appears to spit on Cisse (left) before the Newcastle striker returns the favour (right) as tempers flared before half time . On the right, Angel di Maria was having a decent game, relatively speaking. His night was ended on the hour, though, when Van Gaal replaced him with Adnan Januzaj. It seemed an odd move and Di Maria looked less than chuffed. At least by then the game was a little more alive. Riviere brought a save from David de Gea after Coloccini headed down a free-kick while at the other end Krul saved brilliantly from a Fellaini half-volley and a Young follow-up that perhaps took a little too long to arrive. At last there was an atmosphere inside this great stadium and things improved further when Jonas Gutierrez entered as a substitute. His first appearance since recovering from testicular cancer, it was soon marked by a booking but nobody really cared about. It was good to see him. Soon Newcastle could have had a goal. A break from another substitute Ayoze Perez found him and Cisse two-on-one with Evans but the pass from one team-mate to another was criminally over hit and, as such, the chance disappeared. Perhaps that summed up the night for both teams. Just not good enough. In sport, though, mistakes often decide contests and so it was here. Krul won a game all on his own for Van Gaal with his penalty shoot-out heroics against Costa Rica during last summer’s World Cup. Here, he did it again in rather different circumstances.

"We have been here before, of course — a breathless Liverpool win over Manchester City secured by the brilliant right foot of Philippe Coutinho. That was last April and we all know what happened next. This time, the Liverpool charge is locked on a different target. Last season, despite their slaying of City at Anfield, they could not secure the Barclays Premier League title and it remains to be seen if this tilt at the top four ends more happily.

Click here to check out our brilliant Match Zone for pitch maps, heat maps and all the stats from the Anfield side's crucial victory. No doubt feeling Thursday night’s Europa League exit in their minds and legs, Brendan Rodgers’ team faced a fresher City side hungry to close the gap on Chelsea at the top. Still, though, Liverpool won, still they managed to take another step towards hauling in Manchester United and Arsenal in the places above them. This really was a remarkable effort, perhaps one of the most significant of Rodgers’ reign. For City, questions remain. Manager Manuel Pellegrini still cannot find a way to secure the centre of the field in games such as this. Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher described City’s lack of control in that area as ‘embarrassing’. That may be overstating it but City continue to be undone the same way in too many big games. Last season they got away with it but this time round they may not. Having said that, it took a heck of a goal to win this. Coutinho was the game’s star player. Rarely has Pablo Zabaleta on the City right had such an uncomfortable time. The goal, though, was something else. A right-foot shot from the angle of the box, it was so perfect in angle and trajectory that Joe Hart, though he had plenty of time to see it, had absolutely no chance of stopping it. It came out of nothing. The game had fallen into a fallow period with 15 minutes to go. Pellegrini had sent on an extra midfield player in an attempt to close the game down and a contest that had been open for an hour had become scratchy. Perhaps Coutinho sensed the mood. That is what the best players do. Perhaps he knew that if he didn’t take the occasion by the lapels and shake two extra points from it, nobody else would. He had been a pest earlier, too. City had started the brighter of the sides and could have taken the lead when Yaya Toure chipped a cute ball over the top for Zabaleta to volley over. Jordan Henderson continues to impress in the Liverpool midfield and he curled home the opening goal against Manchester City . Henderson's shot flies towards Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart who attempts to position himself to make the save . Hart attempts to fling his right hand across his body to stop the shot but must realise Henderson's effort will evade his grasp . Henderson is mobbed by his Liverpool team-mates and Anfield boss Brendan Rodgers after his effort beat Hart all ends up . Ten minutes in, though, Liverpool suddenly clicked and Coutinho was at the heart of it. First he played Adam Lallana through a gaping hole between Vincent Kompany and Eliaquim Mangala, only for the midfielder to shoot weakly at Hart. Then, moments later, Lallana lashed the ball into the net from an angle, only to be ruled offside. Pressure was mounting and it wasn’t long before Liverpool were ahead. Fernandinho sold Kompany short with a pass in midfield and when the Belgian could not catch Coutinho, the ball was funnelled forwards to Jordan Henderson. The England man moved the ball out of his feet and curled it past Hart with his right instep from 20 yards. It was a lovely goal and the celebrations by the Liverpool bench said everything for its importance. For a while, Liverpool were at their waspish best and, as a result, City rocked. Liverpool were not in front for long as Edin Dzeko finished off a delightful team passing move to bring parity to the Anfield clash . Dzeko celebrates his strike with his team-mates who played an instrumental part in the build up to Manchester City's equaliser . Seregio Aguero fires in a shot under pressure from Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana as both sides looked to edge in front . Sergio Aguero did race through to strike a post but at the other end Alberto Moreno wasted one chance and Raheem Sterling — once again playing as a centre forward — ran on to a Coutinho pass to mug Toure and slide a cross-shot wide. At 1-0, Liverpool were in the ascendancy. City, though, looked dangerous when they moved forwards and after Coutinho had erred for once by presenting a clearance to Zabaleta in the 26th minute, the visitors moved through the gears, enabling Edin Dzeko to run on to Aguero’s neat through pass and beat Simon Mignolet with his right foot. For a while, this was a contest that crackled with energy and attacking threat. Coutinho was Liverpool’s go-to man throughout while, for City, David Silva was equally dangerous. The Spaniard enjoyed himself at Anfield last season and was prominent once again here. Lallana screwed a chance wide late in the first half following Lazar Markovic’s lovely chip, while Aguero and Sterling missed opportunities at the start of the second period that they perhaps should have taken. Beyond Coutinho’s goal, City did raise themselves a little. Silva slashed a chance wide after a buccaneering Toure run while Aguero did likewise. At the Kop End, meanwhile, Sturridge ran clear but could not convert. At full-time, it felt a significant result. But, to repeat, we have been here before.

"A man faces court for allegedly flying  a drone over several Premier League football grounds as well as London landmarks including the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. Nigel Wilson of Nottingham, has been summoned in relation to 17 breaches of the Air Navigation Order, Scotland Yard said on Wednesday. All of the incidents reportedly took place last year – with 15 occurring in September and one each in October and December. Four of the football stadia-related charges refer to Liverpool's Anfield, three to Derby County’s Pride Park, two each to Leicester City’s King Power stadium and Nottingham Forest’s City ground, and one each to Manchester City’s Etihad stadium, Arsenal’s Emirates stadium and Stoke City’s Britannia ground. Nigel Wilson has been summoned for allegedly flying a drone over grounds including the Emirates (above) The north London derby  in September is understood to be one of the games that the drone was flown over . He is also alleged to have failed to maintain direct, unaided and visual contact with a drone at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: 'We can confirm that we have assisted the police in preparing this prosecution. 'There are clear rules and regulations in place regarding the flying of drones in the UK and it is the responsibility of users to spend time fully understanding what those rules are.' Drones, like the one pictured, are not allowed to be flown over gatherings of more than 1,000 people . The fixtures that Nigel Wilson is accused of flying a drone over are: . Liverpool v Aston Villa on September 13 at Anfield . Liverpool v Ludogorets on September 16 at Anfield . Nottingham Forest v Fulham on September 17 at the City Ground . Derby County v Reading on September 23 at Pride Park . Arsenal v Tottenham Hotspur on September 27 at the Emirates Stadium . Stoke City v Newcastle United on September 29 at the Britannia Stadium . Derby County v Bournemouth on September 30 at Pride Park . Leicester City v Liverpool on December 2 at the King Power Stadium . He will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday, April 16. The Civil Aviation Authority has previously issued a warning over the use of drones after footage was posted online. A CAA spokesman said: 'The rule is that you're not allowed to fly over large gatherings of people of 1,000 or more at any height. The suspect is accused of flying a drone over Premier League grounds including Anfield (above) the Etihad, the King Power Stadium and the Britannia Stadium . Steven Gerrard celebrates scoring against Leicester at the King Power Stadium in December, another game that Wilson allegedly flew a drone over . 'You're not allowed to go within 50 metres of a building or structure. It's not something that people can just do without permission for safety reasons. 'These [drones] can weigh up to seven or eight kilograms. They could create a bit of damage if they fall from 1,000 feet.' The CAA has already prosecuted two people over illegal drone flying. Wilson is also accused of flying near London landmarks including the Palace of Westminster (pictured) Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nigel Wilson has been accused of flying a drone over crowded areas .

"Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was left furious after his side were denied what he felt was a legitimate goal against Cardiff City on Tuesday night. Striker Callum Wilson stood with his back to goal as opposition goalkeeper Simon Moore attempted to take a goal kick during his side's clash with Cardiff City, only for Moore's clearance to hit the forward. The ball cannoned off the back of the number 13 before hitting the bar, and Wilson, who was signed by Howe from League One outfit Coventry City, then tapped the ball into the empty net. Callum Wilson is standing still outside of the box with his back to goal when the goalkeeper kicks the ball . Wilson and the fans celebrated, but referee Lee Mason was quick to disallow the goal and booked the 23-year-old Bournemouth top scorer, much to Howe's frustration. 'I've got to be very careful with what I say, we've been in a bit of trouble recently with officials,' Howe told BBC Radio Solent. Howe continued: 'Callum (Wilson) did that all night. He didn't move, didn't follow the keeper, he held his ground and by the laws of the game that is perfectly acceptable. It's a goal that should have stood.' Bournemouth striker Wilson just cannot believe his goal has been disallowed by referee Lee Mason . 'You'll have to ask the referee why the goal was not allowed, I don't think he had a particularly good game and that's an understatement. 'Callum was looking the other way, he stood his ground which is allowed and the goalkeeper has kicked it at his back. 'That's a real strange decision and ultimately it's cost us two points.'","Callum Wilson was denied a goal against Cardiff City by referee Lee Mason .

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has delivered a considerable snub to the BBC by turning down the opportunity to join a televised debate with his three challengers before the election in Zurich on May 29. Blatter was always expected to refuse the request, put to him in a letter from the BBC and Sky, for an hour-long debate with Prince Ali of Jordan, Luis Figo and Michael van Praag about their plans for leading FIFA. The event would have been hosted by top broadcasters from the two networks and given equal prominence to each candidate. FIFA president Sepp Blatter speaks to journalists after the IFAB meeting in Belfast last month . FIFA presidential hopeful Luis Figo takes notes during the CONMEBOL Ordinary Congress on March 4 . But rather than give a courteous answer by letter to the prominent TV stations, Blatter relayed the curt reply ‘thanks but no thanks’ via one of his flunkeys in a telephone call. This didn’t impress the BBC, who have been FIFA partners as World Cup rights-holders since proper live coverage started in 1966. Blatter’s three challengers replied by letter that they would be happy to participate. But the whole project depended on Blatter and he is not even prepared to outline his reasons for not taking part, let alone have his make-up applied for the TV cameras — in front of which he would have by far the most to lose. Far better for Blatter is to fast-track FIFA Goal Programme funding to African countries, where he enjoys mass voting support. Prince Ali of Jordan is pictured during a press conference in central London last month . Michael van Praag, also going for the FIFA presidency, poses for a photo in Schiphol earlier this month . Boxing promoter Barry McGuigan is in positive talks with ITV about super bantamweight Carl Frampton making his second world title defence on terrestrial TV. Frampton’s win over Chris Avalos in Belfast’s Odyssey Arena last month had far more impact because it was on free-to-air television. ITV say their plans for screening boxing are on a fight-by-fight basis. Carl Frampton is lifted up by trainer Shane McGuigan after defeating Chris Avalos in Belfast last month . The Premier League have caused plenty of angst for the FA by flexing their financial muscle during power battles. However the FA, who have the power of veto as the 21st shareholder in the PL, will not object to CEO Richard Scudamore becoming executive chairman and the governance statute changes that will trigger. Sport England, who fund grassroots sport, make no secret that they are hugely influenced by the participation findings of the Active People Survey when doling out cash. So it’s difficult to see how swimming, who shed 245,000 participants last year according to the latest APS figures, can avoid having funds diverted from the national governing body when the allocations are announced on Thursday.

UK Sport have conducted a widespread consultation on their policy of funding only sports with Olympic medal potential and showing zero tolerance to the rest. And it’s understood the outcome will be ‘business as usual’ on the road to Tokyo 2020 and beyond. The only real change will be more flexibility for team sports, where each medal gained involves a lot more personnel. Jim Rodwell, a breath of fresh air on the Football League board and FA International Committee as a former player, has made the surprising decision to switch from Notts County chief executive to League One rivals Scunthorpe. Although Scunthorpe have a wealthier backer in chairman Peter Swann, it doesn’t seem much of a promotion for the ambitious Rodwell.

"Fernando Alonso hailed a ‘great day’ as he returned to work at McLaren’s headquarters in Woking. The Spaniard missed the opening race of the season in Australia after he suffered concussion following an unexplained 134mph crash while testing at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona last month.

"Leeds United delivered a masterclass in smash and grab football as they were battered by Fulham but stole away from Craven Cottage with a resounding 3-0 victory. The game marked five years to the day Fulham beat Juventus 4-1 in the Europa League, arguably the greatest night in the club’s history. But defeat  left them only six points clear of relegation to League One. Sam Byram leaps highest to send Leeds United into the lead against Fulham at Craven Cottage . Byram beats his man as the Yorkshire side take the lead against Fulham in west London . Fulham: Bettinelli, Richards, Hutchinson, Turner, Stafylidis, Parker, Hoogland, Tunnicliffe, Ruiz (Kacaniklic 63), McCormack (Fofana 83), Smith. Subs Not Used: Kiraly, Bodurov, Woodrow, Rodallega, Kavanagh. Sent Off: Stafylidis (52). Booked: Stafylidis.

Booked: Sharp,Bamba. Goals: Byram 40,Bamba 48,Antenucci 88. Att: 19,200 . Ref: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). Manager Kit Symons, who was a coach at Fulham in 2010 in that memorable night, was aware of the anniversary. ‘That’s football,’ was all he could summon about their fall, adding: ‘We had 27 shots altogether, I’m incredibly frustrated. ‘I thought we were excellent first half, created numerous chances and didn't take them. I’ve been in and around football for a long time, often there’s sucker punch if you don't take chances. ‘We need three wins to stay up, it’s down to us to go get them. We probably had enough chances to win three games here.’ Twice the home side’s defence fell apart either side of half-time to allow Sam Byram and Sol Bamba to head Leeds ahead. Fulham went down to 10 men and still managed to outplay their opponents, until substitute Mirco Antenucci made it three late on. It was inexplicable that Fulham were not in front before Leeds took the lead, five minutes before the break. Ross McCormack and Matt Smith, facing their former club, raced through early on but could not convert. Bryan Ruiz almost caught out Leeds goalkeeper Marco Silvestri with a 35-yard lob, but he tipped over, then hit the crossbar from a corner. But out of nowhere, Leeds scored when Gaetano Berardi crossed for Byram to head in completely unmarked and by seven minutes into the second half the home team completely capitulated. On 48 minutes Leeds went two ahead, an Alex Mowatt corner bouncing all the way through Fulham’s box to allow defender Bamba to head in at the back post. Then left-back Konstantinos Stafylidis was sent off for two yellow cards within 45 seconds of each other to end any hope of a comeback. Sol Bamba doubles the travelling side's lead as he heads past Marcus Bettinelli in the Fulham goal . Leeds United's Bamba celebrates scoring his side's second goal of the game with teammate Billy Sharp . Symons said: ’It was ridiculous getting the second so soon after the first. He dived in right in front of the Leeds fans for the second. It seemed the ref was moving on, but someone was in his ear then he changed his mind and went for the second yellow. It was rash and petulant.’ Fulham continued to dominate, despite having a man less, until the 88th minute when Antenucci scored with a first-time shot. Leeds manager Neil Redfearn said: ’Our lot got a bollocking at half time, I thought we were off the pace. We worked it out and toughed it out.

"The Queen gleamed in a tailored apple green silk dress and matching jacket as she mingled with sporting greats at a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust event tonight. She was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh as they met famous names such as Dame Mary Peters, who won gold in the pentathlon in the 1972 Olympics, and paralympian Baroness Grey-Thompson. The Trust was set up in 1965 as the legendary wartime Prime Minister's living legacy. Her Majesty meets Tanni Grey-Thompson at Winston Churchill Trust 50th anniversary event . Prince Philip holds a medallion . Since then, more than 5,000 British citizens have been awarded fellowships by the Trust, from more than 100,000 applicants, to travel overseas to study areas of topical and personal interest. The Queen, wearing a Karl Ludwig dress and jacket in green silk with a woven geometric pattern, was given a medallion bearing the photographer Yousuf Karsh's image of Churchill. She showed the medallion to Prince Philip and the pair both studied it with interest. Fellows from every decade since 1965 represented the trust at the event. Both Baroness Grey-Thompson and Dame Mary Peters had fellowships from the trust. The female athletes explained what the sporting trust had done for their careers. Dame Mary said after meeting the royal couple: 'I used the fellowship to help me train for the Olympics in 1972. I was in Belfast, it was the height of the Troubles, and I didn't have a running track. The Queen meets Dame Mary Peters at Buckingham Palace bash to honour Britain's sporting greats . 'The fellowship gave me the opportunity to go to Pasadena in California to train for six weeks. 'There was sunshine every day, I had the most amazing time training in May and June, and was successful in Munich in the September.' Baroness Grey-Thompson said: 'My fellowship was in 1993. I went to Perth in Australia to look at their methods of identifying talent, and although those methods are very good, it was useful for me to realise that they would not work here because their weather is so much better and they have a smaller population. 'That was useful for me to know when I joined the board of UK Sport in 1997.' At the time of her visit to Australia, she had competed in two of her five paralympics, collecting four of her 11 golds.

"Per Mertesacker had to admit that the prospect of ever winning the European Cup was a distant dream for Arsenal as they came to terms with another early exit. Arsenal won 2-0 in Monaco on Tuesday but lost the first leg 3-1 in London and went out on away goals. Arsene Wenger was downbeat and introspective after the game as he tried to sum up the disappointment of a fifth successive campaign ending in the first knockout round. The Arsenal boss claimed flippantly that it might be better to finish third in the group and drop into the Europa League than keep losing in the last 16. His captain was equally sombre when asked how far this team was from seriously competing for the top prize.

Mertesacker (left) is brought down to the ground after a challenge by Monaco's Fabinho . ‘Far,’ said Mertesacker. ‘Monaco were very under-estimated. But they deserved it by playing well in the first leg. We had one bad game and that was enough to get knocked out. We were missing some good fortune but we didn’t deserve it because we played so poorly in the first leg. ‘It’s difficult after such a good performance to look back and think that in the first game we missed that mental level you need to compete at the highest level. You can see how good we are as a team and how well organised we can be. We need to consider that every single day in training and in games. That’s why we are so far away.’ Wenger said: ‘Maybe it would be better not to pass the group phase and play the Europa League than to be eliminated in the last 16. We would have more chances to win a title.’ Santi Cazorla (right) looks dejected after the match as Monaco players celebrate progression . Prince Albert II of Monaco (centre) is among those celebrating on a joyous night at Stade Louis II .

Wenger’s team have won 13 of their last 15 games and are third in the Barclays Premier League. Aaron Ramsey thinks they can catch Manchester City and finish even higher. ‘The top two is within our grasp,’ said Ramsey. ‘It’s only one point and anything can happen. We still have the FA Cup to go... we’re still on for a successful season. ‘We’re more than capable of beating anyone and it’s a case of being more wise over two games in Europe.

"Alastair Cook is not the sort to wash his dirty linen in public so for the England Test captain to launch a barely concealed attack on Tuesday on the management who sacked him before the World Cup is little short of astonishing. Cook's words in Abu Dhabi, where he will play for MCC against Yorkshire on Sunday, will send shockwaves through an England hierarchy desperate to pick up the pieces from their disastrous World Cup when they go to the Caribbean next month. Not least, they will concern under-pressure coach Peter Moores, who insisted in Australia that Cook was 'over' his World Cup omission but who must now wonder if his relationship with his Test captain is seriously damaged. Former England one-day captain Alastair Cook was removed from his post in December last year . England endured a disappointing World Cup campaign and were eliminated at the group stage . Batsmen: . (Player, Age, Tests, County) Alastair Cook, 30, 109, Essex . Jonny Bairstow, 25, 14, Yorkshire . Gary Ballance, 25, 8, Yorkshire . Ian Bell, 32, 105, Warwickshire . Jos Buttler, 24, 3, Lancashire .

Cook made no attempt to hide the hurt he has felt back home on his Buckinghamshire farm while England floundered so badly under his replacement Eoin Morgan that they could not even make the last eight. 'I think you saw in Australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to a tournament,' said Cook of his sacking on the brink of the World Cup. 'I don't know what's gone on over there, and I can only speak from watching a little bit from afar, but it did look like the lads were shell-shocked from the first two games. That's when you need real leadership to steer you through that. 'I can't speak about what's gone on in depth but you always back yourself and I would have loved to have had the opportunity that was taken from me. The selectors made that decision because they thought it was best for English cricket. Hindsight has probably proved them wrong but now it's easy to say that. 'Whether I would have made a difference I don't know, but I was confident we would get out of the group. From there you just have to win three games in a row — that's how this World Cup has worked.' Ouch. What a mess England find themselves in. They made decent progress in Test cricket last summer but that has been virtually invalidated by the crushing inadequacy of the World Cup squad — and Cook knows it. Cook believes hindsight has proved the ECB wrong to remove him as captain before the tournament . 'The Test team was in a good place,' said Cook. 'I wouldn't say all the confidence has gone but a hell of a lot of it has. It's a different format but all teams are grouped under the same English umbrella and we can't be naive enough to think that they're not. 'We have a repair job to do and the only way of doing that is by playing some good cricket and starting to win. We built that momentum a little bit after the Ashes 14 or 15 months ago with a younger side, including the likes of Joe Root and Gary Ballance. 'There was a feelgood factor about the English game in the middle of August after the Tests. Since then it's been tough going. We've got to rebuild again.' Cook (right) feels England have to rebuild the feelgood factor that followed Test success against India . Cook (left) will lead England in three Tests in the West Indies in April, before New Zealand visit in May . Cook feels the ECB have highlighted the perils of changing captain so close to an international tournament . Eoin Morgan's England captaincy came under particular scrutiny during the poor World Cup performance . Cook did not mention Morgan by name but there is little doubt that he proved a desperate disappointment as England's one-day replacement captain. Not only was he unable to regain the form that has largely deserted him over the past year but Morgan was not the adventurous tactician many imagined him to be. The Irishman also spoke such gibberish in public that he ended up saying he had 'no regrets' over the worst World Cup in England's history. Whether he retains the one-day leadership remains to be seen but he has done himself few favours by insisting he will miss England's next one-day international against his native Ireland in Dublin so that he can play in the Indian Premier League. Cook may not have been able to arrest his own slump in form before the World Cup but history will now say that England did not improve by ditching him after backing him as one-day captain for three and a half years. Now attention is back on Cook for a three-Test tour of the West Indies next month that is crucial if Moores — along with managing director Paul Downton and national selector James Whitaker — are to keep their jobs until this summer's Ashes. At least Cook had some encouragement for the coach. 'There's pressure on him,' said Cook. 'There's pressure on all of us. All I can say is that I've really enjoyed working with Peter. He's a fantastic coach who just needs a bit of luck. I hope he gets the opportunity to stay and turn things around.' Moores will get that chance in the Caribbean unless new chairman Colin Graves and new chief executive Tom Harrison swing the axe in their first weeks in office. They will probably give all involved a little longer but patience is short and now England know that they also have a disaffected Test leader despite investing so much in him. It is a sorry state of affairs and one that can only be transformed by good results. And quickly.

"Gareth Bale should stay at Real Madrid and forget about returning to the Premier League says his international manager Chris Coleman. Bale's future has been the subject of much debate since Real fans began booing the world's most expensive player at the Bernabeu, while the Madrid media have accused him of being 'lazy' and a 'ball hog' in trying to shoot for goal rather than pass to colleagues. Team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has also shown his displeasure over the Welshman's supposed selfishness and the Portuguese forward reacted petulantly when Bale scored last weekend - his double in a 2-0 win over Levante as he netted his first goals in 10 games. Gareth Bale covers his ears as he celebrates his goal for Real Madrid against Levante on Sunday . Bale charges forward with the ball past Levante's Tono Garcia during Sunday's La Liga clash . Bale responded to his first goal by covering his ears with his hands - seen as a sign that he was not listening to the criticism - and kicking the corner flag, and it has led to fevered speculation that he could return home to the Barclays Premier League this summer. Jose Mourinho's Chelsea have been linked with bringing the former Tottenham player back to London and it has been suggested that Manchester United could swap him for their Madrid-born goalkeeper David de Gea. But Wales manager Coleman said: 'He should stay where he is. 'Chelsea are a huge club and have been successful as are Manchester United - but Real Madrid is Real Madrid. 'Gareth's good enough to win the big trophies, play on the big stage and play with the biggest club. Bale kicks the corner flag as he celebrates his goal at the Santiago Bernabeu . 'It is different from Manchester United or Chelsea because while there is pressure on them to perform in every game, at Madrid it is almost like a show and there has to be entertainment. 'You have to be one of the best to play for them and, in my opinion, Gareth is good enough to win trophies and entertain at Real Madrid at the highest level.' Despite Bale's difficult start to 2015, Coleman insists his talismanic forward is in good spirits ahead of Wales' table-topping Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel on Saturday week. Surprise front-runners Israel have won their opening three matches but Wales are unbeaten after four games and have taken points off the top two seeds, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Belgium. 'I spoke to his agent three days ago, he is absolutely fine and there are no problems,' Coleman said. Wales manager Chris Coleman has urged Bale to stay at Real Madrid and forget a Premier League return . 'Baley is the most expensive player in the world and there is politics to all this. 'He's been caught up in a bit of a storm but, knowing Gareth as I do, I'd be really surprised if he said, 'I've had enough, I'm not accepting that and I'm coming home'. 'Everyone has good and bad periods and you just have to get through it and, saying that, he scored a couple of goals at the weekend.' But Coleman admits that he has been taken aback by nature of the criticism aimed at the 25-year-old from Cardiff . 'It's just not people venting their anger. some of the attacks have been quite personal,' Coleman said. 'You can't say Madrid have lost two or three games because of Gareth. VIDEO Bale double silences critics . Bale falls down during the match between Real Madrid and Levante in the Spanish capital on Sunday . 'That's not the truth, but he has been personally attacked. 'I don't know what the future will be for him, but all I can say is when he comes with us then it's not a problem. 'He works hard for us and fits into the system whether we play him down the middle or wide, as a nine or a 10. 'We may go to Haifa next week and he has a bad game, but he can still score us a goal that will win us the game out of nothing. 'The pressure is on but he has shown he can handle that in big games.

"The Dallas Cowboys have taken a punt on Greg Hardy, who has agreed on a one-year deal which could be worth up to $13.1million. At 26, the aggressive pass rusher is in his prime but missed all but one game last season after being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt List following a conviction for assaulting his then partner. He remains on the exempt list  until the NFL has finished it own investigation, with reports saying he could miss the first six games of the 2015 season. Nicknamed The Kraken, Greg Hardy is a fearsome pass rusher but is tainted by off-field issues . Hardy leaves Mecklenburg County jail after being released on bond in Charlotte in May last year . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Seattle Seahawks were said to be interested in Hardy, but both dropped out of a move. 'At the end of the day, we didn't feel good about it,' Bucs general manager Jason Licht told the Tampa Bay Times. The deal with Dallas is heavily incentive-driven and was first revealed by NFL insider Ian Rapoport. The Carolina Panthers put the franchise tag on Hardy in February 2014, guaranteeing him $13.1. He was arrested and charged on May 13 with assaulting and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend Nicole Holder. Hardy was found guilty on July 15 by a Mecklenburg County judge, but on appeal to a jury trial (a quirk of North Carolina law), charges were dropped when Holder refused to co-operate with the prosecutor. In purely football terms, the Cowboys have strengthened a position of need. Last season, the Cowboys defense mustered 28 sacks last season. During his 2013 season, defensive end Hardy made the Pro Bowl and recorded 15 sacks; in 2012 he had 11 and adds an extra dimension to Rod Marinelli's 4-3 scheme.","The 26-year-old defensive end joins on an incentive-laden one-year deal .

'My sparring partners gave me good work today. They were perfect for testing the strategy Freddie and I have developed to beat Floyd Mayweather. I was very happy with my stamina and speed today.'","Gennady Golovkin pictured with Manny Pacquiao in California .

"Manuel Pellegrini admitted Manchester City had been outclassed by Lionel Messi after they crashed out of the Champions League against Barcelona. Ivan Rakitic’s 31st-minute strike was enough to secure a 1-0 victory and ease Barcelona into the quarter-final of the European Cup with a 3-1 aggregate win. Sergio Aguero had a penalty saved in the 78th minute, but the reality is that Barcelona threatened to humiliate the Barclays Premier League champions. Ivan Rakitic scores the only goal of the game as Barcelona progress against Manchester City . Rakitic is mobbed by his Barcelona team-mates after his 31st-minute strike in the second leg . Javier Mascherano leads the celebrations as Sergio Aguero reflects on an early European bath for City . Pellegrini, who admitted that talks will take place on his future at the end of the season, said: ‘Messi was imperious - at the moment we have to accept Barcelona are better. ‘It is not a failure, it is a disappointment. We have been unlucky to play Barcelona for two years in a row. We have had a restriction on the number of players we can use in the Champions League.' 'It is very difficult to beat Barcelona, but the statistics I don’t care about. ‘We cannot analyse what we will do next season because it is too soon after this result. We can do that later. ‘It is not easy to play Barcelona. This is the draw, they are very strong. At least we have improved.’ Pellegrini has been beaten four times by Barcelona since becoming City manager and he now has nine games to save his job at the Etihad Stadium. VIDEO Pellegrini disappointed after Champions League exit . Manuel Pellegrini has been beaten four times by Barcelona since becoming Manchester City manager . The City chief claims the heavy Christmas fixture schedule is the reason behind the failure of a single English team to reach the quarter-final of the competition. Pellegrini added: ‘It is difficult to analyse because the Premier League is strong, with money and very good players. ‘We play so many games in December and January and we are not fresh in February. In Spain, Italy and Germany they stop playing. Last year we played nine games in December and nine in January, and that was before we played Barcelona.' City keeper Joe Hart was easily their best player and it was his immense contribution that prevented Barcelona adding to Rakitic's opener. Hart, who saved Lionel Messi's penalty in the first leg, said: 'We've gone out to a magnificent side, but that's the second time in two years which is disappointing for us. 'They're going to get a lot of plaudits for how they play, they've got fantastic players, but we had a big chance, we hung on in there and we had a big chance but unfortunately we couldn't take it. 'I suppose you could say they had a chance to finish us off in the first game and they didn't take it but that's how football goes.' Hart made a string of impressive saves, especially in the second half, and midfielder James Milner was full of praise for his team-mate's performance. 'There are not too many words you can say,' Milner said. 'It's incredible really. Joe Hart was in inspired form against Barcelona, pictured here saving from man-of-the-moment Messi . The Manchester City and England No 1 foils Messi to prevent the striker from doubling Barcelona's lead . Messi pays tribute to Hart at the final whistle following his heroic display in the Manchester City goal . 'He's showed again what a great keeper he is and it's not the first time he's done that for us in Europe. He gave us that chance with the penalty (in the first leg). They could have been out of sight by then and he gave us a chance to still be in it. 'He was amazing tonight and deserves everything that gets said about him.' Hart added: 'It was busy. I just tried to smother them as best I could because I know full well they're thinking they've got to pass at all times. 'I tried to rush him for the goal, I thought he took it well. From there my job is to rush them, with quality players it's difficult to do sometimes, and I got a bit of luck on my side. 'I don't know how Neymar's stayed out in the first minute but that's football. We did our best to stay in it and were just unfortunate tonight.'","Manuel Pellegrini said Manchester City had been outclassed by Barcelona .

"Two Belgian companies have joined forces to create one of the world's most a unique aircraft: a plane featuring childhood animated favourite, Tintin. The cartoon, developed by Belgian artist Hergé, provided the inspiration for this one of a kind Airbus A320. Together, Brussels Airlines and Moulinsart had been working on this secret project for several months. Wife of Hergé, Fanny Rodwell, was on hand for the unveiling of a plane based on her husband's cartoon, Tintin . Two Belgian companies, Brussels Airlines and Moulinsart, came together for the bespoke aircraft design . Based on Professor Calculus' shark submarine from the adventure series, the long black shark aircraft was bapitised 'Rackham.' On the side of the fuselage, it reads: 'We fly you to the home of Tintin.' Tintin, who travels the world on his adventurous quests, is a natural travel partner for Brussels Airlines, who has also partnered with many other Belgian talents, such as the national football team and the country's largest music festival. The final design was based on Professor Calculus' shark submarine from the adventure series . The long black shark aircraft, baptised the 'Rackham,' has a side that reads: 'We fly you to the home of Tintin' The Airbus A320 took several months to create and was done entirely in secret . For the painting of the aircraft, Brussels Airlines hired plane paint artist Andre Eisele, who had to adapt the perspective of the drawings to the unusual curves of a plane. Eisele was also tasked with getting the aircraft looking as close to the original shark submarine design as possible. The entire paint job took 1500 hours in total. 'This aircraft is a dream come true,' Nick Rodwell, Director of Moulinsart, said. 'The partnership with Brussels Airlines is a perfect marriage for us.' The total paint job took 1500 hours in total to complete, under the hand of artist Andre Eisele . One of Eisele's biggest challenges was adapting the perspective to the unusual curves of a plane . The creators call Tintin and Brussels Airlines a 'perfect marriage' as both are passionate about adventure . 'Tintin is all about Belgium, all about Brussels, where he was born, as was Hergé. Tintin is also all about adventure and travelling, and with this plane we bring our two worlds together perfectly.' Following its unveiling, Rackham's maiden voyage took place: an hour and 45 minute flight to Toulouse. The aircraft will remain in use until 2019.","Brussels Airlines has teamed with Moulinsart for a unique aircraft design .

"On a scrap of paper at Selhurst Park last March, Jose Mourinho scribbled down the one word lacking from his Chelsea team after they had been beaten by Crystal Palace. At Upton Park, Mourinho’s side showed ‘balls’ of steel, surviving a difficult game against one of those teams — and at one of those grounds — where anything can happen. Chelsea have the mentality of champions. Their celebrations at Wembley on Sunday told a story, linking arms and sliding to their knees in front of their supporters after they had beaten Tottenham 2-0 in the Capital One Cup final. Cesar Azpilicueta, John Terry and Ramires leave the Upton Park pitch after another victory for Chelsea . Jose Mourinho won the first trophy of his second stint at Chelsea and few would bet against him adding the title . Chelsea celebrate their Capital One Cup trophy win at Wembley and maintained their five-point lead . There have been markers at key stages of the season: a 2-0 win over Arsenal in October, 2-1 at Liverpool the following month and their stunning performance in the 5-0 win at Swansea in January. This 1-0 victory at West Ham was another. Chelsea’s bond is strong, building this resilience in the dressing room as the season has progressed. They looked impenetrable, especially in the closing stages as West Ham pushed for an equaliser. Their work-rate is phenomenal, a team fighting for each other as they close in on their first Barclays Premier League title since Mourinho returned to the club. He described himself as a kid after he ambushed the trophy celebrations on Sunday, but it is on nights like this when the big boys go to work. Look around the Chelsea dressing room and it will be difficult to separate some of these players when it comes to voting for the PFA Player of the Year in a few weeks’ time. John Terry, exceptional against Tottenham at Wembley, must be in with a shout. Incredible as it sounds, he last won it in 2005. Thibaut Courtois, returning in goal in place of Petr Cech, was exceptional. His first-half save from Diafra Sakho was top class. He oozes confidence, taking responsibility as the last line of defence after Terry’s early booking for a foul on Cheikhou Kouyate. The doubts that crept in after a rare mistake in the 1-1 draw against Manchester City in January have been eradicated. Mourinho has made the right call to make him first choice. Thibaut Courtois was again exceptional and could make it back-to-back titles after winning La Liga last year . Cesc Fabregas probes into West Ham territory with Enner Valencia and Mark Noble close by . Cesc Fabregas, what with those 15 assists in the league since his move last summer from Barcelona, will also be in the running. Then there is last season’s Young Player of the Year Eden Hazard, the tormentor-in-chief down Chelsea’s left last night. He scored with a clever header from a cross by Ramires in the 22nd minute to secure his side’s 19th league victory of the season. Sometimes he leaves you drooling. His composure on the ball, coupled with that ability to be able to run with it when he is looking at the options around him, are made to look like pure instinct. Some of the twists and turns, creating space by leaving Carl Jenkinson and James Collins wrong-footed, were of the highest order. So what has changed since last season, when they gifted Manchester City their second Premier League title with a series of faltering performances? They have the bottle for the big occasion now. At Wembley last Sunday, Mourinho turned to a television camera and squirted water all over the lens after Terry had opened the scoring for Chelsea. Here they washed West Ham’s faces again. Adrian dives in vain as Hazard's header sails past the Spanish keeper and into the back of West Ham's net . Hazard was in irresistible form and leads James Collins a merry dance here . For many different reasons, some tribal and some because of an irrational hatred of former player Frank Lampard, who has since left Stamford Bridge, away at West Ham is always a tough fixture for Chelsea. To their credit they always seem to survive the taunts, the songs from the terraces that are usually directed at the captain Terry and his mother. Chelsea’s captain always appears unmoved by it all. But there was more last night. When Kurt Zouma was fouled by Collins just before half-time, West Ham’s supporters sang ‘You won’t let him on the train’ when he was waiting for treatment. Naturally those chants, given the dreadful incident on the Paris Metro before Chelsea’s Champions League clash at Parc des Princes last month, should be discouraged. Chelsea are the big noise in football right now, the team to beat as they prepare to face Paris Saint-Germain in the return leg of their last-16 Champions League tie next week. Increasingly Chelsea look like a team determined to power on and finish the job in the Premier League after feeding off the scraps last season. After this, the message from Mourinho was loud and clear. West Ham players gather around the floored Kurt Zouma after Collins' tackle on the Frenchman .","Chelsea have discovered the ruthless, killer instinct required to win matches .
The bond is already strong, building this resilience in the dressing room as the season has progressed. Here at Upton Park they looked impenetrable .
Their work-rate is phenomenal. They are a team fighting for each other as they close in on their first Premier League title since Mourinho's return .
Increasingly they look like a team determined to power on and finish the job well before they play their final game of the season against Sunderland ."

"When Eoin Morgan spoke at the end of Sunday’s thumping defeat he seemed to be suggesting that it would still all somehow be ‘alright on the night’ for England at this World Cup. Well, I’m afraid it won’t be unless everyone involved, both players and management, have a good hard look at themselves. There needs to be a lot of hard, honest talking in that England camp over the next few days and a re-evaluation of how they are doing things because if they carry on like this they will not be involved in the World Cup for much longer. Eoin Morgan looks disappointed as he watches on during England's disastrous defeat by Sri Lanka . The England players, led by their captain Morgan, walk from the field in Wellington after the match . 'Even when England put what looks like a challenging score on the board they are still brushed aside with contemptuous ease. Not for the first time in this World Cup they seemed like boys in the men’s world of modern one-day cricket.' Click HERE to read Paul Newman's match report from Wellington . England now need to win their next five games if they are going to lift their first World Cup. When did they last win five one-day internationals on the trot? It is going to be hard enough to win two in a row, let alone the next five. The whole tone was set with the sight of Gary Ballance walking out at three after England had got off to a really good start. Now, it’s not Ballance’s fault. He did not ask to be picked out of position and out of nick. But it just sent a message to England’s players that they were going to prod their way through the middle overs and then have a go in the last 15. And it was a policy that brought England 309 that in the old days would probably be enough. Now it is nowhere near. It is plain ridiculous. Sri Lanka fans wave flags and lift banners in celebration after beating England convincingly in Wellington . Morgan (left) and James Anderson (right) react as Kumar Sangakkara survives a run out chance . Contrast that with Sri Lanka. They get off to a good start, lose a wicket like England, but then in walks a world class No 3 in Kumar Sangakkara who knew exactly how to pace the innings and ensure Sri Lanka won with ease. And how come Jos Buttler was left with just 19 deliveries at the end of the innings? He made one of the best one-day hundreds I have seen from an England player last summer — and it was against Sri Lanka at Lord’s. Now he is not being allowed nearly enough time to put England out of sight. Then, sitting on the bench, we have Alex Hales, who hit one of the best Twenty20 hundreds you will see by an England player. And that happened to come against Sri Lanka too, in last year’s World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. Gary Ballance (bottom right) loses his wicket, leaving England at 71-2 during their innings . Alex Hales (left) is sitting on a beach, and Jos Buttler (right) got 19 deliveries - something needs to change . Sri Lanka must have looked at England and laughed to see two such key players being under-used and, worse, not being used at all. Then we have bowling that was just too one-dimensional to make any sort of impact on Sri Lanka. It was all right-arm, all one-paced and most of it too short. We cannot just bang the ball in halfway down and expect to bully sub-continental players any more. It just ain’t going to happen these days. Moeen Ali has been England’s most economical bowler at this World Cup. So why not play a second spinner in James Tredwell? Or why not try Ravi Bopara’s cutters with the keeper standing up? Morgan and the men in charge of England need to take a good hard look at themselves after their defeat . Lahiru Thirimanne (left) and Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka to a comfortable win over England in New Zealand . Anything to get a bit more variety into the attack because the bowlers offered Eoin Morgan nothing in Wellington. They just never looked like getting people out, even if a couple of chances did go down. In the first over of the batting power-play, with fine leg up, Stuart Broad banged one in short and was hit for four by Kumar Sangakkara. Then from the first ball of the second over Steven Finn did the same the same thing and was hit for six. It just isn’t working and England need a rethink. There is no magic fix. There aren’t lots of brilliant players waiting to come in to this one-day side. Those who are on the outside are there for a reason and have, in most cases, fallen short to a larger or smaller degree. That’s why I keep on saying the culture has to change as much as the personnel. Sangakkar and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket win . Australia coach Darren Lehmann has shown that a change in coach can change a culture too . From what I’ve heard over the last year or two that culture has been driven by pre-meditated plans and statistics when it should be gut feeling and instinct . The next week needs to be spent thinking how England can start playing a different brand of one-day cricket. The captain, who used to play with that gut feeling and instinct, needs to take the lead but Darren Lehmann has shown that the coach can change a culture too. England cannot go into their remaining matches at this World Cup with their fingers crossed. Boy, do they need to start plotting a new way forward.","Sri Lanka beat England by nine wickets and something needs to change .

"Former England captain Lewis Moody says he does not think England will win the World Cup this year. Moody, who won 71 caps over a 10-year career, believes Stuart Lancaster's team are 'not quite where they need to be' to lift the William Webb Ellis cup on October 31. The former Leicester and Bath flanker, speaking at an awards ceremony for the Prince's Trust in London, told the Press Association: 'I don't think England are in the right place at the moment to win the World Cup. Former England captain Lewis Moody does not think England are in a position to win the World Cup . Moody knows what it takes to win the tournament having lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in 2003 . 'If they can get through the pool stages they'll have a great, fighting chance. Being at home for every match makes a massive difference and if you get into a semi-final anything could happen - but I think at the minute they are probably not quite where they need to be to win the World Cup. 'They can certainly be there to push the others, and if they get into the semi-final then there is every chance they could make the final.' Moody, who cannot see beyond New Zealand as tournament winners, believes Lancaster may be hoping his squad will peak for 2019. He continued: 'He's been building a team, there are a lot of young new changes coming, so I think he'll be focusing on the next World Cup, especially as he's had that nice new contract extension.' However, he believes England can still win the Six Nations. Lancaster oversee training as his side prepare to face Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . How England and Scotland will line up for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham . Moody said: 'It is disappointing that England have ended up in this position. They had a good chance to come away with a Grand Slam but they have got to focus on Scotland now. 'It should be a reasonably comfortable result against Scotland, and then go on and beat France. They can still win it, but it will be a big ask now - we are reliant on other teams.' Moody added: 'I am a huge fan of Stuart Lancaster. 'I think he's done terribly well and I think all that now Stuart is lacking is that win, that result that really says, 'Look, what I've been doing over the last four years has been about this, achieving this', and if we can take something out of the Six Nations, which will be tough now, then he'll have that.' One bonus is that the Six Nations may well have ironed out England's conundrum at fly-half and in the centres, Moody suggested, with George Ford and Jonathan Joseph cementing their places. He said: 'For me it is quite simple. I think Ford has stepped up and done a fantastic job. I'd keep him there, and he would be my man for the World Cup. It will be interesting to see where Owen (Farrell) slots in when he comes back. Moody thinks George Ford has stepped up as England centre and should keep his place for the World Cup . Ford offloads a pass during training as England prepare for Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland . 'Joseph has stepped in and filled a void I think we've been nursing since Will Greenwood was playing, and that's some time ago now. 'And when Manu Tuilagi comes back I'd like to see Joseph and Tuilagi playing in the centres together and how they can work that. I think (Luther) Burrell has been all right but I think Joseph and Tuilagi are probably the future.' Moody was adamant Ford's rise had not consigned Farrell's days as England's starting number 10 to history. 'They are certainly not over,' he said. 'The fact George has come in and done so well, George Ford has had a fantastic start to his international career. 'Owen is a young man in his own right. Those two vied for the under 20s spots, they were centre and fly-half together when they played England under 20s together, so they know each other well. 'Owen is a great temperament and he'll work hard to make sure he is pushing George all the way for that 10 shirt.'","The 2015 Rugby World Cup starts in September and will be held in England .

"There have been all manner of World Cup shambles for England since they should have won the 1992 final here in Australia. But never one as bad as this. This, surely, is the worst yet, worse than 1996 when Sri Lanka’s pinch-hitters left them trailing in their wake. Worse, even, than 1999 when England were eliminated from their own World Cup the day before the official song came out. And it is certainly worse than the last three World Cups when we had come to expect England to struggle in the one-day game, particularly in 2007 and last time when the biggest tournament in limited-overs cricket followed the Ashes.

England batsman Moeen lays on the ground after being run out by Bangladesh wicketkeeper Rahim during the World Cup match . The 15-run defeat here by Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval, which confirmed England’s abject surrender, is nothing short of an utter humiliation, an embarrassment that, not for the first time in recent years, leaves them as the laughing stock of world cricket. This was the World Cup that England were supposed to take seriously and prepare thoroughly for. This was the World Cup that the Ashes were moved for, leading to a 5-0 thrashing last winter and all manner of painful recriminations. Yet so far advanced has the one-day game progressed in the last two years since England reached the Champions Trophy final that clearing the calendar and playing only one-day cricket so far this winter has been akin to trying to put a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. England have been able to defeat just Scotland in this tournament and after being thrashed by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka they have now been humbled by a team in Bangladesh who are little more than minnows themselves. This tournament was set up to virtually guarantee the progress of the big eight teams to the quarter-finals. It was almost impossible for England to fail to at least get to the last eight where defeat would have been far from a disgrace. Or so it seemed. Instead this is a defeat that deserves to be considered as a total disgrace. It is one that leaves Peter Moores fighting to salvage his reputation as a credible coach of England and Paul Downton, the man who appointed him, facing huge questions about the big decisions he has made. When the dust settles and England have gone through the motions of their last group match against Afghanistan they must have a searching examination of how they play one-day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next World Cup in four years time. It is not just Moores and Downton with much to contemplate. Senior players such as Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one-day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built. And the decision to replace Alastair Cook with Eoin Morgan as one-day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired, the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most. Morgan has been given permission to miss England’s first one-day international after this World Cup, against an Ireland team having a far better tournament than England, so he can play in the Indian Premier League. That decision frankly stinks and if Morgan does not want to lead England into a new one-day era then he should give up the job now and let Joe Root, who was seriously considered when Cook was sacked, lead them from now on. Never mind that Jos Buttler almost rescued England after they had fallen to 163 for six chasing 275. And never mind that TV umpire Simon Fry gave an atrocious decision to rule that Chris Jordan had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground.

Moores went into full Graham Taylor mode on the sidelines, raging at the fourth official after a truly awful decision, but in truth England did not deserve to get away with this. They were second best to a tigerish Bangladesh just as they have been worse than second best throughout this tournament. And it all started off so well too. It looked as though England were going to have an easy night when Anderson found the bite and swing that had eluded him in this tournament to take two wickets in his first seven balls. Neither Imrul Kayes nor Tamim Iqbal, the dangerman at the top of the Bangladesh order, could cope as England made a start full of the sort of aggression and purpose that the seriousness of their plight demanded. Yet England could not have expected the resistance and then blossoming strokeplay that came from a batsman who had never made a one-day international century before in Mahmudullah. The drop-in pitch at the re-built Adelaide Oval may have been near perfect for batting but the lack of variety in an England attack that has struggled for penetration in this World Cup allowed Bangladesh to flourish. Mahmudullah found a willing ally in the tiny form of Mushfiqur Rahim, the Bangladeshi ‘mighty atom’ who first faced England as a 16-year-old schoolboy 10 years ago, and together they preyed on England’s nerves. Mahmudullah certainly enjoyed becoming the first Bangladeshi to record a hundred in a World Cup match and while he and Rahim were adding 141 for the fifth wicket a total beyond 300 looked within his side’s reach. That they fell 25 short of that was down to much improved death bowling from England, Chris Jordan in particular showing how it should be done after being preferred to Steven Finn in this winner takes all match. It should have been well within England’s reach but their chase was old-fashioned and flawed with Bell, involved in a schoolboy run out that saw the demise of Moeen Ali, leaving them far too much to do after he had taken 82 balls to reach 63. The dismissals of Bell and Morgan in four balls from Rubel Hossain, faster than any England bowler, left England deep in the mire and even though Buttler, their main glimmer of hope for a better one-day future, hit 65 off 52 balls they ended up 16 short. The brilliant Hossain finished it by bowling both Broad and Anderson in three balls in the penultimate over, leaving Chris Woakes stranded on 42, to spark off wild Bangladeshi celebrations.

"England head coach Peter Moores, who should surely be sacked after the World Cup humiliation against Bangladesh, is doubly fortunate at the timing of this rock-bottom moment for English cricket. Firstly, the new regime at the England Cricket Board are concentrating on a big restructuring of the organisation, to the extent that axing the beleaguered Moores was said not to be even on the agenda — or wasn’t last week. Secondly, Aussie Jason Gillespie, who would be hot favourite to replace Moores, is not sure he wants the role. Gillespie has five children — with four under the age of 10 — and the county championship-winning Yorkshire coach has promised wife Anna he will put the family first. England coach Peter Moores (left) said he is 'desperate' to continue after his side's poor World Cup campaign . Gillespie said: ‘My eldest daughter Sapphire lives at home in Australia with her mum and I didn’t see her grow up as I was on the road playing for Australia. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t do the same again. The children are my priority, family come first.’ And Gillespie, who worked very successfully with England number two Paul Farbrace at a Yorkshire bankrolled by new ECB chairman Colin Graves, added: ‘It would be a really big ask to go away 9-10 months a year. I would find that really difficult. I’d find that a challenge.’ Phil Neville (left, with Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino) will work on his FA Pro-license this week . Phil Neville and Brentford manager Mark Warburton are part of a select group of 24 coaches working on their FA Pro-Licence at St George’s Park this week - at a time when the FA of Wales are promoting their ‘world class’ alternative course which has Thierry Henry, Les Ferdinand and Tim Sherwood signed up. However, the FA still regard their coaching badges as the gold standard and will react to the Welsh competition by putting on two Pro-licence courses a year in future rather than one. But there will be no reduction in the extra hours involved in completing the SGP course — 500 as compared to 350 in Wales — that the FA believe gives their set-up the edge. Grand National winning jockey Carl Llewellyn’s ghastly n-word comment on a racing preview panel on the eve of last year’s Cheltenham festival seems to have been airbrushed out of insular racing’s memory one year on. Not only was Llewellyn, who was fined and interviewed under police caution, included in exactly the same line-up for the annual tipping evening at famous racing pub the Hollow Bottom on Monday night, but the sport’s promotional arm Great British Racing have assistant trainer Llewellyn featured riding Champion Hurdle horse the New One on one of their main Cheltenham preview videos on their official website.

Andy Murray looks anything but a team player — which he clearly is — in pictures on Monday of the Great Britain Davis Cup group celebrating their win against the USA. The players and management are in Nike-supplied official training kit, apart from Murray who is wearing his Under Armour shirt. It transpires that there was nothing in Under Armour’s £3.5m-year-deal with Murray to prevent him slipping on a GB tracksuit to demonstrate the side’s unity for the cameras. But the Lawn Tennis Association, in their wisdom, didn’t feel any need to have Murray, who had come straight off court, pictured in team uniform. Former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli’s ambassador appearance at the recent Qatar racing festival in Doha has only added to speculation that the Frenchwoman — crassly described during Wimbledon as ‘not a looker’ by John Inverdale — is considering a return to the sport, but as a Qatari citizen. And Bartoli would receive a huge sum for changing nationalities, reportedly as much as £1million.

"FA chairman Greg Dyke has called for a public debate between the four candidates for the FIFA presidency and offered to host the event at Wembley. Dyke made his wish for a TV inquisition known during an awkward weekend in Sepp Blatter’s company at the rules-deciding IFAB meeting in Belfast.

Meanwhile, in a separate move, Sky and the BBC have made a joint approach to Blatter and rivals Prince Ali of Jordan, Luis Figo and Michael van Praag to stage such an event. FA chairman Greg Dyke has called for a public debate between the four candidates for the FIFA presidency . The TV networks — through leading sports news broadcasters Paul Kelso and Richard Conway — have written to the contestants outlining their ambitious proposals for a live, hour-long debate in the UK with an audience of fans representing all 209 FIFA member nations. This fans’ congress would provide questions, with others drawn from football supporters via the Sky and BBC websites, and Facebook, to ensure maximum interaction. All four challengers have been promised equal time and emphasis to present their manifestos and visions for FIFA’s future. Blatter has yet to respond to the Sky-BBC letter but it is highly unlikely he’ll agree to such public exposure. His three opponents will all be in favour. Sepp Blatter has yet to respond to the Sky-BBC letter but it is unlikely he’ll agree to such public exposure . The official photo of the IFAB summit shows Greg Dyke seated between, of all people, Sepp Blatter and Thailand’s Worawi Makudi, whose presence at Belfast’s Cullodon Hotel as a representative of the Asian Football Confederation was bizarre in the extreme. Makudi has an acrimonious history with the FA and is under investigation by FIFA’s ethics committee for breaching World Cup bid rules. It’s understood Makudi played no part in the rules debate. FIFA said Makudi was selected by the AFC to attend and is innocent of any code violations until found guilty. The home nations are in disagreement as to whose turn it is to take the FIFA British vice-presidency . The 2011 gentlemen’s agreement between the four home nations, which declares it is Wales’s turn to take the FIFA British vice-presidency, continues to cause ructions. The three other countries believe the agreement was nullified by a new statute that has all UEFA associations involved in the vote at the Congress later this month. But Welsh president Trefor Lloyd-Hughes says he has a signed contract in his possession that declares no change can be made in the rotation pledge unless there is unanimous agreement. Meanwhile, England’s David Gill, persuaded by UEFA president Michel Platini to stand for that FIFA place against Lloyd-Hughes, has written to all UEFA countries outlining his plans. To spice up their battle, Wales are still annoyed that a UEFA ExCo, including Gill, voted for Hampden Park over the Millennium Stadium as one of 13 venues to stage Euro 2020. It’s believed Gill rated the Cardiff venue higher. General secretary Alex Horne left the FA at the end of January but has not yet been replaced . Greg Dyke and David Gill, who are on the nominations panel choosing the FA’s next chief executive, were coy over the weekend about how far they have progressed in finding general secretary Alex Horne’s replacement. However, it’s understood the selection has been made after final interviews last week and an announcement is imminent.

"If England's early World Cup exit was not hard enough to stomach then look away now because the Australian media has found rich entertainment in poking fun at Eoin Morgan's beleaguered men. After the calamitous 5-0 Ashes whitewash last winter, Australian scribes could hardly have expected that just 12 months later they would be handed even more ammunition to shoot down the mother country. The 15-run defeat to Bangladesh that sealed England's fate in Adelaide was their fourth defeat in five games at a forgettable World Cup and means they will fly home after their now meaningless final group game against Afghanistan on Friday. The Australian newspapers pulled no punches as they mercilessly mocked England's exit . Peter Moores and his side came in for plenty of stick from the Australian press after defeat to Bangladesh . Moores could be out of a job after watching his team crash out of the World Cup with four defeats from five . James Taylor looks down at his bat as he joins the procession of English batsmen who failed to make a score . Moeen Ali is a doubt for England's final game of the World Cup after picking up a side injury . Joe Root arrives at Sydney airport after England's shocking defeat to Bangladesh on Monday . 'Cheerio chaps: Poms are bangers and mashed' was the back-page headline that greeted the England squad when they landed in Sydney on Tuesday. If coach Peter Moores and his team dared pick up a copy of the Daily Telegraph they were certainly reminded, in no uncertain terms, how well an English failure is regarded in the Antipodes. 'England have been utterly embarrassing,' the story opined before throwing thoughts ahead to this summer's Ashes, adding: 'Australian fans now can't wait to face cricket's minnows - that's England - in the Ashes.' Back at the scene of England's exit the Adelaide Advertiser focused on the prospect of Moores being replaced by Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie, who grew up in the South Australian capital. 'The look on ashen-faced Moores as cameras panned in encapsulated a dead man sitting,' Richard Earle wrote. England captain Eoin Morgan has come in for criticism as his side crashed out of the World Cup . Fast bowlers James Anderson (left) and Stuart Broad (right) have been far from their best all tournament . Steven Finn arrives at Sydney Airport on Tuesday ahead of their final World Cup game . Chris Woakes looks a beaten man during England's dismal display, which left them as a laughing stock . Chris Jordan dives but was run out as England's hopes, and batting order, disintegrated in Adelaide . Bangladesh celebrated at the end, but the Australian press dubbed England the new 'minnows' of cricket . 'England's demise will now have Yorkshire and incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves sending an SOS to 71-Test paceman Gillespie.' England's 'catalogue of Adelaide disasters' was also broken down since the unlikely last-day Test defeat in 2006 when it was suggested then captain Andrew Flintoff had been 'turned to drink to soothe the pain'. England's poor record at World Cups was also underlined in the brevity of one statistic which read: 'While the British Empire has faded so has its cricket machine, winning just five matches against top-eight ranked rivals in World Cups since 1996.' Moores' own apparent liking for statistic was not missed, and his post-match claim that he would need to 'look at the data' raised a Aussie smirk or two with one internet headline reading: 'Analyse this data; One win, four losses' before offering a link to 'England's worst cricket disasters'. The anguish is clear to see on Taylor's face as he is dismissed, and England exited at the first stage . Moores' 'grey hair seeming to whiten at each wicket' according to one Australian journalist . The Aussie media suggested that former fast-bowler Jason Gillespie could be drafted in to replace Moores . Gillespie took 259 wickets in 71 Tests for Australia, and is now coaching Yorkshire . In The Australian one of the country's pre-eminent cricket writer's Gideon Haigh was more nuance, but no less scathing, as he wrote of the fear that was visible on the England players' faces whenever the television cameras panned to them waiting in the dugout to bat. 'They were as cheerful as boys awaiting the cuts from their headmaster. At the centre of it all, Peter Moores, grey hair seeming to whiten at each wicket. 'And at the last, a tiny glimpse of Joe Root, seated next to his coach as James Anderson fell, blowing a little bubble of gum. Pop - that was all it took.' Haigh finished by adding: 'Moores wanted people to wait to judge him until after the World Cup ended. They're ready, coach.'","England crashed out of World Cup after losing four of five games .

"There was nothing more mind-numbingly maddening in the aftermath of England’s worst World Cup exit yet than the immediate reaction of Peter Moores. ‘We thought 275 was chaseable. We’ll have to look at the data,’ said a coach now fighting to avoid his second ignominious exit from international cricket as the reality of an embarrassing group stage elimination sank in. Well, England should rip up their data along with their whole philosophy towards one-day cricket and start again. Peter Moores faces an uncertain future following England's humiliating exit from the 2015 Cricket World Cup . England were beaten by 15 runs at the Adelaide Oval to make it four defeats against Test-playing nations . England captain Eoin Morgan looks dejected as he leaves the field after their World Cup match . Morgan's fifth ODI duck in 12 innings summed up their poor performance at the World Cup . 90 - the amount of runs captain Eoin Morgan scored in five innings at the World Cup . 12.2 - the overs it took for New Zealand to beat England's total of 123 in their second group game. 111 - Australia's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament . 654 - total of runs scored by Australia and Sri Lanka against England . 1 - number of centuries scored by an England batsman against Test playing nations . 72 - number of runs scored by Sri Lanka off the bowling of Chris Woakes . 0 - number of wins registered by England over Test playing nations in the tournament . 0 - the number of centuries scored by a Bangladesh batsman in a World Cup before playing England on Monday. 37.4-1-234-5 - Chris Woakes's tournament bowling figures. 49 - the amount of runs Steven Finn went for in two overs against New Zealand. You do not need analysis to know that they have stunk this tournament out and, after this 15-run defeat by Bangladesh, are once again the laughing stock of the cricket world. The only statistic Moores needs to know is that England, having been thrashed by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, were humbled by a Bangladesh side who beat them here at their own very English game. The key data is that England, having defeated just Scotland so far, have excelled themselves in being even worse at this World Cup than the five previous stinkers since they came so close to winning the 1992 tournament in Australia. And this humiliation has come after the Ashes were moved and a winter of one-day cricket provided to try to make sure England had every chance of finally competing for a first global 50-over trophy that looks further away than ever. In truth, arranging a one-day series against Sri Lanka before Christmas was akin to putting a sticking plaster on a gaping wound because England are light years away from the dynamic, vibrant teams we have seen here. To hurl all the blame in the direction of Moores would be unfair but there is no question that his position must now come under serious scrutiny, as too will that of the man who re-appointed him in Paul Downton. Colin Graves does not become ECB chairman until May but he is not the sort of man to postpone a big decision and the coach and managing director may soon be caught up in the new broom that is sweeping through the English game.

We've got nine guys who haven't been to a World Cup before. 'That's the reality of it. You make your choice, you pick the side you think is the best team, which we did, and we have to accept they didn't play well enough.' Shane Warne and Kevin Pietersen were among those criticising England on Twitter after their early elimination in the group stages. 'England had the wrong team, the wrong style of play and everyone could see it. Tonight's result is not a shock, I feel for Morgan. Coach is in trouble,' Warne tweeted. Pietersen added: 'I cannot believe this. I just cannot. But, well done Bangladesh! You deserved it! 'Do not say we haven't prioritised ODI cricket! We played a back-to-back Ashes to make sure England played six months of ODIs before this World Cup!' Gary Lineker, the former England striker, said: 'Bangladesh win! Congratulations to them. The good news is, England can't possibly get any worse.' And Piers Morgan wrote: 'What an absolute disgrace. [Paul] Downton and Moores have dragged English cricket into the sporting sewer with their petty, clueless incompetence. 'I want  Downton and Moores sacked today and Kevin Pietersen restored to the team. This farce just reached its true, hideous nadir. 'I wouldn't trust Downton and Moores to run a ****ing bath, let alone the England cricket team.' Moores pictured after the defeat as he speaks with press in Adelaide about their World Cup exit . To highlight Moores immediate mention of data on television is not to take a cheap shot at a decent man who appears to be liked and respected by players who on the whole have let him and their country down here. By the time he gave a more considered press conference yesterday there was no mention of the statistics that seem to have weighed down even a free spirit in Eoin Morgan, who has been a huge disappointment as captain here. My gut feeling is that Moores will be given the summer before England think about replacing him but a personal view is that maybe his assistant Paul Farbrace, an Asia Cup and World Twenty20 winner with Sri Lanka before throwing in his lot with England, could take extra responsibility for limited-overs cricket. England are about to embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 Tests in 10 months and the danger is that one-day cricket will again be shoved to the bottom of England’s list of priorities unless a clear strategy is undertaken. The overwhelming favourite to succeed Moores if and when he goes is Jason Gillespie but he distanced himself from the role yesterday and there is no doubt that the Yorkshire coach and his family are happy and settled in Leeds. Joe Root (centre) exchanges words with Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza (left) at the Adelaide Oval . Bangladesh sealed a surprise win over England at the World Cup as Moores and his men suffered elimination . Gillespie has already turned down a role with his native Australia under Darren Lehmann and has been given permission by Yorkshire to coach a team, probably Adelaide, in next year’s Big Bash while staying at Headingley. The constant year-round slog of international cricket is making it harder for countries to attract the best coaches and former Yorkshire chairman Graves may need to be at his most persuasive if he wants to recruit his old county coach. Moores and Downton are not the only ones under the microscope. Morgan refused to say that he wanted to carry on as one-day captain yesterday and reiterated his intention to miss England’s one-day international against Ireland in May, their first of another ‘new’ era, to play in the IPL. Well, I am sorry but if he does want to continue then he needs to be with the team in his native Dublin, particularly as it will be impossible for England players touring West Indies next month to make the Ireland trip on May 8. The sheer volume of cricket means that the best way for England to catch up in 50-over cricket is to build a new young team of one-day players as different as possible to that which will contest Test cricket in the next year against West Indies, New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa. Eoin Morgan looks to have been given the backing by Moores to continue as England's one-day captain . Alastair Cook (left) was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup . Ian Bell, who left England far too much to do against Bangladesh by getting out after scoring 62 off 83 balls, will surely bow out of one-day cricket after Friday’s dead rubber against Afghanistan while it is in the best interests of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad for them to do the same. Joe Root was strongly considered for the one-day captaincy by England when they sacked Alastair Cook before they plumped for the out-of-form Morgan and I would give him the one-day job now and build a new team around him. It is certainly possible to envisage a squad led by Root and including Jos Buttler, who came so close to recuing England yesterday, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Ben Stokes, Jason Roy, James Vince, Sam Billings and Adil Rashid growing into an outfit capable of competing in the modern one-day world. But the seam bowling remains a huge worry, not least the absence of a quick left-armer. Bangladesh, worthy quarter-finalists now, had the fastest bowler on show yesterday in Rubel Hossain, who took four wickets, and that must be the first time they have ever had more pace at their disposal than England. The lack of variety in England’s bowling is one of the many reasons why they will be on their way home before the business end of this elongated tournament. And why they will be returning to the drawing board when they get there in their never-ending search for one-day success.","England were knocked out of the Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh .

"India took apart a diligent but limited Ireland attack to sweep to an untroubled eight-wicket victory at Seddon Park on Tuesday which confirmed they will top Pool B in the cricket World Cup. After dismissing Ireland for 249 with an over to spare when their spinners established a stranglehold on the top-order batting, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan played themselves in for a token couple of overs. They then launched a full-blooded attack, alternating flowing drives with explosive pulls while also pushing around the ball for comfortable singles.

After scoring five further runs he was dropped again off the unlucky Mooney, this time at backward point when captain William Porterfield parried a stinging cut but was unable to hang on to the rebound. Those were the only times the Irish bowlers looked like taking a wicket and the duo took the score to 174 when Sharma chopped medium pacer Stuart Thompson on to his stumps and was out for 64 from 66 balls. With the Indian supporters making a tremendous din, Dhawan took a single to complete his eighth one-day century from 84 balls with five sixes but was then caught off the following ball he faced from Thompson. Virat Kohli (44 not out) and Ajinkya Rahane (33 not out) took their team to victory with 13.1 overs to spare. Porterfield elected to bat on a warm afternoon before a capacity crowd of 11,000 packed into a picturesque ground in New Zealand's fourth largest city and all seemed set fair for the Irish when the captain and Paul Stirling put on 89 for the first wicket from 15 overs. Mahendra Singh Dhoni turned to his spinners and Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina responded by first frustrating then dismissing the Irish batsmen who found boundaries hard to come by after the initial flurry. Stirling (42) lofted a simple catch to long-off off Ashwin's bowling and Ed Joyce was bowled for two trying to cut a ball from Raina which was too full for the shot.

"The moment the names came out of the hat, Aston Villa had to play West Bromwich Albion in an FA Cup quarter-final. The same when West Ham United met Millwall in the Carling Cup in 2009. No escape. Administrators must have winced, but that was the hand they had been dealt. No doubt there were similar misgivings at UEFA when Serbia were paired with Albania in the 2016 European Championship qualifiers.

"Carlos Mars, 19, is facing assault and weapons charges . Police have arrested a 19-year-old student in connection with a stabbing at Morgan State University that left three football players injured. Police said Wednesday that Carlos Mars has been charged with assault and weapons charges. The stabbing happened Tuesday afternoon when a fight broke out between two groups of students at the Baltimore-based campus. Police say two men were slashed, one across the chest and one in the back, and a third student suffered abrasions. Charging documents show that a witness told investigators that Mars 'repeatedly and aggressively' stabbed another student in the chest during a fight. But Mars told investigators he 'swung his knife around in a wild manner' to keep students away from his friend, who also was involved in the fight. Police say Mars remains in jail. It was the third instance of violence on the Baltimore campus in less than a week. The players were taken to hospitals and their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, police said. University spokesman Clint Coleman said one of the players was slashed across the chest and another was cut on the arm. Police place a person of interest in a police cruiser for transport from a scene where a stabbing took place at Morgan State University . An investigator peers into a trash can at a scene where a stabbing took place. It's the third incident of violence at Morgan State University in a week . He said a third person was cut on the cheek; police said a third person was stabbed in the back. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear. It's not clear what started the fight. This is the third instance of recent violence. On Friday, a male student was stabbed with scissors by his roommate after an argument over the cleanliness of their dorm room. Early Saturday, an on-campus party was broken up after fights started. School officials held a campus meeting Tuesday night to talk about what happened. 'We expect you as students to take responsibility for your own behavior and actions,' University president David Wilson told those in attendance. Two groups of people got into a fight outside a dining hall on the Morgan State University campus, and some football players were stabbed by someone swinging a knife wildly, police and college officials said . History: Morgan State is the largest historically black university in Maryland and has about 6,000 students . Earlier Tuesday, Wilson sent an email to students that declared 'This is not Morgan!' Kevin Banks, vice president for student affairs, repeated that assertion. 'The stuff you've seen on TV the past few days is not Morgan State University,' Banks said. Wilson also said no text alerts were sent to students immediately after the stabbing because 'the general public was not in imminent danger because this was a fight between known parties and not a random act of violence.' But Freshman Shakia Marine, 20, who did not attend the campus meeting, said she is a little worried about the latest spate of violence. 'My godfather has concerns about me coming here,' Marine said. 'There needs to be more security guards walking around. After today, it made me feel scared. My roommate said we should get some Mace to protect ourselves. I think the school needs to take more action. It's not the first time something like this has happened.' Morgan State is the largest historically black university in Maryland and has about 6,000 students, according to its website.

"Peter Moores is adamant Alastair Cook has recovered from losing the one-day captaincy and is ready to lead England forward in a run of 17 Tests in under a year. Cook was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup and has watched as England have struggled to improve without him under new captain Eoin Morgan. Yet Moores says his relationship with Cook is undamaged and they have been busy planning for their imminent three-Test series against the West Indies. England coach Peter Moores talks with Alex Hales during an England nets session in Adelaide on Saturday . 'I've spoken to Alastair quite a bit and he's in a good place,' said the England coach ahead of the do or die World Cup match against Bangladesh. 'He's outside of this and is able to plan for Test cricket. 'Our working relationship hasn't changed. He's been an international for a long time and he realises it's a tough business and things change. He's thrown his focus totally into the big Test cricket to come.' That Caribbean series follows this World Cup and begins a year of Test cricket that includes a home series against New Zealand and another Ashes before visits to the UAE to face Pakistan and then South Africa. Alastair Cook (left) was devastated to be axed from 50-over cricket on the brink of his first World Cup . Moores admitted that national selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott about a possible return to the Test side. England may face a West Indies side without Chris Gayle — expected to retire from international cricket after this World Cup — and many of their best players could take part in the Indian Premier League instead. England will therefore consider resting players because they have so much important cricket ahead of them, not least the establishing of what will have to be a new one-day side. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad — prime candidates to be protected from burn-out — will both resist any attempts to force them to rest. National selector James Whitaker has spoken to Jonathan Trott (above) about a possible return to Test cricket . Anderson is four wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham as England's leading Test wicket-taker and wants his family to join him for the first Test in Antigua in the hope he will reach the landmark there. Meanwhile, Moores on Sunday insisted he had no regrets about returning as England coach despite the huge pressure which comes with a poor showing at the World Cup. 'No regrets at all,' said Moores. 'I felt I could make a difference. We know we've been behind in the one-day format and have to get better.'

"I’m starting to think Adam Lallana might actually become a better version of Steven Gerrard. He’s certainly got all the qualities that make him the perfect replacement for the Liverpool captain. I appreciate that Jordan Henderson is set to take over as skipper, but in terms of dynamism, energy and quality, Lallana looks like the perfect replacement for Gerrard the player. Have a look at Sunday’s victory over Manchester City: Lallana started the game as one of two No 10s behind Raheem Sterling (Brendan Rodgers’ innovative approach as a coach should not be underestimated). When Lazar Markovic went off, Lallana went over to the right wing, and then when Alberto Moreno was substituted, Lallana ended the game on the left wing. Adam Lallana (centre) gave an all-action display as Liverpool impressively beat Manchester City . Lallana chats with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during training on Monday . He is truly two-footed – for that reason alone English football should treasure him. But he is also clearly capable of playing in different positions, and he can adapt midway through a game. Those qualities are not readily available in most players and it takes me back to the Champions League final of 2005 when Gerrard ended up at right back. The very best not only play different positions, they excel in those positions as well. Lallana still has to prove he can do it, as Gerrard did, in a major final, but he proved it in a massive game on Sunday. A simple five-minute chat about Lallana with Rodgers will have him purring. The Liverpool manager will be using words and phrases like 'balance', 'clever', 'worker', 'technical ability', 'awareness', 'great character', 'looks after the ball'. Bring up the subject of Lallana and you could be there all day with Rodgers. On Sunday all the talk was of Philippe Coutinho, and understandably so. The brilliance of his goals alone in recent weeks makes him the hot topic and it’s great to see him add consistency to the undoubted quality. But Lallana’s contribution should not go unnoticed. Philippe Coutinho (2nd right) curled home Liverpool's winner late on in the Premier League clash at Anfield . Vice-captain Jordan Henderson (right, front) also scored a screamer for the Reds on Sunday . One thing you might not know about Lallana is that in Rodgers’ words, he is 'no shrinking violet'. He has bags of personality and character off the pitch as well as on it, and good leadership qualities – let’s not forget he was captain of Southampton as they returned to re-establish themselves in the Premier League. For Liverpool’s system he is perfect. He has quality on the ball – did you see his Cruyff turn in the centre circle against City? Breathtaking stuff – he creates – he scores (probably could score more) – and he presses the ball. He was injured pre-season, so it was a slow start to his Liverpool career and some supporters were too quick to judge. Rodgers knew that opponents’ approach to Liverpool would be different this season, he knew he would need players to be clever on the ball, and Lallana has that football intelligence. Lallana - who played three positions against City - shows his defensive qualities challenging Sergio Aguero . He doesn’t get talked about too much, does he? Is that because he’s English? Probably. But Rodgers told me this about Lallana: 'He’s technically as good as any European player'. Some might disagree, but it rams home the point that we don’t value his qualities highly enough in this country. In the feverish pace of the Premier League, Lallana still makes time for himself on the ball, and has that football intelligence and ability to make an impact on a game. Yet somehow, if he is only on the bench for England later this month it won’t be a surprise. And that’s a shame in my opinion. Gerrard’s departure will still hurt Liverpool fans, but I expect Lallana to grow even more when the legend leaves. He’s one of the most underrated footballers in the Premier League. Lallana slides in to have an effort on the Manchester City goal that went narrowly wide of the target .","Liverpool beat champions Manchester City 2-1 on Sunday .

"Jimmy Greaves did not attend Wembley on Sunday. A lot of people tend to get upset when this happens. The one who doesn’t is Jimmy Greaves. If he wanted to go, as a guest of either Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur, his former clubs, he could have secured a ticket, no problem. The Football League would probably love to have him, too. The issue isn’t that Greaves is short of invitations. He’s just not that into it. Jimmy Greaves was a great player, and doesn't need a fuss around him when he decides not to attend games . This can happen when you’re 75. Jimmy thinks of Wembley and, as much as the match — which he would enjoy — he imagines the queues of traffic on the North Circular, the hassles of parking and of spending the hour before kick-off having a big fuss made about his presence when he would rather be sat with a pot of tea in front of Liverpool and Manchester City and then the rugby. Jim loves the rugby. Truth be told, if Ireland versus England captured his attention, he might even have delayed changing channels until it was over. He finds it strange that people are still interested in getting him to Wembley. We want our heroes to behave like besotted fans, but Jim’s interests were always broader. Greaves' interests were always broader than just football, and he should be left to enjoy his retirement . He liked playing, and was quite brilliant at it, but since retiring he’s as likely to be engrossed in a Test match as a cup final, and he hasn’t the ego to wish to be feted wherever he goes. He doesn’t claim to be an expert on the modern game, having not been a part of it for so long, but feels no animosity towards the Premier League or its high-earning players. For a man whose problems with alcohol led him to a psychiatric unit shortly after retirement, the second act of Jim’s life has been a triumph. We should perhaps acknowledge this, rather than wonder why he isn’t constantly seeking attention or another lap of honour. We should wish every former athlete the quiet contentment of Jimmy Greaves. Greaves doesn't claim to be an expert about the modern game, and didn't want to attend the League Cup fianl .","Spurs and Chelsea legend Jimmy Greaves chose not to go to Wembley .

"David Gill, the Football Association vice- chairman, says FA Cup replays and the two-legged League Cup semi-finals may have to be sacrificed in the season of the 2022 World Cup. Why wait? If anything, replays are detracting from the excitement of the competition, and the format of what is currently the Capital One Cup is an anomaly. It should not take FIFA’s monstrous destruction of football’s calendar to make the English game see sense. By chance, there were no replays in the FA Cup fifth round this year and they were not missed. The great Cup shocks of this campaign have all happened on the day, inside 90 minutes. David Gill suggested removing cup replays, and he has a point, even if it it has taken Qatar to make it happen . Cambridge United were excellent to earn a replay against Manchester United, but lost the second game . That is when Bradford City beat Chelsea and Sunderland, when Middlesbrough eliminated Manchester City, when Blackburn Rovers beat Swansea City then Stoke City. A few lower division tussles aside, all the games that went to replays went with form. Manchester United defeated Cambridge United, Sunderland won at Fulham, Liverpool came from behind to beat Bolton Wanderers and Southampton won against Ipswich Town. Replays favour the bigger teams anyway. If Cambridge could have taken Manchester United to extra-time, and maybe to penalties, on a crummy pitch at a boisterous Abbey Stadium, who knows what might have happened? Heading to a decider at Old Trafford, their moment had passed. Jonathan Stead's goal against Chelsea was part of a shock that re-affirmed the FA Cup's giant killing tradition . Bradford celebrate their win at Stamford Bridge, and didn't need a replay to upset the Premier League leaders . We cling to tradition, but tradition had teams playing replay after replay until they could be separated. Those encounters had an epic feel. In 1979, Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday needed five matches — including three that went to extra-time — lasting nine hours before they could be torn apart. The second replay ended 2-2, the third 3-3. Arsenal won the fourth 2-0. That is the true gladiatorial tradition of the FA Cup, but it is unthinkable with modern fixture congestion. So as the shoot-out that completes the first replay is in itself a compromise, why is it needed at all? Middlesbrough also caused an upset, by beating Manchester City, but replays rarely lead to shocks . Smaller clubs might be better rewarded if games were decided on the night by a penalty shoot-out . A game decided on the day, one hit, with extra-time and penalties, would go some way to restoring tension and drama. When the FA has to alter its company accounts because the FA Cup sponsorship deal confidently included by former general secretary Alex Horne has not materialised, it is ridiculous to pretend the current format is a winner. The same with the League Cup. It is decided over one game in every round, then two in the semi-finals, and back to one for the final. What is the point of that? Better to have consistency and let the calendar breathe a little. It should not need FIFA’s selfishness to be a catalyst for reform in the English game. The time to change is now.","Qatar World Cup likely to force changes to domestic calendar .
But FA Cup replays have lost their appeal - they should be scrapped .
Upsets rarely happen in the second game, giant-killing would not suffer .

"The emotion of gaining a career breakthrough and striking a blow for the less gilded outfits at Cheltenham proved too much for Warren Greatrex. The unsung 40-year-old trainer was unable to blink back the tears behind his spectacles after Cole Harden had provided him with a first Festival winner, and in the biggest race of the day, the World Hurdle. It was a victory for an emerging trainer, ridden by his freshman jockey Gavin Sheehan on a 14-1 horse owned by former customs and excise investigator Robin Eynon and his wife Jill from Winchester. Cole Harden makes every yard of the running to win the Ladbrokes World Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival . Gavin Sheehan  celebrates winning the Ladbrokes World Hurdle, his first victory at the Cheltenham Festival . Sheehan gets to work on Cole Harden as he wins from the front on the third day of the famous Festival . 1 Cole Harden (G Sheehan) 14-1 . 2 Saphir Du Rheu (Sam Twiston-Davies) 5-1 Fav . 3 Zarkandar (N D Fehily) 6-1 . Suddenly the winners’ enclosure looked less the preserve of the fabulously wealthy and the heavyweights of the industry they employ. There was incredulity among the victorious names that they had elevated themselves to the kind of company more regularly associated with names like McManus, Mullins and McCoy. Cole Harden had struck out for the front from the off and stayed there for three miles, winning by three-and-a-quarter lengths. ‘If you’re going to break your duck you may as well make it a big one. Anyone that knows me will tell you I can talk all day long but I’m stuck for words,’ said Greatrex, who eventually managed to articulate his achievement. ‘I’m small, I’m a youngster at this. I’ve got nine runners here, we’re breaking through — we’re trying to compete with the big guys and hopefully this will help. We’ve beaten the best. You look at the next two horses behind and they’re trained by Paul Nicholls ... unbelievable.’ Sheehan celebrates as he crosses the line in front of the favourite Saphir Du Rheu at Cheltenham . Sheehan gives the horse a pat after a brilliant front-running performance on Cole Harden . Sheehan celebrates with Daryl Jacob after riding Cole Harden to victory in the Ladbrokes World Hurdle . After a modest career as a jockey in which he rode 13 winners, Greatrex served a long apprenticeship as a trainer, working under some of the finest in the business such as David Nicholson, Josh Gifford and Oliver Sherwood. He now works out of Uplands, the former premises of legendary jockey and trainer Fred Winter in Lambourn, where he has built up a mid-size yard of 75 horses. ‘I am sure the Duke (Nicholson) is looking down from somewhere with pride and I hope Fred would have been proud as well,’ said Greatrex. His faith in Cole Harden was tested when, after a win at Wetherby in November, he struggled in the January’s Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham and so, less than two months ago, was sent for an operation. ‘I was struggling with him early season, having trouble with his wind, but then he won at Wetherby. He wasn’t right at the Cleeve, so we had it done. It was a soft pallet operation, not a big thing, but I knew we needed to do something.’ Trainer Warren Greatrex and jockey Gavin Sheehan celebrate their first ever success at the Festival . Sheehan takes the acclaim of the crowd as he heads for the Winners' Enclosure on Cole Harden . If Greatrex is a different name to conjure with then so is Eynon, who comes from a less ostentatious school than the increasingly select number of tycoon owners who dominate national hunt racing, like JP McManus, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary and American Rich Ricci, with his permanently attached sunglasses. Cole Harden is one of two horses he owns, along with a half-share in Paint The Clouds, running in today’s Foxhunter’s Chase. He is the kind of enthusiast who makes a pilgrimage to Cheltenham at least once a year, regardless of whether he has a horse running or not. ‘We’ve had horses since 1996 and this is the best day we’ve had so far,’ he said. ‘We’ve been lucky, every horse we’ve had has done quite well. I’ve forgotten how much we spent on Cole Harden, it wasn’t much; we don’t spend a lot on horses. ‘I’ve been retired a few years but I worked for many years as an investigator for Customs and Excise in London, in a department that doesn’t exist anymore because Gordon Brown closed it. ‘When you get something like this it’s really special. We always come to Cheltenham once a year and if they got rid of the traffic we’d be here every time.’ While Cole Harden’s victory provided the romance, the powerhouse yard of Willie Mullins notched his sixth winner of the meeting after Vautour destroyed the field in the earlier JLT Novices’ Chase. Ruby Walsh and Vautour romp home to leave trainer Willie Mullins dreaming of next year's Gold Cup . The Irish trainer, now just one short of Nicky Henderson’s record of winners for the meeting, could scarcely contain his excitement about the 6-4 favourite’s potential, which could exceed that of Faugheen ‘The Machine’. ‘This is the real machine,’ said Mullins. ‘He is a Gold Cup horse.’ Jockey Ruby Walsh was equally effusive after his 15-length victory. ‘He jumped like a gazelle and quickened up so impressively off the bend, it was flawless,’ he said. ‘The horses behind are very good and he ran them ragged.’","Cole Harden won the World Hurdle from the front at Cheltenham .

Morgan's fifth ODI duck in 12 innings summed up their poor performance at the World Cup . 90 - the amount of runs captain Eoin Morgan scored in five innings at the World Cup . 12.2 - the overs it took for New Zealand to beat England's total of 123 in their second group game. 111 - Australia's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament . 654 - total of runs scored by Australia and Sri Lanka against England . 1 - number of centuries scored by an England batsman against Test playing nations . 72 - number of runs scored by Sri Lanka off the bowling of Chris Woakes . 0 - number of wins registered by England over Test playing nations in the tournament . 0 - the number of centuries scored by a Bangladesh batsman in a World Cup before playing England on Monday. 37.4-1-234-5 - Chris Woakes's tournament bowling figures. 49 - the amount of runs Steven Finn went for in two overs against New Zealand. 'You just feel hollow if I'm being honest. Very, very disappointed. We haven't played well enough, we've got to accept that. 'You just feel like you've let people down, that would be the main emotion. 'I want to carry on desperately. It's certainly not my decision. I hope [to stay]. I'm here to try and make a difference. Certainly on a day like today you look at it and you know we have a lot of work to do in one-day cricket - there's no doubt about that. 'We haven't played well enough in this tournament all the way through. That's something we have to look at. 'It's a game we felt we should have won. We should have chased 275 and we didn't do it - we have to take that on the chin.' England must now play out a dead rubber against Afghanistan on Friday in a tournament that was summed up against Bangladesh by Eoin Morgan's fifth ODI duck in 12 innings. Morgan replaced Alastair Cook as captain shortly before England left for their warm-ups in Australia, with the relatively untested Gary Ballance also drafted in at number three. Moores continued: 'We haven't got a settled team. We've lost two key players at the top of our order (Cook and) Jonathan Trott was the number three, we've lost some players and we accept that, we don't make an excuse of it. We tried to find what we think are the best players to get into that team. 'Gary is a very good one-day player, we felt that was the right decision. He didn't play well enough, Alex (Hales) got his go today. England batsman James Taylor reacts after he was dismissed during the 15-run defeat by Bangladesh .

We've got nine guys who haven't been to a World Cup before. 'That's the reality of it. You make your choice, you pick the side you think is the best team, which we did, and we have to accept they didn't play well enough.' Shane Warne and Kevin Pietersen were among those criticising England on Twitter after their early elimination in the group stages. 'England had the wrong team, the wrong style of play and everyone could see it. Tonight's result is not a shock, I feel for Morgan. Coach is in trouble,' Warne tweeted. Pietersen added: 'I cannot believe this. I just cannot. But, well done Bangladesh! You deserved it! 'Do not say we haven't prioritised ODI cricket! We played a back-to-back Ashes to make sure England played six months of ODIs before this World Cup!' Gary Lineker, the former England striker, said: 'Bangladesh win! Congratulations to them. The good news is, England can't possibly get any worse.' And Piers Morgan wrote: 'What an absolute disgrace. [Paul] Downton and Moores have dragged English cricket into the sporting sewer with their petty, clueless incompetence. 'I want  Downton and Moores sacked today and Kevin Pietersen restored to the team. This farce just reached its true, hideous nadir.

'We've picked guys who can play a brand of cricket that if we performed we could win this World Cup but ultimately we haven't performed,' he told Sky Sports. 'It's pretty poor, obviously to be knocked out of a World Cup this early is unbelievably disappointing. I'm gutted at the moment. We've struggled and fought away since we arrived here. 'One of our big things was to fight quite hard and to try and get through to the quarter-finals and then from there fight our way through the last three games but obviously that's not meant to be.' Morgan added: 'It ultimately comes down to performance and today was an example of where some of our guys performed but we didn't perform as a unit and we've done it for quite a while now. 'Since we've landed in Australia we've tried to address that problem but it hasn't worked. 'Our expectations are a lot higher than the way we've performed so that's extremely disappointing.

"Dick Advocaat has been plotting Sunderland’s survival mission for the past fortnight from him home in Holland. The new boss has revealed that he was waiting for the Black Cats to sack Gus Poyet and was surprised it did not happen sooner. Indeed, in the wake of Sunderland’s 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday there were reports that Advocaat was set to take over, despite this being some 48 hours before Poyet was dismissed. Reports in Holland suggest Dick Advocaat was surprised his predecessor Gus Poyet was not sacked sooner . Poyet was sacked after Sunderland were beaten 4-0 at the Stadium of Light by rivals Aston Villa . Advocaat said John O'Shea (left) will have to play despite not training in the week as the squad is small . The Dutchman said: ‘I expected they would do it (sack Poyet) earlier, but they didn't. ‘Poyet was a coach who is very self-focussed. They were looking for someone with experience, a guy who knows what it's about. For this short time they didn't want to take the risk to get an inexperienced coach.’ Advocaat will take charge of the team for the first time at West Ham tomorrow and, with his new club just one point above the Premier League drop zone, he has revealed his stark message to the players. ‘As I said to the players, it’s quite simple. This is a big, big club – do you want to play in the other league?’ he said. ‘With this club, this stadium, you cannot play in the lower league. I think they realise how important it is. Midfield player Sebastian Larsson has also missed training but will be called upon by Advocaat . Advocaat believes Sunderland have a competitive squad when all of their players are fully fit . ‘We have nine games to go and are still a point ahead, so we have everything in our own hands. ‘Keeping this team in the league is the most important thing. ‘There is enough quality in this squad to stay up. We have a difficult programme, as do the other teams, but it’s all up to us and I have a good feeling about it.’ Meanwhile, it has been reported that Advocaat is open to the idea of staying at the club beyond the end of the season. However, it appears some of that was lost in translation from an interview in his homeland and Sportsmail understands he will return to Holland in May.","Dick Advocaat  named Sunderland manager until the end of the season .

"In my career, I never spat at anybody. It’s such a disgusting act and is one of the most disrespectful things you can do to another human being. In some cultures, people do spit on the floor when they’re angry, but I can’t understand why people would spit at all. Jonny Evans certainly isn’t part of one of those cultures. I don’t understand why people do it, but I did think there was some provocation on Wednesday night. United defender Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse have been charged with spitting during the game . Evans and Cisse were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on Wednesday night . Cisse has accepted a possible seven-game ban while Evans has until 6pm  on Friday, February 6 to respond . It looked like Cisse ran his studs down Evans’s achilles and also made a straight-legged challenge on him. That’s why we saw a transformation in the seemingly mild-mannered Evans. He says he was unaware of any spitting incident, but I find that hard to believe. I was once spat at during a game in Turkey while I was playing for Everton. It was supposed to be a pre-season friendly but it was anything but. Our bus was even stoned by local fans. When I was spat at, it was right into my face. But it wasn’t a case of being so angry I wanted to hit him, I was mostly just shocked. It was an abusive act and it is unacceptable. Luis Suarez (top left) was caught biting Branislav Ivanovic during a Premier League clash in April 2013 . The Chelsea defender appeals to the referee, with Suarez later receiving an eight-game ban for biting . As for punishment, you could argue it is as bad as, if not worse, than biting — and Luis Suarez, then of Liverpool, received an eight-match ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic. Biting causes physical pain, but that is almost a childish, instinctive reaction. To spit in someone’s face is more deliberate and insulting. For me, spitting is worse. But I don’t think spitting merits more than a three-match ban. Yes, there has to be a suspension, but it’s more important to educate players as to how badly incidents such as these come across to those watching the game, particularly youngsters. ‘Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night’s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. ‘I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. 'During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. ‘It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.’ THE GAMES HE COULD MISS FOR UNITED: Arsenal (h), Monday; Tottenham (h), March 15; Liverpool (a), March 22; Aston Villa (h), April 4; Man City (h) April 12; Chelsea (a) April 18. ‘I have apologies to make to a lot of people today. Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny. ‘I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be a positive role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down. ‘I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.’ THE GAMES HE’LL MISS FOR NEWCASTLE: Everton (a), March 15; Arsenal (h), March 21; Sunderland (a), April 5; Liverpool (a), April 13; Tottenham (h), April 19; Swansea (h), April 25; Leicester (a), May 2.","Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse have been charged with spitting at each other during Premier League clash on Wednesday .

"A war veteran who became a high-profile fundraiser and public speaker today appeared in court charged with lying about having PTSD and cancer. Former Royal Signalman Simon Buckden is accused of pretending to suffer from the illnesses in order to obtain money and other perks such as therapy. He is also alleged to have falsely claimed to be a member of the SAS, Leeds Magistrates' Court was told. Charges: Simon Buckden has been accused of lying about having PTSD and cancer . Buckden, 42, was chosen to carry the Olympic torch in 2012 after becoming a leading campaigner for victims of PTSD. He also planned to run 100 marathons in 100 weeks in order to raise money for charity Help for Heroes. But in April 2012, he said he had put the challenge on hold after being diagnosed with rectal cancer. Buckden, from Leeds, was arrested in August last year on suspicion of fraud. He has now been charged with seven counts of fraud by false representation. Campaigner: Buckden was picked to carry the Olympic torch and planned to run 100 marathons in 100 weeks . The court heard that the charges date between October 2009 and December 2013. Buckden, who served in Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda and Northern Ireland, spoke only to give his name, address and date of birth. He will next appear at Leeds Crown Court in two weeks' time. The former soldier was medically discharged from the Army in 2001, after 12 years of service.

"Rafael da Silva's time at Manchester United appears to be at an end with the club willing to listen to offers for the right-back. The Brazilian, 24, is a cult hero at Old Trafford but has not impressed manager Louis van Gaal. He has made just nine appearances this term and despite overcoming injury was left out of the squad for the last two matches against Sunderland and Newcastle. Rafael has not featured for Manchester United since the FA Cup match against Yeovil in January . Rafael has failed to impress manager Louis van Gaal since he arrived at Manchester United . Rafael's tendency to take risks coupled with a fiery temperament have made him a firm fans' favourite. But it is those traits which are thought to have sealed his fate under the methodical Dutch manager. The writing for Rafael has been on the wall throughout the season. Van Gaal has been willing to play others out of position at right back and has been quick to praise youngster Paddy McNair, who recently signed a new contract. Rafael can do nothing to stop Saido Berahino from scoring during the Premier League clash with West Brom . United are interested in bringing Southampton right back Nathaniel Clyne to Old Trafford . United also retain a keen interest in Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne, while reports in Spain claim they are locked in a two-way battle with Real Madrid for Porto's Brazilian right back Danilo. Rafael, last seen in the 2-0 FA Cup win at Yeovil on January 4, will have 12 months remaining on his contract at the end of the summer.

"It's fair to say Mesut Ozil has struggled to adapt to life at Arsenal, but the Gunners midfielder is no quitter and says he is not interested in a move away from the Barclays Premier League this summer. Ozil arrived in north London for a fee of £42million from Real Madrid in 2013 and has drawn criticism for his lack of impact in his first season-and-a-half at the Emirates Stadium. But Ozil says he is now working harder than ever as Arsenal look to reignite their season after their Champions League exit in Monaco, with a charge up the Barclays Premier League table and an FA Cup semi-final against Reading on the horizon. Mesut Ozil doesn't look like he will be waving goodbye to Arsenal this summer after revealing he wants to stay . Ozil played the full 90 minutes of Arsenal's Champions League exit against Monaco on Wednesday night . Questioned on whether he would consider a move back to the Bundesliga after beginning his career there with Schalke, Ozil refuted any chances of quitting Arsenal. 'A return to Germany is not an option for me right now. I am really happy at Arsenal and I want this to continue,' Ozil he told German paper Express. 'I played in the Bundesliga and at Real Madrid. But the English Premier League is the strongest league in the world. Opponents never give up. The German midfielder cannot hide his hurt at full-time, but he is determined to stick it out in north London . Ozil says he is working harder than he ever has done in his career previously with the Gunners . 'Even if we’re 3-0 in front with Arsenal, the players never give up and fight until the very last second. You can only succeed here when you’re on top level physically. 'I’m working as hard as I never worked before in my life. My body is more stable and I feel fresher. You need that in England.' Ozil played the full 90 minutes of the 2-0 win at the Stade Louis II on Tuesday, but that wasn't enough to overturn a 3-1 deficit from the first leg and Arsene Wenger's men crashed out on away goals. Despite his midweek exertions, the Germany international is expected to feature in Saturday's return to the Premier League against Newcastle United at St James' Park.

"Pilots were forced to show off their skills yesterday as stormy weather hit the north of England. And as this incredible video shows, planes flying into Manchester battled against the winds that saw many appear to be 'hovering' on their descent in. Posted on Twitter by user@philip2004, the action was taken from near the airport pub close to the runway. Scroll down for video . As well as tilting from side to side, the plane appears to be 'hovering' as it gets trapped by the wind . Speaking to MailOnline Travel, @philip2004 from Stockport, said 'I'd say the wind was gusting at about 35 miles per hour. 'I never fear the aircraft landing but it did look nice and they will land ok. 'I really need to get filming where I can barely stand up myself.'The only thing is predicting when there's a long enough day of winds. 'The planes were swaying in the wind but it wasn't as big a deal as other days I've seen. I was here for the Emirates one last week when they had to abort the landing.' The wind was thought to only be around 35mph, but the direction and pressure affected the landing . Rob Hunter, British Airline Plot's Association (BALPA) head of flight safety told MailOnline Travel that pilots are well-trained to deal with a crosswind landing. 'The pilots here are performing a cross-wind landing which we train for all the time, and which are not that unusual,' said Mr Hunter. 'The wind is trying to push the aircraft one way, so the pilot has to point the aircraft into the wind until the last minute at which point he or she then turns the aircraft to be head on with the runway. 'This is just one example of the need for well-trained, well-rested professional pilots.' Mr Dodd told MailOnline that he was always confident the plane would make a safe landing . As well as capturing the windy landing for an Etihad 777, he also videoed British Airways and easyJet planes having a less-than comfortable descent. Last week he was on hand to catch a 'go around' of an Emirates A380 when it couldn't land due to high winds. The plane that had flown in from Dubai came around a second time, and despite a few wobbly moments, made a safe landing. After getting over a period of crosswinds, the Etihad jet approached the runway effortlessly . It was by no means the most comfortable of landings, but all passengers were safe on board . The manoeuvre meant the passengers were only delayed by 25 minutes; a scheduled landing of 11.20am turned into 11.45am. One eyewitness told the Manchester Evening News: 'This is a huge plane which we see come over every day and it's quite unusual to see it do a go-around like it did.' In January this year, planes were battered by 100mph winds when trying to land at Leeds Bradford International Airport. One propeller plane - a Flybe flight - looks particularly precarious as it swings from side to side on the approach. Pushed sideways onto the runway, the plane almost seems to land nose-first as it struggles against the gusts. Leeds Bradford Airport is considered one of the most difficult airports to land at in the UK. Its altitude sees it hit by strong winds in bad weather. But these skilled pilots show how flights compensate for the high winds, by approaching at an extreme angle. Footage emerged after a North Atlantic storm hit the UK, causing the strongest wind gusts in over 50 years.","Spectacular footage captured by Twitter by user@philip2004 on the ground .

"Manchester City might have seen their Champions League dreams end in Barcelona on Wednesday night, but they are the Barclays Premier League's big winners this season in terms of money made from taking part in Europe's premier competition. Defeat at the Nou Camp left Manuel Pellegrini's men with just the Premier League title to fight for in what is looking increasingly like a disappointing season at the Etihad Stadium, on the pitch at least. Off it, City's staff will be delighted to be able to bring in £28.4million-worth of revenue from their participation in Europe, more than Chelsea and Arsenal - who both joined City in dropping out at this stage - and group stage flops Liverpool. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and his team-mates had a tough night in Barcelona on Wednesday . Chelsea were knocked out by Paris Saint-Germain at the same stage as City but take home less money . The reasoning behind City's increased income is their league positioning from last year, which affects the market pool shared between the clubs and accounts for half of the money paid to participating clubs. The Premier League champions  get 40 per cent of the money set aside for English sides, with Liverpool taking 30 per cent, Chelsea on 20 per cent and Arsenal getting just 10 per cent. The other half of money paid to clubs comes from prize money  based on the stage they are knocked out at. Given their third-place position in the Premier League last year and having advanced to the second round with City and Arsenal, Chelsea are the second biggest earners on £28.4m. Santi Cazorla is consoled after Arsenal's defeat to Monaco - they earned the same amount as Liverpool . Steven Gerrard and his Liverpool team-mates topped up their earnings with a brief Europa League flirtation . Group stage . Second round . Quarter-finals . Semi-finals . Runner-up . Winner . £6.2million . £2.5m (£8.7m total) £2.8m (£11.5m total) £3.5m (£15m total) £4.6m (£19.6m total) £7.5m (£22.5m total) Figures exclude market pool share, clubs also earn £700,000 per group stage win and £350,000 per group stage draw . London rivals Arsenal brought in the same level of revenue as Liverpool - £21.6m. This comes down to the Anfield club's better league position last season - second rather than fourth - plus the topping up of their total by £0.8m from a brief stint in the Europa League. Come the final in Berlin on June 6, whoever lifts the famous trophy could pick up a prize pot approaching £26.8m, dependent on their group stage results, and that's before the market pool money is considered. They also get the chance of another payday in the UEFA Super Cup next season, played between the Champions League and Europa League winners. That one-off game paid out £2.1m to this season's victors, Real Madrid.","Manchester City will be paid £28.4m for their Champions League efforts .
That is £3.8m more than their nearest Premier League rivals, Chelsea .
Liverpool and Arsenal, also knocked out, both earn £21.6m from UEFA .
The difference for City comes from their position as English champions .
Eventual winners of Champions League could make around £40m ."
"In the aftermath of Lionel Messi's masterclass, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini repeated that he does not fear losing his job at the end of the season. But with the ruthless Chelsea machine far in the Premier League distance and no chance of silverware from cup competitions, the Chilean's ageing, expensively-assembled side look certain to end the campaign trophyless - a relative drought that will not go down well in the desert residence of the club's owners. Here, Sportsmail looks at five men who could replace Pellegrini in the Etihad hot seat in the summer should he be given the boot. Manuel Pellegrini could be dismissed as Manchester City boss with the club facing a trophyless season . 1. Frank de Boer . With four Dutch titles in a row under his belt the Ajax supremo is the most attainable of the candidates in the running. The innovative 44-year-old introduced youth and creativity to an ageing, underperforming side and would appear to fit the bill. However, City are famously looking for Champions League progression and three group stage exits in a row in Amsterdam may undermine his case. That said, De Boer would have resources at City he could only dream about with Ajax. Do not rule out a Dutch dynasty in Manchester. Frank de Boer has won four Eredivisie titles in a row during his time as manager at Ajax . De Boer's case may be weakened by three group stage Champions League exits with Ajax . 2. Pep Guardiola . The Bayern Munich boss is well-known to City executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain from their time together at the Nou Camp and would appear to be the obvious choice. Begiristain, City's director of football, held that role at Barcelona while Guardiola was coach and the men are close friends. Guardiola himself has spoken of his desire to coach in England. Timing however, is the issue. Pep Guardiola is well known to City executives but his contract at Bayern Munich expires next season . Guardiola was on hand to witness City's demise at the hands of former side Barcelona on Wednesday . The 44-year-old's contract in Bavaria does not expire until next summer and he has already ruled out leaving before then. Interestingly that coincides with the end of Pellegrini's deal at the Etihad... 3. Diego Simeone . The Argentine's stock went through the roof after last season's logic-defying La Liga title and Champions League final appearance. A defence of that title looks unlikely but by qualifying for the Champions League quarter-finals the Man in Black has delivered another work of fantasy. Diego Simeone celebrates with his Atletico Madrid players after leading them to La Liga glory last season . Simeone got Atletico to the quarter-final of the Champions League and could be on the verge of a new deal . With Real Madrid and Barcelona retaining their rights to plunder most of the money from TV rights, an exit born of frustration may well have been on the cards. But Simeone's sister and representative Natalia dismissed talk of a move away, stating that her sibling was close to signing a new deal at the Vicente Calderon where he is loved like no other. 4. Carlo Ancelotti . Odds on the veteran Italian swapping Madrid for Manchester could shorten as early as this weekend, when his men take on Barcelona in El Clasico. Carlo Ancelotti celebrates winning the Champions League with Real Madrid last season . But the Italian is under pressure this year after Madrid were replaced by Barcelona at the top of La Liga . Lose and it could be two years in a row without a La Liga crown, which is not acceptable for the Bernabeu masses. Win, and with a Champions League quarter-final to come, Ancelotti may not be going anywhere. 5. Patrick Vieira . There is little doubt that the Arsenal legend will one day be gunning for the top job at City. Vieira has impressed during his stint in charge of City's youngsters after inheriting a shambles. He makes the right noises, is loved by his players and is respected within the club. Vieira is young and ambitious but currently lacks the experience needed for the role. Expect him to be the man who replaces the man who replaces Pellegrini. Patrick Vieira has impressed City bosses with his work at the club overhauling the youth system .","Manuel Pellegrini  facing up to a trophyless season at Manchester City .

"Great players with baggage like Yaya Toure are always worth the aggro when they are on top of their game. But when their form dips and yet they remain high maintenance, there is only ever one outcome. It happened to Roy Keane whose tantrums and outbursts were tolerated by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United until the moment he no longer justified his place in the team. After the embarrassing mis-match in the Nou Camp when Barcelona could have scored at least six against Manchester City, you feel that time is rapidly running out for Toure and others like Vincent Kompany and Edin Dzeko. This summer will surely see a major transfusion of personnel at the Etihad if they are to challenge Europe's best. Midfielder Yaya Toure struggled to impress as City crashed out of the Champions League to Barcelona . City were happy to put up with the baggage that came with Toure (right) while he was performing at his best . City captain and defender Vincent Kompany (right) contests for the ball alongside Barcelona's Luis Suarez . Defender Pablo Zabaleta has been left out of City's team for their biggest games this season . Toure became the Premier League's best-paid player when he signed for Roberto Mancini from Barcelona in 2010. In domestic football, he has been an unqualified success and scored 24 goals last season as City won their second championship. His world-class strike against Sunderland at Wembley won Manuel Pellegrini the Capital One Cup. When things were rosy, the club were happy to overlook constant talk about him being linked with other clubs, his pushiness to secure improved contracts and a farcical stand-off about not being treated with enough respect on his birthday. Premier League managers felt the midfielder didn't do enough of the hard yards to protect City defensively but they were unable to capitalise much because when Yaya had the ball he was an unstoppable force of nature. But those days have gone and the 31-year-old's hapless showing against Barcelona as City crashed out of the Champions League underlined he is not the man to push the club forward any more. His dereliction of duty to allow Ivan Rakitic the space to score Barca's winner was noted immediately. Going forward, his shooting was wayward and he was taken off before the end by Pellegrini – unthinkable one or two years ago. Remember, Toure had been banned for the previous three games in Europe and this was his big chance to show the world what he was still capable of. The club are in no hurry to offer the current African Player of the Year a new deal at anything like the £240,000-a-week terms of his last contract. Indeed, with Financial Fair Play now increasingly important, the temptation to offload him and his wages to Inter Milan this summer to allow new blood is very tempting. Striker Edin Dzeko could be considered as dispensable by City in the summer if they have an overhaul . Joe Hart (right) was in inspired form during Manchester City's 1-0 defeat to Barcelona on Wednesday . Striker Sergio Aguero (left) missed a penalty as City were eliminated 3-1 on aggregate by Barcelona . City defender Martin Demichelis (left) challenges Messi of Barcelona for possession of the ball . City's failure to reach Europe's last eight under their Abu Dhabi owners will create a major rethink at the club this summer. All their marquee names like Sergio Aguero and David Silva were signed before Pellegrini's arrival in 2013. While their rivals are signing young, hungry, world-class players like Eden Hazard, Alexis Sanchez and Philippe Coutinho, City looked ageing and stilted in the Nou Camp. Toure symbolises the malaise but he's not the only one. Skipper Vincent Kompany has been off the boil all season and can no longer lead while his personal form is so patchy. At 30 years old, Pablo Zabaleta is still able to cope with run-of-the-mill league games but it's interesting he has been left out of the really big matches like Chelsea away and Barcelona away. Edin Dzeko isn't going to get any better, neither is Martin Demichelis or Aleksandar Kolarov. If they stay at City, they will only be squad players and in the case of Dzeko in particular his wages are astronomical compared with strikers at other clubs. The new signings from Txiki Begiristain have been flops. Fernando, Eliaquim Mangala and Wilfried Bony cost £72million and yet none of them are considered good enough to start. Stevan Jovetic, a young and skilful import from Serie A, has fallen so far down the pecking order he was sacrificed from City's Champions League squad, reduced as an FPP punishment. Aleksandar Kolarov (centre) is crowded out by Messi (left) and Ivan Rakitic of Barcelona . Stevan Jovetic was removed from City's Champions League squad to accommodate Wilfried Bony . James Milner (right) chases after Messi in the Champions League clash between Barcelona and City . It is such a far cry from the excitement of the first few years under Sheik Mansour. He broke the British transfer record on his first day and while Robinho didn't work out, it did create a buzz around the place. Aguero, Silva and Toure were dazzling signings. City need to get back to that and go for the likes of Raheem Sterling, Gareth Bale and Arjen Robben if they are going to threaten clubs like Barcelona. It means a major clearout this summer and Toure could well be on the list.","Yaya Toure produced another underwhelming display against Barcelona .

"So it has once again fallen on Everton to prevent the Barclays Premier League suffering a week of complete ignominy in Europe. Roberto Martinez's side have risen to the challenge regularly this season but now they are set for their biggest test here in Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium. Can they do it? Sportsmail looks at five reasons why they can keep carrying the flag for England. Everton's players jog around the running track at Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium on Wednesday . BUBBLING CONFIDENCE . Had Everton travelled here last week, their prospects would not have been so positive but the mood is significantly different thanks to back-to-back victories at Goodison Park against Kiev in the first leg and then Newcastle on Sunday. It is the first time since November Everton have managed to put two results like that together and it has made a big difference to the mood of the squad. Once this group gets on a roll and has confidence, they can meet challenges head on and they won't shirk what is in front of them. 'We know that it is going to be a tough game,' said Seamus Coleman. 'We were very impressed with Kiev in the first leg and they have got good players, like (Andrei) Yarmolenko. But we have come here with confidence and we want to go through to the next round.' Everton midfielder Ross Barkley scores his side's final goal in their 3-0 win against Newcastle on Sunday . LETHAL LUKAKU . After enduring a difficult spell in the middle of the season, Everton's record signing is beginning to deliver big goals at the right moments. He has scored 10 goals in his last 14 appearances, including the scruffy penalty which secured a first leg advantage. That strike made him Everton's leading European scorer with seven and he has been proficient at coming up with big moments in this competition, such as hat-trick in Berne and a group-winning goal in Wolfsburg. He will fancy his chances of maintaining that sequence tonight. Romelu Lukaku celebrates scoring his 10th goal in his last 14 games against Newcastle last weekend . Club legend Graeme Sharp and Everton in the Community coaches deliver a coaching session to local kids . DIFFERENT DEMANDS, DIFFERENT TEAM . If Everton have been erratic in the Premier League, playing in Europe has liberated them. Martinez puts domestic struggles down to the fact they lost a lot of ground in the race for fourth place early on and ultimately lost heart for a period. In Europe, though, they have had a sense of freedom and have been liberated by the chance to achieve something significant. They have won six of their nine games so far and the players are determined to not let the opportunity slip. 'We are going to approach it the way we approach every game,' said Ross Barkley, who will have a key role to fulfil. 'We did well at home and hopefully now we can do that in the away game. We have to be positive and give our all.' Manager Roberto Martinez (left) and Seamus Coleman speak to the media ahead of Thursday's last 16 tie . Martinez poses with a group of local children inside Dynamo Kiev's Olympic Stadium on Wednesday . SOMETHING IN THE YEAR? This is a pithy point but seasons ending with a '5' have been good for Everton; 1985 saw them win the European Cup Winners' Cup. 1995 brought the FA Cup, their last piece of silverware; 2005 ended with David Moyes guiding them to a top four finish, while 1915 heralded their second league title. Everton will, of course, need more than omens to get through but there has long been a feeling within the squad that they have the ability to go all the way to the final in Warsaw and they want to create their own history. Graeme Sharp, Kevin Sheedy, Trevor Steven and Andy Gray hold the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1985 . NO FEAR . Much has been made of Dynamo's formidable home record – they are unbeaten in the Olympic Stadium this season – but Everton are not going to sit back and hope to sneak through. By playing their natural game, Martinez believes they have an outstanding chance of progress. 'We have to be attack minded and when we are on the ball, we need to be a team that wants to score goals and make it very much eye to eye and an open game,' said Martinez. 'That's what I'm looking for tomorrow, that we can make it a game full of chances for us . 'I don't want it to be a game where they are a home team, and let them see if they can break us down. That would be a big mistake. It is wanting to achieve something historic and special for us and make our fans proud in Europe – which is what we are doing.'

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes his side cannot expect to just defend deep and look to hit Manchester United on the counter-attack if they are to secure safe passage into the semi-finals of the FA Cup on Monday night. The Gunners head to Old Trafford on the back of a fine run in the Barclays Premier League, with sevens win in the last eight games putting them third, now a point ahead of United. The last time Wenger took his side to Manchester at the end of January, they produced what many believe was a pivotal defensive-minded display to beat City 2-0.

Wenger, though, maintains a concentrated rear-guard action alone will not be enough to see off Louis van Gaal's side, who continue to grind out results despite a wave of criticism over their style of play. 'At Manchester City, we scored the first goal, then we were on a defensive foot because they had to come out, and that (who scores first on Monday night) is not predictable today (before the game),' said Wenger. 'But what is for sure is both teams will go for it, so that means we will have to attack well and defend well.' Arsenal won against City despite having only 35 per cent possession.

You also have to look at ways of possession - is it in your own half or is it in the opponents half? If it is in your half, it can be a bit illusionary possession,' said the Arsenal boss. 'I still think possession is an important part of the game - you cannot go into a game and say you do not want the ball. 'Sometimes you do not have the ball because your opponent is better, sometimes you are leading 1-0 or 2-0 and your team is focused on defending the advantage.

"A mysterious silent flash which lit up the Russian night sky has baffled people and sparked theories of extraterrestrial activity. Experts have said the blue and white burst of light, which illuminated Stavropol in southern Russia, is not natural. The strange glow was not accompanied by any sound, according to witnesses, and made the city's street lights briefly go out.

'I was very frightened by what I saw, I was already in bed,' said one woman, according to the website. 'It looked as if something very bright lit up my ceiling.' The flash was captured on a vehicle dashboard camera at around 12.39am on Monday morning. According to local reports weather experts and scientists have been unable to explain the strange phenomenon. But they have agreed the source of the mysterious light was most likely at ground level. This shows the view from the vehicles dashboard camera moments before the strange glow illuminated the night sky . One local woman said that she was 'very frightened by what I saw,' from the bedroom of her home . The phenomenon was said to have knocked out the city's street lights and caused bulbs to flicker . Theories include that the glow could have been caused by a military exercise, faults in the electricity network, the Northern Lights, an asteroid and even a UFO.

"Lionel Messi just keeps on finding new ways to stake his claim for status of greatest player ever. He's done the two-goal games, the three-goal games, even the four-goal games; throughout Spain on Thursday he was being hailed for a game he didn't even score in. The victory over Manchester City was being seen as the most one-side 1-0 in the history of 1-0 wins and the man who set up the winner was given Man of the Match in all the reports of Barcelona’s passage to the last eight. It was a game in which, for once, he had broken no records…only Manchester City's spirit, with a mesmerising display that left them doubting if they were worthy of being on the same pitch as him. Lionel Messi joins in the celebrations with Ivan Rakitic and Luis Suarez after the first-half goal . Messi taunts the Man City defence on the edge of the penalty area during a classy performance . Messi delivered a man of the match performance as he ran the City defence ragged at the Nou Camp . Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo hailed the 'Fantasic' Lionel Messi after his 'masterclass' against Manchester City that included 'nutmegs, dribbles and an assist', while he also featured on the front cover of Sport . Messi does that to opponents, not just bamboozling them with skill but undermining any confidence they may have that they can live with him. 'The best I've ever seen' said Javier Mascherano and Jordi Alba called it ‘another recital’ but in truth players don’t like what’s known as ‘the Messi question’ because whatever answer they give is going to be inadequate alongside the man they are trying to describe. ‘I'm just glad he plays for us said Luis Enrique'. The two nutmegs – one on Fernandinho and one on James Milner – reminded many of something the coach said before he managed Barcelona. He said that Messi stands out from the rest not because he necessarily does anything different to other players, but that he does it in big games against big name rivals. All footballers grow up being able to belittle far inferior rivals – they do it on the school playground against other kids first, then in youth academies against youngsters with less talent, and then eventually in training as senior professionals against the reserve-team centre-backs. But Messi, in contrast, does it against internationals in big matches all the time. James Milner approaches Barcelona star Lionel Messi during their Champions League tie on Wednesday . Messi slips the ball through Manchester City midfielder Milner's legs at the Nou Camp . It’s easy to laugh at his Manchester City victims but they are just two more of a long line as Messi takes playground football on to the big stage and runs rings around everybody just as in those grainy videos of him aged six and seven playing Baby-Football in Argentina. It was fitting that Pep Guardiola was looking on on Wednesday night. The Bayern Munich coach was there with a view to scouting potential quarter-final opponents. It was Guardiola who transformed Messi from a wide attacker in Barca's front three to a deep-lying attacker – the famous false nine. Anyone who thought that would be the last Messi innovation was wrong – who knows where the Argentine was playing last night? He now has complete freedom to go where he wants on the pitch and spends large chunks of games with a deep right-sided midfield spot as his starting position. That was where he found himself when he seemed to draw the entire Manchester City side to him in the first half, just before he released Ivan Rakitic for the goal that won the game on the night for Barcelona. Milner slides as Messi nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their Champions League match . Former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola reacts to the nutmeg in the stands at the Nou Camp . Bayern Munich manager Guardiola reacts to the ridiculous skill from Messi during the Barca match . The new ‘more roving than ever’ role even begs the question is it time for coaches to start trying to man-mark him? That in turn begs another question – would he have been so good in the age of cynical man-marking that allowed hatchet-men to scythe down great players without punishment? That variable always needs to be factored-in to comparisons between him and Diego Maradona. On Thursday in Barcelona the over-riding sentiment was: It’s good that football is not like that anymore, and we can enjoy Messi the magician to the absolute maximum.","Lionel Messi was man of the match against Manchester City on Wednesday .

"Arsene Wenger has insisted there is no European crisis for English clubs despite a second year out of three with no representatives in the last eight of the Champions League – but he does believe it is time to change the away-goals rule. Arsenal and Chelsea both crashed out of the competition on away goals in the first knockout stage, beaten by Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Wenger, however, has long championed a change to the rule. Arsenal crashed out of the Champions League on away goals despite beating Monaco on Tuesday . Monaco scored three away goals at the Emirates which proved to be the difference in the tie . If at the end of two-legged tie the score is level, the team that has scored the most goals away from home is declared the winner. For example, Monaco beat Arsenal 3-1 away from home before losing 2-0 in Monte Carlo. With the score tied at 3-3, Monaco progressed courtesy of having scored on more goal on their travels. 'That's a rule that's outdated now and should be changed,' the Arsenal boss said. 'It should count maybe after extra-time. It was created in the 1960s to get teams to attack away from home. 'Since then football has changed and the weight of the away goals is too big today. Maybe count it after extra-time like in the League Cup in England. 'I think the quality of Premier League is high and physical demands are extreme but I'm not in the mood to analyse too much what's wrong with English football. I don't think there's a lot wrong.' Wenger must pick up his players ahead of Saturday's game at Newcastle as the battle for a top-four finish in the Premier League continues. He added: 'The mood is down and we are disappointed. The tie lasted 180 minutes and we were not cautious enough in the first 90. We know why we went out, it's down to a dreadful defensive performance in the first leg. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger wants the away-goals rule changed in European competition . Manchester City were the third English club to be knocked out at the last-16 stage after they lost to Barcelona . 'We must focus on next targets and we have to continue to improve. We are better today than four months ago. 'Let's keep that attitude. There's a fantastic spirit and great quality. Let's rectify what we didn't do well in first game and continue to improve. 'We've won 13 of the last 15 and that's down to quality and improvement. We are not in a transfer period. Ninety-five per cent of the players will still be here next season and what is important is their attitude and improvement. We are in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, and in a strong fight in the Premier League. We can do that straight away on Saturday. 'We're on a good run. We won the game in Monaco. We're frustrated and disappointed to go out but that's down to our home performance especially on the defensive front. We were a bit unlucky as well. If you look at shots on target by Monaco in the two games they've been quite efficient.'","Arsenal and Chelsea crashed out of the Champions League on away goals .

A statement from local government officials identified the remaining victims as Laurent Sbasnik, Lucie Mei-Dalby, Volodia Guinard, Brice Guilbert and Edouard Gilles, as well as Argentine pilots Juan Carlos Castillo and Roberto Abate. The accident happened at around 5pm on Monday shortly after the two aircraft took off in a mountainous region of La Rioja, in Argentina's north west. Rebecca Adlington and Amir Khan were among those to have paid tribute. Great Britain's two-time Olympic champion Adlington wrote on Twitter of the 25-year-old on Tuesday: 'So sad and shocked to wake up to hear the tragic death of Camille Muffat. She was an amazing sportswoman, competitor and lovely person. Scroll down for video . Alexis Vastine, a boxer who won bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics (left) and Florence Arthaud, who won the transatlantic sailing race Route du Rhum in 1990, were also reported to have been killed . Ten people, including eight cast of a French reality TV show and two Argentine pilots, have died after their helicopters collided over a mountain range in La Rioja province, officials say . This is believed to be the last picture of the three Olympians (on the right) before the crash . Camille Muffat, 25 . The Swimmer won a Gold, Silver and Bronze medal at London 2012, finishing ahead of Rebecca Adlington to win the 400m freestyle. A former World record holder over 400m and 800m, she was also a World and European champion. Alexis Vastine, 28 . Won Bronze at the Beijing Olympics light welterweight boxing. He lost in controversial fashion in the London games. Florence Arthaud, 57 . A sailor who won the Route du Rhum in 1990, Arthaud had survived a car crash aged 17 which left her in a coma. 'My thoughts go out to not only all her friends and family but to all the family and friends of all the 10 victims. Its an extremely sad day. 'RIP Olympic Champion Camille Muffat. You will be dearly missed. X' Twenty-eight-year-old Vastine claimed light welterweight bronze at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, while 57-year-old Arthaud was considered one of the world's best sailors. Khan, who secured a lightweight silver medal for GB at the 2004 Olympics before going on to become a pro world champion, told Press Association Sport: 'I'm very sad to hear of the passing of Alexis Vastine. 'I had the pleasure of competing against him in the amateurs and would like to send my deepest condolences to all his family and friends during this difficult time.' Disel Cuneo, government spokesman for the province, said: 'There are several French nationals among the victims. So far we only know of two Argentine victims.' Another provincial spokesman, Horacio Alarcon, said that the two helicopters appeared to have collided during filming. 'There are no survivors,' he added. Camille Muffat was a former world record holder for the 400m  women's freestyle from 2012 until 2013. She won gold during the 400m freestyle at London 2012, earned silver in the women's 200m freestyle, and a bronze as a member of the women's 4×200m freestyle relay. She was the third Frenchwoman in history to earn three medals in a summer or winter Olympic Games and was named the 2012 French Sportswoman of the Year. It is thought that the two craft crashed into one another during filming for a survival show which was taking place just after 5pm local time . Alexis Vastine won bronze for boxing in the Light Welterweight category at the Beijing Olympics, and competed at London 2012, but was knocked out in the quarter finals. Florence Arthaud was regarded as one of the world's best sailors, and won the Route du Rhum, a transatlantic single-handed yacht race that takes place every four years. She took first place in 1990 with her boat Pierre 1er. Sylvain Wiltord, a 40-year-old former Arsenal footballer who won two Premier League titles and two FA Cups, was in the show, but was not on board either of the helicopters. Wiltord tweeted early this morning: 'I am sad for my friends, I'm trembling, I'm horrified, I have no words, I don't want to say anything'. 'The brutal demise of our compatriots is an immense sadness,' said French President Francois Hollande in a statement published on the website of the French daily Liberation. Irish boxer Paddy Barnes, who also won Bronze in 2008, tweeted of his shock at hearing about Vastine's death. The crash happened close to the village of Villa Castelli in the Andes mountain region of La Rioja province . A spokesman for the local government said that weather appeared to have been clear at the time of the crash, adding that there was no further information on what caused the accident . 'RIP Alex Vastine! French Olympic boxer who won a bronze medal in Beijing 2008! Trained with him many times, terrible news!' he wrote. Alain Bernard, 31, and another swimmer who won gold at the London Olympics is also among the show's survivors. The group were taking part in a French version of the Swedish survival show Dropped, in which athletic celebrities are abandoned in harsh environments and left to survive. On the website of Zodiak Media, who produce the show, it says: 'With no food, no map, and no help, [contestants] must make their way through unforgiving landscapes, in a race to find civilisation, and a helicopter to take them to the next location. 'A daily radio message from the show's host is their only indication as to how far they've gone. Each week, the losing team faces an elimination challenge, until only four contestants remain.' Mr Alarcon said the weather conditions were good and the cause of the crash was unknown. No further details have been released on the identities of the victims, thought it has been reported by local news stations that one of the pilots was from the province. Images on Argentine television showed the wreckage of the two helicopters lying in flames on the barren scrubland. The helicopters were flying over Quebrada El Yeso and Quebrada Condado, two locations in the mountain region of La Rioja, located 700 miles north of the capital Buenos Aires. It is thought that one of the vehicles belonged to the regional government, while the other came from the nearby Santiago del Estero province.","Swimmer Camille Muffat,  London 2012 gold medalist, thought to have died .

"Of all the players Manchester City might have expected to drive the final nail into their Champions League coffin Ivan Rakitic was a long way down the list, but it was the former Sevilla midfielder who got the goal on Wednesday night. Here MailSport takes a closer look at the Croatian midfielder more than proving his worth in his first season at the Nou Camp. Ivan Rakitic superbly lifts the ball over the on-rushing Joe Hart to give Barcelona the lead against Man City . Rakitic loops the ball over Hart and past Vincent Kompany to earn Barcelona a 1-0 lead at the Nou Camp . When he signed in the summer what was the reaction? There was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons – firstly they need midfielders after selling Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea and Thiago to Bayern Munich, and second Rakitic was, along with his fellow countryman Luka Modric, the best midfielder in La Liga last season. Is he an improvement on the aforementioned Fabregas and Thiago? Thiago has the potential to be the best of the three but appalling luck with injuries has stalled his career. Is Rakitic better than Cesc? Probably not but he has many of the same characteristics so that has made him a worthy replacement. The Croatia international challenges for the ball with Manchester City midfielder James Milner . Rakitic was brought to Barcelona from Sevilla for £14million to replace Cesc Fabregas, who joined Chelsea . And those characteristics are? He is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club Sevilla and he can play deep in front of the centre-back as he also did, although less so for his former team, and as he did for Barça last Saturday away at Eibar. Much like his compatriot at Real Madrid Modric, he can tackle, pass, and shoot. He’s a very complete midfielder. Who brought him to Spain? Sevilla signed him from Schalke for €2.5m. It was another work of genius from the club’s Sporting Director Monchi because within a very short space of time it was clear Rakitic was destined for bigger things and would make the club a tidy profit. Rakitic (laying down on left of trophy) captained Sevilla to Europa League glory in 2014 . Rakitic was born in Switzerland but plays international football for Croatia . Did he consider England? His wife, Raquel Mauri, is a hairdresser from Sevilla, and so he preferred to stay in Spain. When Barcelona came calling it was a no-brainer. He was close to going to Chelsea as a 16-year-old but his father advised him to move to Schalke instead. The language was not going to be a problem wherever he went because the Swiss born Croatian international speaks five languages. And his battle with Modric will be one to look out for on Sunday? It will. And even more so because Rakitic was denied the chance to face his international team-mate in the first Clasico of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven. Rakitic is mobbed by his Barcelona team-mates after opening the scoring against City on Wednesday . Midfielder Rakitic is joined in celebration by Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar Jnr . How did that work out for Luis Enrique? Badly. Many had tipped the coach to resist the temptation of giving Luis Suarez his debut after so long out, move Iniesta forward to the front three and bring in Xavi alongside Rakitic. Instead Luis Enrique dropped Rakitic despite the fact that he had been playing well and lined Xavi up alongside Andres Iniesta. ‘They are great players but they are not getting any younger,’ Paul Clement told me after the game. Barca started well but lost control of midfielder and ultimately the match. Without Rakitic they were completely out-run in the middle of the park. When he is at his best, he is their engine. Now he’s back in the team for good? He didn’t start against Malaga and Barca lost 1-0. He then played and scored against Granada. He is becoming a leader on the pitch and has bought into the ideas of sacrifice and generosity at Barcelona having been very much the talisman of the team at Sevilla. When he scored against Grandada he approached the bench to dedicate the goal to his best pal in the dressing room – the German keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and he even said of Luis Enrique: ‘He knows what he is doing, we have to trust in him.’ Former Sevilla and Schalke midfielder Rakitic attempts to escape the attention of Yaya Toure .","Ivan Rakitic scored winning goal against Manchester City on Wednesday .

"Police arrested former Premier League footballer Calum Davenport for allegedly assaulting one of his own team-mates after a local league match in Bedfordshire. Davenport, 32, a former England Under 21 defender who played for West Ham, has been bailed by officers after a man in his 30s received head injuries in the away changing room at Cranfield United. Both men were playing for Elstow Abbey FC and Davenport had been sent off. Calum Davenport (pictured here in 2009) was arrested for allegedly assaulting his team-mate . Davenport was arrested after playing for Elstow Abbey at Cranfield United (ground pictured above) Village football club Elstow play in Division 1 of the Bedfordshire County Football League . His Premier League career ended in August 2009 when he was stabbed in the legs by his sister's boyfriend. Ed Frost, chairman of Cranfield United told the Bedfordshire on Sunday: 'The incident occurred in the away changing room between away players, it was isolated there and didn't spill over into the club house. 'This followed a tense game between two teams at the top of the table, in which Mr Davenport was sent off in the latter stages.' An ambulance spokeswoman said: 'The East of England Ambulance Service Trust was called to an incident on Crawley Road at 3.32pm on Saturday, March 14. Davenport had spells at West Ham and Tottenham but struggled to hold down a first-team place at either club . 'An ambulance was called to a man in his 30s with a suspected head injury and who was taken unwell. He was taken to Bedford Hospital for further care.' Bedfordshire Police have bailed Davenport until April 17. The defender started his career at Coventry before joining Tottenham for £1.3million but he only made 20 appearances over three years and spent time on loan at West Ham, Southampton and Norwich. Davenport joined the Hammers permanently in 2007 but was again farmed out on loan, to Watford and Sunderland. He spent two years with United Counties team Wootton Blue Cross in a bid to regain fitness ahead of a return to the senior game which never transpired. In 2009, Davenport was charged with assaulting his sister during an incident in which he was stabbed in both legs. He was later cleared of all charges.

"England prop Mako Vunipola will be gripped by anticipation as Saturday's decisive RBS 6 Nations clash with France nears its climax, knowing he could have a critical late role to play. Wales and Ireland are also competing for the title on an afternoon of staggered kick-offs that promises a nerve-shredding conclusion to a Championship that will almost certainly be decided by points difference. Favourites England are in the driving seat as they will be aware of the target they require if they are to lift a first piece of silverware under head coach Stuart Lancaster, raising the prospect of a pivotal final quarter at Twickenham. Mako Vunipola (right) is anticipating a tense Six Nations finale when England play France on Saturday . Stuart Lancaster's England side could win the Six Nations, with the World Cup later on in the year . Vunipola cold be unleashed to help England get extra points against France in the final moments of the game . It is in the midst of this scenario that explosive front row Vunipola will be summoned from the bench and ordered to wreak as much havoc as possible for the brief time he is on the pitch. 'The last 15 minutes against France could be the most crucial spell of our Six Nations so far, so we know we have to come on and make a difference,' Vunipola said. 'As a bench we're always trying to have an impact on the game. When you're coming on in the last 10-15 minutes, there can't be any excuses like you're tired. 'Every replacement player gets restless in that second half. We all want to get on as soon as possible and get ourselves into the game. 'Around the 60-minute mark you're on the edge of your seat waiting for the coach to give you the heads-up, but you have to try and stay relaxed and composed until you get the call. 'When you go on, the first thing to do is ensure the set-piece is stable and then try to get involved as much as possible, get your hands on the ball, make tackles, get around the pitch and make an impact. 'The bench has a massive role to play in the game now. It's not just about the XV, it's about the 23-man squad. 'France have world-class players on their bench who come on and make a massive difference for them. We have to make sure we do the same.' Vunipola will operate in the eye of the storm as the giant English and French packs slug it out over 80 minutes in search of the foothold that will propel their team to victory. Vunipola feels France players such as Romain Taofifenua (left) and Alexandre Flanquart will be a hard test . Vunipola says France's physicality will provide a  challenge for England as they look for Six Nations glory . Lock Courtney Lawes has described Les Bleus' forwards as 'big dudes' and Vunipola insists the Red Rose must be ready to fight fire with fire as they seek to end a sequence of three successive runners-up finishes in the Six Nations. 'We've seen the threat France pose with their pack and they have some big, heavy boys with an all-round game, but their set-piece is their bread and butter,' Vunipola said. 'As a pack we have to stand up to them first and foremost and then challenge them with our all-court game. 'I think they're the biggest pack we play against. Uini Atonio (tighthead prop, 6'4' and 25 stones) is a big boy and you don't want him running at you at full pace. 'They have some big boys, but we have some big boys ourselves so we have to stand up to them and match them in terms of physicality. 'These big forwards nowadays are massive but they can still get around the pitch.' Vunipola also referred to the threat posed by France's tighthead prop Uini Atonio ahead of the encounter . England start as pre-match favourites and are 4/5 to win the Championship, but Vunipola insists they must be pitch perfect if he is to celebrate winning the title alongside brother and team-mate Billy. 'Winning the Six Nations has been our target and to do it would be massive. We lost to Ireland but now have another chance to do it. We will have to perform at our best to beat France,' Vunipola said. 'Just to win the Six Nations is special. The added bonus would be that my brother will be there. It's added motivation for us to go out there and perform.'","England's points difference can see them win Six Nations on Saturday .

"Tim Sherwood insists senior figures at Tottenham wanted to ‘sacrifice’ England newboy Harry Kane to bring in a foreign striker as recently as January 2014. The Aston Villa manager said he refused to sanction any such move as head coach and instead picked the then unproven centre-forward regularly during the run-in. Sherwood said: ‘There were people at club who wanted to bring in another striker and sacrifice Harry Kane. I wouldn’t allow that to happen. They know who they are. Tim Sherwood was not prepared to 'sacrifice' Harry Kane to bring in an expensive striker last January . Gabriel Agbonlahor and Carlos Sanchez were in good spirits at Bodymoor Heath . Charles N'Zogbia concentrates in training and will be hoping he guide his side away from relegation . Alan Hutton is put through his paces in training as he prepares for Villa's clash against Swansea . Scott Sinclair has been given a new lease of life under Sherwood at Aston Villa . Harry Kane has come on significantly as a player since Tim Sherwood handed him his Spurs debut . The Tottenham striker has been in superb form, earning an England call-up with a string of impressive displays . ‘That’s why they should trust the people who know football within the club and not listen to outside influences who are trying to flog them a player. ‘If they would have brought in somebody last January and his name ended in an ‘I’ or an ‘O’, the fans would have been very excited, but I’m not sure he would have given them the same output as Harry Kane has given.’ Since 2011 Kane has experienced loan spells to varying degrees of success at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester before sparking to life with 26 goals this season. Sherwood insists only Championship clubs would have been interested 14 months ago. ‘A lot of people would have taken him but no one would have put their hand up in the Premier League,’ said Sherwood. ‘That just shows you how far he has come. Everyone will tell you now they always believed he would be a top player. But he had a few loans and a few managers never played him. They’d like him now, wouldn’t they.’ Kane has scored eight times in 10 games for the England Under 21s, earning promotion to the senior squad . Sherwood revealed Tottenham wanted to get rid of Kane when he in charge at White Hart Lane . Sherwood blasted Spurs for selling academy graduates Jake Livermore and Steven Caulker and said it took fans time to warm to Kane. ‘“He’s one of our own”, they never sang that, they’ve only just started and he’s had to perform like Alan Shearer. I chuckle when I hear it,’ said Sherwood. ‘I think it’s ridiculous that you let your homegrown players go,’ he added. ‘I thought it was poor that Livermore should leave, I thought it was poor that Caulker should leave, I’m talking about players who are playing in the Premier League week in and week out. ‘I think it’s wrong for clubs to continually waste money on investing for new players who you don’t know are going to settle. It’s not always about spending money. It’s also about improving the players you have within the squad.’ The current Aston Villa boss persisted with Kane and said selling him was never an option .","Senior Spurs figures wanted to replace Harry Kane last summer .

"FIFA has confirmed the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar will be played on Sunday December 18. The climax of the winter World Cup will take place a week before Christmas - a decision which will allow traditional Boxing Day club matches to take place. UEFA president Michel Platini said the decision was acceptable - but warned that FIFA must now protect four international dates that could be disrupted. FIFA on Thursday confirmed the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar will take place on December 18 . Meanwhile FIFA's executive committee meeting in Zurich has chosen France to host the 2019 women's World Cup over South Korea. The 2022 World Cup is to be played in the winter to avoid the fierce heat of June and July, and it will be a shortened tournament over 28 days instead of the usual 32, starting on November 21. The final on Sunday December 18 is also Qatar's national day. Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce previously insisted that clubs' Boxing Day fixtures would go ahead . UEFA had initially pushed for the final to be as late as December 23 but Platini said he now supported December 18. He insisted however that FIFA now had to re-arrange the calendar to protect up to four international dates that might be affected. Platini told Press Association Sport: 'December 18 is a good date for the final - perhaps December 23 would be too late if you are trying to get all the fans back on December 24. December 18 is fine for UEFA - we can accommodate any changes to the Champions League. The Al-Rayyan stadium is pictured in this artists impression as Qatar 2022 World Cup final date is confirmed . 'But FIFA must now protect the international dates for the national associations - there are four international matches that could be affected and those are the lifeblood for the national associations. 'FIFA must look at the international calendar and make sure those dates are protected for the national associations.' He also welcomed the decision to award the women's World Cup to France. Platini said: 'Everyone in France will be very pleased I am sure - and women's football is growing very strongly in the country.' FIFA's executive committee decided France will host 2019 women's fooball World Cup . FIFA's director of communications Walter De Gregorio said: 'The ExCo decided today that the World Cup as proposed by the task force will be played in November-December, with the final on the 18th of December. 'Based on the proposal of the task force, we're going to try to play in 28 days. That's the decision in principle. Now we have to see with the international match calendar how this might be possible.' He added: 'This is for us, an important step. Finally, we know the end of the tournament. 'It's a Sunday and, by the way, it's the national day in Qatar, so it fits perfectly. 'You have enough time to do your Christmas shopping.'","FIFA confirm the 2022 World Cup final will take place on December 18 .

"Manchester City got straight back to business after their disappointing Champions League exit as the squad remained in Barcelona overnight and held a session at Espanyol's training ground on Thursday. Manuel Pellegrini's side were dumped out by Barcelona after a 1-0 defeat at the Nou Camp on Wednesday night but were put through their paces ahead of a return to Premier League action. The champions host West Bromwich Albion at the Etihad on Saturday lunchtime as they bid to get their title challenge back on track after a shock defeat by Burnley last weekend. Manchester City players trained in Spain on Thursday following their Champions League exit the night before . The City squad are put through their exercises at Espanyol's training ground in Barcelona . The players were given no time to mull over their European exit after they were taught a lesson over two legs to find themselves on the wrong end a 3-1 aggregate result. After such a commanding performance by the La Liga leaders captain Vincent Kompany was forced to admit that Manchester City are still a long way behind the very best in Europe. 'The reality is they were a better team, there is no shame in admitting that. For me there is a big, big difference. 'I will just mention Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and then there are the rest of the teams, with Real Madrid probably in between. 'Ultimately we have always said our goal is to become as good as them, but it will take some time. They are really good. Goalkeeper Joe Hart and captain Vincent Kompany train ahead of their Premier League return on Saturday . Samir Nasri shares a joke as Manuel Pellegrini's side prepare to face West Brom at the Etihad on Saturday . 'Bayern Munich and Barcelona are not just Champions League-winning teams, they are World Cup-winning teams as well. They have generations that have played together a long time. 'Of course we want to make up the gap but you just have to be true to yourself. We have the ambition to be as good as they are one day, but it is not going to happen overnight.' City's exit meant that England will not have a representative in the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons. 'The gap will eventually get closer,' said Kompany. 'Whether it is Arsenal, Chelsea, (Manchester) United, the gap will become closer and I just hope it is us that gets there the first.' Kompany and Hart, who produced a fine goalkeeping display against Barca, take a break from training . City were outplayed in the first leg at the Etihad Stadium three weeks ago but had hoped Hart's late penalty save, which kept the score 2-1, might have proved the tie's turning point. It proved anything but as Barca dominated from the outset, hitting the post within moments through Neymar. Messi was at his inspirational best, setting up Ivan Rakitic's 31st-minute goal and generally running City ragged. It was remarkable the scoreline stayed at 1-0, with Luis Suarez also hitting the woodwork twice and England goalkeeper Hart producing a series of stunning saves in one of the best performances of his career. City might have made the latter stages interesting had Sergio Aguero not had a penalty saved by Marc-Andre ter Stegen but they could complain little about the result. Ivan Rakitic beat Joe Hart with a brilliant lob over the City keeper to give Barcelona a 1-0 win at the Nou Camp . The Croatia midfielder celebrates with his team-mates after opening the scoring the hosts . Asked about Hart's display, centre-back Kompany said: 'It was phenomenal. On that side of the pitch I felt we had all the luck we needed to get a result. 'It was probably just the penalty - if we had scored a goal it could have been a different game. It would have been a great way to get back into the tie and it would have been interesting to see what the last 15 minutes would have been like back at 1-1. 'If you want to win against those teams you need a very special performance and a little bit of luck on your side. Then you can beat them, but every team can lose. There is no shame.' Despite progress always seeming unlikely, the defeat is another blow to City's morale after an indifferent spell in the Barclays Premier League. VIDEO Pellegrini disappointed after Champions League exit . Manchester City's players leave the Nou Camp looking glum after being eliminated . Messi tries to take the ball around the onrushing Manchester City goalkeeper Hart . Having fallen six points behind Chelsea, who have a game in hand, it now seems unlikely City can retain their title and their season is in danger of fizzling out. They could even face a battle to hold onto second place as the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United gear up for a strong finish. Kompany is determined to ensure that does not happen. The 28-year-old said: 'Forget about Chelsea. We owe it to ourselves, to our fans to have a good end to this campaign. Then again if we finish this campaign as good as we can, maybe there is still something in it. We will have to see. 'It is not in our hands by any means, but we just have to go back and work hard and improve.'","Manchester City were knocked out of Europe by Barcelona on Wednesday .

"Smiles have been hard to come by among the Real Madrid camp of late but as preparations ramped up for their El Clasico date with Barcelona the mood was decidedly buoyant. Under-fire Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo were in full swing during hurdling drills and five-a-side games at the club's Valdebebas training ground on Thursday. Perhaps the air of positivity stems from numbers that suggest despite their recent run of poor form, which has included a 4-3 defeat by Schalke as they scraped through to the Champions League quarter-finals and falling from the top of La Liga, a trip to the Nou Camp could be just what the doctor ordered. Real Madrid's Gareth Bale shows his flexibility at training on Thursday ahead of El Clasico on Sunday . Bale hurdles keeper Iker Casillas and passes with purpose during a spirited session at Valdebebas . Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) pierces team-mates Asier Illarramendi (left) and Alvaro Arbeloa . The facts are that, despite being in the rare position of being underdogs at the weekend, away from home Ronaldo and Bale are Spanish club football's most dangerous forward duo. The Portuguese Ballon d'Or winner and the Welsh winger have more away goals than any other strike partnership, even Lionel Messi and Neymar. Their combined 22 goals in 14 games when not braving the white handkerchiefs of their Bernabeu is leads Messi and Neymar's tally of 18 outside the Nou Camp. Ronaldo has 15 of those and will be keen to catch the Messi, the prodigious Argentine who has been on fire in 2015 with 20 goals in 17 matches in all competition and overtook the Portuguese to be La Liga's top goal scorer. Stats by Squawka . Ronaldo smiles during training ahead of Real's clash with Barcelona on Sunday . Bale has his eyes on the ball and is focussed on a strong performance at the Nou Camp this weekend . Bale, who broke a nine-match goal drought with a double at home in their 2-0 win over Levante, will also be keen to work his way back into favour with Real fans and the Spanish press, who have recently labelled him 'lazy' and a 'ball hog'. Ahead of their trip to Barcelona for Sunday's 9pm kick-off, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti enlisted second division Castilla players Martin Odegaard, the Norwegian wunderkid, and Ruben Yanez to make up the numbers. With Bale and Ronaldo in full flight, only Sami Khedira was missing through a stomach illness while James Rodriguez's foot injury is still on the mend.

"England saw their Grand Slam ambitions go up in smoke for another season in Dublin two weeks ago, but Stuart Lancaster's side are still very much in the hunt for the Championship. Lancaster's side will look to bounce back against Scotland on Saturday evening following their disappointing 19-9 loss to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium. Courtney Lawes's return to the engine room is most welcome following England's problems at lineout time against Joe Schmidt's side last time out.

Saracens No 8 Vunipola and his fellow back rowers will be looking to bounce back against the Scots . Mike Brown returns at full-back following his recovery from concussion and replaces the unlucky Alex Goode who was one of England's better players during the Dublin defeat. Lancaster's men will be looking to unleash two weeks of pent-up frustration on Scotland following their round three loss. Robshaw led his charges through their team-run at Twickenham on Friday, but the squad engaged in much more hostile session at their team base at Pennyhill Park on Wednesday. 'I had to calm it down, blow the whistle at the end and make sure we didn't play the game too early,' Lancaster said on Wednesday. Gloucester centre Billy Twelvetress will once again provide cover from the bench . Backs coach Andy Farrell has demanded England react to their setback in the Irish capital by keeping their title hopes alive against the Scots. 'What happened against Ireland is a massive factor for this game,' England's backs coach said. 'If you put that alongside the fact we are still in with a shout of winning the competition, then those two things together are a pretty powerful thing leading up to this game. Hopefully we'll put in a performance that matters. Kieran Brookes (right), Joseph (second right) and Brown shake a joke during the session on Friday . 'You learn a lot from a loss. Lads who haven't been in that type of position before will have learnt a lot. 'Did we let ourselves down against Ireland? We didn't play our best, but Ireland like most good sides have a way of making an impact on the game and they did that very successfully. 'There is a determination to put a performance in.' Ford works on his kicking as Owen Farrell (left) and Sale Sharks fly half Danny Cipriani watch on . Farrell is hoping his side will improve on their two key shortcomings against Ireland namely their failure to assert their authority at the breakdown and a lack of discipline. 'We're confident about the breakdown and our discipline for this week. They have been big areas that we have worked on,' Farrell added. 'We've worked on all aspects of the game this week, making sure we're ready for all aspects that could happen.'","England face Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday .

"Lionel Messi was at his brilliant, mesmerising best against Manchester City and the knee-jerkers have been out in full force proclaiming him as the greatest footballer of all time. Steady on, boys and girls. Barcelona’s little big man was just having fun with one of our pot-holed Premier League defences. Lionel Messi (second left) was at his mesmerising best as Barcelona beat Manchester City on Wednesday . Messi (left) takes on Manchester City and England midfielder James Milner in the game at the Nou Camp . Messi was repeatedly denied from getting on the scoresheet by City goalkeeper Joe Hart's excellent display . It was indeed a delight to watch Messi enjoying himself and it was hard to keep a straight face when he made a laughing stock of a player who has been described by his City manager as the complete English footballer. If James Milner really is the complete English footballer that begins to tell us something of what’s wrong with the England football team. Barcelona played football from a different planet to the England of which City are currently champions and Messi was the principle, be-dazzling reason for that. Yet they only won 1-0 when it should have been six and could have been ten and Messi missed his share of those chances. But that is not the reason for resisting the temptation to enshrine him as the best ever. Rather, sublime performances like this perpetuate the riddle as to why he has failed to fully deliver on the greatest stage of all. It is sometimes difficult to evaluate the best of the best when considering players who come from outside the elite footballing countries. Messi (centre) is adjudged to have fallen short of his high level of performance on the international stage . Messi was part of the Argentina squad that finished as runners-up in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Messi has never won the World Cup during his international career and his last chance could be Russia 2018 . But when someone plays for such a major nation as Argentina then World Cup impact weighs upon the calculation, in Messi’s case against him. The tango he danced around poor old City was exquisite to behold but it does not erase the memory of how he fell short – not for the first time at the World Cup Finals – in Brazil last summer. Russia 2018 now represents his last chance to gate-crash this list of the top five players in the history of the beautiful game – and by the way I saw them all: . 1) Pele . Pele won the World Cup three times as a player and scored over a thousand goals throughout his career . Pele celebrates with the Jules Rimet trophy after being part of Brazil's 1970 World Cup winning side . Brazil striker Pele's other two victorious World Cup campaigns were in the 1958 and 1962 tournaments . There can be no arguing with the three World Cup glories, the thousand goals, the rare art of making the impossible look simple, nor that extraordinary ability in the air for the comparatively short man who will be guest of honour at Liverpool v Manchester United this Sunday. And by the way, he was also as hard as nails. 2) Diego Maradona . Not only as mind-boggling to watch on the ball as Messi but capable of winning the glittering prizes single-handed – as he did in lifting Argentina to one World Cup triumph and, when virtually crippled, to the final of another. Diego Maradona celebrates winning the World Cup in 1986 after beating West Germany in the final . Maradona captained the Argentina team to victory at the World Cup in 1986 held in Mexico . Maradona (second right) infamously scored the Hand of God goal against England in 1986 . Forget our English angst about the Hand of God and all the scandals. Remember the genius who also spirited a deeply indifferent Napoli to their only Serie A title. 3) Garrincha . Revered as greater than Pele in Brazil, where they worship above all pure, incredible magic on the ball. Was the divine inspiration for two of his country’s World Cup triumphs, perhaps most notably in 1962 when he assume the mantle of leadership from the injured Pele. Brazil forward Garrincha (left) was held in higher regard by supporters than the iconic striker Pele . Garrincha (left)  takes on England player Ray Wilson while in action for Brazil, where he was loved for his skill . Garrincha (left) was renowned for his dribbling ability and inspired Brazil to two World Cup victories . Also the most loved of all Brazilian players, as a bohemian man of the people. 4) Alfredo di Stefano . Can be excused the absence of the World Cup from his portfolio, as he played only six times for Argentina before joining Real Madrid, who had him naturalised in the vain hope that he might galvanise a poor Spanish national team. Don Alfredo was one of only three stars who played in all Real’s winnings of the first five European Cups. Striker Alfredo di Stefano (centre) was described as one of the most complete players ever by Pele . Di Stefano (right) scores for Real Madrid in the European Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 final . Di Stefano poses with five European Cup trophies won during a trophy-laden era with Madrid . He ran the team from midfield, inspiring the dazzling moves which he then arrived in the box to turn into goals. At his greatest when Ferenc Puskas came from Hungary to join him at the Bernabeu. Don’t just take my word for it. Pele and Eusebio are among many who describe di Stefano as ‘the most complete footballer of all time.’ 5) Cristiano Ronaldo . Exempt from our World Cup statute by virtue of playing for second-tier Portugal, yet still did more for his country at Brazil 2014 than Messi for Argentina. Cristiano Ronaldo has fired in goals at a relentless rate during his career at Real Madrid . Ronaldo (right) scores for Portugal in the World Cup Group G game against Ghana at Brazil 2014 . Ronaldo has a physicality that appears to emulate Messi when comparing the two best modern day players . He, too, is blessed with little Leo’s dexterity on the ball but also brings physical power and serious pace to the argument as to which of these Ballon d’Or winning rivals should be the representative of the modern era occupying the final place this list.","Lionel Messi starred as Barcelona beat Manchester City on Wednesday .

"The Hull City Supporters' Trust has once again called upon the club's owners to abandon plans to change the club name to Hull Tigers. The FA Council rejected owner Assem Allam's attempt to rebrand last year but on Monday an arbitration tribunal ruled that that decision had been put aside. That was due to the involvement of Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke on the sub-committee which made the initial decision, with the tribunal believing Clarke based his decision only on what members of the City Till We Die supporters group, now part of HCST, wanted - the club's now 111-year-old name to remain unchanged. The Hull City Supporters' Trust has called upon club owner Assem Allam to abandon his name change plans . That means that while the club will remain as Hull City AFC until the end of the current campaign, Allam can now re-apply to change the name again ahead of the new season. But HCST has pleaded with the club's hierarchy to completely abandon their lengthy campaign, believing the tribunal's decision was based on a 'very minor technicality'. 'HCST urges the owners to abandon the name change application once and for all,' read a statement. 'It is clear from the evidence set out in the arbitration document that a strong and compelling case for change does not exist. Hull supporters have publicly stated their opposition to the name change and don't want the 'City' dropped . 'The FA has published a 30-page arbitration document that describes why the FA Council's decision to reject the club's proposed name change has been 'set aside' on a very minor technicality, having rejected most of the arguments offered by the club. 'The Trust is disappointed with this finding - the FA Council made a sound decision made in the interests of football in general, not just those of Hull City supporters.' The statement continued: 'The arbitration document also reveals that the club agreed to present a business case for the change and then failed to do so. We believe this is because there is not and has never been any evidence that 'Hull Tigers' would generate a financial benefit. 'The report also stated that the heavily-weighted ballot of season ticket holders the club ran was 'poor', 'unimpressive' and the outcome was 'unconvincing'.' Fans hold 'City till we die' scarves above their heads during a Barclays Premier League game last season . Allam, however, is regarding the decision of the panel as a major victory and does not believe he even has to submit a new application to change the name. 'The tribunal states, in this case the FA saying no to Tigers, that the decision should be set aside,' he told the Hull Daily Mail on Wednesday. 'That means nothing has happened. 'The application has not been answered. The tribunal says our appeal was successful. That decision to set it aside was unanimous.' A Hull City Tigers sign is displayed at the KC Stadium, and is Allam gets his way it will be 'City' no more . The Egyptian businessman also reiterated that the club will remain for sale until he gets his name-change plans pushed through. 'The club is up for sale as I've said before,' he added. 'There is no change. If I can change the club's name to Hull Tigers then I will stay and develop the club further and further. I have shown it would be a success. 'If it is not Hull Tigers then the club will be sold. What is the problem with that? I could have sold the club already, but I want it to go to a good home.' On the pitch, Hull are fighting a relegation battle while the boardroom battles centre around the club's name .","Hull supporters ask owner Assem Allam to abandon name change plans .

"Chelsea have called for an end to sexism in football after footage emerged of fans directing abuse at their club doctor Eva Carneiro. Recordings of fans at Manchester United and Manchester City chanting and shouting obscenities at Carneiro were broadcast by the BBC on Thursday night, leading to an unequivocal statement from the Blues. A spokesman for the club told the Guardian: 'The issue of equality is one we take extremely seriously and we abhor discrimination in all its forms, including sexism. Such behaviour is unacceptable and we want it eradicated from the game.' Recordings of Manchester United and Manchester City fans shouting abuse were shown on BBC on Thursday . Abuse was directed at Chelsea club doctor Eva Carneiro by opposition fans on seperate occasions . Chelsea have called for an end to sexism in football after fans directed abuse at their club doctor . Campaign group Women in Football is launching an anti-sexism social media drive on Friday and has also contacted all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs asking them to champion female members of staff in their matchday programmes ahead of International Women's Day on March 8. Minister for Sport Helen Grant is supporting the initiative. She said: 'It is absolutely right that we champion and celebrate women who work in the football industry and play vital roles in making the game the success that it is. Demba Ba is treated for a broken nose by Carneiro after being kicked in the face against Newcastle . Carneiro joined Chelsea in 2009 but was promoted to the first team by Andre Villas-Boas in 2011 . 'I want more women to get involved in football across the board and to see it as a great industry to work in. Sexism, in any shape or form, should not be tolerated so I applaud this push to encourage people to report any incidents of sexist abuse and for the promotion of inclusivity across football.' Carolyn Radford, chief executive at Mansfield Town, told the BBC: ‘You are almost made to feel if you should be made to tolerate such abuse. If it was racist language being chanted at me then perhaps people would say something about it, but because it is just banter, so to speak, I’ve got to flick my hair and just accept it.’ Chelsea's Kurt Zouma is tended to by  Carneiro as he is stretchered off after a collision in the penalty area .

Aguero had a penalty saved in the 78th minute that would have made the closing stages more interesting, but the reality is that Barcelona threatened to humiliate the Barclays Premier League champions only for a heroic goalkeeping performance from Hart. The squad returned to Manchester late on Thursday evening after they remained in Barcelona overnight and held a session at Espanyol's training ground earlier in the day.

We have been unlucky to play Barcelona for two years in a row. We have had a restriction on the number of players we can use in the Champions League.' 'It is very difficult to beat Barcelona, but the statistics I don’t care about. ‘We cannot analyse what we will do next season because it is too soon after this result. We can do that later. ‘It is not easy to play Barcelona. This is the draw, they are very strong.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has revealed his time in charge at Old Trafford will be his last in football. Van Gaal and his players head to Liverpool on Sunday in an attempt to solidify their current position in the top four of the Barclays Premier League. And the Dutchman has revealed his attempt to bring glory back to United will be his final challenge in the game. Louis van Gaal has announced Manchester United will be his last job before he retires from the game . Van Gaal told The Telegraph: 'I am old. This is my last job. For sure. 'I have to pay attention to my kids, my grandchildren but also to my wife. They deserve it. Now I cannot pay that attention. I was not at the birthday of my grandson for example. I don't like it. 'We have to qualify for the Champions League and we have many tests next year. That also develops the level of your team, and of course how many players can come in to improve our selection.' Van Gaal has not had everything his own way in his first season in English football but already believes he has identified two future managers in his squad. The former Ajax boss won the European Cup with the Dutch giants against AC Milan back in 1995 . The Dutchman took charge of his national side at the 2012 World Cup in Brazil where they impressed . Van Gaal (left) was boss at Barcelona alongside Ronald Koeman and Jose Mourinho (fourth left) in 1999 . 'Wayne Rooney is very open to learn,' he said. 'It's amazing. I don't know if he speaks with his wife Coleen about football, I don't think so. 'But we have the process of talking here. Most of my players of my selection are open and that's very nice. 'Michael Carrick is more or less a trainer-coach. He is also willing to talk about shapes and systems. The United boss intends to finish victorious before his spell at the 'biggest club in the world' comes to an end . 'That's nice. Rooney also. Not every player is very open and then you have to convince him, and then you get a struggle. It works or it doesn't work. Give them time. Also give me time to do it. 'I am the most flexible manager you can imagine. When the players are coming with good arguments, I change my opinion.' United head to Anfield on Sunday having finally abandoned the three-man defensive system that attracted so much debate earlier in the season. Despite using it all through pre-season and in to the competitive campaign, Van Gaal now claims he has settled on a more effective shape. 'I ask also the players which system they want to play,' Van Gaal revealed. 'And then I ask individual players: 'What's your favourite position?' 'First they don't want to answer but now they are more open, and they answer. 'The fans are shouting it (4-4-2). I have played it but that was to do with accidental circumstances. The system we play now is the system that I prefer, that I have played everywhere. The system against Tottenham last weekend is my preferred system. 'When it is needed, then I play with five at the back. Tottenham was 4-3-3 when we had the ball. When we defend it was more 4-1-4-1 yesterday. The next game is different.'","Louis van Gaal has revealed Manchester United will be his last job .

"Joe Hart has revealed that he has been working with a psychologist in order to improve his life both on and off the pitch. The 27-year-old goalkeeper was the standout performer alongside Lionel Messi on Wednesday night as Manchester City were knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona. City somehow managed to concede just one goal at the Nou Camp despite a dazzling display from Messi, who was thwarted by Hart on several occasions. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart has revealed he's been working with a psychologist . Hart spoke to Sport magazine about his meetings . Hart told Sport Magazine: 'I've got a relationship with someone who I've worked with for a while. It's a lot of fun. I like what I get out of it. Just generally – it's not necessarily just football and trying to 'unlock doors'. 'It's just general – kind of free-flowing, feeling comfortable and safe to talk. Everyone could benefit from it, really, for life in general.' The goalkeeper feels that having a strong mentality is key to being successful - especially being a goalkeeper. 'You can feel when someone is in a good place and when someone feels good about what they do, the same as I can feel it with strikers. So, to be in a naturally good place is a lot better. 'You've got to believe in what you do and feel comfortable and confident when you go out. Being in the right frame of mind always helps – we all have vulnerable parts, times in our game when you're thinking the worst can happen. But you need to limit them as best you can.' 'I've always kind of accepted in my role as a goalkeeper that making mistakes is going to happen. But turning it into a positive is something that I've improved on, definitely.' England No 1 Joe Hart denies Brazilian ace Neymar as the former Santos man looms down on goal . The England No 1 has been in fine form for his club this season, despite his defence struggling for form, but Hart admitted that making a save isn't quite the feeling as scoring a goal. 'It's a very good feeling,' he says. 'It's a good surge. But the thing with making a save is that you can't run off and slide on your knees. Unless you've caught it, you've either pushed it out into play or pushed it for a corner. It's gone. 'As good as making a good save can be, you've got to be aware that five seconds later you can let one through your hands.' England's No 1 gets down low to deny Lionel Messi during his side's defeat to Barcelona at the Nou Camp . Despite going out of the Champions League on Wednesday, the 27-year-old made a crucial penalty save against Lionel Messi to keep his side well and truly in it after the first leg. 'Penalties are an easy one to zone in on because it's a one-on-one duel. There's nothing that can be done – it's not like someone can do a sneaky one when you're not looking. 'You try and make the moment as big for them as it is for you. Some people are immune to that, and you're wasting your time. But there's a few people who it might help with. 'Saving one is a good feeling. In my head it's all because of me. But, realistically, they might have just taken a bad penalty or made the wrong decision. Anyone is more than capable of scoring past me from 12 yards, whatever team it is.' Hart saves Messi's penalty during the first leg of the Champions League clash at the Etihad Stadium .

"Matt Scott has demanded Scotland keep their emotions in check against England today as they look to avoid a repeat of last season’s Calcutta Cup humiliation. The Scots were despatched with embarrassing ease at Murrayfield during the 2014 Six Nations, the 20-0 defeat leading to some commentators questioning whether they should remain part of the Championship. Now, having lost their first three matches of this year’s tournament, Vern Cotter’s men head to Twickenham once again in dire straits and with a winless record at ‘HQ’ that stretches back to 1983. Scotland tighthead Euan Murray throws a pass during his side's captain's run at Twickenham on Friday . Scotland hooker Ross Ford leads a passing drill during Scotland's final preparations for Saturday's game . Edinburgh's Greig Tonks will provide three-quarter from the bench at England HQ . However, Scotland centre Scott, recalled to the starting XV at the expense of the luckless Alex Dunbar, believes that the visitors can upset the odds - but only if they avoid the mistakes made 12 months ago. ‘The England game last year was horrible to look back on,’ he said. ‘It was a terrible overall performance. ‘I remember the boys being so fired up for that game and it is funny how we just completely went to pieces. ‘We didn’t play rugby at all back then so this weekend it’s about drip feeding that passion we felt last year but channelled in the wrong way. Last year, we had boys with tears in their eyes in the dressing room before the game. ‘It was an emotionally charged affair, but it’s a professional sport and it should all be about cool heads. ‘There’s a big focus for us on keeping cool this week because there’s a fine line between being like that and letting your emotions run away with you and we certainly crossed it in the wrong way last year. Vern Cotter's squad gather for a team huddle at the end of the session at Twickenham . ‘I took that defeat really badly as it was probably the worst one of my career. ‘I remember the embarrassment of it all and that defeat has been used as motivation this week. There was a lack of structure to our attack, we were all over the place in parts. There was poor execution of kicks, poor decision-making, it just looked really disjointed. ‘We have watched clips this week and we know there are one or two points to prove.’ Scott also revealed that, should the Scots pull off what some would consider the impossible, they would dedicate the victory to stricken team-mate Dunbar. The Edinburgh centre admitted he was ‘devastated’ for his close friend after Dunbar sustained a knee injury that could rule him out of this year’s Rugby World Cup. ‘I am sure it will be tough for Alex to watch knowing that he was meant to be playing in the match today,’ said Scott. ‘It would be a massive get well soon present for him from us if we can bring home the Calcutta Cup for him and that is what we will be trying to do. ‘There is a feeling in the camp of: “Let’s do this for him”. In professional rugby, guys do get long-term injuries but ones like Alex’s does bring us closer together in the sense we want to do well for him. Scotland fly half Finn Russell (left) and full back Stuart Hogg work on their kicking on Friday . ‘I was pretty close to Alex when he got injured on Thursday morning and it was the most innocuous thing as there was nobody near him when he pulled up. ‘The way it happened, he must have played it over in his head 100 times as he was extremely unlucky. ‘I am devastated for him and sent him a message straight after training saying I hoped it was good news but, unfortunately, it wasn’t. ‘In this period leading up to the World Cup you really don’t want anyone to get any long-term injuries. There is a chance he can still make the tournament so I am praying for him to make a speedy recovery.’ Hogg (second left) is all smiles ahead of Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash in London . Scott, for all his honest sympathy and concern over Dunbar, knows his misfortune has given him a chance of making the No 12 jersey his own from now until the World Cup. ‘It has been a tough few months for me personally, not being selected and being injured,’ he continued. ‘Now I have a chance to start for Scotland and want to do my talking on the pitch. ‘I had a great run of starting a lot of games for Scotland earlier in my international career and I was very lucky to do that. Then got a bad injury and it took me a while to get back to where I was. Now, I feel I am back to where I was and am ready to fill Alex’s boots and do him proud. ‘I am pleased to be starting rather than being on the bench as most rugby players will say it is harder to come off the bench. Most games I have played professionally I have started, which is the way I like it. ‘If you are on the bench you don’t know if you are coming on in minute one or minute 79 so you are constantly on edge. At least this time out I can hit the pace of the game straight away.’","It is 32 years since Scotland last won at Twickenham .

"France's preparations for their RBS 6 Nations showdown with England on Saturday have been disrupted by confusion over the fitness of fly-half Camille Lopez. Lopez suffered a badly bruised knee in last weekend's 29-0 victory over Italy and has been replaced in the starting XV for the climax to the Championship at Twickenham by Jules Plisson of Stade Francais. Fly-half Camille Lopez (left) talks to with France coach Philippe Saint-Andre on Tuesday . However, head coach Philippe Saint-Andre insisted during Thursday's team announcement press conference that Lopez was only overlooked once it became clear he was uncertain over playing England after speaking to his club doctor at Clermont. 'Lopez trained normally on Wednesday morning. He even kicked,' Saint-Andre said. 'In the afternoon his club Clermont decided that he must rest for four to six weeks. Clermont's medic decided that without seeing him and using only the MRI we sent them. Lopez suffered a badly bruised knee in last weekend's 29-0 victory over Italy . 'We had a chat with Camille then and he was disrupted. I need players who don't doubt. 'Camille didn't have any doubt on Wednesday morning. The doubt came in the evening. Camille goes back to Lyon to meet the specialist he had surgery with in 2013.' Plisson , who impressed off the bench against Italy, added to the mystery surrounding Lopez's condition by admitting it was clear that his rival was destined to start against England. 'We could see at training sessions that Camille was supposed to start the game, but we switched positions a lot at training so that doesn't change anything for me. I have to prove to the coaches they were not wrong picking me,' Plisson said.","Camille Lopez suffered a badly bruised knee against Italy .

"Roberto Martinez insisted Everton had to take collective responsibility for their Europa League embarrassment as he defended his team selection. Everton endured a night of humiliation against Dynamo Kiev and tumbled out after a 5-2 defeat (6-4 on aggregate) in the Olympic Stadium. Their performance was stained by defensive mistakes, with Antolin Alcaraz particularly culpable. This was a night comparable to how Everton folded against Dinamo Bucharest (2005) and Benfica (2009) when they also conceded five times. Everton's Ross Barkley and James McCarthy (right) look miserable during the painful defeat . It made Martinez's decision not to start John Stones puzzling but the Everton manager maintained there was only a slight difference between the two teams and it was Kiev's superior finishing that meant they reached the quarter-finals. 'We did make some defensive mistakes but also there was some incredible finishing and sometimes you have to highlight the quality of that,' said Martinez. 'It is only natural and normal from the outside to look back, and I do not regret playing Alcaraz - the defence has been strong in the last two games. Everton's Phil Jagielka, Tim Howard and Leighton Baines look dejected after Dynamo Kiev score their third . 'We conceded only one goal from a corner in the first leg and kept a clean sheet against Newcastle on Sunday, although we did not adapt too well to the pitch. 'But it is a case of the whole team not defending well enough. I do not think it is down to the personnel, but as a team. Dynamo built a lot of momentum with their crowd rather than us being to blame.' Everton got back into the tie when Romelu Lukaku equalised Andrei Yarmolenko's opener but they fell asunder afterwards and Phil Jagielka's late header provided no solace. Martinez, though, was pleased that Everton kept searching for goal. Lukaku and Ross Barkley both look out of sorts as Everton crash out of Europe . 'I am looking at the effort and the way we gave up,' said Martinez. 'We tried everything to stay in the tie but the way it unfolded was down to one team taking most of their chances . 'Sometimes the margins are so small and part of the experience in this competition is learning how to play the second leg. Gareth Barry looks at the ground in disappointment as Everton crashed out of the Europa League . Roberto Martinez and substitute Leon Osman remonstrate with the fourth official Christoph Bornhorst . 'Both teams created a lot of chances and the difference was one team taking them.

The type of game it was there were opportunities for both teams.'","Everton were beaten 5-2 by Dynamo Kiev in the Olympic Stadium .

"A home video from 1988 has revealed that a couple had actually crossed paths 16 years before they were set up on a blind date.

In a strange coincidence Ryan and Jourdan were introduced by 16 years later on a blind date and are now married with three children. The couple, who grew up 45 minutes away from each other, only realized when they were watching old family videos a few years ago. 'We did a complete double-take,' Jourdan Spencer said. 'We paused, we rewound, we paused, we rewound, over and over again. 'We told everyone we knew — and then the tape went missing. We had no proof this whole time.' The video sees the pair at Sesame Place amusement park - Jourdan's mother is standing with her younger siblings, when Ryan strolls past, directly in front of the camera.

"Having left home at 16 to pursue football against his mum’s wishes, Brown Ideye is thankful he can smile now. So much so he is able to give a highly animated impression of her watching him play for West Bromwich Albion. Squinting to study an imaginary television back home in Nigeria, his arms flap wildly. ‘Don’t kick him!’ he shouts, mimicking his mother Teresa’s voice. ‘Ref can’t you see!’ he jabs his fingers. ‘Each time West Brom play my mother is wearing my shirt, sitting down in front of the telly, and she is like this,’ Ideye laughs. Brown Ideye told Sportsmail about his journey from Nigeria to West Bromwich Albion . Ideye's success story is one for West Brom fans and football supporters in general to truly admire . The Baggies striker left his home at 16 to pursue a career in football against his mother’s wishes . The 26-year-old is beginning to make his stamp as the west Midlands club's most expensive signing . Ideye (centre) scores West Brom's third goal in their hammering of West Ham in the FA Cup fifth round . It is quite some turnaround given she banned him from playing the game as a 14-year-old through fears he would get caught up with criminal gangs on the streets of Lagos. After his father Joel died, she even sent him to her sister’s remote village eight hours away to keep him from football and, as she saw it, trouble. A decade later Ideye, 26, is West Brom’s £10million record buy and, after initial difficulties, beginning to make good on his pricetag. He faces Aston Villa in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday, looking for revenge on the local rivals who triumphed in a dramatic Premier League match on Tuesday night. He scored two goals in the last round to do more than any in the 4-0 destruction of West Ham United, and is allowing himself dreams of Wembley. A May date at the grand stadium might present the chance for his mum to support her son in person for the first time. ‘In summer it’s possible, right now it’s cold for her,’ he says. ‘I want us to get to the final. If we do then I can arrange it.’ Had she got her way all those years ago, however, Ideye would not be a Premier League player. ‘It’s hard growing up in Lagos,’ he says. ‘There is always a story to tell in a city like that. My friends were involved in crazy stuff. They were bad boys of the area. I was picked up once by the police. Ideye experienced a frustrating start to his West Brom career and attracted criticism for his lack of goals . The Baggies front man was on the verge of a cut-price deal on deadline day to Qatar side Al-Gharafa . But Ideye is willing to overcome the obstacles he has faced in the Premier League since joining West Brom . ‘My mum stopped me going out with them. She was upset. Each time I told her I wanted to play football she would say, “No you’re going to be with your friends”.’ Ideye was sent to live with his aunt but eventually ran away to train with his old coach and finally told his mum he wanted to make a 200-mile trip to Bayelsa State to play regularly. ‘She didn’t accept. That’s how I left. I went to Bayelsa State then Ocean Boys. Then bam, bam, bam.’ The bams are Neuchatel Xamax in Switzerland, Sochaux in France, and Dynamo Kiev in Ukraine, where he scored 33 goals in 74 games and earned most of his 24 Nigeria caps. Once he had signed professional forms, Ideye patched up his relationship with his mum. Tears flowed. ‘When I got the contract in Switzerland I went back home, sat with my family and had breakfast, dinner, lunch, everyone happy. ‘Afterwards she called me into her room and said, “I’m sorry about everything, your dad is late and I am the only person who can guide you. I looked at what your friends were doing and believed if I left you that is how you’d become.” I said, “I get that.” She started crying. She could not believe she tried to stop me becoming what she is enjoying today.’ Ideye spoke frankly about being sent to live with his aunt in order to keep him out of trouble as a youth . Having looked well short of his pedigree in the opening months of the season and on the verge of a cut-price deal on deadline day to Qatar side Al-Gharafa, a glorious spell of four goals in six days (three games) followed. Cultivating an understanding alongside Saido Berahino and with guidance from Tony Pulis, Ideye looks to have found his feet in England. ‘I took a lot of time to adapt,’ he admits. ‘I was overwhelmed that I am the record signing. I put a lot of pressure on myself. People are not patient. ‘The game doesn’t turn out the way I want, I become frustrated, I keep on pushing when I am supposed to calm down. Things were going so fast. ‘As for the social media, you can’t expect everyone to like you. They will say what they want. I don’t see what can shake me given what has happened before. ‘It’s inspiration. They are pushing me to my success. I like people criticising me. Baggies supporters were annoyed by comments made by Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood on Tuesday . ‘That one week turned out to be something I dreamt. I felt this day would come. Getting back to the Brown Ideye people know. ‘One day the people who are saying, “He’s no good” are the same people who will say, “Don’t let him go.”’ He denies he would ever have gone to the Middle East in a £3.8m deal. ‘I do not have to run to anywhere.’ He hopes to be running in celebration at Villa Park, performing the somersault tumble that marked his last goal. ‘I always did that when I was a child,’ he says. ‘When you’re excited you find yourself doing things you don’t plan. The fans love it so I will keep on doing it.’ He also wants to make Tim Sherwood reassess his belief that West Brom are a ‘good little club’, a throwaway comment not intended to disparage that has irked their supporters. ‘I think it’s not the right thing to say,’ says Ideye. 'But I guess if he sees us as a small club and Villa as a big club and on Tuesday we lost, then he will have the upper hand to say what he wants. To make him realise West Brom is far higher than Villa we have to win. We have a game where we can redeem our image by winning.’ Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor celebrates his goal against local rivals West Brom earlier this week . Defeat on Tuesday night stung, particularly as it was Ben Foster’s error in the final minute which proved costly and that Alan Hutton’s high challenge on Berahino was not met with a red card. ‘Ben is a great guy, a lot of people make mistakes in football,’ says Ideye. ‘He apologised to everyone, but it is already done. We accept it.’ On Hutton he adds: ‘I didn’t really see it at the time but I was watching Match of the Day, I called my wife and said, “Look at this”. I feel a little bit scared that a defender would go in like that. ‘It’s the pressure of the game, everyone wants to go hard. But you still have to respect the fact it is football. You have to respect each other. For me I do not see that as a good thing. There are for sure going to be tackles but not that high.’ The image of Wembley provides most motivation though. ‘The Villa game was just a reminder for us that we could lose a game in that manner, it is for us to sit up and know that to get to Wembley we need to work hard. ‘Every game we play under Tony we give our all, sometimes we win sometimes we lose. Saturday is no different. We just have to add more than what we did on Tuesday.’","At 16, his mum sent him to live with his aunt to keep him away from trouble .
