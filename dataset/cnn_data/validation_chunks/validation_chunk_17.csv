"The biggest impression Grant Elliott had made on world cricket came when he was barged by Ryan Sidebottom during a one-day international at the Oval seven years ago and was unwittingly caught in the middle of a major row between England and New Zealand. Now he will be remembered for all the right reasons. Elliott, a little known all-rounder born in South Africa but a naturalised Kiwi, played one of the great one-day innings on Tuesday for his adopted country against the nation of his birth to take New Zealand to their first World Cup final. It led to jubilant scenes at Auckland’s Eden Park, a venue more readily associated with New Zealand’s rugby triumphs than cricketing ones, and breathed life into a tournament in which exciting finishes have been all too rare. Grant Elliott celebrates hitting a six against South Africa to put New Zealand through to the World Cup final . Daniel Vettori embraces Elliott while bowler Dale Steyn lays on the ground after the crucial blow . Elliott, 36, powered his way to what would be a match-winning unbeaten 84 in the Black Caps chase . What a day for New Zealand and what a day for 36-year-old Elliott, who had not played international cricket for 14 months when he became one of coach Mike Hesson’s inspired choices for this World Cup. Elliott beams as he meets the press after the match . Elliott will surely never play another innings like his unbeaten 84 which earned New Zealand the most nerve-racking of victories with just a ball to spare against a South African team who fell short when it most mattered yet again. And Elliott will surely never play another shot like the six that soared over the short long-on boundary with five needed off two balls from the world’s greatest fast bowler in Dale Steyn. A man who has had a largely anonymous career that has taken in Transvaal, Wellington and Surrey was humble enough to console the stricken Steyn in scenes reminiscent of Andrew Flintoff’s Ashes embrace of Brett Lee in 2005. Then Elliott talked of how much this means for a country who will now take on either Australia or India in the final on Sunday after falling short in no fewer than six previous World Cup semi-finals. ‘I was looking to hit that ball for six or four,’ said Elliott. ‘I was just going to line it up and it was going over the boundary. It means a lot to the players but you only had to look to the stands to see how much it meant to a lot of people.’ This was glorious vindication for the attacking, modern brand of one-day cricket that New Zealand have been producing under their impressive captain Brendon McCullum with players who have not always been regarded as dynamic. Elliott goes for broke on the penultimate ball of the match and his sweet strike soars into the stands . Steyn, for many the world's best fast bowler, stands with his hands on his knees as Elliott celebrates . Elliott shakes hands and consoles Steyn as the conclusion of the match at Auckland's Eden Park . The batsman sparked memories of Andrew Flintoff's sportsmanship with Brett Lee in the 2007 Ashes . Elliott has never been seen as the epitome of modern 50-over power and nor has Martin Guptill, who came of age as a limited-overs batsman with his double century in the quarter-final against West Indies. If they can do it, then why not England, if they throw off the shackles and start again in one-day cricket after their embarrassing exit in the group stages? New Zealand were in all sorts of turmoil two years ago when they messily sacked Ross Taylor as captain but what has happened since has been little short of phenomenal, and they will provide the stiffest of opposition to England in both Test and one-day cricket in May and June. Before his semi-final heroics, Elliott was best known for his collision with Ryan Sidebottom in 2008 . Then captain Paul Collingwood apologised for upholding the appeal that saw Elliott run out after the clash . This was heartbreaking for South Africa, who did little to shake off their reputation as perennial chokers on the big occasion. Yet to use the ‘c-word’ they hate so much would be harsh on South Africa. They fumbled two crucial run-out chances and then saw JP Duminy and Farhaan Behardien collide in the deep (above) when Eliott offered a skyer with 14 needed for victory, but were simply beaten by the better team. ‘I really did feel the pressure, it was stressful towards the end,’ said Elliott, who saw New Zealand home in company with the veteran Dan Vettori. That was of little consolation to South Africa captain AB de Villiers, who struggled to contain his emotions after coming off second best in one of the great World Cup games. ‘We wanted to take the trophy home and lift our nation’s hearts but we weren’t able to do that,’ said De Villiers. ‘But life moves on and the sun will come up tomorrow.’","South Africa-born Grant Elliott hit match-winning 84 not out in semi-final .

"Gloucester have announced that Tom Lindsay will be joining the club from Wasps at the end of the season. The 27-year-old hooker has spent the whole of his career at Wasps since joining 11 years ago, making over 100 appearances and going on to achieve international recognition with the England Saxons. He has been a regular in the squad this season, but has opted to move to Kingsholm as they build for the 2015-16 season. Gloucester have announced that Tom Lindsay will be joining the club from Wasps at the end of the season . Director of rugby David Humphreys was pleased with the deal, telling the club's official website: ""We are delighted to be bringing a player of Tom's quality and experience to the squad for next season. 'His set-piece work is good, he carries the ball well, he's English qualified with a lot of experience and we hope has his best years ahead of him.

"With 60 years of managerial experience between them, Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger have more big match experience than most coaches still involved in European football. They have, as they saying goes, forgotten more about the game than many people will ever know. Games like this, however, still throw up unique questions and challenges, both before and during play, and on Monday night he two men faced one of their biggest nights of the season in a competition their respective clubs are unusually desperate to win. Here, Ian Ladyman assesses how they shaped up at Old Trafford. TEAM SELECTION . Managers are paid to make the right calls and sometimes that involves an element of risk. Wenger’s decision to include Danny Welbeck ahead of Olivier Giroud seemed baffling. Giroud had scored five goals in his last five games and it was hard to think Welbeck would have anything in his repertoire that his former team-mates in the United ranks didn’t know all about. For an hour here it seemed as though the Arsenal manager had blundered a little. Arsenal were familiarly quick and progressive through midfield but Welbeck seemed unable to hold of possession long enough to bring his supporting players Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain in to play. Arsenal left back Nacho Monreal jumps in the air after putting his side in the lead . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney cancelled out Nacho Monreal's opener . Ultimately, though, Wenger’s decision was vindicated when Welbeck was bright enough to anticipate Antonio Valencia’s back pass and calm enough to win his subsequent challenge with David de Gea and score the winner. For their part, it was surprising to see United without their best passer, Michael Carrick, but they still had a bold look about them at the start and that was indicative of the fact that this was a game Van Gaal wished to win at the first attempt. Daley Blind was selected as United’s only holding player and that, in turn, released Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini to try and hurt Arsenal further up the field. Most interesting, though, was Van Gaal’s decision to select Ashley Young as a traditional winger. Young has looked good going forward from left-back this season and by shunting him further up the field, Van Gaal gave him licence to trouble young Hector Bellerin. It was a plan that worked early on, as Bellerin was booked for a foul, but Young couldn’t maintain the threat and spent too much time in his own half. Ashley Young celebrates with Rooney following the Manchester United and England captain's equaliser . TACTICS AND STYLE . Wenger is nothing if not brave when it comes to these games and that was reflected in his decision to pair Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil as central players. Some Arsenal supporters may have wanted their team to look rather more secure and at times the visiting team did look vulnerable when Fellaini edge forwards to impose his unique brand of physicality on to the Arsenal central defenders. Arsenal’s three-man attacking formation took a while to click but the holders’ full-backs Bellerin and Nacho Monreal got significant change out of their opposite numbers, forcing them back, and this allowed the visiting team to stretch the play in a fashion that made United look distinctly uncomfortable. Santi Cazorla (second left) vies for the ball with United trio Young, Daley Blind and Marouane Fellaini . When United did have the ball it was clear they had been instructed to play with more urgency. Certainly Van Gaal’s team moved the ball more quickly early on and tried to deliver telling balls between two Arsenal central defenders that can be vulnerable, something that paid dividends when Wayne Rooney equalised. Unfortunately, this is not a United team that has any great confidence or belief and as soon as things started to go wrong their game plan fell apart to the extent that the final 20 minutes saw them launch a succession of long balls up towards Fellaini. That, it must be said, was startlingly unsophisticated. One final question, here: If Rooney is the man chosen to take your free-kicks from out wide, just what does that say for the abilities of Young and Angel di Maria? TECHNICAL AREA SAVVY . Wenger once got so animated here that he ended up standing on the platform behind the dug-outs after being sent from his seat. It was not a good look but then his team were on the brink of a defeat at the time so perhaps he was to be excused signs of madness. On Monday night he was visible at times and contributed a lovely 360 degree dance after the first goal. A place in Strictly Come Dancing beckons in retirement, perhaps. Van Gaal, meanwhile, rarely ventures from his seat and whether that is the right thing or not depends on whether you think footballers actually benefit from a frantic man in a suit screaming at them while they are trying to put in to practice the things they have spent all week rehearsing. As usual, Van Gaal spent much of the time sitting down whilst scribbling mysteriously on his big black clipboard. It will be some letter home by the time the season ends and, sadly for him, will not include any stories about Wembley. Arsene Wenger (left) was animated on the touchline during Arsenal's win against Manchester United . SUBSTITUTIONS . Van Gaal sees football as an 18-man game and his use of substitutes – both good and bad – has been a feature of his time at Old Trafford, just as it was during last summer’s World Cup. Here, the United manager saw his team very much in the game and gathering momentum towards the end of the first half but then made two changes during the interval. It is hard to say they worked, the hooking of Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera serving only to rob United of any impetus. Luke Shaw was taken off in the second half for United after proving to be ineffective on the left . Equally, the early subs left Van Gaal with no wild card as United chased the game late on. As a result, Radamel Falcao remained on the bench. Wenger, meanwhile, was prepared to wait a little longer but his hand was forced when Oxlade-Chamberlain was injured immediately after the interval. Wenger’s response was positive, sending on a like-for-like replacement in Aaron Ramsey. VERDICT . If you come away with a victory on a night like this then you win the duel, it’s as simple as that. Wenger gambled with his selection and tactics and knew he would be criticised if it didn’t come off. Managers are paid to make the decisive calls, however, and to the victor the spoils.

"Sean Dyche has revealed that he tried to sign new England hero Harry Kane on loan for Burnley when he first took over at Turf Moor. Burnley face Tottenham at home on Sunday and Dyche must try to find a way of stopping Kane whose career has rocketed since honing his skills out on loan at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester earlier in his career. Dyche was also in the queue to sign Kane after taking over as Burnley manager in 2012, and he believes that the 21-year-old striker's spells in the Championship have helped make him the player he is today. Harry Kane at the Juventus Arena in Turin ahead of his firsts start for England . 'He's a player that most people would have had a look at when he wasn't in the side at Tottenham,' said Dyche. 'It's a good reflection of how the loan system can work, and it doesn't have to be the glory loan – the one where it works every time. He's had his ups and downs on loan but that can be a massive part of a young player's development, experiencing the fact that it doesn't always work hand in glove. 'It's not always perfect, you don't play every week, you have to challenge yourself to keep going and keep grinding and be professional every day to be ready to play when you're called upon. 'He was out at Millwall and it was possibly a step too early when he went out to Norwich to play there, and then Leicester a few bits and bobs off the bench. Kane enjoyed a phenomenal start to his international career by scoring on his debut last Friday . Kane headed home against Lithuania just 79 seconds after coming on to the field as a substitute . 'All of that for a young man who seems to me to have a very good temperament and a very good desire to be a footballer, (shows that) if you stick at it long enough you get your rewards. It has to be the ups and downs of football to bring the reality.' FA chairman Greg Dyke tabled a series of new proposals last week aimed at increasing the number of homegrown players in the Premier League. Burnley are the only team in the top-flight to field an all-British team this season, and Dyche believes that the only way for players like Kane to truly progress is to be given a chance at the highest level. Kane was sent on loan to several clubs in the lower leagues, including here at Millwall, before he found fame . The 21-year-old striker has taken the Premier League by storm this season with his glut of goals . 'It's not an exact science,' he added. 'The way the FA are trying to take a grip of it is to try and crunch it down to a better chance of elite young players coming through the system, and an improved chance of them being future England players. 'I don't think there's a perfect situation but they are certainly searching hard to find the best situation of allowing those players real growth. 'But that is inevitably playing in the Premier League. The earlier they can get that experience to play at the top level is the best learning curve.'","Harry Kane is the surprise star of the season with 30 goals and counting .

"The transformation of India's bowlers at the World Cup has been 'wonderful to watch' and the reigning champions will have a great chance of reaching the final if 10 Australian wickets tumble on Thursday, says Virat Kohli. India's bowlers were hammered all over Australia between December and mid-February as the team lost their Test series 2-0 and failed to win a single match in the following Tri-series, which also featured England. However, fast bowlers Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma have upped their game considerably at the World Cup and have combined with the strong spinners to forge a potent attack. India vice captain Virat Kohli is confident India can upset Australia to reach the World Cup final . The renowned batsman pushes through the nets during practice ahead of Thursday's semi-final . With the help of several run-outs, the Indian bowlers have dismissed the opposition in all seven matches on their way to the semi-finals. Kohli, the leading light in the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up, said everyone was aware of the areas where improvement was required and he was pleased by the way the pacemen had responded. India's bowlers including Mohit Sharma (centre) have picked up their game after early struggles Down Under . India's Mohammed Shami (right) celebrates after taking a wicket in the quarter final defeat of Bangladesh . 'The way the bowlers have reacted and the way they have performed with the composure and the confidence and the aggression all together, it's been wonderful to watch,' he told Cricket Australia's website. 'So we expect the bowlers to step up if you want to beat quality sides in the world and the way they have done this in this World Cup has been commendable. 'We've played the right kind of cricket and the difference now is how our bowling attack has come into play in this World Cup taking 70 wickets in seven games. Umesh Yadav (centre) celebrates after taking another wicket against Bangladesh to reach the last four . New Zealand celebrate en route to beating Australia to reach the Cricket World Cup final . 'That's probably been the difference, and if we continue to do that we have a great chance come game day.' India have not beaten Australia in any format since they arrived Down Under in late November but Kohli thinks Thursday at the Sydney Cricket Ground is the perfect opportunity to break that cycle. 'There couldn't be a better time for us,' he said. 'It's an opportunity for us to do justice to the way we've played so far in Australia, and we haven't had the results.'","India face Australia in the Cricket World Cup semi-finals on Thursday .

"The Islamic State has released a new propaganda video showing two deaf fighters speaking in sign language and urging more Westerners to join the terror group. The video is titled 'From Who Excused [sic] To Those Not Excused' - suggesting that disability is no excuse for not serving for ISIS. In the five minute clip the two men, who are deaf-mutes and brothers, are shown working as traffic police in Iraq's second city Mosul, which has been under ISIS control since last summer. Scroll down for video . Two deaf-mute brothers who claim to be fighting for ISIS in Iraq have taken part in the group's latest propaganda video, in an attempt to recruit more people with disabilities to fight for the terror group . The footage, which features the Islamic State flag in the top right hand corner, also shows them working for the traffic police in Mosul, in an attempt to depict an normal life as part of the terror group's Caliphate . Speaking in sign language with English and Arabic subtitles, one of the men says: 'I am a deaf mute who works in the traffic police in the Islamic State with my brother Abu Abdur-Rahman. 'As for my message to the apostate peshmerga (Kurdish fighters) we will strike you soon, by Allah's permission. I am living in a land in which Allah's sharia is established.' Wearing black jumpsuits, ammunition pouches and carrying what appear to be M16 assault rifles, the pair also speak about their desire to 'slaughter' their enemies including Britain, America, France and Italy, saying 'you will not stop our advance'. The fighters also threaten Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and those who have allied with the West, vowing to destroy them. In the final section of the slickly produced and professionally edited film, the brothers are shown assembling simple rocket launchers which they claim are used to fire at Kurdish fighters. The weapons consist of little more than crudely made explosives balanced on a metal frame which is tilted upwards and held in place using a few rocks. In the last seconds of the film, which features the Islamic State's logo in the top right hand corner, one of the men presses a trigger, launching the rockets. The last seconds of the film show the pair wiring up and launching two crude missiles which they claim are being aimed at Kurdish peshmerga fighters . Alex Kassirer, a researcher at Flashpoint Intelligence, who spoke to NBC News, said the video 'represents an attempt by the group to recruit other physically or otherwise impaired individuals, as well as demonstrates the multifaceted responsibilities of those in its ranks.' ISIS's ability to recruit western jihadis using online propaganda films and its monthly magazine, Dabiq, is well documented, and the films often feature fighters speaking about their daily lives, in an attempt to present life under the extremist Caliphate in a positive light. However this is thought to be the first film which deliberately features disabled people in an attempt to recruit more from Europe and the West.","Men claim to be deaf mute brothers working as traffic police in Mosul, Iraq .

"These days the Cheltenham Festival is a marathon not a sprint but Willie Mullins appears to have an outstanding chance of establishing a big lead in the trainers’ title with four stellar chances on Tuesday. Sky Bet Supreme Novices’ Hurdle favourite DOUVAN (Cheltenham, 1.30) is the first of the Mullins battalion to leave the blocks before the baton is passed to powerhouses UN DE SCEAUX (Cheltenham, 2.05) in the Arkle Chase and the exciting FAUGHEEN (Cheltenham, 3.20), who boasts an outstanding chance in the Stan James Champion Hurdle. Many feel Annie Power will complete the victory parade with her coronation in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle, but she will be priced prohibitively to do so and her task may not be as straightforward as it seems after a year’s absence. Douvan is the first of Willie Mullins battalion to race at Cheltenham on Tuesday . Of the quartet, Faugheen arguably faces the most competition with last year’s winner Jezki and The New One, an unlucky third following an interrupted passage, in opposition along with National Hunt legend Hurricane Fly. However, Faugheen’s potential is as yet untapped, whereas the level his rivals have reached is known — albeit a lofty standard. The selection destroyed the opposition in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton with the form receiving a boost when third-home Blue Heron, beaten 17 lengths by Faugheen, hammered Irving at Wincanton in Grade Two company. That performance poured scorn on the theory Faugheen has beaten nothing in his unbeaten eight-race hurdling career, although it is worth noting he also boasts a 22-length mauling of Josses Hill in a Punchestown bumper and a 12-length demolition of the talented Valseur Lido on his record. Fuagheen, pictured on Monday, faces tough competition from last year's winner Jezki and The New One . In short, the son of Germany could prove to be a class apart, especially if The New One continues to drift right at his hurdles, a habit which threatens his hopes of becoming a champion. Jezki is solid and comes to himself at this time of year on spring ground, but his limitations have been somewhat exposed by Hurricane Fly in Ireland this winter and he remains vulnerable to an emerging talent like Faugheen. Hurricane Fly has been done few favours by the drying ground, but the third of Mullins’ representatives, Arctic Fire, could sneak into the places. Tuesday’s nap vote goes the way of CAUSE OF CAUSES (Cheltenham, nap, 4.40), who appears to have undergone an interesting preparation for the National Hunt Chase and was a fine second in a handicap at the meeting 12 months ago when an error at the last fence denied him victory.","Willie Mullins looks to have chance of establishing lead in trainers' title .

"Kevin Pietersen's advisers can try to conclude negotiations for a new contract at Surrey, as he seeks to reignite hopes of an England recall, after agreeing his Indian Premier League release. Pietersen was axed by England in February 2014 after their Ashes whitewash defeat in Australia, but is hoping for a still unlikely international return. He confirmed, on his website kevinpietersen.com, that he has taken another key step to that end by sealing his release from the majority of his IPL contract with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. Kevin Pietersen will have nine County Championship matches at the most to impress England's selectors . He's secured a released from Sunrisers Hyderabad to stake his claim for an England return in the Ashes . Pietersen said: 'My focus is now very much on the upcoming season in England, and I'm absolutely determined to score as many runs as possible.' Surrey de-registered Pietersen at the end of last season. They have nonetheless long been front-runners to re-sign him, but had no update on Tuesday to the situation as of a week ago when a spokesman said: 'We are still in discussions.' Pietersen's availability for all formats, as soon as possible, has appeared a starting point for his possible return to The Oval - and his presence at the start of the season, rather than spending six weeks at the IPL, is therefore a key development. New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves this month revived the record-breaking 34-year-old batsman's hopes of a return to the fold, contrary to the public remarks by anyone else associated with the governing body. But a pre-requisite from Graves was that Pietersen must first of all find a way back into county cricket - and then, of course, start scoring runs again. Pietersen will miss the regular season in the IPL but could be summoned for the knockout stages . Imminent Surrey signing Pietersen says he will 'do everything in my power to earn a recall' with England . Pietersen may still be recalled by the Sunrisers for just a one-week period, should they qualify for the IPL knockout stages between May 19 and May 24. That, however, ought not to be an insurmountable problem for any county interested in securing his services. He added: 'I've never made any secret of my overwhelming desire to once again represent England, and I'm going to do everything in my power to earn a recall to the international set-up. 'To once again put on that England shirt would be a privilege and an honour, but now I have to focus on performing domestically and give myself the best possible chance of meriting selection.' A statement on his website spelled out Pietersen's next move - without specifying Surrey as his immediate destination - and that he has his heart set on an England return in time for this summer's Ashes rematch, beginning in July. Pietersen was axed by England following their 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia last winter . Pietersen in action for Surrey in the Natwest T20 Blast last summer . Pietersen started the year by playing more short form cricket for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash . It read: 'The four-time Ashes winner, who is also England's highest ever run-scorer in all formats, will... join a domestic county with the aim of earning a place in the England squad for the upcoming Ashes series.' Pietersen quickly made it clear at the start of this month that he was delighted to take Graves at his word, that the slate will be wiped clean for all under his tenure, and he has since confirmed he has already spoken to the incoming chairman on the telephone. The controversial South Africa-born batsman has received little encouragement yet in public remarks from other quarters - including ECB managing director Paul Downton and national selector James Whitaker. Pietersen, however, has said he will 'do anything' to play for England again.","Kevin Pietersen is set to sign with Surrey for the County Championship .

"Arsene Wenger is facing another midfield injury headache after Francis Coquelin suffered a broken nose on Sunday. The Frenchman will discover today whether he needs surgery after he was injured in a nasty collision with team-mate Olivier Giroud before taking another blow in the closing stages.

After a lengthy stoppage out, Coquelin was allowed to return the field of play having received treatment . This clash of heads in the second-half left Coquelin with bloody gushing out of his nose . Arsenal are already without key central midfielders Mikel Arteta and Jack Wilshere, while Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini, who didn't feature on the bench yesterday, only returned to training at the end of last week. 'Yes, Coquelin has broken his nose. If he needs surgery or not I don't know,' said Wenger. Coquelin needed lengthy treatment following the clash of heads in the 67th minute but played on until the 89th when he was hauled off after taking a second blow as he went up for a header with Steven Naismith. Coquelin is evidently in pain on the ground after a collision with Giroud broke his nose at the Emirates . And Wenger revealed it was the 23-year-old's decision to continue playing. 'After he took a hit on it again I had to take him off,' Wenger added. 'I had been told by medical people he could stay on and he wanted to stay on.' Arsenal keeper David Ospina made three excellent saves to shut out Everton and manager Roberto Martinez said: 'I felt we were the ones creating the chances and when you create them you need to take them.'","Arsenal face another injury blow after Francis Coquelin broke his nose .

"Chelsea secured the first major silverware of the season with a 2-0 win over London rivals Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley. John Terry pounced to fire in from close range just before half-time and Diego Costa secured the trophy with his deflected strike after 56 minutes. Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham rates every player's performance at Wembley. Chelsea captain John Terry (centre) celebrates with Blues team-mates having opened the scoring at Wembley . CHELSEA (4-3-3) Petr Cech - 7 . Huge pressure was on his shoulders after getting the nod ahead of Thibaut Courtois and he was as reliable as Jose Mourinho would’ve expected. Nothing spectacular, but a cup final clean sheet. Branislav Ivanovic - 7 . The full back was in a rare miss shock early on when he headed wide at the back post. Cleverly won the free kick for Chelsea’s opener, controlling John Terry’s long ball well before going down when pulled by Nacer Chadli. Gary Cahill - 7.5 . Completely nullified the threat of Tottenham’s main man Harry Kane. Almost scored with a header, seconds before the break and moments after Chelsea had gone ahead. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard holds off the challenge of Spurs right back Kyle Walker at Wembley . John Terry - 8.5 . Leading by example as he fired Chelsea ahead just before the break and was equally as solid at the back. Cesar Azpilicueta - 7 . Was in the wars and ended the game with a heavily bandaged up head. Part of an incredibly solid Chelsea back line. Ramires - 6.5 . Solid and reliable performance, if not emphatic. Controlled in defensive midfield alongside an unlikely partner in Zouma and did what was required. Kurt Zouma - 6.5 . Looked out of position in defensive midfield at first but improved vastly. Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas dispossesses Tottenham's Harry Kane (left) in the Capital One Cup final . Eden Hazard - 7.5 . The creative cog in Chelsea’s midfield, finding space on the left-hand side and through the middle. Inches wide with an effort in the second-half. As per usual, the target of several fouls. Cesc Fabregas - 7.5 . Quiet first-half, but made his presence felt early in the second by using his chest to flick the ball into the air then execute and audacious overhead kick which almost beat Hugo Lloris then set up Diego Costa for the second. Willian (substitute for Cuadrado, 76th minute) - 7 . Expertly delivered ball into the box for Chelsea’s first-half goal and was on-song throughout against the club he almost signed for. Diego Costa (substituted for Drogba, 90th minute) - 8 . Dealt the killer blow in the tie with the second goal. At his usual, infuriating best. Involved in early exchanges with Eric Dier, then palmed Nabil Bentaleb in the face. Subs not used: Courtois, Filipe Luis, Ake, Oscar, Remy. Diego Costa celebrates after Chelsea went two goals ahead  after his shot deflected past Hugo Lloris . TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1) Hugo Lloris - 6 . Crucial save to deny Cahill a second just before the break, which would’ve surely buried Spurs, but was powerless to keep out either goal. Hugo Lloris (centre) fails to keep out Terry's opener from close range at Wembley Stadium on Sunday . Kyle Walker - 5.5 . He did not get close enough to Costa in the second half to stop him getting the shot away which then took a deflection off him which wrong-footed Lloris on its way in. Eric Dier - 5.5 . Let Costa rile him in the early stages and picked up a yellow card going through the back of the striker then failed to clear Willian’s free kick to allow Terry to score. Jan Vertonghen - 6 . The calmer of the two heads in Tottenham’s centre of defence and barely put a foot wrong during the match. Tottenham defender Walker shields off the challenge of Chelsea's Eden Hazard at Wembley . Danny Rose - 5.5 . Crucial diving header to stop a Chelsea break at speed in the first-half, covering in the centre of defence, then was at fault for conceding the opener by flicking on Willian’s free kick. Nabil Bentaleb - 5 . Contributed little to Tottenham’s performance and picked up a silly yellow card late on for an unnecessary foul. Mason (substitute for Lamela, 71st minute, 6) - 5.5 . Resorted to shooting from distance, going for the spectacular when a more patient approach was needed. Christian Eriksen of Tottenham attempts to hold off the challenge of Chelsea centre back Kurt Zouma . Nacer Chadli (substituted for Soldado, 80th minute) - 5.5 . He gave away a foolish foul, pulling on Ivanovic’s arm, which gave Chelsea the free kick they scored the opening goal from. Christian Eriksen - 6.5 . Hit the bar early on with a free kick and was Spurs’ most dangerous player going forward, generating a few openings that Cech dealt with fairly easily. Andros Townsend (substituted for Dembele, 62nd minute, 6) - 5.5 . Too ineffectual down Tottenham’s right-hand side. Tried to get on the ball and run at Chelsea but created little of note. Tottenham's in form striker Kane takes on Chelsea duo Ramires (right) and Zouma (left) Harry Kane - 5 . Spent the game in Cahill’s back pocket. Spurs fans were desperate for their man-of-the-moment, and top scorer, to run the show, but he was almost invisible. Subs not used: Vorm, Davies, Fazio, Stambouli.","Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side beat Tottenham 2-0 at Wembley .

"Arsenal target Charles Aranguiz has admitted it would be a ‘dream’ to move to the north London club. The Chile midfielder plays for Brazilian club side Internacional, but has been scouted by Arsene Wenger since he starred in last summer’s World Cup.

I've heard about it through the press but nobody has talked to me.’ Aranguiz, 25, has the unusual blend of being a bullish midfielder as well as a creative playmaker and impressed during Brazil 2014.

"Former Monaco and Tottenham star Glenn Hoddle has predicted a 'difficult' evening for Arsenal as they try to stage a Champions League comeback against Monaco on Tuesday. The Gunners' European hopes are hanging by a thread following a 3-1 capitulation against the French side in the first leg at the Emirates. Hoddle, who was part of the Monaco side that won the league title under Arsene Wenger in 1988, is doubtful that Arsenal will be able to score three goals at the Stade Louis II - a feat that hasn't been managed by any other team in the last 42 months.

"As Manchester United turned in their most dominant display of the season against Tottenham on Sunday, the influence of one man cannot be underestimated. Michael Carrick's return to Louis van Gaal's starting XI proved crucial at Old Trafford, and could be the turning point for United as they look to finish in the top four this season. He took less than nine minutes to stamp his authority on the game and show the Old Trafford faithful what they have so missed during his two months out. Michael Carrick (second left) heads Manchester United 2-0 up against Tottenham on Sunday . Carrick is congratulated on his goal by his United team-mates during the 3-0 win at Old . UNITED WITH CARRICK . P15 W10 D3 L2 . Win percentage: 66.70% . Points per game: 2.2 . UNITED WITHOUT CARRICK . P14 W6 D5 L3 . Win percentage: 42.90% . Points per game: 1.6 . With Daley Blind on the ball at left back and no Tottenham players covering a huge gap just in from the left touchline, Carrick burst forward to receive the ball before instantly playing a perfectly weighted pass for Marouane Fellaini to open the scoring for United. Ten minutes later Carrick had headed his side 2-0 up and sent them on the way to a vital win. But it was the composure and attacking intent that Carrick provided on Sunday that United have missed so much in recent weeks - something which was not lost on his manager. 'Michael Carrick is not my second captain for nothing. He is one of the best passers also, not only wide but also forward. We need midfielders who have that passing,' said Van Gaal after the game. Indeed, with Carrick in the side United have picked up 2.2 points per game compared to just 1.6 without him. The club have won 66.7% of the game the midfielder has played but than number drops to 42.9% without the England midfielder. Daley Blind played at left back against Tottenham but has spent most of the season in central midfield . Ander Herrera (left) has impressed in midfield for United since signing from Athletic Bilbao in the summer . Marouane Fellaini (left) has been played in an advanced midfield role for United this season . Liverpool (away) - March 22 . Aston Villa (home) - April 4 . Man City (home) - April 12 . Chelsea (away) - April 18 . Everton (away) - April 26 . West Brom (home) - May 2 . Crystal Palace (away) - May 9 . Arsenal (home) - May 16 . Hull (away) - May 24 . In truth, nobody should be surprised. Carrick has been a mainstay of United's midfield for years now, anchoring the side from a deep position. Whether his midfield partners have been of the necessary quality over the years is debatable, but with the likes of Ander Herrera and Blind - as well as the revitalised Fellaini - now available, Carrick should not have to carry the burden all by himself. At 33, however, Carrick remains United's main man. As well as Herrera and Blind have done in their first seasons in English football, neither have the authority or influence of Carrick. With trips to Liverpool, Chelsea and Everton to come too, Carrick's big-game experience will also be key. With nine games to go, United will be hoping Carrick stays fit, because with him in the side, they have a much better chance of finishing in the top four.","Michael Carrick scored and set up another against Tottenham on Sunday .

"UEFA president Michel Platini has defended a ban on third party ownership (TPO) of footballers - labelling the practice 'shameful' and a form of 'slavery'. Super agent Jorge Mendes, who includes Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho among his clients, has claimed the ban is illegal and will kill competition in Europe. The Spanish and Portuguese leagues have also opposed the ban. TPO is a practice which takes place in several countries, particularly in South America, where companies own the economic rights of players and benefit from their transfer fees. It has been banned in the Premier League since 2008. UEFA president Michel Platini has defended a ban on third party ownership (TPO) of footballers . Platini, who pushed FIFA to impose the ban - said the ban would stop huge sums of money disappearing from football. Speaking on a UEFA video forum in response to a question from Paris St Germain manager Laurent Blanc, Platini said: 'I have put a lot of pressure on FIFA to stop third party ownership. 'Today, it's shameful to see some players with one of their arms belonging to one person, a leg belonging to a funds pension located who knows where, and a third person owning his foot. 'It is shameful; we're dealing with a type of slavery that belongs to the past. 'Everyone earns money on such transfers, and while we are trying to find money to invest in football, that money goes in the pockets of I don't know who, and I don't know where. 'It's about time that the world of football wakes up, and that the money coming into football remains in football, and doesn't disappear.' Kia Joorabchian, head of Media Sports Investments, part-owned a number of high-profile players . Platini also said in the forum that the biggest misconception about him was that he alone took major decisions about football. He added: 'I think that the people in Europe, or in the world, they think that I take my decisions alone. But you have to understand one thing, I am very democratic and very transparent, and I never take a decision alone without the support of the executive committee or with the Congress of the UEFA. 'I listen to everybody very carefully and I take my decision, when it is necessary to take a decision, always for the good of the game and for the good of football. Don't think that I am very despotic.'

"A shoulder injury to James Tomkins means Cheikhou Kouyate is likely to find himself at the heart of West Ham's defence at Arsenal on Saturday - and the Senegal international has a plan. The 25-year-old midfielder has been used to plug a hole in the centre of Sam Allardyce's defence already this season and Kouyate wants to use the performance of his former club Anderlecht as inspiration for leaving the Emirates Stadium with a positive result. Tomkins, who has recently penned a new long-term deal at Upton Park, dislocated a shoulder in training on Thursday and joins fellow defender Winston Reid on the injury list - with forwards Andy Carroll, Carlton Cole and Enner Valencia also likely to miss out and Alex Song nursing a slight knee injury. West Ham midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate (right) is looking forward to facing Arsenal at the Emirates stadium . James Tomkins is one of three defenders who are unavailable for Saturday's Premier League clash . Add to that Carl Jenkinson's ineligibility against his parent club, and Allardyce will be selecting from a much-depleted pool for a fourth successive Barclays Premier League London derby. But Kouyate was in the crowd as his previous side Anderlecht recovered from a 3-0 half-time deficit to take a Champions League point home from north London and he wants to follow in the footsteps of the Belgian outfit. 'I have never played at the Emirates stadium before, but I know I will play my game and try to enjoy it. I want to help the team and battle for the points,' he told whufc.com . 'Arsenal is a very big team, but West Ham need the points. It's a very good game and London derby, which I like. I'll go to Arsenal to do battle. 'I went to the Emirates to support Anderlecht in the Champions League earlier this season and they did very well and drew three-all. Kouyate went to the Emirates to watch his former club Anderlect secure a dramatic 3-3 draw in November . The Gunners were stunned as the Belgian side came from 3-0 down to grab a point in the Champions League . 'I was very happy because Anderlecht is my second family. Arsenal went 3-0 up and I was thinking ""What is this game?"" but in the second half Anderlecht came with a new mentality. 'It went to 3-1, then 3-2 and then 3-3 - it was unbelievable! 'I am very happy for Anderlecht, but now West Ham go to Arsenal and it would be fantastic if we could do the same. We want to get a draw or even a win.' The Hammers confirmed on Friday morning that Tomkins required hospital treatment as he became the latest player ruled out of Allardyce's squad. 'West Ham United can confirm that James Tomkins has suffered a dislocated shoulder. The 25-year-old was taken for hospital treatment and will continue to be assessed by the club's medical staff,' they wrote over two tweets. Kouyate, pictured with Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas, says West Ham are aiming for a 'a draw or even a win' Kouyate enjoyed a short stint at the heart of West Ham's defence alongside Tomkins due to injuries earlier in the year - scoring against Manchester United and quickly adapting to the role. It is likely he will return to that position for the trip to Arsenal, with the highly-rated but inexperienced Reece Oxford another option. In attack, Cole and Carroll are missing with respective hamstring and knee problems, whilst Valencia is a doubt having suffered a deep cut to his toe after standing on a broken teacup. The number of key first-team players in the treatment room will no doubt be a worry to Allardyce who has seen his side win just one of their last 11 Premier League fixtures.","West Ham take on Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday, kick-off at 3pm .

"Disgraced NRL player Todd Carney could make his way back into the league after the NRL appeals committee ruled in his favour declaring he was unfairly dismissed from his former team, the Cronulla Sharks. Tribunal chairman, Ian Callinan QC, ruled that the Sharks board failed to allow the 29-year-old footballer due process before severing his contract. This came after a photograph of the player urinating into his own mouth went viral on social media last June. Mr Carney's contract was torn up after a photo emerged of the player urinating in his own mouth . The committee’s findings state that the former Dally M medallist should have been allowed an opportunity to plead his case in front of the Cronulla board. Cronulla Sharks chairman Damien Keough said the club will respect the decision made by the appeals committee, adding it is their responsibility to follow correct procedure. “The big oversight was that someone needed to check that the process being followed was correct,’’ Keogh told The Telegraph. Mr Carney's agent claims the photo was a set up and 'an optical illusion' “What’s important to remember here is that it’s not a question of the facts, it’s a question of the process, but the reality of the situation is, the decision would likely have been the same. He said he wouldn't completely rule out the possibility of the former Origin player returning to the league but 'there has been a lot of water that has flown under the bridge since last June.' There's no denying Mr Carney is a talented player, however, his antics off the field have led to the termination of three contracts . The Daily Mail Australia reached out to the Cronulla Sharks however they declined to comment. Mr Carney is currently in France nursing broken ribs, sustaining the injury in only his second game for the English Super League Club Catalans. After what most believed was ultimately the end of the troubled player's career, the five-eighth may surprise us all by staging a return to the league. The disgraced player fled to France to pick up the pieces of his damaged career where he sustained a rib injury . As Cronulla is the third team to terminate a contract with the fallen star, the question remains, which team would be game to pick up the controversial player? Paul Gallen has spoken out on Triple M Radio saying he thinks Mr Carney should allowed to return to the league however he would need a strict contract to curb his bad behaviour. ‘If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life,’ says Paul Gallen . ‘If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life.’ Rumours are flying on Twitter that the Manly Sea Eagles might be in the market for a five-eighth after the Kieran Foran announced he would be moving to Parramatta in the 2016 season. Rumours are starting to circulate about the former Cronulla player's options for the 2016 season . Alternately, the ruling now gives Mr Carney the option of perusing legal action against the club by filing an unfair dismissal claim with the Industrial Relations Commission.","The NRL appeals committee ruled Todd Carney was unfairly dismissed .

"Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet admits Liverpool's improved defensive resilience is making life a little easier for them and instilling confidence throughout the side. A 2-0 victory over struggling Burnley - which the Belgium goalkeeper stressed was just as important as Sunday's win over high-flying Manchester City - saw the Reds record their sixth clean sheet in eight Premier League matches. They have now not lost in 12 league games, picking up 30 points, and have won seven of the last eight. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet (left) believes the team's improved defence helped confidence to grow . Mignolet kept another clean sheet against Burnley on Wednesday and has been pleased with his form . Jordan Henderson (third left) struck Liverpool's first goal from the edge of the area in the first half at Anfield . Liverpool were not seriously tested by the second-bottom visitors at Anfield on Wednesday night but Mignolet said that should not detract from the defensive work being done by the side. 'I think we defended really well. We were very organised and we didn't give too many things away,' he said. 'A clean sheet is nice and I am happy with how things are going but we all have to keep improving and keep looking forward. 'We're doing our jobs at the moment and we have to keep that going until the end of the season because it makes it easier for us to win games. 'Even at half-time, when it was 1-0, we were saying that we had to keep going because one goal can change the whole game. 'We wanted to make sure we didn't give any silly goals away. We kept calm and defended well and then we got that second goal, which makes things a little bit easier for us at the end. 'Teams likes Man City and Chelsea lost points against Burnley at home so we needed to get three points, otherwise that win over Man City would have meant nothing. 'So six points out of six was what we wanted, and we can move forward and we need to keep going like this until the end of the season.' Stand-in captain Jordan Henderson opened the scoring for the second successive game and the 24-year-old is growing into the senior midfielder role in the absence of Steven Gerrard, who returned to training this week after a hamstring injury. Gerrard leaves for Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer and Henderson, as current vice-captain, is favourite to assume the armband on a permanent basis.

Gerrard (centre) is back in training but will leave Liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the season . Daniel Sturridge (right) headed in Liverpool's second goal in the game against Burnley on Wednesday . 'Jordan is a massive player for us,' said Mignolet. 'He is a very positive character who always works hard and leads by example. 'He's vocal both on the pitch and in the dressing room. He goes in front of us and everyone follows behind. 'We've got a young squad but that doesn't mean there aren't leaders in the team. 'Every individual is contributing to the team. The big thing for us is we're a unit and we're working well together. 'But individuals score goals and at the moment it's Jordan, Philippe (Coutinho) and Studge (Daniel Sturridge) doing the business for us.' Liverpool have not lost in the 13 matches Henderson has started as captain, with an incredible record of eight Premier League wins out of nine.

"It wasn't one for the scrapbook, but Ronald Koeman won't care a jot. When Sadio Mane fired home eight minutes from time, not only did it end a run of three games without a win - it ended a 387 minute spell without a home league goal. This wasn't a display that said much for Southampton's Champions League credentials, nevertheless their top-four dream is still alive after this scrappy win over Crystal Palace. Sadio Mane races away to celebrate following his 83rd minute strike at St Mary's . Mane watches on as his strike secured a much-needed three points for Ronald Koeman's side . Southampton (4-2-3-1): Forster 6.5; Clyne 6.5, Fonte 6.5, Yoshida 6, Bertrand 6.5; Wanyama 6.5, Schneiderlin 6.5; Elia 6 (Tadic 59), Djuricic 6 (Ward-Prowse 78), Mane 6.5; Pelle 5.5 (Long 70).

'We scored and we won at home, so I'm relieved, but I can't say we deserved to win,' said Koeman. 'It's all about confidence and we didn't have that tonight. But I think it can one of the key moments in our season. 'Qualifying for the Champions League will be difficult, but we will try our best.' Palace manager Alan Pardew wasn't as contented in his post-match press conference, however. The Eagles boss was angered by referee Martin Atkinson's decision not to award the his side a second half penalty after Jose Fonte bundled over Yannick Bolasie in the 70th minute. 'Fonte was over aggressive in the box,' insisted Pardew. 'It should have been given, but we've been harshly treated by officials in the last few games and sometimes you get a run like that.' In response to Pardew's comments, Koeman said: 'It's easy to tell that story after losing game, the ref wasn't involved in final result. 'We scored, they didn't. I know that feeling, it's too easy and people talk too much about referees. I don't like that.' Pardew may change his mind once he sees replays of Fonte's shoulder-to-shoulder collision with Bolasie. Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha (right) controls posession under pressure from Southampton defender Maya Yoshida . Eagles forward Zaha makes a run as Saints midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) gives chase at St Mary's Stadium . Perhaps the Palace manager, who was without skipper Mile Jedinak, who on Tuesday accepted a four match suspension for elbowing Diafra Sakho on Saturday, was trying to mask his disappointment at leaving the south coast with nothing when they could easily have left with all three points. The fact Palace players hardly appealed for a spot-kick tells its own story. Southampton enjoyed the upper hand during the opening exchanges, Filip Djurcic fashioning the first chance, controlling Victor Wanyama's mishit shot only to fire over the bar in the 11th minute. But despite their dominance in terms of possession, this looked a Southampton side void of invention in the final third. Even 25 minutes into the game, you could sense the anxiety from home supporters. Earlier this week a local newspaper scrapped an idea to print full-page arrows for Saints fans to display  as a tongue-in-cheek reminder to players of where the opposition goal is.

Graziano Pelle (left) and Scott Dann both hit the turf as the Italian chases his first goal looked to add to his single goal in 13 appearances . But on the evidence of the opening 45 minutes, Koeman's side needed all the help they could get. The anxiety in Southampton's attacking play even trickled back to their usually tight defence in the 36th minute, goalkeeper Fraser Forster misjudging a high ball, nearly allowing Wilfried Zaha to tap into an empty net. Palace keeper Julian Speroni made the first real stop of the night in the 40th minute, saving Eljero Elia's shot from a half-cleared Morgan Schneiderlin corner at his near post.

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman (right) watches on from the technical area with Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew not far away . The rebound fell to Pelle, but the struggling striker could only stab his effort wide from close range. During the opening months of the season, the ball would have nestled in the back of the net for the Italian. How he must long for those heady days. So to must have Koeman as he faced up to yet another half-time team talk without a goal from his side. Likewise, Palace offered next to nothing in the attacking third during the opening 45 minutes, nevertheless Pardew would have been satisfied with the outcome of their first half. He'd have been even happier if Forster hadn't produced an excellent save from Jason Puncheon in the 48th minute after the former Saints forward turned Maya Yoshida brilliantly in the box. Seven minutes later the visitors went even closer, Zaha hitting the inside of Forster's far post after the England goalkeeper's initial save from Bolasie. Koeman replaced Elia with Dusan Tadic just before the hour mark in search of attacking impetus, Shane Long and Shane Ward-Prowse soon followed. Saints boss Koeman was fearing another goalless 90 minutes from his side in the 69th minute when Maya Yoshida somehow fired wide from three yards after Schneiderlin's corner. But eight minutes from time, St Mary's erupted as Mane fired home after Speroni failed to hold from Ward-Prowse's shot.

"Montenegrin fans who keep causing trouble and forced Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Russia to be abandoned are 'barbarians', according to the general secretary of their FA. The Group G match ended midway through the second half after two outbursts of violence, the first 25 seconds after kick off when a home fan hit Russia keeper Igor Akinfeev with a flare in the head. The match resumed after a 33-minute delay but following fighting between rival fans during halftime and another 18-minute delay for the second half to begin, more trouble erupted. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch footage of mass brawl and flare incident . Montenegro fans light flares from the stands during the Euro qualifier on Friday . A mass brawl between Russia and Montenegro players led to the Euro 2016 qualifier being abandoned . Fans holding flares cut intimidating figures from the roof of the stadium in Podgorica . German referee Deniz Aytekin called the game off in the 67th minute after Russian midfielder Dmitri Kombarov was hit with a missile from the terraces, following a scuffle between players on the touchline. 'These fans sing ""Montenegro we love you"" but throw flares, insult rivals and cause all sorts of incidents every time they turn up and that's outright hypocrisy,' general secretary Momir Djurdjevac told reporters after the ugly scenes in the stadium. 'We have left the impression of barbarians and this is a complete disaster. It seems we don't deserve to have a nation, a soccer team or a berth in a major tournament. 'As far as I am concerned the game should not have continued after the first-minute incident. We can only thank God that no one was seriously hurt.' Russia keeper Igor Akinfeev is knocked to the ground by a flare thrown from the stands after one minute . Akinfeev is carried off the pitch on a stretcher, leading to a 30 minute suspension of the game . Akinfeev was taken to hospital with a concussion and neck burns, undergoing a brain scan and a number of other tests. Montenegrin media also reported a charged atmosphere in Podgorica several hours before kick-off with riot police deployed in numbers to separate rival fans congregating in the city centre. UEFA said it would wait for reports from the match delegate and the referee before opening disciplinary proceedings and Djurdjevac acknowledged any punishment would be suitable. 'We will in all likelihood pay a hefty fine and say goodbye to a major tournament but what scares me is that this can happen again and someone must step forward and say ""Enough"".' Russia head coach Fabio Capello scratches his head as players leave the pitch after the match is abandoned . Riot police clash with Montenegrin fans after the game is abandoned following a pitch brawl . 'Who wants to play for the national team under such circumstances? 'These players have a big dream and it's to qualify with our tiny nation for a major tournament but we are going nowhere.' While Russia have demanded to be awarded victory following the abandonment in Podgorica on Friday night. Russian Football Union president Nikolai Tolstykh said in a statement that his organization would file a protest to UEFA and that 'in our view, it should be a technical defeat for Montenegro.' He added that the match should have been abandoned following the attack on Akinfeev.","Montenegro's Euro 2016 qualifier with Russia abandoned after mass brawl .

"Tottenham striker Harry Kane is in contention to make his England debut on Friday night against Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier. The 21-year-old has been in sparkling form for Spurs this season - having netted 29 goals in all competitions so far. 1966 World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst believes Kane has what it takes to shine on the international stage for Roy Hodgson's side. 1966 World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst (left) believes Harry Kane has what it takes to be an England star . Thrill of a debut . I’ll never forget what it was like getting that first call. It was the start of 1966 and West Ham’s manager Ron Greenwood took me aside in training and said I had been picked for a game against Poland. It was real elation even if I didn’t play. I made my debut a month later against West Germany. Why this is relevant to Harry is the confidence you get from reaching that level. That could be a very big factor for this lad. Hurst made his debut for England in a 1-0 friendly win against West Germany in February 1966 . Confidence . Self-belief is a huge thing in football, especially for strikers. When I got my England debut I felt 10 feet tall. With the season Harry has had, and now this selection, his extra confidence means we should be able to expect even more from him. The challenge will be doing it again next season. People will analyse how you mark him, how you stop him. It will be very interesting to see how he reacts to that. I would say he is not vulnerable to that, when I think about his character. Kane could make his England debut against Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night at Wembley . Character . What I like is that Harry has not had it all his own way - he had to fight to get in, he had to go out on loan. It has not been smooth. I wasn’t a world-class player coming through but we have seen lots of players who have become more successful than those around them with more talent. Dedication and attitude are such key traits and Harry has those in abundance. I saw him receive an award recently at a charity dinner. You could see how level-headed he is. Kane has had several spells out on loan before breaking into the Tottenham first-team this season . The Ingredients . Looking at Harry, I am reminded of a speech I heard years ago by Bill Shankly. He was talking about Chelsea’s Peter Osgood and said: ‘Peter is deceptive - he is much slower than you think he is.’ I liken that to Harry. He is deceptive - he is much better than you think he is. Harry is a bit like Thomas Muller, the Bayern Munich and Germany forward. On your first glance at Muller, he doesn’t look like a footballer. He has his socks down his shins, looks ungainly. But he’s a fantastic player. I liken Harry to that type of all-round player. Hurst believes Kane's deceptive style of play can be compared to Germany forward Thomas Muller (right) Strengths . I like how he shoots. He is almost always on target. He can score from distance or a tap-in - and that is a whole different skill. He can anticipate and poach. He has excellent technique. He strikes the ball cleanly and that is why he is often on target. It is also why he is so good at keeping the ball low. How often do you see him shoot over? The other thing is they come from all directions. He will still be unpredictable next year because there is not one set place he shoots from. Kane (left) battles for the ball against Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason during England training on Thursday . It helps that he is so comfortable with each foot, unlike a lot of players today. More than that, Harry has football intelligence which is especially important for strikers. His awareness of space on the pitch is very good. Throw in the fact he is very, very good in the air, strong physically and willing to press and defend, and you have a striker to be excited about. He is a team player. I will save my excitement until the end of next season to see if he has done it again - look at Ravel Morrison - but Harry looks very good. Hurst is impressed with Kane's (right) ability to shoot off either foot as well as his ability in the air . Weaknesses . I don’t think he has electric pace. But I didn’t have that and it didn’t do me any harm. He is not slow - he can still run at players - but it is not electric pace. Teddy Sheringham was like that and I think Harry has Teddy’s intelligence. Despite a lack of pace, Teddy Sheringham made 51 appearances for England - scoring 11 goals . Sir Geoff Hurst is encouraging communities to nominate a local #GrassrootsHero for the FA & McDonald’s Community Awards. Nominations in England close on March 27; to make your nomination, go to: www.mcdonalds.co.uk/awards .","England host Lithuania in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night .

"Midfielder Harry Arter has been rewarded for his contribution to Bournemouth's bid for Barclays Premier League football with a first call-up to the senior Republic of Ireland squad. The 25-year-old, who regularly represented his country at Under 17 and Under 19 levels, has been included in a provisional 35-man party for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on March 29. Manager Martin O'Neill will reduce the initial squad before the players meet up on March 22 ahead of what could prove to be a key game in the qualification campaign, but there could yet be a place for a surprise inclusion in the shape of Arter. Harry Arter (left) has been called up to the Ireland squad after impressing for Bournemouth this season . David Forde (Millwall), Shay Given (Aston Villa), Keiren Westwood (Sheffield Wednesday) Darren Randolph (Birmingham), Rob Elliot (Newcastle), Richard Keogh (Derby), Marc Wilson (Stoke), Seamus Coleman (Everton), Cyrus Christie (Derby), John O'Shea (Sunderland), Alex Pearce (Reading), Paul McShane (Hull), James McCarthy (Everton), Jeff Hendrick (Derby), Ciaran Clark (Aston Villa), Stephen Ward (Burnley . Harry Arter (Bournemouth), Glenn Whelan (Stoke), Darron Gibson (Everton), Paul Green (Rotherham), Aiden McGeady (Everton), Anthony Pilkington (Cardiff), James McClean (Wigan), Robbie Brady, Stephen Quinn, David Meyler (all Hull), Wes Hoolahan (Norwich) Robbie Keane (LA Galaxy), Shane Long (Southampton), Daryl Murphy (Ipswich), Jon Walters (Stoke), Kevin Doyle (Wolves), Anthony Stokes (Celtic), Simon Cox (Reading), David McGoldrick (Ipswich). O'Neill said: 'He is having a very good season. I think, yeah, why not? It would be nice to have a look at him. 'He's obviously played at under-age level and I wanted to introduce another fresh face. There are no guarantees of anything. I've met him twice now and I think he deserves that chance. 'This might be a surprise to him as I didn't say anything to him. He will hopefully be pleasantly surprised.' Former Charlton trainee Arter is currently in his fifth season with the Cherries after joining them from Woking in June 2010, and has scored six goals in 38 appearances to date during the current campaign. Bournemouth head into the weekend having returned to the top of the Sky Bet Championship table as a result of their 5-1 victory at Fulham last weekend, but only on goal difference with Derby, Watford and Middlesbrough all level with them on 66 points and Norwich just a point behind. Hull midfielder Robbie Brady and Everton counterpart Aiden McGeady have been included, although Brady in particular is struggling with a torn calf muscle, while former Celtic winger McGeady is nursing a bruised knee. Arter has been the driving force behind Bournemouth's quest for promotion to the Premier League . But there was no place for Aston Villa's Jack Grealish, who is yet to make up his mind over whether to opt for Ireland or England, a process which has been ongoing for some time to the particular frustration of O'Neill's assistant and former Villa number two Roy Keane. The Poland game could prove crucial to the Republic's hopes of making it to the finals in the wake of November's 1-0 Group D defeat in Scotland. O'Neill's men opened their campaign with victories in Georgia and at home to Gibraltar, and a 1-1 draw in Germany in October boosted their hopes of claiming second spot with the reigning world champions expected to recover from a less-than-impressive start by their lofty standards. However Poland, who were expected to rival the Irish and the Scots for the runners-up spot, currently enjoy a three-point lead over Germany, Scotland and Ireland at the top of the table having beaten the Germans 2-0 in Warsaw during October, only to be held to a 2-2 draw by Gordon Strachan's men three days later. O'Neill said: 'Poland are a very strong team, they've obviously got off to a great start. Confidence is obviously very high there. They look up to the task. It will be a tough game for us.'","Harry Arter has been in fine form for Championship side Bournemouth .

"Holland scored in stoppage time through a deflected Wesley Sneijder shot to secure a 1-1 draw with Turkey on Saturday and avoid their first ever home defeat in European Championship qualifying.

Burak Yilmaz (left) fired Turkey into the lead in the 37th minute in their game against Holland . The Netherlands stayed third in the standings with seven points from five games. Turkey have five points at the halfway point of the qualifying campaign. The home team had several chances in the first half with captain Sneijder, deputising for the injured Robin van Persie, going closest but their best came after the break when substitute Luciano Narsingh missed an open goal. Sneijder shot narrowly wide with a free kick and full back Jetro Willems went close with a rasping shot 10 minutes from time. The introduction of tall forward Bas Dost forced the Dutch to throw everything forward in a final assault and the equaliser came when Sneijder's shot struck Huntelaar on the back of the head and deflected into goal. 'From the first minute we went for victory,' Sneijder told Dutch television. 'Turkey had one chance in front of goal. We dominated and made chances but we took until injury time to get the equaliser. We did not impose ourselves enough in the first half but we were more attacking in the second and something had to fall for us in the end.' Avoiding defeat will not lift the pressure on coach Guus Hiddink, who received a public vote of confidence from the Dutch football association after defeat in Iceland in October.

He is at Anfield as part of his commercial work with Subway Restaurants, who are one of Liverpool's business partners. Brazil legend Pele will be a guest at Anfield to watch Liverpool take on Manchester United on Sunday . Pele played in Liverpool, across the park at Goodison, for Brazil in 1966, but he limped off injured . It is not Pele's first visit to the city, the Brazil legend having appeared as a player for Brazil at Everton's ground Goodison Park in 1966 during the World Cup finals. However, he does not have too many happy memories of Liverpool, having been forced to limp out of the tournament after being given rough treatment by Bulgaria and Portugal. The two sides are both in the hunt for a Champions League spot, and both come into the game in good form, with Liverpool's last league defeat coming at the hands of United back in December. Juan Mata scored the final goal when the teams last met in December, making it 3-0 to United . David de Gea was in fine form for the clash of the two giants, denying Mario Balotelli on several ocassions . Balotelli has since fallen out of favour at Anfield, and is unlikely to start against United on Sunday .","Brazilian legend will be a guest at Anfield for crunch clash .

"A video maker from Peterborough captured some incredibly eerie footage of a disused RAF station in Upwood. Daniel Munns, a Lincoln University graduate, travelled to the Cambridgeshire station with a Phantom 2 DJI drone and a GoPro camera. He was drawn to the location because he was bored of filming the fields around where he lives and after purchasing a drone believed the station would be an interesting place in which to capture some unique footage. Helped by his friend Sean Young, who drove the pair to the location, Daniel squeezed through a hole in a fence and spent an hour filming and an additional nine hours editing once home. Looking back on the project, Daniel, who was merely testing out his new equipment on the day, admitted he was ecstatic with the final product. He said: ‘It had been a bit trial and error at first as I don’t have a monitor for the drone so I was flying blind. ‘I was just holding certain shots and hoping they would come out okay. When I got back and saw the outcome though I was buzzing. Daniel was drawn to the location because he was bored of filming the fields around where he lives in Peteborough . After squeezing through a fence, Daniel captured some truly atmospheric footage of the abandoned RAF base . 'I knew for sure that the drone had been a good purchase.’ The video itself is both chilling and mesmerising and captures the abandonment of the place in all its eerie glory. Opening on a shot of tall trees, the footage fades into a birds-eye view of the abandoned RAF station. Unsettling music accompanies the clip throughout as the drone moves slowly around the area capturing it entirely. Footage of the buildings up-close show the extent of the deterioration that has taken place since the base was closed . Daniel was only testing his GoPro camera and drone but was ecstatic with the final outcome nevertheless . Royal Air Force Station Upwood is a former  non-flying station. It was under the control of the United States Air Force from 1981, and one of three RAF stations in Cambridgeshire used by the United States Air Forces in Europe. In 1994 the station was closed by the Ministry of Defence and most of it was vacated with the land and buildings being sold off to civil ownership. Daniel explained that the size of the abandoned place was overwhelming and that this helped influence his decision to depict it in a spooky way. He said: ‘It was eerie being in there so it only felt right to edit it in the way that I did.’ The drone then stalks a man (Daniel’s friend Sean) walking through the isolated landscape before ascending over his head. The footage then fades into arguably the best shot of the piece – a vantage point that captures the sun breaking through miserable clouds, and the trees appearing as silhouettes. Featured in the film is Daniel's friend Sean, whose presence adds another spooky element to the piece . Daniel captures a great shot of the sun breaking through the miserable clouds and the building's dark and empty windows . Also featured in the shot is the building’s darkened, empty windows as well as a row of them in the distance that appear to look like a series of letters. Faster footage of the buildings follow and a close-up shot of one of the entrances show the depreciation that has taken place. Sean again features – standing in one of the windows – giving the piece another strange and spooky element. Daniel admitted however that his intention had been to use someone dressed in military uniform so as to provide an even ghostlier edge, but stated that he does intend to do a follow up piece at a later date. Daniel took a total of nine hours to edit the footage of the station after filming it for an hour with a drone . ‘I felt I could have done a lot better if I had planned it,’ he said. ‘But for test footage I was chuffed to bits with it.’ Daniel studied Media Production at university, with a focus on film and TV, script writing and film production. He has recently started a media company called ShotSightMedia, where he uploads videos of his work.

"An Indonesian town was high on more than just life when police set fire to more than three tons of confiscated cannabis. Residents of Tangerang, 15.5 miles west of the capital Jakarta, reported suffering from headaches and dizziness after inhaling the tangy smoke given off by the bonfire. The 3.3 tons of marijuana were burned by Palmerah police at their subprecinct office in West Jakarta earlier this month. Indonesian police accidentally intoxicated the population of the entire town of Tangerang, 15.5 miles west of Jakarta, by holding a bonfire of 3.3 tons of confiscated marijuana outside a subprecinct office . The haul was valued at $1 million, according to Breitbart.com . Tangerang police chief Senior Commander Riad told The Jakarta Post his officers seized the stash in south Tangerang on February 2. Police wore masks to protect them from the fumes but watching civilians were left unprotected. The smoke spread from the yard to surrounding residents' houses. One resident named Deden said: 'I got a headache because I wasn't wearing a mask.' A journalist reported having to 'sit down and have a cup of tea' to deal with the high. Officers also destroyed 1.8 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine and 2,538 ecstasy pills by blending them. The destruction of the illicit substances was witnessed by several officials from the West Jakarta municipality. A police officer throws packages of cannabis onto a fire  in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, in August last year. That blaze destroyed two tons of the drug while the latest one in Tangareng burned 3.3 .","Residents of Tangerang suffered headaches and dizziness from the bonfire .

"Middlesbrough are confident of beating promotion rivals Derby and Norwich to the signature of Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes. The 25-year-old is the nephew of Boro assistant Steve Agnew and that is thought to have played a part in the Scotland international favouring a move to Teesside. Rhodes is set to join on loan before the weekend with a £8million permanent deal arranged for the summer, should he help Boro win promotion to the Premier League. Further clauses have been inserted should Aitor Karanka’s side then stay in the top flight. Jordan Rhodes (centre left) is set to complete a loan move to promotion-chasing Middlesbrough . The striker has an incredible goal-scoring record in the Sky Bet Championship and is an impressive coup . The Riverside club are concerned that their challenge is beginning to falter and see Rhodes – who has 13 goals for Blackburn this season and was a £12million target of Hull last year – as the addition needed to bolster their claims for a top-flight return. Karanka’s men are one of four teams at the top tied on 66 points but sit at the bottom of that pack because of goal difference. They have lost three of their last five with the club’s strikers coming in for criticism during that run. Should the Rhodes deal go through then he could be in the squad for Saturday’s lunchtime visit of Ipswich Town. Aitor Karanka has a formidable strike force as they look to continue their march for automatic promotion .","Jordan Rhodes is set to complete loan move to the Middlesbrough .

"Depraved militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq are attaching high-definition cameras to the barrels of their guns in order to film barbaric executions in gruesome detail. The shocking pictures were captured by the terror group's Tigris River branch, who are currently engaged in fierce battles with up to 30,000 Iraqi Army soldiers and Shia militia roughly 70 miles north of the ISIS-held city of Tikrit. Still images from the video shows a group of blindfolded prisoners being forced to their knees while heavily armed militants line up behind them. The photographs then cut to the gun barrel cameras, which display in graphic detail the young men being shot to death from point blank range. The unorthodox camera view and the use of HD equipment give the footage the appearance of a computer game and is just the latest example of ISIS attempting to portray their atrocities in a manner that could appeal to young men and women living in the West. Savages: Depraved militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq are attaching high-definition cameras to the barrels of their guns in order to film barbaric executions in gruesome detail . Killers: It is understood that the group behind the savage murder represent ISIS' presence along the River Tibris. They have attached HD cameras  (circled) to their guns to film the atrocity . The unorthodox camera view and the use of HD equipment give the pictures the appearance of a video game . The horrific images have been shared online by Arab-language supporters of the brutal terrorist group. They show a group of men being dragged before a baying crowd of local men, who gather along a roadside and use mobile phones to film the shocking scene. The victims - who wear Western-looking clothing and have their hands bound behind their backs - are forced to their knees by the bearded militants, who tower over them while wearing military fatigues. One jihadi stands behind each of the five victims, brandishing all manner of guns - from what appears to be small .9mm handguns to massive AK47 assault rifles. At least one of these larger weapons has an HD camera attached and captures in gruesome detail the horrific moment a bullet hits one of the prisoner's head, causing blood and brains to spray into the air. The next image is a close-up shot of the five victims lying in a pool of their own blood while bloodthirsty onlookers stand and cheer, raising their fingers in the air in a symbol of religious devotion. Death: The victims - who wear Western-looking clothing and have their hands bound behind their backs - are forced to their knees by the bearded militants, who tower over them while wearing military fatigues . Professional: The photographs  carry the distinctive yellow branding of ISIS' propaganda wings, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video . It is understood that the group behind the savage murder represent ISIS' presence along the River Tibris, which flows from southern Iraq into Turkey, passing through regime held cities such as Baghdad, as well as the militant stronghold Mosul and current frontline city Tikrit. It was not immediately clear where the images were taken, but this particularly ISIS group typically operate in and around the remote villages off Iraq's Highway 1, such Azwya and Al-Shirqat. The photographs are high quality shots and carry the distinctive yellow branding of ISIS' propaganda wings, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video. The victims are believed to be a group of local men accused of attempting to organise an anti-ISIS resistance group, although this information has not been independently verified.

An Iraqi Army soldier raises his finger in the air in a sign of religious devotion before attacking an ISIS target . The shocking use of cameras attached to gun barrels is just ISIS' latest attempt to portray life under the terror group as similar to a video game. The approach is believed to make an effort to make their atrocities more palatable and possibly even appealing to a generation of Westerners raised on graphic shoot 'em ups that portray human life as cheap, and even reward and encourage users to commit cold-blooded murder. This morning Islamic State group militants in the north of Iraq set oil wells ablaze in an attempt to foil government forces battling to reclaim territory. A bomb ripped through an outdoor market in the Baghdad suburb of Nahrawan, killing three civilians and wounding 12, a police officer said. Another bomb targeted a military patrol in the northeastern district of Rashdiya, killing three soldiers and wounding seven, he added. Mortar shells hit a residential area in the southern district of Dora, killing two civilians and wounding six, another officer said. An explosion in a market in Mahmoudiyah, 20 miles south of Baghdad, killed three civilians and wounded seven. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man  to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay. Stomach-churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group's de facto capital Raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim. With the baying crowd clambering on to rooftops to get a better view of the savage scene, the blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death.

"Michael O'Neill is preparing to do battle with a familiar face on Sunday, as an old friend attempts to derail Northern Ireland's Euro 2016 dream. Finland are the opponents at Windsor Park, led by Mixu Paatelainen - the man who gave O'Neill his coaching break as his number two at Cowdenbeath. The pair have already crossed paths on the international circuit, sharing an entertaining 3-3 friendly draw in 2012, during O'Neill's early days at the helm. Michael O'Neill is preparing his Northern Ireland side to do battle with Finland in Euro 2016 qualifying . He will be up against former assistant manager Mixu Paatelainen (pictured) who is current Finland boss . There is a whole lot more riding on the follow-up, with Northern Ireland having taken nine points from a possible 12 in Group F, while their opponents face a fight to stay in contention with just four points from their four fixtures. O'Neill admits he and Paatelainen have declined to swap advice about other teams on the road to France, but accepts the two men know each other's style 'inside out'. 'We're similar to players, I think. When you've played at a club with someone and then you've worked briefly with them as a coach there's obviously a relationship there. 'But we didn't spend hours on the phone or anything up to that, so the relationship hasn't changed at all. Obviously we are less inclined to discuss the opposition because he probably thinks he doesn't want to tell me things I perhaps don't know and vice versa. But we both know each other inside out and how our team will play. 'Regardless of what happens it won't affect how close we are.' O'Neill even sees a parallel between the two national sides, with both he and Paatelainen attempting to eke the best out of a small number of top-tier players, while building a strong group in support. 'I think Mixu has done a great job there and his job is quite similar to mine,' he said. 'You have a limited pool of players to choose from and he has got them playing in a nice style. 'There's no doubt Finland are a good team but there is a dependence there on five or six players and the team's make-up is quite similar to mine.'

He has had a change of scenery since then, leaving Norwich for a loan spell with Turkish side Rizespor. Part of his motivation for that unexpected move was a desire to get regular game time at centre forward, with the Canaries having used him predominantly in a withdrawn role. Davis, a former Rangers team-mate of Lafferty, explained: 'He just wants to go out and get regular football, and a chance to play up front. 'He's had a few experiences in other countries so I think at the time he knew it was the time to move on. He had Northern Ireland in the back of his mind, he wanted to improve his football for international level too. 'He's always going to give you 100% commitment and effort, give you everything but it's about getting him focused.

"It is a common problem for airlines, ferries and cruise ships - how do you make passengers pay attention to the safety briefing? Condor Ferries believes it has found the solution, producing a video complete with a rapping captain and dancing staff that certainly attracts attention. Doing away with the monotone yet informative messages usually portrayed in safety briefings, the Portsmouth-based company said it wanted to inject some 'fun' into this year's offering. But not everybody is a fan, with some commentators saying they would prefer to jump overboard than listen to the song. The captain introduces the rap for a very different safety demonstration . Condor Ferries have produced the safety rap as part of their 'Good Times' branding . Slightly out of sync and with some incredibly cringeworthy dance moves, the video seems to have done the trick and has already been viewed nearly 20,000 times since it was posted on YouTube several days ago. The video begins with a captain sporting blue sunglasses and some questionable moves as he announces: 'To ensure you have good times on board, please listen up to the following safety message from Condor Ferries.' It's soon time for the crew to get involved as they raise their hands in the air singing, 'life jackets, life jackets, they're right beneath your seat.' The pair then instruct those watching how to operate the life jacket. 'It clips together so easily just listen for the click,' sings the female. 'That means you've done it properly and you look so very hip.' That may be a matter of opinion. The steward raps how to fix the life jacket on and blow the whistle, all out of sync . All you have to do is just 'listen for the click' says the stewardess, and that means you've done it right . The male then takes the lead when notifying of where the emergency exits are, complete with some cringeworthy dance moves that involve bouncing on the spot and hilarious hand signals. But it only gets worse. It's back to the captain, as he comes into shot singing 'now ladies, hey ladies,' while making what can only be described as an 'uncomfortable' facial expression. However, rather than flirting, he is simply advising that 'sharp objects can't go on our slides, so leave those heels behind.' The steward then bounces on the spot and uses amusing hand gestures to warn of the emergency exits . The emergency slide is then shown, at least in graphic form, as the stewardess demonstrates how, well, to slide down it. The video then uses graphics to show how the staff can help passengers from wheeling their luggage, to using a resuscitator and defibrillator, as 'you name it, we have it.' The star of the show then comes back, the captain, as he sings: 'So who would have thought that the Condor could bust out such good rhymes?' The video is being broadcast  on all sailings between Poole and the Channel Islands. He's back! The captain then makes a somewhat unnerving re-appearance as he warns ladies not use heels down the emergency slides . The idea was conceived and produced by Bournemouth-based Walker Agency, working closely with the Condor Ferries safety, marine operations and marketing teams. Alicia Andrews, executive director – commercial at Condor Ferries, said: 'We're really proud of the new safety video, it's been a very fun project to work on, and we're delighted with the results. 'Our brief was simple, we wanted something a little bit different, something that our passengers would sit up and take notice of, and which would appeal to all members of the family. We think that the rap, with the Good Times messaging does just that. The stewardess demonstrates how passengers would use the emergency slide... not too difficult . 'Ferry travel is very family-friendly, there are no restrictions on the amount of luggage you can bring – you can pack everything in to your car, and off you go. 'We hope that our passengers, whether they are frequent travellers or joining us for the first time this summer will enjoy the video and their Good Times experience onboard Condor Liberation as we set sail to Jersey and Guernsey.' However the video has been met with less-than positive comments by users on YouTube, where it has been hosted. The staff are there to help with passengers' every need, according to the safety video . Liam Gilheany wrote: 'I want to pour lava into my ears,' while James Lund added: 'I'd want to jump into the harbour if this is for real.' Nathan Thomas is somewhat dubious as to the authenticity of the captain writing: 'I hope they keep a look out for fishing boats better - now they seem to have employed a stripper as a captain.' Condor are believed to be the first ferry operator to produce an onboard safety video to feature a rap. The release has coincided with the launch of its brand new state-of-the-art Condor Liberation with a new mission statement of 'Good Times.'

"Manny Pacquiao has claimed his predicted defeat of Floyd Mayweather in the pair’s $300million mega-fight on May 2 would be a boost for their sport. ‘Beating Floyd is good for boxing,’ the Filipino superstar said, referring to Mayweather’s long-running dominance and money-flaunting lifestyle. ‘When athletes have great success, their success goes to their head. That is bad for boxing.’ Manny Pacquiao on the PR trail with Stephen A. Smith from ESPN First Take, on which he continued to issue some fighting words to Floyd Mayweather ahead of their May 2 mega-fight . Manny Pacquiao, here during his training camp in Los Angeles, says he will 'easily' beat Floyd Mayweather . After dishing out some fighting words on Tuesday, Pacquiao works the heavy bag at Wild Card Boxing Club . Pacquiao, a resounding underdog for the May 2 showdown at Las Vegas’s MGM Grand, has come out fighting long before the bell saying Mayweather’s fights put him to sleep and urging the master tactician to fight aggressively. The 36-year-old’s confident jibes come even before the pair face-off in Los Angeles for their only joint press conference in the lead-up to the fight. ‘I'm here to prove that I can easily beat the undefeated,’ Pacquiao said on ESPN in comments shared by his minders on Twitter. Pacquiao and Mayweather come face-to-face on Wednesday night in their only pre-fight press conference . ‘I am very happy that Floyd Mayweather and I can give the fans the fight they have wanted for so many years.’ Pacquiao, boxing’s only eight-division world champion, added his nimble feet and combinations will give him the edge over the American with an imposing 47-0 record, and that his bouts against Miguel Cotto and Oscar De La Hoya instilled more fear in him. ‘My footwork and hand combinations will be my advantage,’ he said. ‘I tell you Cotto and Margarito punch hard. This is boxing and its about punches.’","Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather meet in Las Vegas on May 2 .

"Staff had to be on their guard at Gold Coast Airport in Australia this morning when a snake came within inches of getting onto a plane. As passengers began to settle into their seats aboard the Virgin flight to Sydney, a green snake slithered its way up the stairs to the entry door. Eagle-eyed passenger Stuart Robert, who rather fittingly works as the Assistant Minister for Defence, was on hand to capture the action unfold. The snake was halted just inches from entering the main body of the plane by airport staff . The snake's actions were caught on camera by Australia's Assistant Defence Minister Stuart Robert (file photo) 'The green snake had slithered up the front stairs so the passengers had to board from the back,' he told MailOnline Travel. 'It was probably enjoying the warmth of the tarmac and steel and may have made its way up there as people were boarding. 'I took the photo just as the staff had got the little guy into a bag, so it wasn't quite 'Snakes on a Plane' and we didn't have an extra passenger to Sydney.' MP Robert was full of praise for the way the drama was handled by staff at Gold Coast Airport. Delays were minimal at Gold Coast Airport today after a snake was halted entering a plane on the tarmac . 'The airport staff acted quickly and brought a bag with a rod to gather up the little guy and probably take him back to where he came from. 'They responded well and the delay was minor.' It is not known as to what kind of snake it was. Staff were expected to return the reptile back to its natural habitat.","Snake believed to have slithered its way between passengers .

"Floyd Mayweather's superfight against Manny Pacquiao on May 2 is to be conducted under the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) testing program. The welterweight rivals have agreed that their Las Vegas showdown will observe the rules established under the World Anti-Doping Code (Code), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List and the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing. Both fighters have agreed to unannounced blood and urine testing without reservation and will be tested out of competition prior to the fight and in competition after the fight. Floyd Mayweather Jnr posted pictures to his social media ahead of mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao on May 2 . Some of the banned substances that will be tested for at the WADA-accredited laboratory are growth hormone (HGH), erythropoietin (EPO) and the use of carbon isotope ratio (CIR). 'It's a strong statement of the importance of clean and safe competition to have these two fighters voluntarily agree to have a WADA level anti-doping program implemented for this fight,' said USADA chief executive Travis Tygart. 'We commend them for their stance on clean sport and the message it sends to all those who want to compete clean at the highest levels of all sport.' Mayweather vs Pacquiao is widely considered to be one of the biggest boxing fights of all-time . Mayweather and Pacquiao are set to earn hundreds of millions from the blockbuster fight . Plans for the pair to clash five years ago when at the peak of their powers were abandoned after Pacquiao refused to participate in blood testing at Mayweather's insistence. The two went head to head for the first and only time prior to their collision at the MGM Grand at a press conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday. No publicity tour has been scheduled and they will not meet again until fight week. The showdown is set to be the richest in boxing history, with an estimated shared purse of 250,000,000 US dollars (£167.4million). Mayweather, 38, is coming to the end of a brilliant, and as yet unbeaten, professional boxing career .","Floyd Mayweather's comes up against Manny Pacquiao on May 2 .

"The wonderful Estadio Do Dragao has two huge gaps between the seats and the roof behind each goal. Porto have learned that it is useless to try and keep prying eyes out. Every summer, as the transfer window opens, the dragon's lair is raided. Giants from all over Europe come ashore at this Atlantic port with their treasure chests of booty, eager to snatch the latest talent off the conveyor belt. Jackson Martinez produced an outrageous back heel flick to set up Cristian Tello's first for Porto . The Colombian's audacious assist set Porto on course for a comfortable 3-0 win over Sporting Lisbon . The result closes the gap between Porto and current leaders Benfica to just four points . Cristian Tello, celebrates the first goal of his hat-trick to fire Porto to a 3-0 victory over rivals Sporting Lisbon . PORTO (4-3-3): Fabiano; Danilo (Indi 84), Maicon, Marcano, Sandro; Casemiro, Goebel (Neves 71), Herrera; Brahimi Quaresma 57), Martinez, Tello . Subs not used: Hernani , Quintero, Helton, Paciencia .

Subs not used: Boeck, Tanaka, Rosell, Lopes . Booked: Silva, Soares, Nani . Last year it was Manchester City, who prised away the prized assets of Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando. Before that, Zenit St Petersburg swiped Hulk. Atletico Madrid made off with James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao. The list goes on. Left to pick up the pieces this season has been Julen Lopetegui Argote, a man who has coached Spain's Under 19s, 20s and 21s. It has not been easy. While a 1-1 draw at Basel put them in the box seat for the last eight of the Champions League, before kick-off here on a rainy, foggy night, the hated Benfica were almost out of sight in Primeira Liga. Seven points clear, anything other than victory over their third-placed Lisbon rivals Sporting would put Porto's domestic season in danger of ending in March. Not that Argote is criticised. A perceived establishment bias towards Benfica is bemoaned, with talk of a season blighted by refereeing injustices. Adrien Silva of Sporting Lisbon aims to bypass the challenge of Porto's Jackson Martinez on Sunday night . Tello, on loan from Barcelona, completed his hat-trick in the second-half to keep Porto close to Benfica . Inevitably, it was a man widely thought to be the next out of the door who unlocked Sporting's defence. There seemed to be little danger in a tight contest when the ball bounced towards Arsenal and Manchester United target Jackson Martinez just inside the opposition half on 31 minutes. The 28-year-old, with his back to goal, calmly chested it down before volleying an audacious backheel over his shoulder and over the retreating green and white wall. Barcelona loanee Cristian Tello was perhaps the only person in the stadium who saw it coming. He raced through a static defence, latched onto the flick and cooly slotted past Rui Patricio to ease the tension amid the crowd of 43,111. Porto's Algerian forward Yacine Brahimi (right) takes on Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho . United may be wary of Colombian strikers approaching 30, but in an instant Martinez displayed a vision rarely seen at Old Trafford this season. After the break the pair of them were at it again, although this time it was more orthodox. Martinez's sidefooted through ball found his teammate in space and Tello, ousted by Neymar at the Nou Camp, finished emphatically into the roof of Patricio's net. On 83 minutes Tello had his hat-trick. This time Mexican Hector Herrera provided the assist as he beat the offside trap once more before another sidefoot past Patricio's outstretched arms. Manchester United loanne Nani is booked for Sporting Lisbon during the 3-0 defeat to Porto on Sunday . Tello is approaching the halfway mark of a two-year loan deal. Many more performances like this and he may well have scouts returning down the well-trodden path to Porto. The home side, however, are not the only ones susceptible to Europe's cash-rich big guns. At Porto's wonderful year-old museum (complete with statues of Bobby Robson, Mourinho and Andre Villas-Boas) visitors are informed that it took 12,000 tons of iron and 90,200 cubic metres of concrete to build Estadio Do Dragao. They may have used something similar to put together Sporting's man-mountain William Carvalho. The 22-year-old defensive midfielder is also said to be wanted by United and Arsenal but here he was often outshone by the crafty Yacine Brahimi. The Algerian international, replaced by ex-Chelsea flatterer to deceive Ricardo Quaresma, is rumoured to have interested City and on the evidence of this display Manuel Pellegrini may soon be back here. Porto's Cristian Tello (right) celebrates his goal against Sporting with his teammate Ruben Neves . For the visitors, United outcast Nani will have been relishing the opportunity to give a UK audience watching on ESPN a reminder of his talents. He scored a 35-yard volley last weekend which he celebrated with tears. There was more sadness here. Isolated on the left he did little to show why Louis van Gaal should change his opinion on a night when others jostled for places at the checkout of Europe's supermarket. Porto's noisy fans unfurled a giant banner before the game depicting one of their supporters elbowing a Benfica fan out of the way underneath the European Cup while a pot-bellied Sporting follower looked on uninterested. They clearly take solace in the fact they are the only Portuguese side left in the Champions League but after this routine victory they should not give up hope on domestic glory.

"Missing: The painting was stolen by the Gestapo from Julius Priester's Vienna home in 1944 . A multi-million pound masterpiece by 16th century artist El Greco has been reunited with its rightful owners more than seven decades after it was stolen by the Nazis. El Greco's 'A Portrait of a Gentleman' had been missing ever since the Gestapo raided the collection of Jewish banker Julius Priester in 1944. Mr Priester, a prominent art collector, had fled to Paris with his wife Camilla six years before, when Austria was annexed into Germany as part of the Anschluss in 1938. The couple, who moved to Mexico City two years later, never gave up hope of finding the 50 precious works which had been stolen. When the war ended in 1945, Mr Priester set about trying to recover his collection - a hunt his heirs took up on his death in 1954. That determination to trace it has been rewarded after a 70 year search, when it was discovered on sale through a London art dealer last year. Although the value of the painting's value is unknown, the world record price for an El Greco is £9.2million. But it seems the emotional reward may have been even greater. When they were finally reunited with the oil painting, Mr Priester's heirs were thrilled to see it was still in the same frame it had when it was hanging above the dresser in the couple's Vienna dining room. Anne Webber, co-chair of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, which helped reunite the Priesters with the painting, revealed they were 'absolutely delighted' to get it back. 'It was very moving when they saw it for the first time - it was still in the same frame it was in when it hung in Mr Priester's apartment,' she said. 'It has taken more than 70 years to reunite the painting with its rightful owners and we are delighted for the family.' Mr Priester's art collection, comprising of pieces by celebrated artists including Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony Van Dyke, was just one of many plundered from wealthy Jews on direct orders from Hitler. When the Nazis were defeated in 1945, Mr Priester set about trying to track down the whereabouts of his stolen art. He spent the best part of a decade searching for the art, working with the Austrian authorities to spread the word around the world. Reunited: The painting, which hung in the dining room, pictured, is still in its original frame . In 1953, the Austrian Federal Police wrote to Mr Priester to say his missing El Greco painting had been sold by the Gestapo to New York art brokers Knoedler, arriving in the city in 1952. However the dealer Frederick Mont refused to comply, denying all knowledge of the painting and thereby halting the investigation. Domenikos Theotokopoulos, better known as 'El Greco', was born in 1541 in Crete, into a wealthy family. He began his career as an 'icon painter', and by 1563, he was described as a 'master'. About four years later, he moved to Venice where he developed his intense, colourful mannerist style. He remained in the city until about 1570, before moving to Rome - the heart of the art world at the time. Here he studied the works of Michealangelo and Raphael, and continued to develop his own style. But it was during his time in Toledo, in Spain, where he moved in 1577, when he would produce his best works - even being commissioned by King Philip II. El Greco died in April 1614, but his genius was not recognised until the 20th century, when his work began to be noticed by the art world. Nowadays, an El Greco painting can sell for millions . But Ms Webber revealed: 'It turns out Knoedler had the painting for more than 30 years and showed it worldwide with a false provenance. 'It spent 13 years in London before going to a Swiss private collector in 2003.' When Mr Priester died in 1954 aged 84, his family picked up the search and continued investigations into the missing artwork. In 2005 the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, a non-profit organisation which helps track down stolen art, were called into help with the search. A breakthrough came last year when the commission discovered the El Greco listed for sale in a gallery in New York via a London art dealer - and a claim was immediately put in for it. 'The dealer acted admirably as soon as he realised the painting's true history and we were able to negotiate a deal to return the painting to Mr Priester's heirs, who now live in Britain,' said Ms Webber. Christopher A. Marinello, CEO of Art Recovery International, which represented the art dealer the painting was acquired from, added: 'This case proves that equitable restitution of looted works is attainable. 'Without the strength and precision of the historic claim on one side and the compliance and co-operation of the gallery on the other, this would never have been possible.' Julius Priester was a banker and president of Austrian petrol firm Petroleumgesellschaft Galizin. He began collecting art in the 1920s, building up a notable gallery. The Commission for Looted Art in Europe, a non-profit organisation, has helped return more than 3,500 pieces of stolen artwork to their rightful owners since it launched in 1999.","El Greco's 'Portrait of a Gentleman' seized by Gestapo from Vienna in 1944 .

"Oklahoma University alumni are rallying around an African American chef who has been forced out of his job at the school's disgraced fraternity after footage emerged of members performing a racist chant. Howard has worked at Sigma Alpha Epsilon for more than 15 years, cooking raved-about chili dogs and cheering students with his 'infectious smile', former members say. But on Monday, his role was terminated after the university closed SAE with immediate effect. It was a reaction to a video of fraternity brothers chanting 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Support: Howard has worked as a chef at Oklahoma University's Sigma Alpha Epsilon for more than 15 years but is now unemployed because the house was shut down after members were filmed singing a racist chant . Calling for support for Howard and his family as he looks for a new job, one former SAE member created an Indiegogo fundraiser page, and wrote: 'He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids... Because of these kids' actions, many will be affected. None more so than Howard.' Howard, he writes, 'was always there to chat with you' but now 'he is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade.' Within roughly 12 hours, the fund had amassed $5,000. And it is not the only one. 'Infectious smile': Howard befriended all students he came into contact with, alumni say as they raise money . 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was performed by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma on Saturday. The society has since been shut down . Simultaneously another former SAE brother set up a GoFundMe page slamming 'the disgusting chant' and lauding Howard as 'hard-working and loyal'. That page has at least $3,000. A Twitter user who shared a link to the fundraising page wrote: 'I went to an OU SAE tailgate one time, (had a great time) an i met that man howard, he grills a mean burger.' All members of the fraternity have until midnight on Monday to leave the premises, University of Oklahoma President David Boren announced at a press conference amid a chorus of furious reaction to the footage.

"Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel has urged his former club to sign PSG talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the summer. The well travelled Sweden international has been linked with a move to Old Trafford in the past and could be tempted to leave Ligue 1 should the big spending Parisians not qualify for the Champions League next season.

He gives so much credibility and visibility to PSG .. This is someone who takes his responsibilities. 'Last summer there were rumours that he would come to Manchester United. I then said that Zlatan was built for the club, he was born to play there. 'It's why Cantona was so strong when he was there, not at Leeds or in all other clubs in France? Why? Because it is Manchester United. In Manchester, there was the freedom given to the players, but also responsibilities. The PSG striker could leave France should the reigning champions fail to qualify for the Champions League . Former keeper Schmeichel won five Premier League titles and the Champions League at Old Trafford . 'We do not care who you are or what you love, we look at what you're doing on the pitch and the influence you have in the club. If you do not respect that, you're leaving. 'But you can have any personality. Beckham, Cantona, they could go out and also be at their best. There are hundreds of players who are trying to be a Beckham or Cantona, but do not have the personality, and they fail.'

He added that the cathedral is printing a full set of all three main service booklets, including March 22 when the king's coffin first arrived in Leicester, for just £12.50. The Dean added that some of that money goes directly to the cathedral, which is still raising the £2.5million it needs to pay for hosting the historic week of events and overhauling the old building. 'We've noticed that service booklets from the cathedral's services are being sold for extortionate prices on eBay, presumably by those who attended the services,' he said. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch is pictured holding the Service of Reinterment booklet at the Richard III reburial ceremony last Thursday. Dozens of the order of service have now appeared on eBay for more than £200 . Several sellers have bundled the reburial order of service in with official memorabilia from March 22, when the coffin arrived in Leicester, and from March 27 when the new tomb for his body was revealed to the public . 'This is very sad - many would have welcomed being there and keeping this as a souvenir. 'We have had extra copies printed and we are selling a set of all three for £12.50 to cover costs from Christian Resources in St Martin's House, next door to the cathedral.' Cathedral bosses have been at great pains to ensure last week's reburial of the last Plantagenet king was a solemn occasion of 'dignity and honour'. There are currently numerous listings of the order of service from the reburial, which is titled: 'Service of Reinterment of the remains of King Richard III by the grace of God King of England and France and Lord of Ireland', for sale on eBay. Others have already sold for more than £250, with one selling today – which featured all three order of service books - for a whopping £255 plus £5.72 postage. Another sold for £199 plus £2.80 postage on Saturday, with another fetching £200 plus £2.99 postage yesterday. Actors Robert Lindsay and Benedict Cumberbatch could be seen holding the order of service as they chatted ahead of the reburial at Leicester Cathedral last Thursday. Cumberbatch later read a poem to the ceremony . The Dean of Leicester, the Very Reverend David Monteith, said it was 'sad' that people were trying to cash in on the extraordinary event and said the church was selling all three order of service booklets for just £12.50 .

A third order of service was published for the revelation of the completed tomb of  Richard III at the cathedral . The majority of sellers who have listed the items claim to be based in Leicestershire, suggesting they obtained the order of service at the ceremony before trying to make a quick profit online. The church said other sellers had visited the cathedral in recent days to buy the souvenir pack before listing them for sale on eBay. The auction site said it allowed the sale of artefacts, provided the terms and conditions it sets out were followed. A spokesman said: 'We provide guidance to eBay sellers in our help section to make sure that any artefacts they may try to sell comply with the guidelines issued by the authorities, and are always ready and willing to investigate any listings causing concern. 'We work with experts and will remove items from sale based on their advice.'","Order of service booklets from Richard III reburial are being sold on eBay .

"Wales manager Chris Coleman has noticed no difference in Gareth Bale's mood ahead of his side's huge Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel and believes the Real Madrid superstar is ready to perform. Bale has had to endure a rough ride in Spain of late, with his worth to Real being questioned by both fans and the powerful Madrid media. The world's most expensive player has been booed by his own supporters and had his car attacked outside the club's training ground following last weekend's Clasico defeat to bitter rivals Barcelona. Wales captain Ashley Williams (left) shares a joke with Gareth Bale (right) in training on Friday . But Coleman insists Bale remains relaxed around the Wales camp and the thought of him having a conversation with the forward about his club situation has not even entered his head. 'I cannot see any difference in Baley at all,' Coleman said on the eve of Group B's top two sides meeting in Haifa on Saturday night. 'If I thought it was bothering him, and we're all human beings so I know it can bother you from time to time and you can get a bit down, and it was a problem then I would have sat down with him and had that conversation. Wales boss Chris Coleman is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in Haifa on Saturday . Real Madrid star Gareth Bale , who has received harsh criticism in recent weeks, appears relaxed in training . 'But we have not mentioned Real Madrid, we have only talked about Wales, Israel and the job in hand. 'He is happy, relaxed and more importantly he is fit and ready to play.' Bale has been singled out for some rough treatment in the group so far, most noticeably from Cyprus last October, and the 25-year-old could be a marked man again on a night where a hostile atmosphere is expected as group leaders Israel defend their unblemished record against second-placed Wales. Israel coach Eli Guttman insists his side do not have players 'strong enough to kick Bale out of the game' but Coleman remains philosophical about the treatment his star man could receive at the Sammy Ofer Stadium. Aaron Ramsey (left) and Bale (right) watch on as Wales defender James Collins holds possession . 'We cannot come back without anything,' Coleman said. 'That is not the stage we are at. We know what we are up against and they will know that about us. 'Their game against Belgium on Tuesday will not exist for them, they are only thinking about us and that is not our business. Bale holds off his team-mates in training as Wales hope to maintain their unbeaten start in Group B . 'It is up to Israel to do what they want to do,' Coleman said. 'Israel have to do what they have to do to get a result, as do we. But the attention is nothing new for Gareth. 'He has played most of his football in the Premier League and that is the most physically demanding league in the world. 'I've also watched him out in Spain come through the Madrid derbies and the Clasico and we know all the focus will be on him. 'But we have a good squad and our strength is our togetherness. 'We are not here because of one player. Gareth is a huge help, but he is part of something that has been growing.' The Real Madrid star stretches during a training session in Israel on Friday afternoon . Wales remain unbeaten after four games but are one point behind Israel, who play their match in hand at home to group favourites Belgium on Tuesday. Coleman has described the Haifa showdown as Wales' biggest match since the Euro 2004 play-off defeat to Russia, and admits that failing to make the finals in France in two years' time would hurt everyone connected with Welsh football. 'I was part of a couple of great Welsh sides that never did it, qualified for a major tournament,' Coleman said. 'I enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever. We have a good current group and we are going in the right direction but we have been here before. 'One foot in the door does not get you there. I do not want to play things down, we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about. 'But we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go and I'm not being arrogant when I say it's about us and not anyone else.'","Israel face Wales in Group B on Saturday in the Euro 2016 qualifiers .

"Swansea City right back Dwight Tiendalli has joined Middlesbrough on loan until the end of the season. The 29-year-old has only managed one Premier League start this season - a 5-0 defeat by Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium in January - and has fallen out of contention at the south Wales club.

"Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen has urged Harry Kane NOT to play for England Under 21's this summer. Kane is set for his first senior call-up later this month for the games against Lithuania and Italy. But the plan then is for Kane to drop down back into the Under 21's for this summer's European Championships in the Czech Republic. Harry Kane is likely to be included in England Under 21's European Championship squad in the summer . Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has already warned the FA he wants talks with the FA before giving them his blessing to call-up Kane this summer. And Vertonghen, who played in the tournament in 2007, says the 21-year-old, who has played 41 games already this season, should skip the tournament in preparation for next season. The Belgian said: 'It’s difficult for me to judge. Of course England want him. He is a brilliant striker and he can be the main man, but I think he needs his rest for next season. Jan Vertonghen (right) believes the striker should stay at home and instead prepare for next season . 'It’s his call and I know a player always wants to play but sometimes you have to be careful. It’s a difficult one because last season I played with injuries, but sometimes you just can’t. You have to think about what’s going to come. It’s his decision and it’s a totally different situation from when I played in 2007. Did that benefit my development as a player? It’s hard to tell. 'I enjoyed playing for my country because I never played international football at youth level. 'So that was my first tournament as a Belgium player and I enjoyed it. It was in Holland and I played in Holland for Ajax at the time, so for me it was brilliant.' Kane rounds Rob Green in the Queens Park Rangers goal to double Tottenham's lead on Saturday .

Indeed, from attending fashion shows, to modelling for magazines and even a rumoured romance with a Hollywood actress, Brooklyn has put his name firmly on the map. He was even gifted a pair of shoes by Kanye West on his big day, he posted a picture of a fresh pair of Yeezy Boosts on his Instagram account this morning saying: 'Thanks Kanye for the yeezys.' Of course, it can't hurt that David and Victoria are undoubtedly one of the most famous and best-loved couples in the world. And their much adored family unit, including Brooklyn's siblings, Romeo, 12, Cruz, 10 and Harper, three, has gone a long way to cementing their overall popularity. They have been taking Brooklyn out from a young age. As a little boy he was regularly spotted at his father's football matches or out and about with his mother. But it's only been in the last year or so that he's truly stepped out of his shell, even attending events on his own. On Instagram, the teen is incredibly popular, having only opened his account in November he already has 359,000 followers. Brooklyn has boosted his popularity by joining Instagram and posting pictures of his family . Brooklyn often posts photographs of himself posing for selfies to his Instagram account, much to the delight of his young fans . In August Brooklyn attended the If I Stay premiere in LA. At the time he was rumoured to be dating actress Chloe Moretz who stars in the film . He regularly posts selfies which amass thousands of likes and pictures of himself enjoying the jetset lifestyle including luxury holidays around the world. When in November he posted an image of himself with his designer mother at the wedding of Elton John and David Furnish it was picked up by websites around the world. But Brooklyn's transformation into the young man he is today first started as long ago as November 2013, when Victoria took him as her date to the Harper's Bazaar Women of the year awards. Since then he has become a regular on the red carpet. In February and September 2014 he hit the FROW at his mother's NYFW shows. Attending again in February this year along with his little brother's and sister. Brooklyn is a regular at his Mum's fashion shows, pictured her at her February show with his siblings Harper, being carried by Victoria, Cruz (front) and Romeo (left) Brooklyn always dote on his younger siblings, he was photographed carrying a sleepy Harper through the streets of New York following his Mum's fashion show  in February . In October he took part in his first ever solo photoshoot for New York Times Style Magazine, looking very much the spitting image of his famous father. Indeed much has been made of the likeness between Brooklyn and his father, especially after he bleached his hair blonde - as his Dad once had - in January. At the time he posted a picture of himself on Instagram, hilariously captioning it: 'Blonds have more fun.' His rumoured relationship with Chloe Moretz, 17- neither part have confirmed or denied that they were ever a couple - also helped to boost his profile. The pair were regularly spotted out and about together in 2014. Chloe has described Brooklyn as: 'A very good guy,' adding, 'I like hanging out with him. And in December he was photographed leaving red carpet event, ‘A Night With Nick,’ along with singer Talia Storm and blogger Tessie Hartmann. Brooklyn was supposed to join Arsenals training academy but unfortunately he failed to make the cut, it was announced that he had not managed to get a sponsorship in February . One of a handful of appearances  where neither his mother or father played chaperone. He also attended the premiere of If I Stay (in which Chloe stars) without them in Hollywood in August. But despite this move into the limelight Brooklyn, it seems, remains grounded. In fact, it has been widely reported that he has a job in a local coffee shop which apparently pays him just £2.68 an hour. He is also a hands-on big brother to his younger siblings Cruz, nine, and Romeo, 12, and sister Harper, three, often photographed carrying and cuddling her. And he still enjoys the same hobbies that most young teenagers enjoy such as skateboarding and hanging out with his friends. Unlike most teenagers though, Brooklyn does have a superstar sporting legend as a father, and he is tipped to follow in his dad David’s footballing footsteps. However, a spanner was recently thrown in the works for the young star after he was dropped from Arsenals training academy after failing to earn himself a scholarship. From football mascot to selfie taking star we look back over Brooklyn Beckham's transformation... David's little mascot Brooklyn was welcomed onto the pitch at just 18 months old. He was spotted walking around with his father as he celebrated a Manchester win against Tottenham in the year 2000 . Brooklyn also started watching football at an early age, here he is pictured at a Bolton VS Manchester United match at Old Trafford with David, at age 2 . Brooklyn joined his father on the pitch again following a match at Old Trafford in 2001. David carried his son after winning the premiership with his team .

Brooklyn had famous friends from a young age, here he is pictured in Los Angeles at the World Series of Football Exhibition game in 2007 pulling faces at a young Suri Cruise, the daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes . Brooklyn wasn't just a fan of football, he also enjoyed basketball and was pictured watching a game between the Boston Celtics and the LA Lakers in California with his father in 2008 . By 2010 Brooklyn was becoming used to the cameras, posing with David in a smart suit at The Sun Military Awards which were held at the Imperial War Museum, London . Brooklyn and his two brothers Cruz (centre) and Romeo (right) posed with their parents on the red carpet with Victoria the only member of the family choosing not to wear dark colours . By 2012 Brooklyn had a smart new hair cut just like his father, the family attended an event together in LA where they lived at the time . In 2013 Brooklyn made a splash on the red carpet as his mum took him as her date to the Glamour Awards in Berkeley Square, London . At the end of the year Brooklyn made another appearance at the premiere of his father's film 'The Class of 92,' much has been made of the likeness between Brooklyn and his father.

"Mats Hummels' eagerly-anticipated move to Manchester United looks increasingly likely to happen after it emerged he made a promise to Sir Alex Ferguson three years ago. As revealed by Sportsmail at the time, then-United manager Ferguson made a trip to Germany for the 2011-12 Cup final, in the hope of tying up an audacious triple transfer for Hummels, Robert Lewandowski and Shinji Kagawa. In the event, he only managed to lure Kagawa to Old Trafford after Dortmund stood firm over their other two prized assets, in the wake of a stunning victory over Bayern Munich.

"FA chairman Greg Dyke has conceded that there might be some truth in Les Ferdinand's view that covert racism exists in English football. Ferdinand, director of football at Premier League club QPR, feels that covert racism has contributed to why there are so few managers from ethnic minority backgrounds in the English game. The former England striker suggested that some club owners and chairmen are being racist - even if they don't realise it - by not considering minority candidates, and has backed a Rooney Rule style law to be implemented in England to improve representation. Dyke told Sky Sports News HQ, 'I think there is probably covert racism in parts of our society and therefore it would be surprising if it was not in football.' FA chairman Greg Dyke believes that 'covert racism' exists in English football and must be tackled . QPR director of football Les Ferdinand is supportive of a Rooney Rule style law to improve representation . He said, 'I don't think people are blatantly racist but I still think there are views and I think that we've got to change those.' Meanwhile, Dyke is hopeful that he will not have to force Premier League teams to accept his proposed changes to the homegrown talent rules. Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of players per club that have been trained in England for a period of three seasons before their 21st birthday from eight to 12, as part of a strategy to get more Englishmen playing regularly in the top flight. He explained, 'This is not something we want to enforce. What we would like is to have a discussion with the clubs, with the leagues, 'these are our ideas, these are their ideas,' it's exactly what we did on overseas players outside of Europe and we came up with a solution which will reduce the numbers - that's what we would like to do on this.'

"Gareth Bale has been taking more than his fair share of flak from Real Madrid fans this season but supporters of the club's basketball team would surely welcome him with open arms. That's if the Wales forward's performance during the NBA halfcourt challenge is anything to go by.

But Bale hit the target with his final two attempts to round off a hugely impressive display before throwing the gauntlet down to team-mate Luka Modric and Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton. Bale's fondness for basketball stemmed from a holiday in Miami. '(Miami Heat) were playing in the Finals and just from then I have been really intrigued by it and enjoy watching it,' Bale said.

"Italian football's new anti-racism campaign will use the friendly against England in Turin on Tuesday as the focus of its efforts to change attitudes in a country that has an uncomfortable history of race relations in the game. The Italian campaign is being headed by Fiona May, the English-born former Olympic long-jumper who chose to represent Italy after marrying an Italian, and she admits she has a tough challenge. May was appointed by the Italian FA's controversial president Carlo Tavecchio, the 71-year-old who was banned from all football activities for six months in November after referring to 'eating bananas' when discussing foreign players. Mario Balotelli was subjected to racial insults while training with the Italian national team in Coverciano . Fiona May (centre, pictured in Turin) has been tasked with improving race relations within Italian football . Since then, former Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi caused a storm in February by saying there were 'too many black players, even in the youth teams' in Italy, while racist abuse of players by extremist fans is relatively commonplace compared to the UK - Liverpool's Mario Balotelli was even subjected to racial insults while training for Italy at the Italian FA's (FIGC) training centre in Coverciano before the World Cup last year. May admits she had to think long and hard before taking on the 'daunting' task of heading the Italian FA's anti-racism committee in September last year, but has taken heart from the response to the recent launch of a 20-month campaign. She said: 'I didn't accept it straight away - it was a pretty daunting task, but I do like a challenge and felt it was important to show a bit of courage. 'There was nothing existing, we have to start from scratch and the main thrust is to target youngsters, the next generation.' May's campaign is called 'Racists? Ugly race (...and we don't want them in our stadiums)'. It is holding 20 events in 20 months in 20 different cities across Italy, and the second of these takes place in Turin on Monday ahead of the England game. The first involved more than 2,000 young people in Florence, May's adopted home city. Ex-Italy boss Arrigo Sacchi, pictured in 1996, said there's 'too many black players, even in the youth teams' The Italian media has had a reputation for ignoring racist incidents in its football, but May believes that has changed, shown by the coverage given to the Tavecchio and Sacchi remarks, as well as the actions of Kevin-Prince Boateng who led his AC Milan team-mates off the pitch after being abused in a friendly. Even so, Sacchi's comments in particular were hard for May to take. 'I was shocked and disappointed - he's a big name in Italy and it didn't exactly help our cause,' she added. The events around the Italy vs England match will mainly target registered players aged between 10 and 18, and will include educational programmes in regional schools, a talk show targeted at teenagers plus a social media campaign. Juventus and Torino have both promised one first-team player to take part in the events as well as local politicians in Turin. May, who was raised in Derby and is still a keen Rams fan, admits all those efforts will seem a waste of time if England players are on the receiving end of racist abuse from Italian fans on Tuesday. She said: 'I can't say it's not going to happen, but I really hope not - and we know FIFA and UEFA are now watching these matches very, very closely.' May, 45, who has become a well-known actress after retiring from competition, also hopes Italy will learn from Britain that part of the key to eradicating racist abuse is through legislation - Italian anti-racism laws are nowhere near as tough as they are in the UK. 'The legislation has to change, has to be stronger,' May said. 'But at least we are doing something now and slowly but surely I believe it's changing.'","Italy are hoping to change attitudes regarding race during England friendly .

"It was once a common way for boxers to hone their bodies for a big fight, but modern training methods have seen the practice of chopping wood somewhat die out. Floyd Mayweather, however, has gone old school in his preparation to face Manny Pacquiao. The pound-for-pound king has released a video of himself chopping wood on his official Instagram account - emulating past greats such as Muhammad Ali, Rocky Graziano and the fictional Rocky, of course.

' I want to thank all the Flippino fans who are watching at home. I want to thank Freddie Roach for being very nice to me and Bob Arum. We have been working since 2001 and we have loyalty and are the longest working pair in boxing. ' Freddie Roach: 'This is the biggest challenge of my life and I've been looking forward to this for a long time. We are in the toughest fight of our lives, we are fighting the best fighter in the world... but we are going to kick his ass.' Bob Arum and Stephen Espinoza joking about who is the biggest draw in boxing. Espinoza: 'Mayweather is the No 1 pay-per-view-draw in boxing' Arum: 'Everybody has there own opinion, Steven' The man who signed the £200m six-deal Show Time fight with Mayweather, says: 'Floyd is fighting an opponent many thought he would never fight.' Stephen Espinoza says Tyson-Lewis, Mayweather-Canelo did not generate anywhere near the excitement that Mayweather-Pacquiao has done so far. He says that Pacquiao has been always been high on Mayweather's list and that the first fight didn't happen in 2009 because of the infamous drug-testing clause. Bob Arum talking about the importance of this fight - which he says the whole world will be watching. He says 'it is a credit to the sport of boxing' that this fight is happening. A lot of back-patting between here as everyone congratulates each other on getting this fight done. And the official time is in: 38 seconds Mayweather and Pacquiao stood face-to-face. Mayweather now walking on to the stage to join Pacquiao... and he's walking out to 'We Will Rock You' It is Pacquiao to come first on to the stage... Ladies and Gentleman, boys and girls, let's get ready to rumble. After all the talk and hype, finally the two fighters are about to come on stage. Apparently, Mayweather made £2,500 in his first pro-fight when he beat Roberto Apodaca. On May 2 he will earn a little bit more than that. No wonder he is smiling... The reel of highlights continues, with the audience now treated to Pacquiao's dominant performance against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 - a fight that turned Pacquiao into a superstar. Ok, now we are back to Mayweather and his unanimous points win over Juan Manual Marques back in 2009.  The Money man knocked down his opponent in the second round and dominated the fight from start to end. Ok, now it is the turn to relive one of Pacquiao's greatest moments. His destruction of Miguel Cotto in 2009. As we wait for the fighters, we are treated to re-run of Mayweather's 2001 fight with Diego Corrales and specifically the seventh round, when Floyd knocked down his opponent three times in a fight he would go to win with a TKO in round 10. Ken Hersham, the head of HBO, who will also be showing the fight in the States, says this fight will 'transcend boxing' and that May 2 'will be very special' and worth the wait. Let's hope so... Stephen Espinoza, the head of Show Time, who will be showing the fight in the States, says he knew the fight would happen when Mayweather and Pacquaio meet at the Miami Heat basketball game and cleared the air.

"Adam Ashe admits Scotland are desperate to avoid a Six Nations whitewash — even if victory over Ireland today means handing the Championship crown to old rivals England. Defeat at Murrayfield today would ensure a fourth wooden spoon and third whitewash in 12 years for the home side, who have been relegated to a mere sideshow in what is set to be thrilling finish to this year’s tournament. Adam Ashe is determined to spoil the Irish party at Murrayfield on Saturday . The day kicks off with Italy playing Wales at the Stadio Olimpico, before Scotland host Ireland and then England round things off against France at Twickenham. Wales, Ireland and England are all locked on six points each, with the destination of the title set to be decided on points difference. As things stand, England are in the driving seat with a points difference of 37 from their first four games, with Ireland on 33 and Wales off the pace with 12. The Irish will be determined to run in the tries against Scotland, so as to apply pressure to Stuart Lancaster’s men when the take on the temperamental French. Ashe, for his part, is determined to spoil the party. ‘Ireland are focusing on a big win and looking forward to taking the title but we don’t want to let that happen, regardless who goes on to win the Championship,’ said the Glasgow Warriors forward. Ashe doesn't think his selection was a gamble for such an important match . ‘I would say there is more pressure on us going into this match because we have been losing games while playing well. ‘Yes, Ireland have got a lot of pressure on them to win the Championship — but that could be taken out of their hands by us.’ Ashe, who has been brought into the Scotland side at the expense of Rob Harley, denied it was a gamble throwing him in from the start of a such an important match. The 21-year-old, who picked up a neck injury playing against New Zealand back in November, said he was now at peak fitness despite playing a total of just 94 minutes of professional rugby in 2015. ‘I played in the Munster game a few weeks ago and that was my first game back after three months out,’ said Ashe. ‘I had a bit of a reaction with my neck a few days after but it settled down quickly enough. That was always going to happen coming back from my injury. ‘Although I have not played much rugby, I am hungry for it. I am not just physically ready but also mentally ready, too. I want to go out there and give everything I’ve got against Ireland. ‘It was tough missing the first three Six Nations games through injury but I am glad to be back involved and able to do my part.’","Scotland could hand Six Nations title to England by beating Ireland .

"Los Angeles. The carpet was red. Not in memory of all the Oscar winners who walked it down the Hollywood years but for the bad blood soon to be spilt by the two greatest boxers in the world. Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao took this starry detour en route to their appointment with destiny in Las Vegas on May 2.

Pac-Man is all smiles as he enters the arena that once hosted the glitzy Academy Awards . Click here for all that was said as Floyd Mayweather and May Pacquiao came face-to-face for their press conference ahead of their mega-fight on May 2 in Las Vegas . Ultimate stardom can bring out the best or worst in fighting men and Pacquiao had said that it would be good for boxing if can defeat Mayweather, who he sees as bloated with arrogance by success and wealth. So the man who calls himself Money presented himself in a quiet suit and a modest demeanour, speaking with admiration of his challenger as the best pound-for-pound man in the ring. Even though he does expect to win the richest fight of all time. And although he dubs himself The Best Ever, he was full of respect for the legends who preceded him in the lighter-to-middling weight divisions. ‘When I saw Thomas Hearns versus Marvin Hagler I thought to myself there would never be a bigger fight, ever. They were great. Yet here we are today. Getting ready to make some history.’ There was no trash-talking. Floyd said of Manny: ‘It is all about the best fighting the best and Pacquiao is one of the best fighters of this era. 'He’s a great fighter. To reach where he has in the sport of boxing, to be here now, he has to be doing something right. This is part of the fascination of this fight. Mayweather and Pacquiao separate after posing on stage for the sea of cameras . Lights. Camera. Action. The scene is set for the preamble to boxing's richest-ever fight on May 2 . Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum (left) speaks on behalf of his star during the blockbuster promotion . Mayweather says he didn't think he'd see a bigger fight than Thomas Hearns versus Marvin Hagler. 'They were great. Yet here we are today. Getting ready to make some history.' ‘I can always figure out an opponent instantly and I will have to do it again.’ He also predicts – in addition to ‘my emerging victorious yet again’ – that this event will live up to it’s gigantic hype. He says: ‘I’m excited. He’s excited. It’s gonna be exciting. This is a fight the world can't miss. It is an unbelievable match-up . ‘Styles make fights. I’m not psychic so I can’t tell you exactly how it play out. But I can’t wait. Manny is a very interesting fighter but I’ve only seen him fight live twice in the last five years – I’m more of a football and basketball fan these days – but I will find the key to Mr Pacquiao. Just as we’ve beaten all the other top guys. 'He wants to win just the same way I want to win. But one thing I do know about any sport, when you lose its in your mind. If you’ve lost once its in your mind, if you lost twice its in your mind.' Nor does he accept the widespread perception that, with him aged 38 and Pacquiao 36 – that the fight has come five years too late. He says: ‘Everything is always in the timing. When we met each other for the first time at that basketball ball game the other night and then talked man to man in his hotel room, the time was right to make this fight. ‘We’ll see if we’re too old. I feel good. I look forward to looking good.’ Mayweather Jnr laughs for the cameras as he arrives for the press conference in Los Angeles . Pacquiao was also in a positive mood as he turned up looking sharp in a suit and tie . The 47-0 American champion is surrounded by sizeable security guards on the red carpet . Slick in shades, Pacquiao comfortably makes his way through a sea of photographers and well-wishers . Of his alleged vulnerability to southpaws, of which the Pac-Man is the prime example, Mayweather says: ‘I’m eight wins in a row against southpaws in my 47 victories to date. For me it’s business as usual.’ Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum questioned that: ‘When Floyd was with me Floyd Snr (his trainer and father) used to say, ""No Southpaws. No Southpaws"".’ Nevertheless, Mayweather denied there had ever been serious differences between himself and Arum: 'There's never been animosity. It was just that the time had come for me to be my own promoter and to gain that experience.’ While Mayweather talks of ‘just continuing to do what we’ve always done,’ Pacquaio admits he has been preparing mentally for this during the seemingly ever-lasting negotiations. He says: ‘It’s been five years and I’ve been thinking about it all that time. Running it through my mind. Now I can put all that to good use.’ Always ready to put on a show, Mayweather enjoys himself in front of the photo board . Pacquiao poses with trainer Freddie Roach, with whom he's preparing for the fight at their Hollywood base . (From left) A model, promoter Bob Arum, Pacquiao and Roach show their fists for the cameras . Ring announcers Michael Buffer (left) and Jimmy Lennon are ready to see Mayweather and Pacquiao rumble . Pacquiao draws on that to sustain his own belief that he will win: ‘I am 100 per cent confident I will win. In truth I was more worried about boxing Oscar De La Hoya – very good boxer – and Miguel Cotto and Antonio Margarito (both bigger men and very hard punchers) – than I am about this fight.’ Equally well-dressed and just as courteous, Pacquiao stressed the importance of victory not only to himself but his country, where he is  an elected Congressman: ‘If you take a video camera to the Philippines on May 2 you will see that everyone in my country watching the fight – and their amazing reaction when I win.’ Pacquiao added: 'I want to let the people know that God can raise someone from nothing to something - and that is me. I came from nothing to something and I owe everything to God.' Freddie Roach, meanwhile, said: 'This is the biggest challenge of my life and I've been looking forward to this for a long time. We are in the toughest fight of our lives, we are fighting the best fighter in the world. But we are going to kick his ass.' Mayweather has demanded, as is his custom, home advantage in his adopted city of Las Vegas. Mayweather and Pacquiao were joined on stage after the press conference by pop superstar Justin Bieber . But he insists there could be ‘no better stage in the world’ for an event of this magnitude. Ever the showman-cum-salesman, he set the scene perfectly: ‘Lights, camera, action.’ Those lights, cameras – and of course the music – then turned up to dazzling glare and deafening blast as they strode down the aisle of the Theater and onto the stage for the big-sell. This rehearsed razzamataz was beamed around the world via satellite by the two giant cable TV networks in America, who are sharing the $350 million to half-billion dollar bonanza. Arum put the size of the fight into context by saying: ‘We are used to seeing events like the Olympics get this sort of attention but it rarely happens in boxing. Now Mayweather v Pacquiao will be watched by pretty much everyone in the world. These are two great fighters and what they are doing will be great for boxing.'","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight on May 2 in Las Vegas .

Citing his ‘mental strength’, he decided to give athletics one last roll of the dice. It paid off with a 60m gold medal at the World Indoor Championships in Sopot last year, where he surprised everyone - including the bookmakers who had him at 33-1 - by beating Jamaican Nesta Carter in the final. Boosted by his extra income, Kilty has rejoined the Linford Christie training group of which he was a part in the run-up to London 2012. Asked after his golden 6.51sec season’s-best run on Sunday what Christie had brought to the party, Kilty did a double gun salute. After his victory Kilty gave the event mascot, a mole called Krtek, a relieved hug .

Kilty (third right) clocked 6.51 seconds in a commanding win and is now targeting 100m outdoor glory . ‘I’m stronger. I’ve got a bit more bicep there,’ he said, ‘We didn’t necessarily train for the indoors but if you saw the semi-final I dropped my arms and could have run about 6.45sec.’ He doubts whether even the Americans and Jamaicans, including Usain Bolt, could beat him over the distance. ‘Kim Collins beat me a couple of times but a lot of people beat me early season. They don’t count. In a championship I think it would be very difficult.’ He has now set his sights on breaking that hallowed 100m 10-second barrier outdoors. ‘Some people think I’m a spring runner but you’ve only seen me on the scene for 12 months now. ‘If you watched the race today and saw the way I ran away from the field you can see what is going to happen outdoors.’","Richard Kilty won the European Indoor Championships 60m gold medal .

"Jose Mourinho's son has labelled Chelsea fans a 'disgrace' and the 'worst [he's] ever seen' after they booed Cesc Fabregas during Sunday's 1-1 draw with Southampton. Jose Mario, 15, a goalkeeper at Fulham, defended the Spanish midfielder and insisted he did not deserve to be singled out for criticism. Fabregas has struggled to hit the heights he set during the first half of the season when he made 13 assists and Jose Mario claimed supporters were on his back on Sunday.

Cesc Fabregas was booed by some Chelsea fans during Sunday's draw with Southampton at Stamford Bridge . The 27-year-old has not scored or assisted a goal in his last 10 games in all competitions and the last goal he made was against Swansea on January 17. But Jose Mario, who is regularly seen at Stamford Bridge supporting the team and celebrated on the Wembley pitch with players after Chelsea won the Capital One Cup earlier this month, wrote on Instagram: 'Why is everyone hating and blaming Fabregas for Sunday's performance… It was a team effort. 'Fabregas might have not played as well as most expected but at least he kept fighting… Showed a lot of character, I've seen bad Chelsea fans but Sunday was the worse I've ever seen, Fans booing Cesc not singing at all, I completely agree with the chant 'Mourinho's right, you're fans are s****' 'Our fans are a disgrace!!!!'

Oscar, he hasn't done anything wrong, please elaborate, cuz I don't see anything wrong with him.' To the same user, he also wrote: 'That's why every single staff of Chelsea hate Chelsea fans!! Oscar has created a lot of our chances... Willian and Ivanovic are probably the players who track back the most they don't stop running Ivanovic has saved us this season, scored so many goals and helped beat Liverpool with their s****y youngsters... Willian put the cross in... You need to remember who you are talk to and realise I know a lot more than you.' And in a third exchange with the same user, he added: 'Does it look like any of our youth are good enough to play in the best league in the world... No they are too young too weak... if fans kept supporting Fabregas he could change his mind set, booing him won't make him better at all.' Jose Maria has since deleted his Instagram account.

"Manchester United defender Paddy McNair is in line to make his Northern Ireland debut this month, having been included in a 27-man squad for matches against Scotland and Finland. Manager Michael O'Neill has convened a familiar group for the friendly at Hampden on March 25 and the Euro 2016 qualifier that follows at Windsor Park on March 29, with the 19-year-old set for his first senior appearance. He was an unused substitute against Romania in November but with O'Neill set to rotate his squad in the first fixture, McNair can expect to add another landmark moment to his breakthrough season.

"Juventus are ready to resist big offers from top European clubs for midfielder Paul Pogba this summer. The Turin giants have no interest in selling the France international, who has been a big hit since arriving at Juve in 2012 after leaving Manchester United as a free agent. 'There are clubs that are ready to spend 70 to 80 million euros for Pogba,' Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta told Italian radio station Radio Deejay. Paul Pogba scores Juventus' winning goal against Sassuolo in Turin earlier this month . The 22-year-old midfielder is a target for clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain . Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta is not interested in selling Pogba for big money this summer . 'There are many suitors for Pogba, but we do not want to open negotiations and we want him to stay with us. 'If we want to increase our level, we need players of great quality and Pogba is one of them.' The 22-year-old midfielder has been strongly linked with a move to Paris St Germain at the end of the season while Chelsea, Manchester City, Barcelona and Real Madrid are also reportedly keen to acquire his services. Pogba has scored seven goals and set up two more in 22 league appearances to help Juve remain on course for their fourth successive scudetto. The Frenchman is under contract with the Turin giants until June 2019. Marotta did reveal that Juve are keeping a close eye on Palermo's Argentinian striker Paulo Dybala. The Serie A giants are keen on  Palermo's Paulo Dybala, who has scored 12 league goals this season . The 21-year-old, who has been watched by a number of Premier League clubs, is out of contract in 2016 . Dybala, 21, has been impressive this season for the Sicilian outfit, scoring 12 goals while providing seven assists in 27 league games. 'Dybala is a very interesting youngster, who not only has attracted our attention but (that) of other teams too,' Marotta said. 'We are looking to see what is out there in order to form a strong attacking line.' Dybala moved to Palermo in 2012 from home-town club Instituto and helped them gain promotion to Italy's top flight in the 2013-14 campaign.

"Richard Kilty, the self-proclaimed ‘Teesside Tornado,’ is like a prizefighter trying to sell tickets to his next bout with a whirl of punchy declarations and threats to his rivals. ‘A few people have called me a one-hit wonder and counted me out,’ he said after backing up the World Indoor 60m title he won last year with the European equivalent in Prague. ‘I don’t think they should do that again. I’m a fearless warrior when I’m on the track, I come alive on the battlefield.’ He talks a good game but over the last 12 months has backed it up with performances. Victory in Poland last year over a host of American and Caribbean sprinters was a surprise, but he arrived in Prague as favourite and proved himself with a 6.51sec, 33-stride, dash in the final. Richard Kilty took gold in the 60 metres for Great Britain at the European Indoor Championships in Prague . Christian Blum (left) and Julian Reus of Germany took silver and gold respectively behind the Brit speedster . Kilty (third right) clocked 6.51 seconds in a commanding victory in Prague . Kilty (second left) described himself as 'a fearless warrior' after his gold medal-winning performance . After his victory Kilty gave the event mascot, a mole called Krtek, a relieved hug . ‘When I am in good physical shape I don’t think anyone can mentally break me,’ he said, ‘It’s my absolute dream and has been since I was a kid to stand on these start lines and compete. It’s just second nature for me so why should I be unnerved by it.’ Kilty got a good start and maintained his speed to the line to beat German duo Christian Blum and Julian Reus comfortably into the minor medals. It had been teed up as a battle of the Brits but Chijindu Ujah, who qualified second quickest for the final behind Kilty, was disqualified for a false start. The 20-year-old became the fifth Briton to break the 10sec barrier over 100m last year with a time of 9.96sec surpassing anything Usain Bolt did at the same age. But he sat on the outfield head in hands as his compatriot raced to glory and was close to tears afterwards. ‘I felt they were holding us in the blocks for too long,’ he said, ‘I’ve never false started in my life so for it to happen here I’m gutted. I thought I could’ve won.’ Chijindu Ujah denied fans the Battle of the Brits tipped before the race when he was disqualified . Ujah, 20, was took quick out of the blocks and forced to watch his compatriot Kilty race to victory . An official makes Ujah's ejection from the race official with a red card at the  Prague event on Sunday . But Kilty, who is only the third man after Dwain Chambers and Jason Gardner to hold both the World and European titles at the same time, was in no doubt he would have come out on top. ‘I was looking forward to winning the race outright with no questions,’ he said, ‘I’m certain, 110 per cent, I was going to take the victory no matter what the circumstance.’ The British team’s chances of beating their best ever medal haul evaporated with Ujah’s qualification. The final tally of two gold, four silver and three bronze medals fell one short of the 10 won on home soil in Birmingham in 2007. For Dina Asher-Smith it was the Crusades on Monday, the Renaissance on Tuesday and officially becoming the world’s fastest teenager in history over 60m on Sunday. ‘It’s back to lectures in two days,’ said the 19-year-old, who studies history at King’s College London. On International Women’s Day it was fitting she became the first British woman in 30 years, since Heather Oakes won bronze in Athens in 1985, to win a 60m medal. Her time of 7.08sec earned her the silver medal and equalled Jeanette Kwakye’s British record. 60m silver medalist Dina Asher-Smith has been balancing competing alongside university history studies . Asher-Smith became the first British woman since Heather Oakes in 1985 to win a 60m medal . Asher-Smith' second place finish was fast enough to make her the fastest ever teenager over the distance . ‘People were saying “You could break it or equal it” but there’s a difference between saying it and doing it,’ she said. ‘I’m really happy to get a PB in the final — that never happens to me.’ Asher-Smith is at the forefront of a group of talented British female sprinters including Jodie Williams, Bianca Williams and Ashleigh Nelson. But she was not letting her studies suffer, completing an essay on The Return of Martin Guerre by Natalie Zemon Davis before turning her attention to the track. A celebratory pizza with room-mate Morgan Lake, who broke the British junior pentathlon record on Friday, was on the cards. ‘She’s been holding out for the whole champs,’ said Asher-Smith, ‘she hasn’t got a Domino’s to tease me yet.’ The women’s 4x400m team executed a remarkable comeback to win silver. They were in sixth place after Kelly Massey’s first leg but Seren Bundy-Davies demonstrated her powers of recovery with a rapid second leg to move them into fourth. Laura Maddox consolidated their position and Kirsten McAslan ran a storming anchor leg to cross the line in 3:31.79, just behind France.

The men’s 4x400m squandered any chance of a medal after a disastrous handover from Conrad Williams to Jamie Bowie on the first leg. In a thrilling 1500m final, Chris O’Hare strained every sinew to hold off Germany’s Homiyu Tesfaye in the dying metres and clinch bronze in a season’s-best time of 3:38.96. The Scot executed his challenge perfectly, positioning himself on the shoulder of home favourite and eventual winner Jakub Holusa. A nasty cut on his heel did not dampen O’Hare’s delight. ‘In the first five metres I got stood on from behind,’ he said. ‘I thought “That’s not handy” but I’ll get some stitches and I’ll be all right.’ Chris O’Hare battled to hold off Germany’s Homiyu Tesfaye to win 1500m bronze in a season’s-best time .

"Sweden's top flight players earn too much money and youngsters should see the league as a chance to develop rather than become rich, according to Helsingborg manager Henrik Larsson. The former Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United striker, who started and ended his career at Helsingborg, was speaking at a media day to launch the 2015 Allsvenskan season, with his side kicking off at Kalmar on April 4. Appointed by Helsingborg last November, Golden Boot winner Larsson took over at a club that, although known as a powerhouse in Swedish football, found itself struggling financially. Former Celtic and Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson now manages at his former club side Helsingborg . To arrest the alarming economic slide, Larsson decided the fat wage packets paid by the club would be a thing of the past. With Helsingborg's blessing, he introduced a salary cap reported to be a modest 40,000 Swedish crowns ($4,700) a month -- about half the average wage in the Swedish top flight. 'I won't comment on the sums, but I will say that it's not the wages that Helsingborg used to pay in the past,' Larsson told Reuters. The former Sweden international gets emotional during his last playing appearance for Helsingborg in 2009 . 'I don't mind players earning money, but it should mean at the same time that the club is doing good. 'If the club is doing good, the club is getting income, then the club can share it with the players. But when the situation is not going according to plan, you have to look at the financial bit and see what you can change.' Larsson learned his trade with Helsingborg before traveling the well-worn path taken by Swedish players to the Dutch league, joining Feyenoord before moving to Celtic and winning global recognition, and no shortage of riches, for his scoring feats. Larsson won four Scottish league titles with Celtic and two La Liga titles at Barcelona plus the 2006 Champions League. The 43-year-old finds the back of the net for Sweden in the 2006 World Cup group stage clash with England . Larsson was a prolific scorer for club and country, celebrating against England back in 2006 . He recommended that young Allsvenskan players seeking to emulate his success and that of former Malmo striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic should play to develop their game, rather than their bank account. 'I think that the average wage in Sweden is too high. They won't be financially independent from the money they earn here (Helsingborg). 'They earn good money, but I think there has to be the desire to develop, to go on to a bigger league and earn your money there.' Helsingborg's wage cap might have restricted his options a little but Larsson said the chance to work with one of Europe's great finishers - himself - may have helped attract players. 'It's always difficult, but there are always players that have the desire to do something with their football,' the 43-year-old said. Larsson is a club legend at Celtic, seen here lifting the 2004 SPL title with the club he played at from 1997-04 . 'There are players who tend not to look at the money short-term, they have a bigger plan. I haven't found it that hard to attract good players to the club.' Among the players at his disposal this season is his 17-year-old son Jordan, who signed for the club several months before his father took over as manager. 'When we're at the ground he's a football player like everybody else. Even though he is young I expect him to do what everybody else is doing - I don't make a difference just because he's my son,' Larsson smiled. Having performed the near-miracle of keeping minnows Falkenberg in the Swedish top flight last year, Larsson is looking forward to being back in his home town. 'Everything is possible in football,' he said, not ruling out the possibility of a title run with his new charges. 'But for us the most important thing is to steady the ship and make progress with the team.'

"The figure of speech 'a chip off the old block' appears to an apt one for Henrik Larsson's son, Jordan following his recent stunning strike. The son of former Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United striker Henrik scored a sublime solo effort for Norwegian side Helsingborg against Syrianska on Wednesday night. Larsson Jnr's strike is certainly one that his dad, and the current manager of Helsingborg, would have been proud of as he opened the scoring in their 2-2 draw during the Swedish Cup encounter. VIDEO Scroll down to see Jordan Larsson's stunning goal for Helsingborg . Henrik Larsson's son, Jordan (centre) scored a stunning goal for Helsingborg on Wednesday night .

Running on the shoulder of the last defender, the 17-year-old gathers the ball on the edge of the box before turning and unleashing a beautifully curled effort that flies into the top corner. According to some reports in Sweden after the goal, Helsingborg fans sang: 'He's better than his dad!' And judging by that striker Larsson could well emulate his father's goalscoring talents that illuminated Europe for 25 years. Larsson is probably best remembered for his seven-year spell at Celtic where his honours included four league titles and two Scottish Cups. On Thursday the Scottish giants announced that they have signed a long-term deal with sports manufacturer New Balance - who will become their official kit supplier from the 2015/16 season onwards. Larsson (right) wheels away in jubilation at his brilliant goal to give his side the lead in their Swedish Cup tie . The teenager was mobbed by his team-mates as fans reportedly sang 'He's better than his dad!' Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell commented: 'New Balance is one of the world's leading sportswear manufacturers and will cater to the huge global demand for the Celtic FC kit. Importantly, our cultures match well. 'While New Balance is relatively new to football, its sporting heritage dates back more than 100 years and there is huge excitement around the brand and its ambitions globally. Our supporters are rightly proud of the similarly long and prestigious history of our Club, and both Celtic FC and New Balance look forward to an exciting, long and rewarding future collaboration.

"Flight attendants often complain that their uniforms are itchy or too tight, but these outfits worn by staff on a flight in China may rank among the most comfortable ever. Cabin crew for Tianjin Airlines surprised passengers recently when they wore their pyjamas and dressing gowns instead of their usual uniforms on flights across the country. But the publicity stunt wasn’t intended for their own comfort. Scroll down for video . Tianjin Airlines flight attendants wore their pyjamas and onesies on flights across the country recently . The regional carrier, based in Tianjin in northern China, was promoting the benefits of a good night’s sleep by dressing its employees in their PJs and onesies. Organisers of the event said many physical and psychological problems can be cured by establishing proper sleep patterns. It appears to have worked, with passenger Tain Li, 35, telling local media: ‘I was getting onto the plane and there to show me to my seat was a beautiful girl in her night clothes. ‘I thought I must be dreaming. I think it worked though as I quickly fell asleep and got a few hours in, which is more than normal for me on a plane.’ The airline, based in Tianjin in northern China, was promoting the benefits of a good night's sleep . Flight attendants gave instructions on how to relax and meditate to help passengers fall asleep . Flight attendant Tao Chu, 27, said many passengers find it hard to sleep on planes, and they’ll often miss out on a whole night’s sleep. She added: ‘We gave them instructions in how to relax and meditate so they will be able to sleep, even on a plane on long flights. ‘It is very important to have the right number of hours sleep to you want stay healthy.

Monaco may have one of the best defensive records in Europe, but Wenger believes Arsenal can produce an unlikely result against the club he guided to the French title 27 years ago. 'We have to put it right. Sometimes in life, you make a big mistake, and there is no comeback, no way you get the chance to put it right again. 'In football, you can do it, so let's just give everything to do it,' said Wenger, whose side beat West Ham 3-0 on Saturday to cement their place in the top four of the Barclays Premier League. 'We know that (in the first leg) we were impatient and threw ourselves forward too much, that we lost our patience and composure.

"Paul Casey is returning to Augusta after securing his place at next week's Masters. The 37-year-old has not played in the season's first major for the last two years but will tee it up on April 9 due to his position in the world's top 50. The Englishman, whose world ranking got as high as three in 2009, came into the new season outside the top 50 but a second-placed finish at the Northern Trust Open followed by a tie for third at the Honda Classic saw him move back in and his place at Augusta has now been assured.

"Richard Kilty dressed up as Superman to power into the 60 metres semi-finals at the European Indoor Championships in Prague - and then set his sights on winning a domestic duel for gold with Great Britain team-mate Chijindu Ujah on Sunday. Kilty, the surprise world indoor champion 12 months ago, and Ujah were the fastest two qualifiers from Saturday's heats at the O2 Arena, both clocking 6.57 seconds and looking easy doing so. The 25-year-old was clad in an all-in-one bodysuit for the race and said: 'It's Superman this look. I told my little niece I would dress up for her as Superman in the heats.' Richard Kilty (centre) clocked 6.57 seconds to reach the 60m semi-finals in Prague . The British sprinter was a surprise winner at the World Indoor Championships last year . Kilty had a quick spar with the event mascot, a mole called Krtek, after the race, but will have Ujah firmly in his sights on Sunday. The 21-year-old also wears a bodysuit to race in which has helped him earn the nickname Spiderman. 'Superman can beat Spiderman, so it'll be a great battle tomorrow and I'm looking forward to it,' said Kilty. Ujah went into the championships as the fastest man in the field, having run 6.53secs this year, but Kilty said he had plenty more to give. 'I wanted to remind people a little bit, but I thought that would be 6.60s with the effort I put into it,' he said. 'I've come here in great shape. There are still a few technical things - when I looked at the replay I wasn't quite standing low enough in the blocks - but there are massive improvements to come as long as I keep enjoying myself and keep the same mentality. 'I think I've got something to prove coming out here.' Chijindu Ujah, nicknamed Spiderman for his own bodysuit, prepares at the European Indoor Championships . Sean Safo-Antwi was the third Briton to reach the semi-final stage of the event . The third Briton in the field, Sean Safo-Antwi, also booked his place in the semi-finals, clocking 6.67. Less than 24 hours after finishing an essay assessing American historian Natalie Zemon Davis' 1983 book 'The Return of Martin Guerre', Dina Asher-Smith showed she was in the form to break the British 60m record by storming into the semi-finals in the women's event. The 19-year-old history student clocked 7.10, a personal best, to win her heat with ease. That she eased down well before the line indicated Jeanette Kwakye's mark of 7.08 would be under serious threat in the semi-finals and final on Sunday. Asher-Smith was the joint second fastest qualifier, with Dutch gold medal favourite Dafne Schippers leading the way with 7.07. Germany's Verena Sailor also clocked 7.10 and the medals look set to be shared among the trio. Dina Asher-Smith (centre) broke the British women's 60m record on her way to the semi-finals . 'It was a heat so I did try and control it so I could get into the semi-finals, but at the same time I'm really shocked by the time,' Asher-Smith said. 'I'm over the moon. I really wasn't expecting to run so quickly. 'Dafne was amazing and I saw Verena as well so I knew the track was quick. Obviously it wasn't going to change my race, but I did have that at the back of my mind that maybe if I put in a bit less effort I could still get a quick time. 'Hopefully I've got lots to improve on and there's more to come in the semis.'

"Former world No 1 Tiger Woods will  drop outside the top 100 in the rankings on Monday for the first time in more than 18 years. The 39-year-old American is down at No 96 and a world ranking official revealed that he is likely to slip to No 102 when the list is adjusted after this weekend's tournaments. Woods posted an 82 at the Phoenix Open in January, his worst round as a professional, as he slumped outside the leading 50 in the rankings for the first time in more than three years.

Since then the 14-time major winner has continued a downward slide that resulted in him failing to qualify for this month's WGC-Cadillac Championship, an event he has won seven times. Woods is yet to make a decision on whether he will play at the Masters, which begins on April 9. Woods was ranked 433rd when he turned professional in September 1996.

And on Tuesday he followed it up with a clip of his bag work, showcasing the speed and power he hopes will end Mayweather's unbeaten record in a little under two months. Alongside the video, Pacquaio wrote: 'First day of training here in wild card gym, feels good to be back. Thank you Lord for the strength that you have given me day by day.' Pacquiao, who will come face-to-face with Mayweather at their first and only press conference on March 11, has refused to comment on his impressions of the American outside of the ring. Pacquiao also posted a video of himself running through the streets of Los Angeles on his Instagram account . The 36-year-old is attempting to reach peak fitness ahead of his hotly anticipated fight with Mayweather . Speaking to Yahoo Sports, he said: 'I don't want to talk about that. 'I don't have anything to say about him right now. I'm not talking about him.' The Filipino was more open about Mayweather's boxing style, praising the 38-year-old's ability while maintaining an air of confidence in his own. 'He has very good speed and footwork, and he has punches, and that makes him look good,' Pacquiao said. 'But it depends on the fighter he is going to fight. For me as a boxer, I know what the job is. I'm going to throw a lot of punches, a lot of hard punches. Mayweather began training in his Las Vegas gym exactly two months before fighting Pacquiao .

"Palermo starlet Paulo Dybala has revealed he'd 'swim to Barcelona' to secure a move, if the Catalan giants came calling for his signature. The 21-year-old has been in sensational form for the Serie A side this term, netting 12 goals in 24 league appearances, and it hasn't gone unnoticed.

"Hometown boy Jimmy Walker held his nerve to close out victory at the Valero Texas Open at TPC San Antonio. The Ryder Cup player added to his Sony Open title this season and three PGA Tour victories in 2014 as a closing 70 maintained his four-shot overnight lead. Jordan Spieth was second on seven under, having perhaps left his run too late before finishing with four birdies in the last five holes. Jimmy Walker poses with the Valero Texas Open trophy after recording a four-shot win . Walker took the trophy at his hometown tournament and now has six wins since the start of 2014 . Walker went into his final round with four-shot lead and managed to preserve his advantage . Walker birdied the par-five second when he laid up short of the green, pitched on and holed a straight eight-foot putt - though he gave the shot back at the fourth. Another bogey at the seventh was off-set as he pitched stone-dead from an awkward bunker stance at the next, and he birdied 10 as well before dropping a shot at 12. Playing partner Spieth made a late bid to exert some pressure with birdies at the 14th - via a 45-foot putt - and 15th and when his tee shot at the showpiece 16th spun back out of the fringe, there was scope for Walker to crack. Instead, the San Antonio resident struck a lovely pin-high tee shot and read the left-to-right break to perfection on the ensuing 16-foot putt. His birdie was matched by Spieth but the four-shot margin remained and despite a poor tee shot, Walker also birdied the penultimate hole with a good putt from 18 feet. Spieth did likewise and both parred the last to leave Walker as the tour's first repeat winner this season. He told NBC: 'It's at home and it's cool, you can feel support of friends, family and fans. It doesn't happen often, to win in your home town. 'It played hard today, sometimes it's hard to make pars. I wasn't putting very good but I finally got the putting stroke smoothed out and holed a couple. 'And Jordan... holy cow! I'll be having nightmares about that guy!' Spieth's efforts mean he has now finished in the top seven in eight of his last 10 starts. Walker, meanwhile, is building momentum for the Masters in two weeks' time and he said: 'I like Augusta. Walker adds the Valero Texas Open to the Sony Open title which he has already won this season . Jordan Spieth finished as runner-up, despite carding four birdies on the last five holes . Spieth said he found it hard to make par at times on the course but was Walker's closest challenger . 'All this keeps adding momentum and confidence and I'm excited to go. I'll head over tomorrow and take another look at it.' Billy Horschel, the third player in the group, finished third outright at four under. Chesson Hadley birdied the last hole to finish joint fourth with Daniel Summerhays at three under. Several players went into the tournament with hopes of breaking into the world's top 50 and qualifying for the Masters, but none were able to produce the finish they required.","Jimmy Walker secures his second title this season with a four-shot win .

"Rugby World Cup chiefs have warned fans not to buy tickets from unofficial sources after it emerged that a single ticket for the final is being advertised for £59,000. The category A ticket, which has a face value of £715, is up for sale on a secondary ticket website, StubHub.co.uk, for 82 times its original price. The site also has category D tickets for the final at Twickenham on October 31 which originally cost £125 for sale for £7,500, some 60 times the face value. Debbie Jevans, chief executive of England 2015 Rugby World Cup, said organisers hoped new legislation forcing secondary websites to publish the exact row and seat number would prove a deterrent - people buying tickets from unofficial sources can be refused entrance. Rugby World Cup chiefs have warned fans not to buy tickets from unofficial sources ahead of the tournament . Jevans said: 'Our message is to buy those tickets through the official sources - not least to ensure that it is a genuine ticket and not a fraudulent one, and to ensure fans are not ripped off. 'The new legislation means secondary ticket websites will have to show the row, the seat and access of that ticket. That brings greater transparency which will allow us to have more exposure to who is selling those tickets and at what price. 'We will be monitoring these sites, this gives us the ability to do so to a greater degree and we do reserve the right to refuse access. One ticket on StubHub.co.uk for the showpiece final has been advertised for sale at a price of £59,000 . 'Our terms and conditions reserve the right not to allow access if that ticket is sold through an unofficial source. 'We have the ability to track the tickets down.' StubHub did not respond when asked to comment. Meanwhile, Jevans said the success of the Rugby World Cup, which is being hosted by England in the autumn with some matches in Wales, will not depend on whether Stuart Lancaster's side make it through their tough group. England are in Pool A along with Australia and Wales, with only two countries going through to the quarter-finals. Tickets to watch England are expensive, and the tournament's success will be judged on the team's progress . World Rugby's chief executive Brett Gosper, an Australian, reacted to England's early exit from the Cricket World Cup by tweeting: 'England fail to exit pool in World Cup?...? not the words we want to hear during #RWC2015.' Jevans said: 'Of course you think about it when you at the tough group England are in and the impact that may or may not have, but from our perspective it doesn't make a difference. 'As a fan I would be very upset but from a delivery perspective we are looking at it being about 20 teams and ensuring they can all compete to the best of their ability.

'We want to celebrate the sport and our focus is not about who wins or who is the final.

Wales head coach Warren Gatland said last week he was 'surprised' by the tweet, adding: 'Probably the head of World Rugby doesn't need to be doing that, but that's his own personal views and his own personal decision.'","One Rugby World Cup final ticket is advertised on StubHub for £59,000 .

"Australian Open champion and top seed Novak Djokovic launched his BNP Paribas Open title defence in ruthless style on Saturday, crushing Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis 6-1 6-3 in the second round. Playing near-flawless tennis from the baseline, the Serb broke his opponent twice in each set to coast to victory in just under an hour on the showpiece stadium court at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Fourth seed Andy Murray erased memories of early losses at the venue with a 6-1 6-3 demolition of Canadian Vasek Pospisil and Japanese trailblazer Kei Nishikori recovered from an erratic start to beat American Ryan Harrison 6-4 6-4. World No 1 Novak Djokovic made light work of his first round match at the BNP Paribas Open . Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis was no match for the Australian Open champion at Indian Wells . Djokovic, seeking a fourth title at Indian Wells, breezed through the opening set in just 25 minutes before sealing the win when Baghdatis hit a backhand long on the second match point. 'It went very well for me, a very solid performance from the beginning,' the world No 1 said courtside after improving his record this season to 15-2. 'I served well and from the baseline I didn't give Marcos many chances to come back in the match. Great performance against a quality opponent, against somebody that was a former top-10 player and that knows how to play on a big stage. 'Of course, having won the title in Australia, it allows me to have and carry this confidence into every other event that is coming up in the season.' Djokovic takes time out from the tournament to have a kickabout in the sunshine . Andy Murray celebrates his first round victory over Vasek Pospisil by hitting a ball into the crowd . Murray broke Pospisil's serve three times in the opening set and twice in the second to ease to victory in 79 minutes on a sweltering afternoon. Ousted in the opening round in 2011 and 2012, the 27-year-old Scot hit 14 winners and won five of his nine break point chances to dominate the match. 'I've struggled a bit in the last few years here so I decided to try and play a very solid match and adjust to the conditions,' world number four Murray said. 'It was very hot and that made the ball pretty lively. 'Controlling the ball isn't that easy. I thought I played quite a smart match.' Kei Nishikori was made to sweat before finishing off local boy Ryan Harrison in straight sets . Nishikori, who became the first Asian male to reach a grand slam singles final at the U.S. Open last year, broke Harrison five times while losing his own serve on three occasions before sealing his win in just under an hour and a half. 'It was a bit up and down but I played well in the second set,' said the 25-year-old Japanese. 'I was playing almost a perfect game.' The fifth seed, who lost to Marin Cilic in last year's U.S. Open final before ending a landmark season with four ATP World Tour titles, will next play Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, who beat Australia's James Duckworth 6-2 7-6. In other matches, 10th-seeded Croatian Cilic, back on the circuit after being troubled by a shoulder injury, was upset 6-4 6-4 by Argentine Juan Monaco while eighth-seeded Spaniard David Ferrer battled past Croatia's Ivan Dodig 4-6 6-1 7-6.","Australian Open champion dispatched Cypriot in straight sets .

"Lionel Messi is unattainable for most football clubs in the world, according to Barcelona sporting director Ariedo Braida. If he wasn't expensive enough through goals alone, news of his marketability will perhaps scare away any more potential suitors as Barcelona bosses further hailed their star man. '[Messi] is a very strong player and is the icon of world football,' Braida told Radio Anch'io Sport. 'He sells lots of shirts around the world, it's extraordinary. Lionel Messi is unattainable to most football clubs in the world, according to the Barcelona sporting director . There were rumours of Messi falling out with coach Luis Enrique (pictured), but they have been put to bed . 'The president [Josep Maria Bartomeu] always says that Messi is an alien. I think and hope that economically he's unapproachable for other clubs. 'Even if you have to pay attention to new investors, Messi has a release clause of €250 million (£179million) and for most teams that is an unattainable figure. 'Leo in Barcelona is much-loved by all, I think it would be a mistake for him to change team.' Ariedo Braida (pictured) says that it would be a mistake for Messi to change teams . The Argentinian has helped Barcelona to the top of La Liga ahead of their crunch El Clasico with Real Madrid . Earlier in the season, there had been speculation over a potential exit for the Argentinian superstar. Rumours of a bust-up with coach Luis Enrique circulated, but they have been put to bed and Messi has helped the team to the top of La Liga. For much of the season, Real Madrid held the top spot in Spain, but last week Barca overtook them ahead of next weekend's El Clasico.","The pulling power of Lionel Messi has been hailed by a Barcelona chief .

"Andy Murray's hopes of playing July's Davis Cup quarter final at Queen's Club look likely to be fulfilled after positive noises emanated today from the famous west London venue. While there will undoubtedly be logistical challenges in hosting what is Great Britain's biggest home tie in 29 years there appears an enthusiasm among the club's hierarchy to overcome them. Given Murray's desire to play at a venue where he has won the Aegon Championships title three times already, there is likely to be a concerted effort to make it happen, including on the part of the Lawn Tennis Association. Andy Murray with the Aegon Championship trophy at the Queen's club in West London last month . 'We have been approached, along with some other venues, and are actively looking at whether or not we could host it,' said a Queen's spokesman. 'There are a number of logistical issues that would have to be resolved, but if it is possible to overcome them Queen's would be delighted to host the Davis Cup in July.' That date of July 17-19 comes nearly four weeks after the conclusion of the Aegon Championships, which is the main Wimbledon warm-up. Among the issues is keeping up the huge main stand which takes the centre court capacity to nearly 7,000, above the 6,000 threshold required for a quarter final. Other challenges include a scheduled refurbishment of the clubhouse due to begin in early July, and making sure the grass court – the quality of which is reckoned to be at least Wimbledon's equal – can recover in time from the summer ATP event. Murray celebrates beating USA in the Davis Cup to set up a quarter-final against France for Great Britain . The British No 1 won the pre-Wimbledon tournament at Queen's in 2013 (left), 2011 (centre) and 2009 (right) Great Britain vs France . Australia vs Kazakhstan . Argentina vs Serbia . Canada vs Belgium . It will also require considerable commitment and patience from members, with the construction of the main stand already beginning in early May and the prospect of it being up on the site of two hard courts for nearly three months. It had been thought the disruption might be too prolonged, although today's statement appears to knock that down. At the weekend Murray, due to play Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in Indian Wells on Monday night, pointed not only to his own good record at Queen's but also the fact that his brother Jamie has made the doubles final there and James Ward the semi-finals. However, it is also a place where French players have done well, notably Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who is an enormously popular regular visitor. The Scot is in action at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, facing Philipp Kohlschreiber on Monday night . Eastbourne, Birmingham's Priory Club and Nottingham have also been approached, but Murray's opinion carries a decisive amount of weight. France were the opposition when Queen's last staged a Davis Cup tie, back in 1990. GB were beaten 5-0 then, but with Murray in his prime and France' s players by and large – bar the presently injured Tsonga – not at their best on grass, it is likely to be extremely close this time. With a three week gap between Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year, it means there will be six weeks of top-class grass court tennis played in the UK this summer.

"A loving granddaughter skipped her high school graduation ceremony in Wyoming and instead wore her cap and gown to a Texas hospital to surprise her grandmother who was battling leukemia. Sharon Thompson, who was recovering from brain surgery at the Houston Methodist Hospital, was proudly watching a live feed of her eldest grandchild Taylor Thompson's graduation in Cody, Wyoming. However, when Taylor's name was called she burst into her 70-year-old grandmother's hospital room instead of appearing on stage. And now a video of the touching moment has become an internet sensation, with the YouTube clip – which was first shared last June – accumulating more than a million views, the majority of which were amassed during the last two days. Perfect prank: Taylor Thompson (left) skipped her graduation and surprised her grandmother Sharon Thompson (right), who was in the hospital recovering from brain surgery as she battled cancer . The touching footage shows Sharon, who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, enjoying the graduation ceremony from the confinements of her hospital bed. But before her granddaughter's name was called, the speaker made a surprising announcement. 'The next graduate is not here this evening because she has a surprise for someone special in her life,' the announcer said. 'Her grandmother has been battling cancer this past year and can't be at graduation, so she is watching the ceremony live over the internet right now.' He added: 'Dressed in her cap and gown, our graduate is going to walk into her grandmother's hospital room as I call her name.' Sharon burst into tears of joy when she realized what was happening. 'I can't believe it,' she told her granddaughter who was also moved to tears. 'I am so happy to see you.' Proud grandma: Last June, Sharon watched a live feed of her eldest grandchild's graduation ceremony on the internet . Shocking surprise: She was filled with joy when she realized that Taylor had come to visit her instead of walking in the ceremony, which was taking place in Cody, Wyoming that very moment . Unforgettable gift: Sharon happily cupped Taylor's face in her hands, later telling her that everyone should have a granddaughter like her . In the middle of the emotional moment, Sharon joked: 'This is enough to push me over the edge.' Sharon then held Taylor's face in her hands and told her how pretty she looked in her cap and gown. Taylor explained to her grandmother that she had flown to Houston the day before and that she had been pulling her leg the entire time. 'Everybody should have a granddaughter like you,' Sharon replied. Hanging above Sharon's hospital bed was a banner that the nurses had made her, which read: 'Congratulations Taylor Class of 2014.' But she couldn't get over the unexpected surprise. Magic moment: Taylor took a moment to hug her grandfather, who was also unaware of her plan . 'It's like a dream - a good dream,' Sharon said. 'It's real. I got to touch you.' At the end of the clip, Taylor kept with the commencement tradition and moved the tassel to the left side of her cap before throwing it in the air. 'To me, graduation was much more special how I did it,' Taylor told Cody Enterprise last year. 'It was the ultimate graduation for me.' And Sharon confirmed that she had ‘no idea' what her granddaughter was planning. 'I had given her pearl earrings, her birth stone, and she was wearing them,' she explained. 'I had brain surgery the day before and thought I was hallucinating.' She added: 'Oh my gosh, it was the surprise of a lifetime. Really wonderful, it made my day. My husband didn’t even know.'","Sharon Thompson, who was battling acute myeloid leukemia, was watching her eldest grandchild's graduation on the internet .

"Italy coach Antonio Conte believes that players of Italian descent should be free to decide whether they want to play for the 'azzurri'.

'At the last World Cup, of the 736 players that took part 83 were born in a different country from the one they were playing for,' Conte added. Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini expressed a different opinion earlier on Monday. Former  City boss Roberto Mancini had previously disagreed with foreign-born players being picked . 'I believe that an Italian player deserves to play for Italy,' Mancini said. 'Anyone who wasn't born in Italy, even though he may have Italian relatives, shouldn't be allowed to play. At least this is my opinion.' Conte said Vazquez had made it clear right from the start that he wanted to represent Italy. 'It's not that I forced him to accept,' the coach added.

"Red Bull Racing have launched their 2015 Formula One car race livery for the upcoming season as they hope to recapture their titles. Their new 2015 RB11 car has been used in F1 testing with a camouflage livery in order to ward off rival teams attempting to copy their design secrets. Red Bull won consecutive Drivers' and Constructors titles between 2010-13 but relinquished their crowns to a dominant Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton last season. Red Bull Racing have tweeted this picture of their 2015 RB11 car with this season's livery, which is back in their usual team colours . The new colour scheme was displayed on the team's Twitter page with the hashtag '#BackInColour' as Red Bull returned to their usual look. The most notable shape change to the 2015 car is the lower nose box and front of the chassis, which were amended in line with the latest regulations.

"Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock billed taxpayers for more than $10,000 on private flights last fall, including a trip on a private jet to a Chicago Bears football game. The flights last November don't include more than a dozen other trips on donors' planes that Schock has paid for out of his House office expenses or campaign funds since joining Congress in 2009. Schock, a 33-year-old Republican representing Peoria, had already been facing scrutiny for using congressional funds to redecorate his Capitol Hill office in the style of the TV show 'Downton Abbey.' He repaid those charges last month out of his own pocket; his office had said it's reviewing other expenses. Rep. Aaron Schockis accused of billing taxpayers for more than $10,000 on private flights last fall that included a trip to a Chicago Bears football game . Schock and his entourage flew in an Eclipse 500 aircraft like this one . The Chicago Sun-Times reported Sunday night that Schock flew from Peoria, Illinois to Chicago to attend a Bears game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 16, 2014 . Overall, according to the paper, he used $20,855 in taxpayer money for the Chicago trip and another to New York in September, where his political action committee spent another $3,000 for tickets to the Global Citizen Festival concert. This week Schock reportedly hired a pair of lawyers to audit his political and legislative operations. Spokesmen for Schock declined to comment to the Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune, and did not respond to a request from Daily Mail Online. In a statement last week they said a legal team was already poring over 'compliance procedures in his official office, campaign and leadership PAC to determine whether they can be improved.' The football game was part of a longer trip on a chartered six-seat business jet that took off from a civil aviation airport in Manassas, Virginia en route to Peoria on a Friday. The Bears defeated the Vikings but the game may ultimately defeat a congressman . DOWNTON OFFICE: Schock spent $40,000 in taxpayer funds redecorating his Capitol Hill office, but had to pay the money back . The Sunday trip was a sideline before the aircraft returned to Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport a day later. All the seats were filled, according to pilot Keith Siilats, who told the Sun-Times that Schock's district director Dayne LaHood and three others were aboard. He also said he accompanied the congressman and his group to the football game. He was paid $10,802 for 'commercial transportation' in November, the last month for which numbers are available. 'That whole weekend was paid by the government,' he said. Schock 'called me on Saturday and said ""what do you think about’ a Chicago trip?""' Siilats recalled for the paper. Chicago Bears single-game tickets range in cost from $106 to $430. It's not clear who paid for them.","Illinois Republican used his House office expense budget for more than $10,000 in private flights including the November NFL jaunt .

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is promising an exciting summer of recruitment at Selhurst Park after the club effectively guaranteed their Premier League survival with a comeback victory at Stoke City. Palace are now 11 points clear of the drop zone and Pardew can think about building for next season, buoyed by the new Sky Sports TV deal and a possible takeover from American businessman Josh Harris. Recruitment is now uppermost in Pardew’s mind and he revealed: ‘We are getting calls regarding players from Inter Milan and Benfica because they are our market now. Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Stoke 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium . Pardew (left) congratulates wing wizard Yannick Bolasie at full-time after Palace's impressive victory . Wilfried Zaha has scored in his last two games against QPR and Stoke, the first time he’s netted consecutively since October 2012 in his first spell with Palace . ‘Palace now come into the same group as everybody below the likes of Everton, Tottenham and Liverpool, and the most important thing is to try to trade well. ‘It’s important to preserve your Premier League status early. If you leave it late, it is very difficult to get players. You don’t want other teams putting packages together and working on players before you can. ‘We are pretty secure in approaching clubs and players now as a Premier League side for next season and that’s what we will do. We have the finance to do what we say we are going to do. So it does give us a slight advantage.’ One player who will remain is reborn winger Wilfried Zaha who scored the winner at The Britannia for his first back-to-back goals since 2012. In February, Wilfried Zaha (right) was sad, but according to Alan Pardew he is now playing with a smile . Zaha signed for Manchester United after Palace's promotion, but his career nosedived at Old Trafford . Zaha’s career nosedived after a £15million move to Manchester United went sour and he has gone from being capped by England to not even making the Under 21 squad. He was ordered to smile more and sulk less by Pardew last week and celebrated his goal at Stoke by playfully sticking out his tongue. ‘He looked a sad player when I arrived (from Newcastle in January),’ said Pardew. ‘You are never going to play your best football when you're sad and sometimes good management is not about tactics but inspiring players. He was down in the dumps for whatever reason. ‘Young players need that exuberance, particularly with the way he plays. And smiling and being happy is part of that exuberance.’ Nonetheless, 22-year-old Zaha doesn’t plan on transforming himself into a cartoon clown. ‘I do smile when I need to!,’ he stressed. Crystal Palace players celebrate with Glenn Murray after he scored a penalty to draw Palace level . Stoke manager Mark Hughes was distraught with two key decisions by referee Andre Marriner . ‘When it is time to be serious, I’m serious. When it is time to play around I will play around. ‘We’ve got the points we’ve needed to now so we can play without pressure and enjoy the rest of the season.’ There wasn’t much hilarity from beaten Stoke manager Mark Hughes who felt his side were robbed by two key decisions from referee Andre Marriner after taking a 14th-minute lead from Mame Diouf. Hughes has joined West Brom manager Tony Pulis in saying technology should be brought in immediately to stop the wrong decisions being made. The Stoke boss was furious that Mr Marriner awarded Palace a penalty when Asmir Begovic and Yannick Bolasie collided and Glenn Murray levelled from the spot. And after Zaha had put Palace ahead, the official waved away a strong appeal for handball against Palace defender Joel Ward. Hughes believes that Palace defender Joel Ward (right) was guilty of handball in the penalty area . Hughes slammed the standard of refereeing in the Premier League this season . Hughes said: ‘It was clear to everybody that he has thrown his body, his arms to stop the ball going goalwards. It was a shot on target, he was not close to the ball, he was about five yards away so it was a clear penalty. ‘I don’t think the standard of refereeing this year has been as good as it needs to be. They need a little bit of help and I’m an advocate of TV replays. ‘I think it is quite simple. If a big decision is made, he needs to ask the question: is there any reason why I should not give a penalty, or why I should not give a goal. Within 10 or 15 seconds they can give the referee an answer and there will be more correct decisions. They need to be given that option because at the moment they need a lot more help. ‘I think we have reached a tipping point. Before there were debates one way or the other but now I think it needs to come in.’","Crystal Palace came from a goal behind to beat Stoke 2-1 on Saturday .

"On the night where Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup, former midfielder Paul Pogba showed his former side exactly what they are missing as his spectacular half-volley secured victory for Juventus against Sassuolo. The 21-year-old struck eight minutes from full-time as the Italian giants went 11 points clear at the top - ending a two-match winless streak in the process - as they edged past Eusebio Di Francesco's men on Monday night. A 1-1 draw with Roma in their last league match, coupled by losing their long-standing unbeaten home record the game before against Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia semi-finals, meant they went into the game with a point to prove.

"Manchester City are pressing ahead in their interest for Wolfsburg's Kevin de Bruyne. The Bundesliga side want to keep the Belgium international for at least one more season as they plan a crack at the Champions League next year. However, City, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain are all interested in signing him this summer. Manchester City are pressing ahead with a deal for Wolfsburg playmaker Kevin de Bruyne . De Bruyne has been in fine form for club and country this season and is rated at £40m . De Bruyne celebrates with Marouane Fellaini (c) and Radja Nainggolan after a goal against Cyprus . De Bruyne’s agent Patrick de Koster has hinted it would take a bid close to £40million for Wolfsburg to consider selling. Talking last week he said: ‘Clubs who are ready to bid 30million euros for Kevin have no sense of reality. A player like Kevin has a market value of some €50million, €55m or even €60m by now.’ De Bruyne, 23, cost Wolfsburg £16.7m when he signed in January 2014 from Chelsea and has scored 14 goals for his club this season. City defender Aleksandar Kolarov has admitted he’s tempted by a return to Italy after starting just 11 Premier League games this season. The 29-year-old Serb, who cost £16m from Lazio in 2010, fuelled the speculation while praising the job compatriot Sinisa Mihajlovic has done as manager of third-placed Sampdoria. He told Sky Italia: ‘I’d like to return to Italy, but it’s difficult. ‘I’m happy for Mihajlovic. He’s doing very well, as are Lazio.’ De Bruyne, who signed for Wolfsburg in January 2014, chats with team-mate Andre Schurrle against Mainz . De Bruyne is a former Chelsea youngster but never got a real chance to impress at Stamford Bridge . Meanwhile, Yaya Toure has suggested he may be about to step away from international football, after claiming ‘my target is done’. Toure captained the Ivory Coast to glory in this winter’s Africa Cup of Nations, their first major trophy in over two decades, and could now follow his brother Kolo in retiring after suggesting that the Elephants’ new generation should be allowed to flourish. ‘My future?’ he said. ‘You have to wait. Now, my target is done. The time of the youngsters will come soon. We need to let them. ‘It’s always beautiful when everything is going in the right way. I’m delighted with the trophy of 2015. Now I will wait a couple of days before we decide my future.’","Kevin de Bruyne has been in fine form for Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga .

"Manchester United winger Ashley Young hopes his recent form has been good enough to earn him an England recall. Young was tipped to leave Old Trafford last summer but much to many observers' surprise, he has been one of United's best players this season. England manager Roy Hodgson, who names his squad for the upcoming games against Lithuania and Italy on Thursday, was in the crowd at Old Trafford on Sunday to watch the midfielder star in United's 3-0 victory over Tottenham. Ashley Young has played well under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United and wants an England recall . The 30-cap winger has not played for England since September 2013 but his form could lead to a return . Young has not played for his country since September 2013, but he remains hopeful of earning his 31st cap in the near future. 'Fingers crossed I can get myself back into the England team,' the United winger said. 'I've always said that I want to represent my country. It's always an honour to play for England and hopefully I've done enough to get myself back in the squad.' Young's form has sparked rumours he will be offered a new contract. Young takes on Tottenham Hotspur's Nacer Chadli on the wing during United's 3-0 win at Old Trafford . His current deal expires at the end of next season, but he is not concerning himself with the matter at the moment. 'That's down to the chairman and manager to speak about,' he said. 'I'm just concentrating on my football. 'I'm not thinking about the length of my contract. I just want to do well in every game that I'm picked to play.' When asked whether he would consider leaving the club, the 29-year-old said: 'Of course not. I'm a United player and I've got a year left on my contract.' Young also said he is concentrating on his football rather than the prospect of a new United contract .","Ashley Young has been a first-team regular under manager Louis van Gaal .

"Formula One needs teams like Marussia to survive and thrive, rivals said after the tail-enders moved closer to a return to racing. While Caterham appear destined for the scrap heap, or at least the liquidation of their assets, Marussia were named on the official Formula One entry list on Friday after securing their exit from administration. 'I am so pleased... I think it's great to see them back,' Williams technical head Pat Symonds, who joined his current team after a stint at Marussia, told Reuters at the final pre-season test. Marussia were named on the official Formula One entry list after securing their exit from administration . Will Stevens has been confirmed as Manor's first race driver for the upcoming 2015 season . '(Team principal) John (Booth) and (sporting director) Graeme (Lowdon) are two great guys, real racers. I started 35 years ago at Toleman and Toleman was not as professional as Marussia,' he added.

Why would we allow a technically unsafe chassis to race when everybody else has made them safe?' he told Reuters. 'It wasn't that we were against the concession, it was against the fact that it was carte blanche. What were we going to do, allow the 2014 car in for the whole year?

"When Rachel Abbott sold her successful media company for £5 million, she set herself two goals: to embark on a new career as a novelist and to find a dream home in Italy. With no previous writing experience, Rachel knew the former would be tricky – but what she hadn’t counted on was how difficult it would be to crack the latter. Despite viewing countless properties in Tuscany, she and husband John were left disappointed until they discovered a ruined 15th Century monastery in neighbouring Le Marche. Instantly smitten, they swapped their home in the Pennines for one in the Apennines. Dream home: Rachel Abbott and her husband viewed countless properties in Tuscany before discovering the monastery in neighbouring Le Marche . Resurrected: The couple paid just £150,000 for the monastery in 2000. Pictured: the ruins of the monastery . ‘When we went to Italy we knew what we wanted – an ancient building that had been completely modernised,’ says Rachel, 62. ‘There were lots that fitted the bill but something about them didn’t click – they weren’t right. ‘Then, finally, an estate agent took us to this place and we just knew…’ All that remained of the monastery was the chapel – minus the roof – and the oratory. Yet the couple were mesmerised by the building and its location. ‘It had views to the Adriatic in one direction and the mountains in the other,’ says Rachel. ‘We got such a sense of peace and tranquillity.’ The region also excited them. Whereas Tuscany is teeming with wealthy second-home-owners from Britain, Le Marche is the ‘real Italy’ – a place where they could mix with the locals. Back in its glory: After a two-year restoration project, which set the couple back a further £1 million, the monastery was transformed into a modern eight bedroom home . Luxurious: The property also boasts seven en suite bedrooms, a swimming pool and a five-hole golf course. Pictured: the living room . The monastery, near the hilltop town of Treia, cost only £150,000 back in 2000 but a two-year restoration project on which the couple then embarked set them back a further £1 million. Luckily, the old building had survived until the 1960s, so they were able to find photographs, enabling their architects to recreate the style of original. They covered two layers of stone used for the walls in terracotta tiling, just as would have been done in the 15th Century, and windows were installed exactly where they were in the pictures. Behind the facade, the couple built a modern eight-bedroom home with seven en suites, a swimming pool and, for John’s benefit, a five-hole golf course in the five acres of grounds. Price €2.5 million (£1.8 million) Location Near Treia, Le Marche . Bedrooms 8 . Unique features Converted 15th Century monastery, swimming pool, five-hole golf course, five acres . It was only in 2005, when they were fully ensconced in the old monastery, that Rachel turned her attention to her second ambition – to become a successful writer. She had been toying with an idea for a psychological crime thriller for some time, and by 2010 she had finished her first work, Only The Innocent. Then, however, she was faced with another problem: how to find a publisher. Rachel did not fancy the anguish of rejection, so her solution was to self-publish on Amazon instead. At first her novels sold at the rate of only six a week. ‘Then I thought, “This is crazy. I know about marketing, I’m going to make this book sell.” ‘I set up a Twitter account, which now has 12,500 followers, and emailed every blogger and reviewer I could find. I spent countless hours on forums and Facebook. As a result I changed my life.’ Rachel’s subsequent success has been astounding. A first novel is thought to have done well if it sells 3,000 copies – Only The Innocent and follow-up books The Back Road and Sleep Tight have together sold a million. All three have been No 1 bestsellers on Amazon’s Kindle store, and Rachel now outsells many well-established authors. Price tag: The couple have now put the property on the market for €2.5 million (£1.8 million). Pictured: one of the bedrooms . Life in Italy has gone well, too. The couple have made money by letting out the chapel as a venue for upmarket weddings. And with children from previous relationships visiting them, Rachel and John’s house has often been buzzing with guests – just as she had planned. But now they have put their home on the market for €2.5 million – about £1.8 million – and want to move to the Channel Island of Alderney. ‘We already rent a flat there,’ says Rachel. ‘It’s a wonderful place – friendly and virtually crime-free. As much as we love Italy, we now want to buy a property there.’ Uniqueliving.com, 020 7148 6480.

"Ten-man Roma scored a late equalizer to salvage a 1-1 draw with Juventus on Monday and keep alive their faint Serie A title hopes. Former Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita headed in following a free-kick in the 78th minute at the Stadio Olimpico after Carlos Tevez had given Juventus the lead 14 minutes earlier with a curling free-kick. Tevez's goal came shortly after Vasilios Torosidis was shown a second yellow card for a debatable foul on Arturo Vidal, marking the fourth red for Roma in their last four Serie A meetings with Juventus. Seydou Keita rose highest at the back post to head the home side level with just over 10 minutes to play . Keita turns away in celebration after heading his side's equaliser as Gianluigi Buffon pics the ball out the net . The former Barcelona midfielder celebrates with former Arsenal striker Gervinho . The latest red card could revive the controversy that followed the teams' first meeting this season in October, which Juventus won 3-2 with the aid of glaring refereeing errors. The rematch was a physical test that saw 11 yellow cards brandished. It marked Roma's sixth consecutive draw at home and the Giallorossi's seventh stalemate in their last eight matches. 'We needed three points and nothing else,' Keita said. Juventus maintain a nine-point lead over Roma with 13 rounds remaining, while Roma moved four points ahead of third-place Napoli in the race for a direct Champions League berth. 'I'm pleased with what we did until the 70th minute,' Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. 'In the second half we improved a lot, we took the lead, but then we stopped playing. 'The season still has a long way to go and we're going to have to win more matches, especially on the road. We took a step forward but we're still far from reaching our goal.'

Vasilis Torosidis was sent off for Roma and Tevez struck from the resulting free kick . 'Down a goal with 10 men, a reaction like that shows the squad is alive and has personality and character,' Roma coach Rudi Garcia said. 'Now we've got to focus on defending second place. 'The match was very tactical with the goals coming from set pieces.' The match started 15 minutes late to show solidarity for crisis-hit Parma, who are on the verge of financial failure and have had their last two matches postponed indefinitely. Neither side produced clear chances in a tense and physical first-half that saw no shots on goal. The closest either team came to scoring early on came when Kostas Manolas intercepted a cross from Alvaro Morata and nearly redirected it into his own net in the 22nd minute. On the half-hour mark, Keita couldn't take advantage of a close-range opportunity and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon quickly collected the danger. Roma XI (4-3-3): De Sanctis, Torosidis, Manolas, Yanga Mbiwa, Cholevas, Pjanic, De Rossi (Nainggolan 73), Keita, Gervinho, Totti (Iturbe 71), Ljajic (Florenzi 65) Subs not used: Skorupski, Curci, Astori, Spolli, Cole, Paredes, Ucan, Sanabria, Verde .

Juventus winger Roberto Pereyra dribbled past three defenders to set up Tevez in the 42nd but the Argentine's shot was deflected wide. Both sides came out with more aggression for the second-half and a long, angled shot from Vidal went just wide in the 50th. It wasn't until just after the hour mark, though, that the course of the match changed. That was when Torosidis was penalised for what appeared to be a light touch on Vidal. With Juve free-kick specialist Andrea Pirlo missing due to injury, Tevez stepped up, and curled the resulting free-kick over Roma's wall and inside the left post from 22 yards. Roma goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis was left rooted as the ball sailed past him into the net. The home crowd set off flares as they wave flags during the top of the table clash on Monday night . Roma legend Totti makes his way out for the warm-up ahead of kick off at the Olympic Stadium, Rome . It was Tevez's 15th goal of the season, moving one ahead of Inter Milan's Mauro Icardi atop the league scoring chart. Buffon then preserved the lead by pushing wide a header from Manolas in the 72nd. In the 77th, Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini - the recipient of Luis Suarez's bite at the World Cup - was shown a yellow for a foul on Roma substitute Juan Iturbe just outside the area on the right flank. Florenzi's ensuing free kick was redirected by Keita beyond the reach of Buffon with Juventus midfielder Claudio Marchisio claiming the last touch in a failed attempt to deny the goal-bound effort.","Roma held Juventus to a 1-1 draw in the top-of-the-table clash .

The shocking footage shows the helpless macaque monkeys being restrained and force fed with tubes shoved down their throats and up their noses. Chemicals are then pumped into their bodies and the distressing footage shows the panicked animals writhing in agony after being injected. The monkeys are then forced into tiny cages and held in plastic tubes where they can be seen desperately trying to escape as they are held captive. Scroll down for video . Terrified: These macaque monkeys are clearly traumatised as they are experimented on in a laboratory . Tortured: The monkeys are seen having tubes forced up their noses and down their throats to sedate them before the testing . Shocked: The footage shows the monkeys being tested on . The shocking scenes were caught on camera by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), as part of their protest against Air France being the only major carrier still shipping monkeys destined for experiments. Last year, more than 23,000 non-human primates were imported into the United States alone, PETA said. The monkeys are primarily crab-eating macaques, thousands of which are transported from Mauritius to laboratories in the United States and Europe. In the horrific footage, one lab technician even warns his colleague about her brutal treatment as she tries to insert the tube, and says: 'You're going to kill him.' But the woman angrily fires back: 'I'll ram it down his f***ing throat.' Many of the thousands of monkeys shipped from Asia and Africa by Air France were first torn away from their homes and families in the wild. The sensitive and intelligent animals are crammed into small wooden crates and transported inside dark cargo holds for nearly 30 hours, often on passenger flights just below unsuspecting customers. Restrained: With their arms and legs secured, the monkeys are also restrained at the neck to make sure they comply with the laboratory's demands . Panicked: The monkeys are held in plastic tubes where they can be seen desperately trying to escape as they are held captive . Caged: The macaque monkey are also forced into tiny cages where the lab technicians are seen forcefully handling them . When the monkeys reach their final destinations, they are imprisoned in tiny cages and tormented in painful, terrifying – and often deadly – experiments. The footage in the video was taken inside a for-hire laboratory, that conducts toxicity tests on monkeys in which they are force-fed chemicals pesticides and drugs. Previous footage  taken inside a laboratory that conducts toxicity tests showed monkeys being force-fed chemicals, pesticides and drugs. Many of the monkeys are also sold on to private companies and universities that poison, mutilate, cripple and kill them in cruel experiments. Previous videos have also shown monkeys that have suffered from rectal prolapse from the stress of being restrained, blackened lungs, trembling, collapse, bleeding and self-mutilation - including one animal who chewed its finger to the bone . Mimi Bekhechi, UK Director of PETA, said: 'By shipping thousands of monkeys to laboratories, Air France are just as responsible for the mutilation and death of these intelligent, social animals as are the experimenters who wield the drills, scalpels and syringes. Most major airlines in the world – such British Airways, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, United  and dozens of others – refuse to take any part in the industry and prohibit the transportation of primates to laboratories. This week, the founder and managing director of renewable-energy company Ecotricity, Dale Vince sent an angry open letter to Air France calling on them to stop transporting the monkeys. Ecotricity, founded in 1996, began with a single wind turbine and now supplies thousands of people with green electricity. Outraged: Dale Vince, founder of renewable-energy company Ecotricity, has fired off an angry letter to Air France as the company continues to transport the animals . In his letter, Mr Vince points out that Air France are the only remaining major airline that still participate in what he describes as a sickening practice and says that his company will not fly with the airline. He joins a growing list of celebrities – including musician Peter Gabriel and TV presenter Chris Packham - who have spoken out against Air France's carriage of primates. Mr Vince wrote: 'Having previously flown with Air France, I was shocked to learn from my friends at PETA that you are the last airline that continues to ship monkeys to laboratories in the EU and the US. 'These highly intelligent, sensitive animals are either torn away from their homes and families in the wild or bred in squalid conditions on notorious factory farms in Asia and Africa. 'They are then shipped – by your airline – to laboratories, where they face even greater horrors, including being intentionally brain-damaged, shocked, addicted to drugs or force-fed chemicals, before they are finally killed. 'All this suffering, pain and fear occurs for experiments which – as articles in the prestigious publication BMJ have highlighted – fail to translate into effective treatments for humans. 'It truly sickens me to think that these terrified monkeys, crammed into tiny wooden crates for as long as 30 hours before they reach their final destination, are frequently flown in Air France cargo holds – right below the feet of passengers who are completely unaware that purchasing a ticket from your airline means that they are supporting this shameful trade and condemning these wonderful animals to death.' But an Air France spokesman told MailOnline the transportation of animals on its flights - which is dealt with by Air France Cargo - complies with current regulations. The company also holds an authorization to transport animals issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, certifying this fact. The spokesman added: 'The company has established strict standards in terms of comfort and well-being to ensure animals optimal conditions of transport. Primates travel to private research laboratories as well as public research laboratories . 'This highly supervised activity is paramount in the development of research and medicine in France and Europe.' Support: TV presenter Chris Packham (left) and rock star Peter Gabriel (right) have spoken out in the past about Air France's transportation of the animals . Campaign: PETA have called on Air France to stop transporting the monkeys to the laboratories around the world . The animals, and the conditions they are subject to, are also subject to random checks on breeding conditions and use. 'Worldwide, the use of primates for research is crucial in many medical areas,' the spokesman said. 'Research in diseases of the central nervous system, research in autonomic diseases like Parkinsons and Alzheimer's, research in psychological diseases like depression and addiction to alcohol, as well as research in infectious diseases like HIV, malaria, hepatitis C. 'As such, Air France management has received numerous letters of support from various public or private research institutes.'","Horrific footage shows crab-eating macaque monkeys caged for testing .

"Williams and Ferrari are poised to make a good start to the Formula One season after both finished winter testing with another strong showing on Sunday. Valtteri Bottas steered his Williams to the fastest time on the final of 12 days of preseason tests, with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel right behind him at the Barcelona-Catalunya circuit. Bottas clocked an early flying lap of 1 minute, 23.063 seconds. The Finnish driver and teammate Felipe Massa have consistently been among the fastest performers with both in the top two times through the final four days of testing. Valtteri Bottas clocked the fastest time for Williams on the final of 12 days of preseason tests on Sunday . Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Sauber's Felipe Nasr both trailed the Williams driver by less than one second . Vettel catches up with Nico Rosberg of Mercedes during day four of the final Formula One winter testing . Vettel and Sauber's Felipe Nasr were both less than one second slower than Bottas. Nasr put in the most laps of the day with 159 in another promising ride by the newcomer. Whether a revamped Ferrari and confident Williams can challenge champion Mercedes is another issue. Nico Rosberg may have had a subdued final turn behind his Mercedes, but the German team has given no indication of slippage after dominating last season when Rosberg was Lewis Hamilton's only challenger for the title. The Mercedes pair had set the pace on the previous two days, with Rosberg recording the fastest overall lap time in eight days at Montmelo of 1 minute, 22.792 seconds. Toro Rosso's precocious Max Verstappen, who at 17 is the youngest F1 driver in history, again proved steady behind the wheel with the fourth fastest time. He was followed by Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Williams' and Ferrari's impressive displays during testing will give them confidence to challenge Mercedes . Next came Sergio Perez in his first turn behind Force India's new car, right in front of Rosberg. McLaren's Jenson Button, meanwhile, toiled to another session-low 30 laps after only managing two before the lunch break. McLaren has been in a mechanical muddle as it adjusts to its new Honda engines. It was also without driver Fernando Alonso for the final four days of testing while he recovers from a scary crash here last weekend. McLaren only managed to complete 380 laps this preseason. Compare that to Mercedes at 1,274 laps. Or Force India, which in only two and a half days, still racked up 365. Lotus' Pastor Maldonado was the day's slowest driver, and the only one to end up in the barrier when he went off course at curve four. The Australian Grand Prix is in two weeks.","Williams driver Valtteri Bottas recorded the fastest time in Sunday's tests .

"History man Steven Fletcher has spoken of his pride as he ended a six-year international scoring drought to become the first Scotland player to net a hat-trick since 1969. The Sunderland striker hit his treble in the 6-1 triumph over Gibraltar, with two Shaun Maloney penalties and a Steven Naismith strike also helping Hampden recover from the shock of Lee Casciaro’s first-half equaliser for the Group D minnows. Not since Colin Stein bagged four against Cyprus in 1969 had someone scored more than two for the national side. Steven Fletcher celebrates after scoring the second of his three goals against Gibraltar on Sunday . Fletcher (right) curls the ball around the Gibraltar defence to net his third goal of the game at Hampden Park . Regardless of the weak opposition in the Euro 2016 qualifier - albeit the Scots fell victim to the visitors’ first-ever competitive goal to make it 1-1 - Fletcher admitted he was thrilled to have achieved a feat that eluded even the great Kenny Dalglish. ‘I got asked after the Northern Ireland game if I could get a hat-trick and I laughed it off,’ said Fletcher. ‘I said I would be happy with one goal as I haven’t scored for a while. So to get the hat-trick was really pleasing. I was delighted. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba dives to his right but is unable to stop the ball hitting the back of the net . Sunderland forward Fletcher is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against minnows Gibraltar . ‘I’ve been told that it was 46 years since the last Scotland hat-trick and I was shocked. ‘I thought Kenny would have managed it so I am very happy and proud to be part of history. ‘It means a lot. It’s really good and it will be one of the best achievements of my career. ‘I’ve got the match ball and I’ll probably put it in a little glass cabinet. I have another one from my Hibs days when I scored a hat-trick against Gretna, so I will put it next to that. That was my last hat-trick so it will go beside that one.’ Fletcher had last scored for Scotland against Iceland in 2009, and had drawn a blank since his return from a 19-month international exile in 2011. The 28-year-old gave thanks to Gordon Strachan for sticking by him and hopes this boost will help him over the remainder of the Euro 2016 campaign, which continues with a crunch trip to Dublin in June. Fletcher was recently mocked on Twitter for buying a Lamborghini after inconsistent form for his club . Scotland boss Gordon Strachan admitted he is upbeat at his side's position in Group D after their win . ‘It’s been a while since I scored for Scotland and I was aware of that. I get told every day,’ he said. ‘It’s good to get off the mark again, especially after being out for a long time. Was it getting to me? Not really. I was still confident going in to games. ‘To be honest I haven’t had many chances in games but I had a lot against Gibraltar. I could have scored more than three but I was just happy to get the goals. ‘Getting the hat-trick will definitely help my confidence going into the summer. Hopefully I have done enough to stay in the gaffer’s plans and I’m looking forward to it. ‘The manager likes my link-up play. I know people have been saying I haven’t scored but I’ve been doing other parts. ‘He’s praised me for that and if I can keep doing that, and add goals, then I’ll be happy. ‘He’s been a massive support to me. He’s been great with me since I came back into the Scotland squad and I owe a lot to him.’","Scotland beat Gibraltar 6-1 in their European qualifier on Saturday .

"Wayne Rooney insists England are slowly rebuilding their international credibility after a disastrous World Cup and that opponents will be wary of them despite their failure in Brazil. England have won seven straight games since the 0-0 draw against Costa Rica, but they face a tough test in Turin on Tuesday when they take on Italy, who beat them in Brazil. The England captain insists that the team is making progress under Roy Hodgson, even though the victories have been recorded against less exacting opposition. England captain Wayne Rooney is delighted with the progress the team has made since the World Cup . England captain Rooney (left) scored his 47th international goal in the 4-0 win against Lithuania . Since England's 0-0 draw with Costa Rica at the World Cup, Roy Hodgson's team have won seven from seven . Rooney said: ‘After the World Cup we spoke and knew it would take time but we are gradually getting better. 'You are seeing the results on the pitch but there is still a long way to go. I’m not saying we are happy with this level. We will still need to improve before hopefully getting to France in 2016 but there is time to improve. ‘I think, looking at the team we have got, when we lose the ball we go and win it back quickly. What we have been working on is pressing as a team from the back. ‘There are times when we have to tuck in as a team and then hit teams on the break and we have so much pace in the team, which players don’t like playing against. ‘Teams will be a bit wary about that when they play us because of the pace and ability we have. ‘I am one of the older guys in the dressing room and I have responsibility that I am enjoying as captain and with the experience I have I hope to pass that on,’ he added. Rooney admitted he is excited at the prospect of becoming England's all-time top scorer . Rooney has scored 47 goals for England and Sir Bobby Charlton holds the record with 49 . After scoring against Lithuania, Rooney is two goals short of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time goalscoring record for the national team. And he admits he thinks about becoming England’s all-time top scorer. ‘It is always at the back of my mind, there is no getting away from it. It could be on Tuesday, it could be in the summer, or it could be after that,’ he said.","Wayne Rooney is pleased with England's World Cup response .

"Misfiring Inter Milan forward Lukas Podolski has moved to defend himself as he reacted angrily to critics of his recent performances in Serie A, following a loan switch from Arsenal in January. The Germany international has failed to score in his 11 appearances so far for the Nerazzurri and has come under intense scrutiny from the Italian press, with some outlets even branding him as the worst signing of the season. But Podolski feels that these attacks are unfair and counter productive to him rediscovering his form. 'People keep bringing up how the Italian media looks at me,' he said, 'What can I do about it? Should I just dig myself into the ground and give up playing football?' Inter Milan forward Lukas Podolski has hit back at critics of his performances since joining the club . Podolski joined Inter on loan from Arsenal in January but has so far struggled to make an impact in Serie A . While Podolski might be struggling at club level, his international career has suffered no such dip. The 29-year-old came off the bench to score his 48th goal for Germany, a dramatic late equaliser in their 2-2 draw with Australia on Wednesday. That goal has now placed Podolski third in his country's all-time leading scoring charts and he is keen to carry on being part of the international set-up. 'I have always been part of the team and I hope this will continue to be the case,' he said.

"Alexis Sanchez has been training at Arsenal's London Colney training base with Chile ahead of their game against Brazil in London, but has been joined by some unlikely new team-mates: his dogs. Sanchez's Chile meet Brazil in a repeat of last summer's World Cup second-round clash at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, and the Arsenal forward has been making the most of his home comforts between training sessions with his international colleagues. In what seems a slightly unusual way of preparing for a game, the 26-year-old has been taking his dogs around the pitches during the international break. Alexis Sanchez is pictured with his two dogs Atom and Humber during training with Chile on Saturday . The Chile star joined his two dogs for a jog around Arsenal's London Colney base ahead of facing Brazil . Dog-loving Sanchez's canine duo Atom and Humber were pictured accompanying their owner on a jog around the north London base. Sunday's South American showdown at the Emirates pits Sanchez against his former Barcelona team-mate Neymar, who he still holds a close friendship with. The pair last met at the World Cup, with Neymar's Brazil prevailing on penalties. Sanchez had scored Chile's first-half equaliser in Belo Horizonte but missed in the shoot-out before Neymar sealed the win for the hosts. The game against Brazil at the Emirates Stadium reunites Sanchez with his former team-mate Neymar . The pair spent a year together at Barcelona before Sanchez was sold on to Arsenal last summer .

"Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo is currently Europe's 29th best forward in 2015 while Barcelona's Lionel Messi ranks first, a study has revealed. CIES Football Observatory have compiled the best-performing players in five positions this year, crunching the numbers by focusing on shooting, chances created, take-ons, distribution, recovery and rigour. The rankings throw up  unexpected results with Manchester City's Gael Clichy crowned the best full back, and Arsenal's Mesut Ozil the joint-top attacking midfielder with Chelsea's Eden Hazard. Cristiano Ronaldo ranks 29th in a table of the best forwards in the top five European leagues in 2015 . Real Madrid and Portugal star Ronaldo played for his country in the weekend win over Serbia . CIES Football Observatory Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are: . Barcelona and Argentina star Lionel Messi ranks first in CIES Football Observatory's statistics . Ronaldo has scored just six goals in La Liga this year after winning the Ballon d'Or in mid-January, and rival Messi has swept the Real Madrid forward aside with 19 as Barcelona sit top of the table by four points. Messi, with the top score of 100 in the rankings, is followed by Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben (92), Wolfsburg's Bas Dost (77) and Barcelona team-mate Luis Suarez (71). Then come the Barclays Premier League's top scorers. Chelsea's Diego Costa (61) and Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane (57) have 19 goals apiece, and rank fifth and sixth as a result. Kane shares sixth spot with Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus (57) as he continues to surprise at White Hart Lane, having earned his senior England debut against Lithuania.

"Endless hours of rigorous training, countless repetitive rehearsals to perfect your technique and you fluff your lines on the big stage. A horrifying scene no athlete wants to be part of. However that's what happened to Russia's unfortunate skeleton slider Elena Nikitina, when she overshot the mark and completely missed her sled in her very first run of the World Championships in Germany. At the height of her speed in front of an eagerly awaiting crowd, the poor Russian took a tumble and slid down the hill further than a certain Sol Campbell tackle on Ivica Olic when England played Croatia in the Euro 2008 qualifiers. It was all going to plan as Elena Nikitina began her first run in the Skeleton World Championships in Germany .

"Manchester United's No 1 transfer target Mats Hummels has left the door open to a move to Old Trafford though admits he is still undecided about his future. The World Cup-winning Borussia Dortmund centre back has been tracked by United ever since Louis van Gaal took over last summer and the club are preparing a summer bid for the German. Dortmund won back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012 and reached the 2013 Champions League final but are currently 10th in the German table and in danger of missing out on European football altogether next season. Manchester United target Mats Hummels has admitted he could be keen on a move away from Dortmund . The Germany international has been stringently linked with a move to Man United during the past few years . United manager Louis van Gaal wants to bolster his defensive options during the summer transfer window . And Hummels, 26, admitted to Kicker magazine that he is mulling over his future. 'Some days I think I would definitely like to move abroad but then, other days, I think I don't fancy it at all,' he said when asked of United's interest. 'Basically, I think moving abroad would be good for my professional and personal well-being. Eventually, I'd like to leave the Bundesliga. 'I have had many conversations with the leaders of Dortmund, where I know I am a big part of the team, but I am yet to make a decision about my future. 'I'm being open about this because I'm not a fan of those who claim they are staying but, behind the scenes, have actually secretly agreed a transfer away from their current club. 'I will do what is best for my career and what I would like to do. Everyone knows how much I love it at Dortmund but I also want to make sure I'm part of a strong team with powerful players.'

"We are constantly being nagged to floss, with dental experts  claiming it can add years to our life. But according to one dentist, most of us have been doing it incorrectly for years. Dr Carlos Meulener, a  dentist from New Jersey, has released a video showing the best way to floss teeth in order to have the healthiest smile. ‘Brushing is great but it’s not enough - you need flossing to remove the bacteria between the teeth,’ he says. Dr Calos Meulener has released a video showing his 'one minute flossing technique' which he says helps rid the mouth of bacteria. He is pictured holding floss between two thumbs, about an inch apart . He advises taking a piece of wax dental floss and winding it up with the index fingers, but not so tightly that it hurts. When flossing the upper row of teeth, put the thumbs around an inch apart from each other on the floss. Dr Meulener said: ‘The reason why most people have a problem flossing is that they try to get too much floss in their mouths. ‘The way to control it is to use your thumbs for your upper teeth and middle fingers for your lower teeth. ‘Put that amount of floss between these fingers so you can manipulate it easily from one side to the next.’ Then, put the floss between two teeth and floss in and up and down motion along the teeth, rather than a sawing motion from side to side. 1. Take a piece of wax dental floss and put each thumb about and inch apart . 2. Put the floss between the upper teeth . 3. Keeping the back thumb stationary, move the front thumb up and down to floss the tooth . 4. Do not floss in a 'sawing motion' - back and forth - but up and down, rubbing the floss up and down the tooth . 5. Repeat using the middle fingers for the bottom teeth . ‘We’re flossing the walls of one tooth and the other tooth and polishing the bacteria off those surfaces,’ Dr Meulener said. One thumb should stay stationary while the other thumb is moved up and down, creating the flossing motion. Similarly, when flossing the lower teeth, one middle finger should stay stationary while the other is moved, it in order to manipulate the floss so it rubs up and down against the inside of the tooth. Dr Meulener says this method, which takes just a minute, is the best and most efficient way to floss. He said: ‘It takes a minute and it really makes a difference to dental health.’ In the past, studies have shown that flossing teeth can prevent the build up of plaque, which sticks to teeth and causes irritation, inflammation to gums known as gum disease. Gum disease causes bad breath, bleeding gums and, if untreated, cavities, receding gums and tooth loss. Worldwide, 15- 20 per cent of adults aged 35-44 years have severe gum disease, which may result in the loss of teeth. He advises using two thumbs for the upper teeth, or two middle fingers for the lower teeth, and flossing in an 'up and down' motion rather than 'sawing' from side to side . In the UK, the The Adult Dental Health Survey of 2009 found 47 per cent of  the population had moderate to severe gum disease - around 30 million people. Research shows losing teeth could signal a higher risk of suffering heart disease and diabetes. Swedish researchers found people with fewer teeth and bleeding gums were more likely to have a range of cardiovascular problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They found poor dental hygiene and bleeding gums could allow up to 700 different types of bacteria to get into the bloodstream, which increases the risk of a heart attack regardless of how fit and healthy the person is. Previous studies have also linked bad teeth to Alzheimer's, heart disease, strokes, diabetes, lung disease and even miscarriage and premature birth.","Video features Dr Carlos Meulener, a dentist from New Jersey, .

"Roger Goodell has hinted that London could be set for more NFL games in the near future. With three International Series games scheduled for the second season in succession, 2016 may see a further increase, according to the 56-year-old NFL Commissioner. Speaking to Peter King of TheMMQB.com on the eve of the league's owners meeting in Pheonix, Goodell said: 'Yeah, we’re looking at more games.' The NFL wanted to host more games in England this year, but were hampered by the rugby World Cup, which sees Pennyhill Park - a favourite haunt of visiting NFL teams - booked up by  England and Wembley hosting two games during rugby union's showpiece event.

First and foremost is the passion of the fans—they want more. … What we’re getting from authorities is that, “We’d love to have a permanent presence here.” Stadiums are another big part of it,' Goodell to King. Goodell also spoke about the Deflategate saga, saying the saga is rumbling to a close two months after the NFL began their investigation. The NFL is investigating the New England Patriots after 11 of 12 game balls they used in their 45-7 win over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC title game were found to be underinflated. And Goodell said he expects to get the final report 'soon' from independent investigator Ted Wells. 'I think that if you’re going to be thorough, it takes time. You’re having to meet with a lot of people. I guess it’s always too long, because you want to get to that issue and deal with it. It’s important not to exert any pressure to short-circuit or do anything other than be fair and transparent,' he said.","For the second year in succession, Wembley is hosting three NFL games .

"For Steve Clarke, there were no apologies, no guilt and no sense of remorse. He deemed the nine changes before their defeat at Watford necessary if Reading are to be ready for Bradford in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Monday night. Of those nine, four were making full debuts. Discounting Simon Cox, the rest of the Royals side had made just 34 Championship starts between them this season. Whatever Clarke says, this was an unwrapped gift to a team chasing promotion to the Premier League. But the manager must be well down the list when blame is apportioned. Jem Karacan's Reading team-mates gather to congratulate the midfielder after his goal against Watford . Steve Clarke played a decidedly under strength side at Vicarage Road that will completely change on Monday . Reading's Pavel Pogrebnyak and Bradford's Stephen Darby clash in the 0-0 draw that forced Monday's FA Cup replay at the Madejski Stadium, with both sides nursing their squads in the lead-up to the fixture . It is the fault of broadcasters that he had just 48 hours between leaving Vicarage Road on Saturday and kicking off against Phil Parkinson’s Bradford on Monday evening. Domestic cup fixtures cannot be played on the same night as Champions League games and, as such, there is no way around this ludicrous situation. Clarke is expected to name a completely fresh XI at the Madejski Stadium, while Parkinson, who made six changes of his own side for the 1-1 draw at Notts County, will mix and match, too. Bradford had five players who retained their place from the Cup game. Reading had none. Fifteen changes was the sum total and for one reason only. Clarke is dealing with a ludicrous 48-hour turnaround between playing Watford and Bradford . These will be two teams going hell for leather in a competition they have prioritised. Their tedious goalless draw at Valley Parade last week may have been wretched to watch, but this tie is harking back to the FA Cup’s old days, neither side giving an inch. They could not bear losing at this stage. Reading supporters won’t remember the 4-1 defeat at Watford in a decade’s time, but a day out at Wembley, taking on holders Arsenal, would stick in the memory should they progress. The Royals have nothing to play for in the league. They are safe and will not trouble the second tier’s play-offs. Almen Abdi (centre) scored the opener against a Reading side with nothing to play for in the league . And club captain Jem Karacan, who made only his second appearance for the club since September 2013 because of injury, backed his manager’s decision to ring the changes. ‘The gaffer has to bear the replay in mind,’ said Karacan, who scored his side’s consolation as Watford ran riot with strikes from Almen Abdi, Matej Vydra, Troy Deeney and Fernando Forestieri. ‘If you put a team out that doesn’t win at Watford you get criticised, but if you don’t win on Monday you get criticised as well so it’s a catch-22 for the gaffer. ‘Playing at Wembley is one of those things that you just can’t describe. The feeling we had when we went there before (the 2011 Championship play-off final loss to Swansea) will always stay with me.’ Reading's Yakubu Aiyegbeni passes under pressure as his side struggled against the promotion hopefuls . Parkinson has had a trickier balancing act. Bradford are three points beneath the League One play-offs and will have two games in hand once Tuesday’s programme of fixtures is complete. He couldn’t afford to make changes quite so wholesale for their trip to Nottingham, knowing promotion is by no means out of the question. Those in West Yorkshire will think of two years ago when they were capable of juggling that fairytale journey to the Capital One Cup final and the league campaign, which ended in promotion from League Two. Reading will doubtless have the fresher side tonight and Parkinson knows his team blew their best chance of reaching the semi-finals. But they feed off adrenaline. Just ask Chelsea and Sunderland. Two games in three days will not faze this collection of loanees and cast-offs. After all, Arsenal await. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Maybe, just maybe, Ronnie Moore can inspire Hartlepool to Football League survival. Marooned at the foot of League Two for months, all looked lost. The 1-0 win at Morecambe - thanks to an Andy Parrish own goal - was their first three points on the road since October, their first clean sheet away from Victoria Park for 12 months and puts them within two results of safety. No wonder defender Scott Harrison was close to tears in the dressing room afterwards. WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE .","Reading were battered 4-1 by Watford on Saturday at Vicarage Road .

"Torpedo Moscow must play two home matches behind closed doors because of the racist abuse aimed at Zenit St Petersburg forward Hulk in Sunday's Premier League match.

The club were sanctioned in September for racist chants directed at Dynamo Moscow's Christopher Samba, playing one match with part of their stadium closed. Torpedo supporters were also found guilty in November of aiming monkey chants at Rostov's black players which resulted in the club having to play three home fixtures with part of the stadium closed. Torpedo were made to play with part of their stadium closed for one match after fans aimed abuse at Christopher Samba back in September . Earlier on Wednesday, Premier League president Sergei Pryadkin vowed to hit offenders hard. 'This is not the main problem facing us but racism certainly is a problem,' said Pryadkin. 'In some countries where football is very well developed this problem occurs and racism happens every week. Even in England it is a problem. 'We will take responsibility for what has happened. Together with the Russian Football Union and the Sports Ministry we will work to cut out this problem,' added Pryadkin.

"After a NFL season to forget, Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson celebrated his 30th birthday in style  with an extravagant Arabic-themed party in his home state of Texas. Peterson put speculation about where he’ll be playing next season behind him and took his own life into his hands as he entered his birthday bash on the back of camel. The elaborate celebrations included costumes, an ice bar, a cake shaped like a middle eastern palace and a special guest appearance by actor Jamie Foxx who can be seen hamming it up on the dance-floor and in the DJ booth in mobile phone footage that has since appeared on social media. Scroll down for video . Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson celebrated his 30th birthday in style on Saturday by entering the extravagant Arabic-themed party on the back of a camel . Peterson, posing above with one birthday guest, celebrated turning 30 on Saturday with a no-expense-spared party in his home state of Texas . The big 3-0 typically signals the beginning of the end for an NFL running back, but Peterson didn’t let that spoil his fun on Saturday night. The Vikings' all-time leading rusher appeared in only one game in 2014 because of the child abuse case that involved injuries to his four-year-old son. He was indicted on September 11, 2014, by a Montgomery County, Texas, grand jury on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child that occurred on May 18, 2014. He is accused of beating his four-year-old son with a tree branch, which Peterson consistently referred to as a 'switch', causing severe welts and bleeding on the child's back, legs, buttocks, genitals and ankles. In their initial response, the Vikings deactivated Peterson for a single game. Peterson’s 2014 NFL season was over after arbitrator Shyam Das ruled in favor of the NFL on November 18, 2014, saying, 'the league can keep Adrian Peterson on the commissioner’s exempt list,' effectively terminating the Minnesota Vikings running back's season. Actor Jamie Foxx was one of the guests in attendance for Peterson's party and he can be seen hamming in up on the dancefloor and in the DJ booth in cellphone footage that has appeared on social media since . The elaborate celebrations included costumes, an ice bar and a cake shaped like a middle eastern palace . His suspension, ordered by Commissioner Roger Goodell through at least April 15, was tabled after a federal judge knocked down the NFL arbitrator's denial of Peterson's appeal. Peterson was returned to the special exempt list, pending further developments on the legal front. He has three years remaining on his Vikings contract and is owed $12.75 million next season, but relations between the two parties are currently described as tenuous. While team officials have said they want Peterson back, he has questioned their commitment in the wake of the suspension controversy. The Vikings' all-time leading rusher appeared in only one game in 2014 because of the child abuse case that involved injuries to his 4-year-old son . In an interview with ESPN last month, he called the collaboration between the Vikings and the NFL to place him on paid leave the week after he was indicted in Texas 'an ambush.' Peterson's agent, Ben Dogra, said on Friday that he declined an invitation from Vikings general manager Rick Spielman to meet over dinner during the NFL owners meetings in Arizona next week. The Texan has featured in six Pro Bowl selections, run for 10,190 yards and scored 86 touchdowns since joining the NFL. He has only played for the Vikings since his league debut in 2007. In 2012, Peterson rushed for 2,097 yards, finishing nine yards shy of breaking Eric Dickerson's all-time record for running yardage in a single NFL season.

"Kimi Raikkonen was left to bemoan bad timing as the reason why he faces an uphill struggle to claim a podium finish in Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix. Throughout practice at the Sepang International Circuit Raikkonen had suggested a top-three position was on the cards as he emerged the closest rival to Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. But come qualifying, and the start of the second session with a storm brewing overhead, the Finn found himself out of position in the queue to take to the track and set a banker lap.

With team-mate Sebastian Vettel at the head of the line of cars, the four-times champion eventually emerged quickest in Q2 as the drivers only had time for one hot lap before the heavens opened. That lap proved to be a mad scramble from which Raikkonen could only qualify 11th, with Sauber's Marcus Ericsson his undoing. 'I tried to overtake Ericsson because he was in front of me,' said Raikkonen. 'But at the last corner I couldn't slow down because there were other people pushing me forward. 'In my mind we just got the timing wrong. That's how it ended up.' Television pictures of qualifying showed lightning and stormy conditions approaching the circuit . Dark clouds gather in the background at the Sepang International Circuit during the qualifying session . Raikkonen, though, opted not to point an accusing finger at his team, adding: 'I don't know if it helps to blame anyone. 'It's easy to say afterwards we should have been waiting behind one another, but the end result is this and whatever we will do now will not change it. It is unfortunate. 'Obviously, we have made our life very difficult, so I have no idea what we will do tomorrow. We will try our best and see where we end up.'

The car felt good in both dry and wet conditions at the end. 'I'm reasonably happy, and also the long runs look good on practice days, so we should be in good shape, but we know they (Mercedes) are difficult to beat.

"The Premier League will break extraordinary new ground this weekend when fans are taken inside the dressing room ahead of Arsenal vs Liverpool. In a first for top-flight football, both pre-match teamtalks by the captains will be streamed live to the world from the Emirates on Saturday. As they bid to keep track with the latest technology, the Premier League has convinced both clubs to take part. But it was only rubber-stamped last night after the rivals agreed to a strict number of rules that will ensure neither side is left at a disadvantage. Per Mertesacker and Jordan Henderson will give teamtalks in the dressing room that will be broadcast live . Although the teamtalks by Per Mertesacker and Jordan Henderson will not be screened on BT Sport - who are covering the match live on TV - fans who own a smartphone will be able to tune in. New social media tool Periscope - which was launched last week - will host both teamtalks as it bids to break into the sports market. Arsenal and Liverpool were initially reluctant to take part in the broadcast - but Premier League chiefs have assured them it will not compromise their attempts to win the match. Although Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers - who famously starred in the Being Liverpool documentary on Channel Five - was willing to take part, his counterpart Arsene Wenger was hesistant over fears of giving away his side's secrets.

"Jonny Evans' wife, Helen, had to leap to the defence of the Manchester United defender in a rather awkward phone-in conversation with celebrity Arsenal fan Piers Morgan. Mrs Evans, a presenter on the club's MUTV channel, dealt with the rather unwanted and uncomfortable call on Thursday night while sat alongside former Red Devils defender David May. As she previewed United's FA Cup sixth-round tie at home to Arsenal, Morgan shifted the conversation on to her husband's 'spitgate' (a term used by Morgan) incident with Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse last week. Helen Evans has defended her husband, Jonny, during a phone-in conversation with Piers Morgan . Evans, a presenter on Manchester United's TV channel MUTV, spoke to the celebrity Arsenal fan on Thursday . Jonny Evans (left) appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle's Papiss Cisse, who then retaliates . Evans and Cisse clashed near the halfway line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Manchester United defender Evans received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident . Tempers threatened to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gathered following the incident . Arsenal (h) March 9, FA Cup*; . Tottenham (h) March 15 . Liverpool (a) March 22 . Aston Villa (h) April 4 . Man City (h) April 12 . Chelsea (a) April 18  (*Possible replay or FA Cup semi-final could mean he is available for the Chelsea game) A disciplinary panel ruled that Evans and Newcastle rival  Cisse had spat at each other in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor during the St James' Park clash. Cisse was banned for seven games (he was given an extra match as it was a second suspension of the season) by the Football Association, while Evans was handed a six-match ban - despite fiercely denying the charge. And the 27-year-old's wife reiterated his stance when Morgan quizzed her over his innocence. 'That's definitely the case [he had no idea about the spitting incident], he didn't even know that he had got spat back at until after the game when he had watched the footage,' she told Morgan. 'People can believe what they want but that's the truth. 'Jonny spat on the floor and it was obviously near [Papiss] Cisse so unfortunately it was just the way that the camera looked at it and saw it and also the way that Cisse saw it, but what can you do.' Evans, nee McConnell, met the defender shortly after she landed her dream job for the club's official TV channel. There is no right of appeal so Evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three-man panel . The couple started dating shortly after in 2011 and got married two years later at Clough Presbyterian Church in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Last year they became parents for the first time following the birth of baby Lottie in May. Her husband's ban, which starts against the Gunners on Monday, could see him miss the FA Cup semi-final in April should United overcome their north London rivals. However, Morgan feels Louis van Gaal's cup run will end at Old Trafford before boldly predicting a comfortable win for the visitors and more disciplinary problems for the Red Devils in a tongue-in-cheek comment. 'It's my usual confident prediction 5-0 Arsenal, [Olivier] Giroud hat-trick,' he added on MUTV. 'I'm also predicting at least three members of United's team to be sent off for spitting.' As well as quizzing Mrs Evans, Morgan boldly predicted a 5-0 win for his beloved Arsenal on Monday night . Piers Morgan: 'Have you got any comments about spitgate?' Helen Evans: 'Now I thought you might start with that one. No comments to make everything is in the statement Piers, I don't need to anything else.' PM: 'I was just curious whether that Helen who knows Jonny [Evans], obviously better than the rest of us, that when he says he had absolutely no idea he had even be seen spitting whether she thought that was the case? HE: 'That's definitely the case [he had no idea about the spitting incident], he didn't even know that he had got spat back at until after the game when he had watched the footage,' she told Morgan. People can believe what they want but that's the truth.' PM: 'I certainly believe you but what I wonder, when you see the footage back, if you were [Papiss] Cisse and you watch that video back you could see why he felt that he been deliberately spat on, right?' HE: 'Oh yeah. Jonny spat on the floor and it was obviously near  Cisse so unfortunately it was just the way that the camera looked at it and saw it and also the way that Cisse saw it, but what can you do.' HE: 'Thanks for talking to us tonight.' PM: 'Well you haven't asked me for my prediction yet.' HE: 'Yes go for it.' PM: 'It's my usual confident prediction 5-0 Arsenal, [Olivier] Giroud hat-trick. Enjoy your evening.' HE: 'Well we're predicting 8-2!' PM: 'I'm also predicting at least three members of United's team to be sent off for spitting.'","Manchester United host Arsenal in their FA Cup tie on Monday night .

"Karim Benzema says Brazil were far superior than France as the five time World Cup winners cruised to victory in Paris. In a repeat of the 1998 World Cup final – which France won 3-0 – Brazil ran out 3-1 winners at the Stade de France. France took the lead thanks to a Raphael Varane header but Brazil hit back with goals from Oscar, Neymar and Luiz Gustavo. France captain Karim Benzema was left frustrated with the defeat by Brazil . And France skipper Benzema says his side can have no complaints over the result. He said: 'A defeat is never good. It was a tough game, high level. They were better than us, even if we put them in danger in spurts. We have not had enough risk-taking. 'To celebrate in these kinds of games, you have to be thorough from the first to the 95th minute.' Oscar scored Brazil's first goal as they came from behind to beat France 3-1 . Neymar also got on the scoresheet in the Stade de France . France play Denmark in a friendly in Saint-Etienne on Sunday, and Benzema was relieved to have a chance to rectify the mistakes made against Brazil so quickly. 'What's nice is that there is a game on Sunday and that should enable us to erase this defeat.' And France goalkeeper Steve Mandanda agreed with his captain. He said: 'They were superior, period. They were very solid at the back, and offensively as well. 'We did some good things, by opening the scoring and then having opportunities to come back. 'Good things like the worst should be analyzed. We must use this match to see what we are missing.'","Brazil beat France 3-1 in Paris in a repeat of the 1998 World Cup final .

"El Salvador players and fans were left bemused ahead of their friendly against Argentina when, instead of pumping out their national anthem, the stadium's sound system instead played the anthem of Kazakhstan. The Central American minnows, ranked 89th in the world by FIFA, were facing the World Cup runners-up at Washington DC's FedEx Field on Saturday but their large travelling support were unimpressed as the stadium DJ's mistake became apparent ahead of kick-off. Rather than the familiar 'Himno Nacional de El Salvador', staff at the stadium which usually hosts the NFL's Washington Redskins played out 'Menin Qazaqstanim'. El Salvador players were left bemused when the Kazakhstan national anthem was played instead of theirs . The players, stood proud with hands on their chests, look confused by the error, glancing around . Having listened to the Kazakh anthem, the Salvadorans head for the handshakes with their heads down . Supporters instead the stadium had prepared a huge banner for the anthem but ended up booing it . El Salvador (5-4-1): Carillo; Flores, Mendoza, Molina, Renderos (Ceren 88), Larin; Alvarez, Ceren, Menjivar (Punyed 76), Alas (Santamaría 67); Bonilla (Burgos 59) Argentina (4-2-3-1): Guzman; Zabaleta, Musacchio, Funes Mori, Orban; Pereyra, Banega; Di Maria (Mancuello 73), Lavezzi, Tevez (Pastore 78); Higuain . Scorers: Renderos OG 54, Mancuello 88 . The players stood out on the pitch, with their hands across their chests looked confused at first, before becoming increasingly frustrated as boos rang out on to the field. The supporters - who had prepared a 'Vamos Selecta, Houston' flag to be carried over the crowd - reacted furiously. Washington is home to one of the largest Salvadoran communities outside of Central America and their followers outnumbered the Argentine support. To make things worse, El Salvador fell to an expected defeat against an Argentina side who left out Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero. The distance from El Salvador to Kazakhstan is 7,909 miles, a fairly big mistake for the stadium staff to make . Argentina players celebrate after Federico Mancuello (left) scored a goal during the international friendly . Lionel Messi was not required by Argentina in their 2-0 win, and neither was Manchester City's Sergio Aguero .

"Everton midfielder Ross Barkley accepts his form this season has fallen below his best but insists he is not feeling the pressure. The 21-year-old's fortunes on the pitch have mirrored that of his team as neither have been able to reproduce the standards of last season, when a brilliant campaign saw the Toffees finish fifth after being in contention for the Champions League for a long period. Barkley has struggled to rediscover the form which made him such an integral part of the team's success but he is working hard to get back to his best. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley has admitted he has failed to replicate last season's performances . Barkley, pictured scoring against Newcastle, has netted just two goals so far this season . 'From my point of view I haven't done as well as I know I can, but things like this happen,' said the England international. 'You have to go through bad days to get to the great days you have in your career. 'Everything's a learning curve. We haven't been going through the best period at the moment but we're going to come through this and be really good at the end of it. 'I don't feel pressure. I believe in myself and I know what I can do. It's not me feeling pressure, it's just me putting pressure on myself if I don't do my best, and I know I can do better. The 21-year-old (right) is expected to start against Italy after coming on in the second half against Lithuania . 'I just focus on getting better every day, putting things right in training and then hopefully what I'm doing right in training I'm going to show in games as well.' Barkley, when he has started, has found himself switching positions regularly and has not been given a long spell behind the centre forward where he was most effective last season. Many observers appear to have pencilled him in for a deeper midfield role but he does not feel that will get the best out of him. 'I'm a striker,' he said. 'I feel I can have my greatest impact there because I'm free to roam around the pitch, take players on, have shots and create chances.'","Ross Barkley has struggled for form during the course of the season .

"We've divided the Premier League into teams from the north and south of England - with Welsh side Swansea included in the south. Joe Bernstein had the choice to pick any players from the north, in any formation, with no limit on how many from each club. Rob Draper picked his South XI on Monday, and you can read that here. Here's how we split the clubs: . South . Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, QPR, Southampton, Swansea City, Spurs, West Brom, West Ham United . North . Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland . North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England. But without dipping into the political allegiances, property prices and weather, we're sticking to the ultimate debating point – football. This week we are starting a new North vs South debate - who would you pick and who would win? In the NBA, each season they stage an All-Star match that pits the best from the West against the cream of the East. And wouldn't it be fascinating if the Premier League adopted a similar event? Yesterday, Rob Draper selected his South XI. Here, Joe Bernstein reveals his North XI - plus seven subs. Then on Wednesday, we'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at Football Manager. And, as always, we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team... Goalkeeper: Joe Hart (Manchester City) Tough call between David de Gea and Hart, but the City stopper is better at organising his defenders and more commanding in the air. And, as he showed against Lionel Messi, he can stop a penalty too. Right back: Daryl Janmaat (Newcastle United) Been outstanding this season and Toon fans will have an anxious wait this summer to see if a bigger club snaps him up. Janmaat can also play in the centre of the defence but he's most threatening down the right where his crosses would cause havoc to any rearguard. Creative player too. Centre half: Ryan Shawcross (Stoke City) Would surely have been an England regular if he played for a more glamorous club than Stoke. Better than Gary Cahill or Phil Jagielka, less injury-prone than Phil Jones. This team is so crammed with attacking talent, the two centre-halves are in purely to defend. And they're good at that. Joe Hart has been superb in the league and showed against Barcelona he can do it in Europe too . Daryl Janmaat has been outstanding this season and Newcastle fans will have an anxious wait this summer . Ryan Shawcross pictured scoring for Stoke City against Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium . Centre half: Martin Skrtel (Liverpool) Totally fearless, he keeps putting his head and body in the way of danger - just what you want from a centre-half. Useful in both penalty areas at set-pieces too, he gets his fair share of goals for a defender. Him and Shawcross wouldn't let anything pass, allowing the two full backs to push up. Left back: Leighton Baines (Everton) Just gets better and better with age. Fantastic at set-pieces, both delivery and shooting, and so calm on the ball. Has got over the disappointment of not joining Manchester United and it's no coincidence Everton hit their dodgy patch when he was out of the team injured. Right wing: Raheem Sterling (Liverpool) Showed at the last World Cup he has now taken over Wayne Rooney's mantle as the best player in the England team and it's hard to believe he is still only 20. The one player in Roy Hodgson's squad that you think could actually make it with Real Madrid or Barcelona, he is quick, skilful, has natural balance and courage on and off the ball . Liverpool's totally fearless defender Martin Skrtel (right) squares up to David de Gea at Anfield recently . Everton's Leighton Baines just seems to get better and better with age in the demanding Premier League . Raheem Sterling has become an brilliant performer for Liverpool this season as they look to tie him down . Central midfield: Michael Carrick (Manchester United) People ask why Manchester United's form has improved in the last couple of matches. Simple, Michael Carrick is back from injury and making the team tick. Always seems to know when to play the right pass, and makes average players around him look good and the good players look great . Central midfield: James McCarthy (Everton) If this team has steel down the middle in Skrtel and Shawcross, and stealth in Carrick, McCarthy adds speed. He can cover ground to make tackles and when he needs to use the ball, the Irishman is neat and tidy. One of Roberto Martinez's best signings and no wonder bigger clubs want him. Left midfield: David Silva (Manchester City) With Leighton Baines behind him, Silva wouldn't have to hug the left-hand touchline like a traditional winger, he would start from there, link up with Baines at times but also drift inside and drop grenades infield. On his day, a hugely talented and influential player. Juan Mata is rightly getting plaudits at the moment, in Spain they say Silva is better. Michael Carrick has returned from injury and is making Manchester United tick for manager Louis van Gaal . James McCarthy, pictured scoring for Everton against Newcastle United at Goodison Park, makes the XI . David Silva (above) and Manchester City team-mate Sergio Aguero make it into our North XI . Striker: Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) Has taken over Luis Suarez's mantle as the best player in the league. Absolutely lethal against any type of opposition as his hat-trick against Bayern Munich showed in the Champions League. May be asked to leave the penalties to Leighton Baines though after his fluffed effort in the Nou Camp. Striker: Wayne Rooney (captain) (Manchester United) Rooney has often formed good strike partnerships with players who are of similar build and technique, Henrik Larsson springs to mind in his brief spell at Manchester United, so I have no doubts he would be prolific with Sergio Aguero. I can see them being on the same wavelength and Rooney would spot the Argentine's runs early. Wayne Rooney captains our North XI for his outstanding form for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United . Subs . Asmir Begovic (Stoke): Another in the Hart mould; big, commanding, won't leave his defenders alone. Pablo Zabaleta (Manchester City): If you need someone to see out the final 20 minutes, he's perfect. Phil Jones (Manchester United): Another who can put his body in the way if you're defending for your life. Yaya Toure (Manchester City): Totally unpredictable, if you don't know how he's going to play, how can the opposition? Ashley Young (Manchester United): Coming into some great form, can play right or left, and will track back when needed. Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool): A great impact sub, can score in instant with his quick feet . Robin van Persie (Manchester United): Been written off this season, but it's less than a year ago he scored that header in World Cup. Yaya Toure just misses out on the starting XI but the Manchester City star makes our subs bench .

"World Cup winners Germany eased past hosts Georgia 2-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday with two goals in five minutes from Marco Reus and Thomas Mueller enough to get their Group D campaign back on track. Reus scored after 39 minutes and Mueller soon doubled their lead as the Germans, who had an erratic start to qualifiers last year and lost in Poland, were never threatened by their weaker opponents. The win lifted Germany to 10 points from five games, as many as leaders Poland, who take on Ireland later on Sunday. Scotland are also on 10.

'A look at the table before the game was enough to see the urgency of the situation,' Germany coach Joachim Loew told reporters. 'We played a dynamic game, we then controlled it in the second half but did not have the same drive towards goal.' Loew said their conversion rate would need to improve after again spurning several good chances and hitting the woodwork twice. 'We again missed some good chances. We had good combinations but failed to score a third or fourth goal.' Georgia have had a tough start in Group D, recording four defeats and a win in Gibraltar to stay on three points. It did not take long for Germany, with several World Cup winners back in the squad including captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, to threaten with Reus' powerful drive palmed on to the crossbar by keeper Giorgi Loria after five minutes. With coach Loew reverting to a four-man defence from a three-player experiment against Australia in a friendly on Wednesday, the Germans were in and around their opponents' box for most of the first half. Thomas Muller slots home the second for Germany as they comfortably dispatched of Georgia . Mueller fired at goal from a corner only to see the ball fly just wide and Mesut Ozil missed another big chance as the visitors had the hosts firmly on the backfoot. Reus did better in the 39th when Mario Goetze charged into the box and was lucky to scramble the ball to the winger, who drilled home for his second goal this week, after also scoring in their 2-2 draw against Australia. Mueller then fired in another on the stroke of halftime to firmly put them in the driving seat. New Georgia coach Kakhaber Tskhadadze added a forward after the break but it was Reus who came close again, rattling the bar for a second time on the hour with another powerful shot. 'We are not yet fully on track and still have to improve,' said Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. 'But there is sufficient time and I am very confident.'

"Two months before man set foot on the moon for the first time, Gordon Strachan stood on the Hampden terraces to witness a Halley's Comet moment. Just 12 at the time, he could hardly have known 46 years would pass before a Scotsman scored another international hat-trick. 'I was here when Colin Stein scored four,' said the Scots boss after Steven Fletcher's star turn against Gibraltar. 'It's a long time ago — and a few stone ago — but I was there.' Steven Fletcher celebrates scoring a hat-trick for Scotland in the 6-1 victory over Gibraltar . Fletcher is the first Scotland player to score three goals in a game since Colin Stein in 1969 . Fletcher (right) scored his third goal with a left-footed strike from range for Scotland against Gibraltar . Fletcher was recently mocked on Twitter for buying a Lamborghini after inconsistent form for his club, Sunderland .

Referee: Mattias Gestranius (Finland) The Group D standings after Scotland's 6-1 win vs Gibraltar . He was back again, on Sunday night. The old ash wooden steps are long gone, but the technical area provided an excellent vantage point to watch the landmarks tumble down as heavily as the rain over Glasgow. Fletcher climbed back into his Lamborghini as the first Scotland player to drive home a hat-trick since Stein in an 8-0 win over Cyprus in May 1969. Strachan's team became the first in dark blue to rack up half a dozen goals since a 6-0 thrashing of the Faroes in 2006. And, to prove history comes in all shapes and sizes, David Marshall became the first keeper to lose a goal to the minnows of Gibraltar in a competitive international. 'McGregor and Gordon now love me,' said Strachan, only half joking. 'They think I'm the best manager in the world for not picking them —they're not in the history books.' Rightly, Scotland's boss was quick to hand credit to the visitors. Fletcher took the headlines with his first goals for his country since April 2009, Shaun Maloney scoring two penalties and Steven Naismith the other. Yet this was a patchy, unconvincing performance at times. The Scots won the three points and are still on course in Group D. The Gibraltar team of semi-pro part-timers put together by Scot Davie Wilson made the first half an astonishing affair at times. Their tally of goals against is now 27 in five qualifiers. But for 10 minutes the one they scored threatened to break the worldwide web. 'I'm so proud of all the players,' said Gibraltar's interim coach. 'They've given us everything. And now we're even getting free fish and chips to celebrate — the Blue Lagoon chippie in Glasgow sent a card to the hotel this morning saying they were laying them on for us…' Presumably the fish was as battered as their defenders at the end of a long 90 minutes. Scotland's breakthrough came from the penalty spot in 18 minutes via a dubious award. Matt Ritchie, earning his second cap, played a pass inviting Maloney to give chase. The attacker got to the byeline first, knocking the ball past keeper Jamie Robba and out of play. Had the keeper kept his hands to himself Gibraltar would have survived. Instead he sent the striker tumbling rashly. It took a word from the assistant behind the goal to make the Finnish ref's mind up, Maloney tucking home. That, we assumed, was that. With a goal at their back Scotland would make short work of the spirited, plucky underdogs. So there was widespread disbelief when Gibraltar refused to be patronised or quelled. It was glorious stuff, in truth. The very essence of football. The visitors had already caused panic in the eighth minute when Joseph Chipolina threw in a cross from the left flank which keeper David Marshall flapped at horribly, the ball careering off his own crossbar. Maloney (left) won the first penalty and picked himself up to score and put Scotland in the lead . Lee Casciaro (second right) hauled Gibraltar level 72 seconds later with their first ever international goal . Casciaro's goal sparked jubilant celebrations from Gibraltar's players as Hampden park was stunned into solence . Gibraltar's team celebrate as they draw level in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Scotland . Gibraltar had around 500 supporters inside Hampden Park to witness their teams first ever competitive international goal . Fletcher (left) scores Scotland's second and his first of the game to return his team into the lead . Maloney scored Scotland's third and his second of the game which also came from the penalty spot . Trying — and failing — to adapt to the novelty of a three-man defence featuring one central defender and two full-backs in a 3-2-4-1 formation, Scotland were caught cold in the aftermath of the opener. 'We took it for granted Gibraltar were not going to score,' admitted Strachan. It was a big mistake. Andrew Robertson was out of position when Lee Casciaro wrote himself into the history books, racing onto a pass by Aaron Payas to slot through the legs of Marshall for 1-1. Pre-match expectations of a rout suddenly felt rather foolish. Scotland spent 10 minutes at home tied with a British Overseas territory of just 30,000 people. They reclaimed the lead in 29 minutes, Fletcher scoring his first since April 2009. A right-footed cross from the left flank by Ikechi Anya was headed unconvincingly up into the air by defender David Artell. Fletcher reacted first, nodding the ball inside the right-hand post as the keeper scrambled in slow motion across his line. He savoured the moment, sliding on his knees in relief as much as anything. The monkey, at last, was off his back . Collectively, there would be no repeat of the calamity which followed the first goal. Scotland began to relax. In the aftermath of the third goal, in 34 minutes, the game followed its pre-ordained script. It came from a second penalty of the game, rightly awarded for a bizarre flying challenge from Gibraltar scorer Casciaro on Naismith. Maloney opted for the tried and tested, going for the same corner, but a little higher. It flew into the net for 3-1. Gibraltar were now a busted flush. Fletcher hit the outside of the post with a deft effort, but the fourth goal came seven minutes before the interval. The visitors played themselves into trouble in their own area, Anya managing to stay onside before picking out Naismith with a cut-back. He netted smartly for 4-1. The scoreline, as half-time beckoned, had a more acceptable hue. Oddly, however, Scotland refused to apply a foot to the throats of their fading visitors. Fletcher, in truth, might have had five here. He blew a wonderful chance from an Alan Hutton cross in 62 minutes but improved markedly when Jordan Rhodes appeared to provide some back-up in attack. The only disappointment was that Rhodes didn't claim a goal or two as well. He had his chances, controlling a long diagonal ball from fellow sub Barry Bannan in 76 minutes before thrashing the ball into the side-netting. He atoned within a minute when his cross from the right flank picked out Fletcher for his second goal — a downward header. The Sunderland striker should have had his hat-trick four minutes from time when he thumped a neat Rhodes lay-off towards goal but Robba saved. Yet the Gibraltar keeper was merely delaying the inevitable. With one minute of normal time to play, Fletcher produced the kind of calm, composed finish which comes of renewed confidence, passing the ball into the bottom corner from 16 yards for a small, long-awaited slice of Scottish footballing history.

But it proved to be too little, too late as QPR went down to a 3-1 defeat on Saturday afternoon. Palace manager Pardew said: ‘I remember Beckham scoring the goal here and, from a technical point of view, Phillips’ was better because it was an outstanding hit. 'Matt can be very proud of it.

"Fiji reclaimed the Hong Kong Sevens title when it routed defending champion New Zealand 33-19 in the final on Sunday. Fiji blasted to a 21-0 lead in the first half, taking the tension out of the 12th final matchup between the tournament's most successful sides. Each time New Zealand rallied, Fiji had a reply, and even denied New Zealand the last say when Fiji's Vatemo Ravouvou and Apisai Domolailai bundled out Rieko Ioane just shy of the left corner flag.

Fiji players celebrate the team's victory at the Hong Kong International Stadium . Fiji supporters celebrate in the stands after their side scored a try in the final against New Zealand . 'Tactically, we were really astute,' Fiji coach Ben Ryan said. 'I'm really pleased with the way they managed the final.' The win was Fiji's third in four years in the Hong Kong Sevens, and a record-extending 13th in the tournament it prizes above all others. Fiji's third win from six tournaments in the sevens world series also lifted it above New Zealand into second place, two points behind leader South Africa, and in position to win a first series in nine years. New Zealand, also defending the series title, was one point behind. The Japan Sevens is next weekend in Tokyo. Great support play set up Savenaca Rawaca for the opening try, then Semi Kunitani stole ruck ball from New Zealand and sent in Jerry Tuwai. New Zealand tried a five-man attacking lineout, but then trying to back up the sole player out wide ended up giving an intercept try to Rawaca.

But it was dampened by a try by Jasa Veremalua for 28-12 with seven minutes to go.

'That's a great Fijian side,' New Zealand coach Gordon Tietjens said. 'They defended really well and a couple of length-of-the-field tries killed us.' Fiji did well merely to survive its quarterfinal. It led England 14-5 with a penalty try, then lost a man to the sin-bin, too. England, at 14-12 down, gave James Rodwell a chance in the right corner, but Rawaca pulled off a brilliant try-saving tackle.

"The luxurious mansion once live in by former heavyweight champions Mike Tyson in Southington, Ohio is set to be transformed into a church. Tyson was forced to sell the home for $1.3million in 1999 following his fall from grace which saw the American facing huge financial difficulties after being convicted for rape. The champion boxer lived in the Ohio residence during the late 1980s and 1990s while training for fights at Don King's facility 20 miles away in nearby Orwell. The iron gates at the entrance to the derelict mansion in Southington, Ohio, still bear the name of the former heavyweight champ . The boxer lived in the property in the late 80s and early 90s until his dramatic fall from grace when he was jailed for rape . The property features five bedrooms, several living spaces, seven and a half bathrooms, a full kitchen, a mini-kitchen/washroom, two attached garages, one external garage, full size pool and Jacuzzi, tiger cages and a basketball court . Tyson is pictured in 1988 after knocking out British champion Frank Bruno (left) and at the Mike Tyson at the iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday . One photographer Johnny Joo, 24, was allowed inside to explore the property which featured gold-plated furnishings, a mirrored ceiling jacuzzi and a swimming pool twice the size of the average family home. It features five bedrooms, several living spaces, seven and a half bathrooms, a full kitchen, a mini-kitchen/washroom, two attached garages, one external garage, full size pool and Jacuzzi, tiger cages and a basketball court. Tyson decked out the mansion with crystal chandeliers, a pool larger than most homes, tiger print carpet and everything else necessary to make it his private party pad. But now the property lies eerily quiet with just the shell of what was once home to the youngest boxer to win the WBC, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles at age 20.

Another view of the massive entertainment room where the champion boxer entertained friends and hangers-on during his glory days . Photographer Mr Joo, from Cleveland, Ohio, said: 'My journeys have taken me to some strange places but nothing quite like the abandoned home of a former professional boxer. 'It felt cold, rather empty and eerie - not so much a creepy eerie but a more interesting one. 'I knew Mike Tyson had once just hung out here and now I stood staring down everything that had been left behind. 'I loved the bathroom simply because of the view and the mirrored ceiling above the Jacuzzi tub. 'But the pool was probably my favourite just because of how incredibly large it was and thinking how vibrant it was at one point in time. 'The room was bigger than three of my houses, it was pretty incredible to look at while standing at one end. Everything was so full of life and now simply collects dust. 'As I wandered the halls and rooms I imagined the wild parties which must have taken place within these walls. 'I looked across a living room once full of life but now empty of parties, tigers and celebrities.' Gold-plated fittings line the top of the landing at the vast home which is due to be renovated this year after being bought up in December . One of several grand staircases at the Ohio mansion, once home to the champion boxer once dubbed 'the baddest man on the planet' The heavy wooden front door opens up to an expanse of black marble but the once stunning home has fallen into disrepair . Tyson decked out the mansion with crystal chandeliers, a pool larger than most homes, tiger print carpet and everything else necessary to make it his private party pad . Another grand staircase leads down to the mansion's man hall with an open fire space at the bottom . The boxer was taken into custody in 1991 on allegations of rape and in 1992 a jury found him guilty with the ruling committing him to a six year prison sentence with four years of parole. In 1995 Tyson was granted parole and released from prison, returning to rural Southington in hope of escaping the media which ended up following him. Because of his increasingly desperate financial situation he put the mansion up for sale and sold it in 1999 for $1.3m (£870k). It has since had multiple owners - including one who was the subject of an FBI investigation when he tried to sell it - and is now set to be converted into a church. The current owners bought the property in December 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015, allowing Johnny to explore before the work takes place. The mansion's descent into disrepair could be said to mirror the former heavyweight champion boxer's own fall from grace . The current owners bought the property in December 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015 . He added: 'I've seen a few restorations throughout my work but nothing so contrasting as this. 'But it's definitely one of the more well-preserved structures I have been in through years of exploring and photographing abandoned places.

"Will Ferrell has raked in box-office millions playing the earnest goofball in a string of sports movies. He took it to a new level on Thursday, when he played all nine baseball positions and coached for 10 teams in five Arizona ballparks in a spring-training blitz. In addressing the crowd at his final stop in Peoria, the comedian said, 'Ruth, Musial, Mantle, Will Ferrell. Who would have thought that one day those names would be synonymous? Show of hands - scratch that, never mind.' Ferrell started at noon in an Oakland Athletics uniform at shortstop, and ended eight and a half hours later playing right field for the San Diego Padres in the ninth inning. Will Ferrell took part in spring training in Arizona on Thursday as part of an HBO special for a good cause . Ferrell - pictured in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform -  played for 10 different teams in one day . The funny man couldn't resist creating a beard out of nachos as he played every baseball position possible . 'When I embarked on this journey way back at breakfast,' Ferrell said, 'I thought to myself, ""Could I do it?"" The answer is yes.' Memorabilia from his journey, filmed for an HBO special, is to be sold at auction on MLB.com with proceeds going to Cancer for College and Stand Up to Cancer. He hugged a guy in an elf suit as he left Mesa, held up a sign saying 'Remember These Games Don't Count' as impromptu third base coach for the Chicago Cubs, struck out twice on three pitches each, watched two home runs sail over his head, and chased the ball around the outfield during a challenging stint in left field for the Arizona Diamondbacks. His ten uniforms, and other baseball memorabilia, will be auctioned at MLB.com to raise money for charity . Another of Ferrell's teams was the Seattle Mariners - he is pictured running around the field on Thursday . Los Angeles Angels were also on the list as he played in an exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs . 47-year-old Ferrell looked pumped as he raised his fist in the air, clad in the red and white uniform of LA . Ferrell wore No. 19 for every team except his last one. He didn't want to wear the late Tony Gwynn's number, so donned No. 20 for the Padres. When it was over, the star of 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' and 'Elf' took the public address microphone to the infield and recounted his day. 'There's no doubt I turned some heads today, even if it was just for a moment,' Ferrell said. 'I brought passion to the field, dedication, ability, and a lot of ignorance. The ball moves fast out there, a lot faster than it looks on television. It's like a speeding bullet. It's horrible, terrifying.' The Angels then traded Ferrell to the Chicago Cubs for a washing machine, and he played third base coach . At the top of the fourth innings the Cubs let Ferrell step up to plate, and he batted against his former side . Ferrell, acting as the third base coach, talks to Chicago Cubs' Addison Russell during the match in Arizona . A grumpy-looking Ferrell appeared to want the cameras out of his face as he played baseball . In his final stop, he also took the mound for the Los Angeles Dodgers and got San Diego's Rico Noel, the only batter he faced, to bounce out to the pitcher. 'Is there life in this 47-year-old arm?' he said. As he walked off the field, Ferrell waved his cap and gave a security guard a high five. He managed an impressive catch, having kicked off the day by boasting about his abilities in the field . Ferrell showed off his graceful moves as he co-operated with his various teammates throughout the day . Later in the day he joined the Arizona Diamondbacks, but had to wolf down a hotdog before the match . Ferrell throws the ball in hilarious fashion for the Diamondbacks, in their match against Cincinnati Reds . 'They say there's nothing more American than grabbing a hot dog, heading to the ballpark, and watching nine guys from the Dominican Republic,' he said. '... But you know what, today I learned that was wrong. They had eight Dominicans, and one guy from Irvine, California. 'Was I the best player on the field today?' Ferrell said. 'Maybe, maybe.' Then he led the crowd in a chant - 'May-be, may-be, may-be.' After playing for Arizona Diamondbacks and Cincinnati Reds, Ferrell then went on to Chicago White Sox . After climbing out of ‘Penguin Air’ in full uniform, he stepped up to the plate to bat for the White Sox . Unfortunately, he disappointed and was promptly traded to the White Sox's opponents San Francisco Giants .","Will Ferrell played baseball for 10 different teams on Thursday .

"A spring training baseball game between Kansas City Royals and Los Angeles Angels was held up by a pitch invasion of honey bees. The pesky visitors landed on the backstop netting and microphone during Sunday's game in Tempe, Arizona, causing quite a buzz. The unusual visitors delayed the start as an exterminator was brought in to deal with the swarm. Not safe: The match between Kansas City Royals and Los Angeles Angels was delayed when a swarm of bees traveled across the pitch and landed on the net (top right) Bee swarms are common in Arizona in March and it's not the first time the Angels have had to deal with the flying nuisances. In 2013 they have two regular season games delayed and disrupted by a swarm in Anaheim. Manager Mike Scioscia admitted he had never seen the honey makers create the kind of buzz they did on Sunday. Sciosa said: 'We've never had them migrating, but like a tornado, they landed on the microphone. Fortunately, they stayed there until we could get rid of them.' Pitch invasion: The honey bees flew across the pitch and settled on the microphone and back netting in the match in Tempe, Arizona . But Royals boss Ned Yost was left a little saddened by the whole thing. He said: 'I've never seen mass bee genocide like that. 'All you have to do is get some smoke. Trust me, I live in the country. 'You take some smoke out there because the queen is in there somewhere, you get a Shop-Vac and suck them all in and take them out to the parking lot and let them go. 'They're just honey bees, man. There's a decline in honey bees. We need them. It was sad to see, but they had to do what they had to do.' Strike out: Fans take photos as the exterminator gets rid of the bees which delayed play between the Kansas City Royals and Los Angeles Angels on Sunday .","Kansas City Royals and Los Angeles Angels had game delayed by bees .

"Wayne Rooney has sung Michael Carrick's praises after his cameo against Italy on Tuesday night, saying the England midfielder was the best player on the pitch 'by a mile'. Carrick, who plays with Rooney at Manchester United, replaced Chris Smalling towards the end of the first half with Roy Hodgon's side struggling at 1-0 down. But England went on to level courtesy of an Andros Townsend stunner, and Rooney believes Carrick played a huge part in the friendly draw. Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch after he came on against Italy, according to Wayne Rooney . Carrick celebrates with his team-mates after Andros Townsend's strike salvaged a 1-1 draw for England . 'The best player on the pitch by a mile was Michael Carrick,' Rooney told ITV after the game. 'He came on and dictated the game for us you - saw how much control we had after that. I think he was the big difference between two teams in second half.' Ross Barkley was also introduced in the second half and impressed alongside Townsend and Carrick at the Juventus Stadium, as England bounced back after Graziano Pelle's opener. England captain Wayne Rooney strikes the ball at goal during the friendly international in Turin . Hodgson also reserved praise for United midfielder Carrick, who has only been capped 33 times by his country. He said: 'Michael did very well. We experimented in first half, Jones did well, but we missed players like Carrick and Wilshere. 'There might come a game when we need a Phil Jones-type in midfield.'

"England stretched their undefeated run to eight matches as a late Andros Townsend strike canceled out Graziano Pelle's first-half header. Here Sportsmail's Rob Draper casts his eye over Roy Hodgson's side and their Italian hosts. England (4-1-2-1-2) Joe Hart 7 . No blame attached for the goal and a very good save from Eder on 51 minutes. One of the positives for England. Nathaniel Clyne 5 (Walker 45) Always willing to offer an outlet in attack but the system left him exposed in defensive areas and switched at half time. Chris Smalling 5 . Aggressive and firm early on but along with Jagielka completely failed to dominate the box when needed most for Italy's goal. England and Tottenham forward Harry Kane is challenged by Italy and Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini . England and Manchester United defender Phil Jones (left) falls following a challenge from Roberto Soriano . Phil Jagielka 5 . Heavy touch in bring the ball out and, along with Smalling, failed to command the penalty area for Italy's goal. Look ill at ease. Kieran Gibbs 6 (Bertrand 88) Like Clyne, often looked lost without support from a wide midfielder. Had chance to equalise on 54 minutes but drove into side netting. Improved in second half. Phil Jones 4.5 (Carrick 44) When Carrick came on to relieve him from the holding midfield role as it was though he'd escaped purgatory. Static and beaten embarrassingly easily for the goal – but better, unsurprisingly as centre half. Two Italian fans share a smile ahead of the international friendly between Italy and England in Turin . England and Manchester United defender Chris Smalling hassles Italy's Eder Citadin Martins for the ball . Jordan Henderson 6 (Mason 74) Scurried here and there with plenty of intent but little guile. Didn't ever really settle into the system. Fabian Delph 5.5 (Townsend 70) Much the same. Harried and was strong in tackles but too often was a man chasing around in search of a game plan. Wayne Rooney 7 . The flashes of class England showed invariably came from him; shot off the bar on 22 minutes, a glorious cross field ball for Walcott on 27 minutes. Tested Buffon in second half – perhaps should have scored on 72 minutes. Harry Kane 6 . Lost in a vortex of team-mates' inability to pass the ball. Looked eager to impress with no opportunity to do so until late on when he had strikes to trouble Buffon. England and Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph (right) prepares to tackle Italy's Vitaliy Mandziuk on Tuesday . England and Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney (centre) is surrounded by Italian defenders in Turin . Theo Walcott 5 (Barkley 55) Looked out of place in a front two and even more so when he played behind the front two. Never convinced. SUBS . Michael Carrick 8 . Provided much better distribution that Jones could; baffling why he didn't start. England were much more fluid with him on the pitch. Kyle Walker  6 . Exposed almost immediately when Eder drifted past him to set up scoring chance but improved from thereon in. Michael Carrick passes the ball for England ahead of the oncoming challenge of Italy's Ciro Immobile (right) Tottenham forward Kane (left) takes a hand to the face from Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci (right) in Turin . Ross Barkley  7 . Offered more pace, drive and direction to the England midfield. Will be encouarged. Andros Townsend  7.5 . Superb strike for goal which rescued England and sparked by far their best period. Incisive and ful of running even though on left. Ryan Mason 7 . Can feel satisfied with a decent debut. Contributed to England's best spell . Ryan Bertrand  6 . Southampton and Italy striker Graziano Pelle (left) plays the ball ahead of the oncoming defender Jones (right) Italy: (3-5-2) Gianluigi Buffon 7.5 . Rarely called on initially but fine save from the Rooney striker on 72 minutes and then again on 80minutes. Andrea Ranocchia 6.5 . Part of an immaculate back three for an hour – suddenly looked a little vulnerable as the changes unsettled Italy. Leonardo Bonucci 7 . Looked imperious until the changes in the last 15 minutes left Italy looking a little exposed. Pelle scores the opening goal of the game with a glancing header across the England box on Tuesday night . The ball nestles into the bottom corner as Italy take the lead and England defenders watch on helplessly . Giorgio Chiellini 7.5 (Moretti 72) Beat Jagielka to deliver glorious wrong-footed cross for Pelle goal. Was great in defence before being wrong footed for the Rooney chance a minute before being taken off. Allesandro Florenzi 6.5 (Abate 60) Solid throughout – was full of running when England's midfield allowed him space in the first half. Marco Parolo 7 . Able and capable in possession – well on top of England's midfield for much of the game. Mirko Valdifiori 7 (Verratti 67) Quietly distributing in the Pirlo role – may never be in that class but did his job last night until replace by Verratti. England and Arsenal forward Theo Walcott attempts a shot at goal but is closed down by Andrea Ranocchia . Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon (right) comes out to punch the ball away from the head of England's Kane . Spurs forward Kane has another shot at goal but is closed down by Italy defender Ranocchia (right) in Turin . Roberto Soriano 6 . Decent performance, passed well and kept his head. Only lost track in final twenty minutes. Matteo Darmian 6.5 (Antonelli 73) Plenty on incursions down the left as Clyne struggle to contain his man. Graziano Pelle 7.5 (Immobile 60) Lovely glancing header to make it 1-0, his first goal since January. Replaced on the hour by Immobile. Eder Citaden Martins 6 (Vazquez 60) Not as successful as Pelle; best chance on 55 minutes when Hart saved. England and Tottenham winger Andros Townsend (centre) dribbles with the ball ahead of Marco Verrati (left) Townsend celebrates scoring England's equalising goal against Italy during the friendly match in Turin .","Andros Townsend's long-range strike cancelled out Graziano Pelle's first-half header to secure England a draw against Italy .

"Brazil head coach Dunga has labelled Chelsea midfielder Willian as one of the keys to his tactical revolution alongside Neymar as the Selecao prepare to face Chile at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. The five-time World Cup winners trained on the pitch of Arsenal's 60,000-capacity ground on Saturday ahead of the sell-out South American showdown in London on Sunday. And with just over two months until the Copa America begins, Dunga - appointed head coach in the post-mortem of Brazil's embarassing World Cup elimination - sees Willian and Neymar as two of the key men in his tactical revolution. Thiago Silva, Miranda and Neymar (L-R) are at the centre of the laughs as the Brazilians enjoy training . Real Madrid defender Marcelo (left) leads his team-mates into a huddle for a photo at the Emirates Stadium . Neymar (left) laughs during a conversation with Chelsea midfielder Willian (third left) during a brief break . Neither player started in the 7-1 humiliation against Germany in last year's semi-final, and Dunga wants the movement and mobility the pair share to help redefine the way Brazil play in the hope of bouncing back from their last tournament appearance. 'The movement and mobility of our players is key,' Dunga said. 'The more they play together the more things become automatic. 'Willian is skilled. He has a lot of pace, a speed in his reasoning and he can make the difference in many games. Neymar is doing very well and will only grow.' 'In regard to goals I don't think that will be a problem. But the record we really want him to get is Pele's number of World Cup wins.' Brazil head coach Dunga talked up the abilities of Neymar and Willian as two of his star players . Willian has grown into an increasingly important figure for Brazil since last summer's World Cup disaster . Marcelo, Neymar and Luis Adriano (L-R) are all expected to be involved in Sunday's friendly in London . Both Neymar and Willian are set to be key men in Dunga's side for this summer's Copa America, where he has confirmed that no new players will be brought into his squad. 'Those who have never been called (for the squad) are not out, but they will have to wait for another opportunity,' he said. 'The Copa America is a competition, where we have to put players who already have an answer. The Copa America is not the place to test a player. I can't select someone I haven't worked with.' Barclays Premier League pair Philippe Coutinho and Oscar put themselves about during the training session . Neymar has been getting used to the Emirates pitch as he looks to further his impressive international record . Brazil have no new injury problems though Dunga said he will make changes to his side in London. David Luiz and striker Diego Tardelli are both missing again but London fans will see plenty of familiar faces including Chelsea trio Oscar, Willian and Filipe Luis.

Brazil may have come away with a 1-0 win through Firmino’s second-half strike, but this match between two South American rivals was more like a scene from cult ‘90s film Fight Club, in which Brad Pitt and Ed Norton get normal men kicking lumps out of each other every week, than the showpiece friendly expected. As the film goes, the third rule of Fight Club: Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out, the fight is over. No-one told the Chilean players as they repeatedly floored Neymar with challenge after challenge after challenge. Hoffenheim's Roberto Firmino (left) celebrates with team-mates Elias and Neymar having opened the scoring for Brazil against Chile . Firmino managed to skip past the on-coming Claudio Bravo on 72 minutes to slot Brazil ahead at the Emirates stadium on sunday .

The Barcelona star is evidently in pain after Medel's (centre) cynical stamp on Neymar's leg at the Emirates stadium on Sunday . Remarkably referee Martin Atkinson didn't punish the stamp by Medel as Neymar was left in pain on the Emirates stadium pitch . Brazil (4-2-2-2): Jefferson 7; Danilo 7, Thiago Silva 6.5, Miranda 6.5, Marcelo 6 (Filipe Luis 76); Souza 6.5 (Elias 60, 6), Fernandinho 6; Douglas Costa 6 (Willian 62, 6), Coutinho 6 (Robinho 60, 6); Neymar 7, Luiz Adriano 5.5 (Firmino 60, 7).

Subs not used: Roco, Garces, Cornejo, Pizarro, Orellana, Gutierrez, Fuenzalida, Lichnovsky. Manager: Jorge Sampaoli 5 . Booked: Albornoz, Gonzalez . Referee: Martin Atkinson 7 . MOTM: Alexis Sanchez . Attendance: 60,007 . The Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. Here at the Emirates Stadium it was 11 on 11. The first savage blow came three minutes in. Brazilian enforcer Souza crunched Alexis Sanchez. Somewhere, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger winced and knew it would be a nervy 90 minutes watching his star player. It was clear this was going to be a ‘friendly’ in the very loosest terms. Miiko Albornoz was next in referee Martin Atkinson’s book, nailing Neymar twice in a matter of minutes as the Chileans competed against each other for how many times they could take out Brazil’s star man. Gary Medel tried the hardest, taking him down in a challenge then standing back up on his calf. The former Cardiff defender was lucky to remain on the pitch, perhaps helped by Neymar writhing around as if he had been tasered. 'They didn’t get much protection,' Dunga said of his players’ treatment after the game. On Medel’s stamp, he added: 'The decision is the referee’s. Chile has a great team, very dynamic, great fighting, but some players make mistakes. These days we have 300 cameras focusing on the action so you have to play football. There’s no other solution.' There were flashes of quality and skill, from Sanchez and Neymar mainly, the pair sending either side of the stadium into raptures of screeching and screaming with their every touch. On 37 minutes, Neymar scooped the ball out of an opponent’s reach, which prompted their best chance of the first-half. The ball made its way to Marcelo and he crossed for Douglas Costa to the right of goal, who controlled the ball with his chest but could only volley over. Neymar also came close with an in-swinging free kick from out on the right after 26 minutes, which almost tucked into the far right post before Claudio Bravo tipped it wide. Early in the half Sanchez took a lovely touch to get clear and raced into the box, but was eventually blocked out. The first 45 minutes were brought to a close by Fernandinho flying in with studs raised only to find air and Neymar being booked for tripping Gonzalo Jara. It was fitting. If anyone was expecting anything different in the second-half, they were duly disappointed 100 seconds into it when Mauricio Isla went through the back of Neymar, who was down clutching his ankles yet again. Sanchez started taking the game by the scruff of the neck, while the others were too busy taking each other by it, and making things happen. The international friendly between Brazil abd Chile added a bit of South American flare to proceedings in a rain drenched North London . Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez sprints away from Thiago Silva (left) on the Emirates stadium pitch he has become very familiar with . Brazil manager Dunga passes on instructions to his right back Danilo as he watches his side take on South American rivals Chile . He got the wrong side of Miranda on 63 minutes and was brought down, earning the Brazil defender a yellow card. Three minutes later he beat three men before being tripped by substitute Willian and moments later he was spinning and shimmying past more again. The resulting free kicks, however, were poor. Finally, after 72 minutes of the match, there was a chance of real note - and the Brazilian’s scored it. Substitute Firmino was played through by a wonderful pass from right-back Danilo and he rounded the goalkeeper to score. Dunga was satisified with victory, he said: 'It's true Chile controlled the game, but we had more chances at goal. So it wasn't just luck - we deserved to win. We are building a competitive team, working through obstacles very well, played against a very strong France team, changed six players but stayed stable and strong.' Managers across Europe with a vested interest in this game would have been relieved to hear the final whistle blow and no major injuries incurred. By the end, seven yellow cards had been brandished and it was incredible there were no reds. But the match is over now and, remember, the first rule of Brazil versus Chile is: You do not talk about Brazil versus Chile.

"England football coach Roy Hodgson was the talk of the League Managers Association President’s Dinner after he was upstaged by inspirational speaker Paul McGinley, Europe’s victorious Ryder Cup captain. Hodgson and McGinley were interviewed on stage by Sky Sports’ David Jones on the subject of leadership. But Hodgson paled next to McGinley, who gave a masterclass at the Lord’s function in explaining the attention to detail, perception and man-management which went into beating the USA at Gleneagles. It would not have been McGinley’s intention but his thoroughly modern approach to leading a team only exposed Hodgson’s old-school philosophy.

Neymar embraces his 'big friend' Alexis Sanchez, who was a team-mate of his at Barcelona until last summer . But being in only his second year at Barcelona following a £48.6million move from Brazilian club side Santos in June 2013, he wants to stay there for far longer. Neymar said: ‘As for playing in England myself, I’m very happy playing for Barcelona and I still have a long road to walk here.' Neymar played at Barcelona with Alexis Sanchez before the Chilean moved over to Arsenal last summer. ‘Alexis is a big friend,’ he added, ‘and someone who I had the privilege of playing with at Barcelona.

"The frustrations of certain Scotland coaches appeared to boil over after their late defeat to Italy on Saturday afternoon. A picture from the Telegraph shows how a reinforced glass door in the Scotland coaches' booth at Murrayfield was smashed during the late 19-22 defeat to Italy. It is not known whether it was head coach Vern Cotter who smashed the door, which can only be accessed by coaching staff or the media, or one of his assistants. A reinforced glass door in the Scotland coaches' booth at Murrayfield was smashed following the defeat . A team spokesman failed to deny that a member of the coaching team had caused the damage after Scotland had given them numerous reasons to get angry. Cotter concedes his 'message' is not getting through to his players after watching them crash to their third RBS 6 Nations defeat on the spin. The Dark Blues' faces were left matching their crimson red change strip as they threw away victory against Italy with a late collapse - leaving them near certainties to take home the Wooden Spoon. Having struggled to deal with the Azzurri's driving mauls and referee George Clancy's pedantic meddling at the scrum, the Scots found themselves a man light as debutant lock Ben Toolis was sin-binned two minutes from time.

And the visitors to Murrayfield clinched a 22-19 victory when Clancy's patience finally ran out as he awarded a penalty try after Scotland resorted to another infringement just inches from their own goal-line in a desperate bid to halt Italy's last-gasp surge. It was the 14th foul committed by Cotter's men and came after penalty-littered defeats to France and Wales. The Kiwi had warned Scotland to be on their best behaviour but after falling to the Italians for the seventh time in 15 years, he said: 'I'm obviously not getting the message across.

But Cotter also admitted he will have to take his share of the blame. Asked if he regretted replacing skipper Greig Laidlaw with five minutes to go just as the Italians were turning the screw, he said: 'Not just that. I'm responsible for the defeat so I will be having a good look at myself and how we can move forward.'

"Wales captain Ashley Williams says summer holidays for the squad have been put on hold as qualifying for Euro 2016 takes precedence over visiting exotic hot-spots. Chris Coleman's Group B leaders host Belgium for their next qualifier but the June 12 fixture at the Cardiff City Stadium causes problems as far as preparation is concerned. The fixture comes nearly three weeks after the conclusion of the Premier League season and almost a full six weeks from the final match of the regular Championship campaign, which could mean an extended break for the likes of Reading pair Chris Gunter and Hal Robson-Kanu.

Wales boss Coleman is still undecided whether to go ahead with a planned Cardiff friendly against Northern Ireland on June 4 or have a long training camp before the Belgium game. But Williams says that whatever the decision, Wales will not be taking their eye off the ball following the 3-0 victory in Israel on Saturday night, a win which gave the nation its longest unbeaten start to a qualifying campaign since the 1976 European Championships. 'There was a big wait for this game and it will be the same for the Belgium game in June,' Williams said. 'When the season ends we will get focused again and keep the ball rolling. Williams has his heart set on helping Wales qualify for their first ever European Championship finals . 'We have not spoken about that break yet and I don't know what they are going to do with us. 'But everyone understands the importance of that game and no-one is going to be in Vegas or Miami before. 'We will have a rest and keep ourselves fit.' Wales will lose top spot in the group on Tuesday night should the delayed Israel-Belgium game in Jerusalem produce a winner - the fixture postponed last September because of the political situation in the Middle East. Chris Coleman's men reached their target of being in the top three teams at the halfway mark of qualifying . But Coleman said Wales have met their pre-group target of being in the top three at the halfway stage of the qualifying campaign and, with seven or eight points potentially enough to claim one of the two automatic qualifying places for France 2016, three of their last five games are now at home.

'There is still a lot of football to be played after that so I wouldn't go as far as to say that we win that and we are there. 'We do know that a win over Belgium will make a big difference.

Alonso's McLaren is wheeled into the garage after he was forced to retire from the Malaysian Grand Prix . The German is, of course, Alonso's replacement at Ferrari as the 33-year-old opted to quit the Maranallo marque after five years without success of trying to claim a third title. What must Alonso have thought later when he saw Vettel stand on the top step of the podium, the first time a Ferrari driver had done so since the Spaniard himself in his home grand prix two years ago. Whatever Alonso's thoughts, all he can do now is remain convinced McLaren's early woes in conjunction with new power-unit supplier Honda will ultimately lead to the results he craves. It is a case of short-term pain for long-term gain as Alonso said: 'These reliability problems are normal. The Spaniard failed to finish the race on Sunday, managing just 21 laps at the Malaysian Grand Prix . 'What you normally find in winter testing, we have to find in the first couple of races unfortunately. We need to accept maybe some retirements and we are ready to do so. 'Definitely it has been a very nice weekend and a very nice surprise to see the improvements from Australia to here. 'If we keep up this rate then we will enjoy success very soon.' Overall, Alonso expressed 'mixed feelings' as to how the weekend had unfolded, adding: 'I'm happy to be back and very happy with the progress the team has made. Both McLaren's failed to finish the race in Malaysia as they continue to struggle for form this F1 season . 'Watching the race on the TV in Australia, we were very far off - four seconds in the race and just one McLaren running alone at the back. 'Here we were much more competitive in qualifying, running with everyone in the race, which was a very nice surprise. 'But not finishing the race is never a nice feeling, so let's see if we can improve next time.' Team-mate Jenson Button retired on lap 42 with a turbo issue, leaving neither of the team's cars classified for the first time since the 2006 United States Grand Prix.

"The Duke of Wellington is famously quoted as saying that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton. And now an amazing 150-year-old photograph has emerged of boys at the private school playing cricket - one of the earliest images ever taken of the sport. The earliest ever photograph of a school cricket match, and the second oldest of any cricket anywhere, has been discovered and is to be sold at auction. An 1860s photograph of young men playing cricket at Eton has been discovered and is to be sold at auction. It is thought to be the second oldest image of the sport ever taken . The photograph was signed by Victor A. Prout in pencil. It will be sold at auction by Dominic Winters Auctioneers in Cirencester . Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, was a British leader who is said to have traversed the playing fields at Eton College when he was a student in the 1780s. The Duke attended Eton, which was founded in the 15th Century by King Henry VI, before he joined the army in 1787 and later helped defeat Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. According to history, he touched the ground at Eton and claimed: 'There grows the stuff that won Waterloo.' He was later misquoted repeatedly as having said: 'It is here that the battle of Waterloo was won.' His statements were construed by historians as references to the 'manly character induced by games and sport' among the English youth. The previously unseen image was taken in the early 1860s and shows 11 young men dressed smartly in trousers and waistcoats. Resting on their bats, they pose for the photographer with the distinctive Eton College visible behind them. The photograph was taken by Victor A. Prout who signed it in pencil afterwards. Dating from around 1862, it was taken just five years after the first ever image depicting the sport. It is to be sold by Dominic Winters Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and is expected to fetch at least £500. Auctioneer and Senior Valuer Chris Albury said: 'This early, and previously unknown, cricket photograph in this album probably dates from circa 1862, some five years after the earliest photograph of a cricket match.' The first ever photo of cricket was taken by Roger Fenton in 1857, a founding member of the Royal Photographic Society and famous for his photographs of the Crimean War. He first captured the sport in during a match between the Royal Artillery and the Hunsdonbury Cricket Club at the Honourable Artillery Ground in Islington, London, 25 July 1857. Around 100 years before the image of taken the Duke of Wellington is said to have traversed the playing fields at Eton where he was a student. Touching the ground, history claims he said: 'There grows the stuff that won Waterloo.' He was later misquoted repeatedly as having said: 'It is here that the battle of Waterloo was won.' Eton College was founded in the 15th Century by King Henry VI to school 70 poor boys. The pupils were then sent to Kings College in Cambridge, founded in 1441. The school has long been associated with cricket with its annual fixture against Harrow dating back to 1805. Cricket has long been part of Eton's sporting curriculum.

The pupils were then sent to Kings College in Cambridge, founded in 1441 . English poet Sir Henry John Newbolt (pictured) perhaps summed up the spirit of the 19th Century best, with his famous work known as 'Vitaï Lampada' In the 19th century, character building through sports was said to be vital in morally equipping young men to achieve greatness later in life. Many held the view that 'manly characteristics' were developed by gaming and sports, and that those who flourished on the field would go on to carve successful careers as soldiers or engineers. English poet Sir Henry John Newbolt perhaps summed up the spirit of the age best, with his famous work known as 'Vitaï Lampada'. The poem, written in 1892, refers to how a schoolboy, a future soldier, learns selfless commitment to duty in cricket matches in the famous Close at Clifton College. Vitaï Lampada, which means 'the torch of life', also makes reference to the Battle of Abu Klea in Sudan in January 1885. The poem, in full: . There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night— . Ten to make and the match to win— . A bumping pitch and a blinding light, . An hour to play and the last man in. And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat, . Or the selfish hope of a season's fame, . But his captain's hand on his shoulder smote . 'Play up! play up! and play the game!' The sand of the desert is sodden red,— . Red with the wreck of a square that broke;— . The Gatling's jammed and the Colonel dead, . And the regiment blind with dust and smoke. The river of death has brimmed his banks, . And England's far, and Honour a name, . But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks: . 'Play up! play up! and play the game!' This is the word that year by year, . While in her place the school is set, . Every one of her sons must hear, . And none that hears it dare forget. This they all with a joyful mind . Bear through life like a torch in flame, . And falling fling to the host behind— . 'Play up! play up! and play the game!'","The image was taken by Victor A. Prout around 1862 and shows 11 sportsmen dressed in trousers and waistcoats .

"Aaron Ramsey believes Wales can pull off a summer surprise against Belgium and take a huge stride towards reaching the Euro 2016 finals in France. Wales coasted to a 3-0 victory over Israel in Haifa on Saturday night to top Group B in European Championship qualifying, with their next game at home to group favourites Belgium on June 12. Belgium are ranked fourth in the world and made their own statement of intent on Saturday when they thrashed Cyprus 5-0 in Brussels. Aaron Ramsey (right) insists Wales can spring a surprise against Belgium on June 12 . Ramsey wheels away in celebration after scoring the first goal during Wales' 3-0 victory against Israel . The Red Devils will top the group by beating Israel in Jerusalem on Tuesday but Wales held Belgium in Brussels in November and Ramsey believes they can upset them again in the return fixture at the Cardiff City Stadium. 'We'll be looking forward to Belgium,' Ramsey said after opening the scoring against Israel with his ninth international goal. 'It's a tough game but we are full of confidence at the moment. We are top of the group, so why can't we win the game?' Arsenal midfielder Ramsey revealed his goal celebration when he pointed to the heavens was in honour of his grandmother who died last weekend. 'My nan passed away on the weekend, that's why it's been quite tough,' Ramsey said. Ramsey (right) points to the heavens in honour of his grandmother who died last weekend . Ramsey was mobbed by his Wales team-mates after putting them ahead at the end of the first half . 'My goal was for her. I'm just really proud I could score the goal for her. I know she's looking down on me and I was glad I could score. 'I shut my eyes, got my head on it and thankfully it went in. It was a great performance and 'Ginge' (James Collins) said in the dressing room that's maybe the best performance away from home he has been involved in. 'We looked quite comfortable and played with a lot of belief. 'It was a great performance from the boys, we came here believing we could get a result and we managed to do it. 'We kept ourselves in the game, defended really well and then we got the goal before half-time and it opened up a bit more.' Marouane Fellaini scored twice to help Belgium to an impressive 5-0 victory against Cyprus on Saturday . Eden Hazard (left) bagged a goal and an assist as Belgium continued their Group B march . Ramsey's goal preceded a double strike from Gareth Bale which took the game away from 10-man Israel in the second half. Bale's form for Real Madrid has been widely criticised in Spain but he has now scored six goals in his last six appearances for his country. 'He was unbelievable,' Ramsey said. 'Every time he comes away with Wales he puts on a performance. He got two goals himself and an assist, it was a good job for him.' Ramsey hailed his Welsh team-mate Gareth Bale as 'unbelievable' following his two-goal performance . Bale uploaded this picture to Instagram afterwards with the caption 'what a performance from the lads' Wales now have 11 points from five games and manager Chris Coleman believes 20 will prove enough to claim one of the two automatic qualifying spots on offer. 'You've got to be really unlucky if you get to 20 and you don't get to the first top two,' Coleman said. 'We've done some good work and we're on the right road but there's some distance left. We've got the chance to prove we are the best Welsh team since the one that qualified for the 1958 World Cup. 'I played in Welsh teams in 1994 and 2004 where we nearly did it and now we have the opportunity to go a step further. 'People say it's a golden generation but we need to earn it. We're doing it but we've not done it yet.

"Trying to find a way to explain the birds and the bees to children can be a difficult task for any parent. So luckily for this father, a pair of raccoons took it upon themselves to make his job a little easier by giving a little demonstration in the garden. The hilarious footage captured in Seattle begins innocently enough with some excited children looking out of the window at two raccoons scaling their fence. The children watch on excitedly as the male raccoon chases the female from the fence and into the garden . As the youngsters speculate about whether they will jump from the fence – before a little ‘muffin man’ song interlude – one of the raccoons descends into the garden closely pursued by the other. One child, sensing the tension, asks: ‘Can raccoons fight?’ While another exclaims: ‘Woah, they’re wrestling.’ As one raccoon mates the other, the children begin to laugh and the father responds quickly be saying: ‘They’re doing more than wrestling I think.’ Laughing along in the excitement, the father continues to film the episode in the garden until one of the children offers up an explanation in the form of a question: ‘Is he doing the Heimlich manoeuvre?’ The children laugh hysterically as the two raccoons begin mating and offer up a number of innocent explanations for their behaviour . ‘I think so,’ replies one of the children before the father confidently states: ‘Yes, that’s the Heimlich.’ Raccoons usually mate between late January and mid-March, in a period triggered by increasing daylight. During the mating season, males spend much of their time searching for females in an attempt to copulate in the three-to-four day period when conception is possible. The encounters can last over and hour and may be repeated over several nights, so it is likely that the children have some laughs still yet to come. The Heimlich manoeuvre? Raccoon copulation can last over an hour so it is likely the children had some more laughs later .","Youngsters watch from the window in excitement at the two raccoons .

Hamilton’s Mercedes team had threatened to dominate this season but to the great relief of Formula One fans throughout the world — including some patriotic Hamilton supporters — they have been caught up.

"Gareth Bale insists the intense criticism of his Real Madrid form will fall on deaf ears and he is firmly confident of his elite abilities. Having weathered a storm of whistles from the stands to spearhead Wales to victory in Israel, Bale spoke in assured tones about doing likewise in Spain. Exactly a week ago Bale found his white Bentley under attack from irate Real fans after the Clasico defeat to Barcelona in which influential newspaper Marca scored him zero mark. He has been subjected to boos from the stands and had his £86million pricetag mocked and questioned.

Bale scored a brilliant free-kick as Wales won 3-0 in Israel in the Euro 2016 Group B qualifier . Bale (centre) leads the celebrations after his second-half free kick put Wales 2-0 up against rivals Israel . But in Wales' hugely important Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel Bale was magnificent, scoring twice to move onto 16 in total for his country, level with Cliff Jones, Mark Hughes and Robert Earnshaw, and beyond the great John Charles in the all-time list. And Bale said: 'I don't need to answer the critics. I know, and everyone around me knows, what I can do. 'There are ups and downs in football, you have to take it with a pinch of salt and all you can do is respond with your performances on the pitch, like that. 'I don't feel I need to prove anyone wrong or right, I just need to play my football. 'I love playing for Wales, it's a big honour and the most important thing is I focus on my football. I don't listen to anyone else, what they're saying, just enjoying my football with the boys.' Bale was an image of relaxation as he flew back to Cardiff with his Wales teammates yesterday, smiling, chatting and sharing sweets. He will enjoy some home time before travelling to Madrid. Wales boss Chris Coleman was at the head of the plane perusing tactical notes. Job done in Israel, the manager is already looking forward to the visit of Belgium on June 12. Emerge from that game unscathed and Wales will begin to smell the croissants. A point or more would bring to life the vision of qualifying for France 2016, a first major tournament in more than half a century. That is thanks to a substantial victory in Haifa that removed any lingering doubt this gilded crop possess the ability, application and mental strength to succeed. The performance in winning 3-0 could in future be seen as era-defining. Bale (second left) has struggled to hit the form Madrid supporters want to see from him . Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (centre) put Wales a goal to the good against Israel in Haifa on Saturday . Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen (right) was impressive for Wales in the encounter against Israel . Wales have been in promising positions before since reaching the 1958 World Cup, but failed. The way they set about business in Israel, who entered the game with a 100 per cent record in Group B, told of a team likely to make history, not repeat it. Plenty of times Coleman has referenced this golden generation, headed by the irrepressible Bale. He set up Aaron Ramsey's opener before scoring the final two goals at the Sammy Ofer Stadium, a wnderful free-kick and composed finish. To a man Wales were composed, Joe Allen particularly good, silencing a feverish atmosphere. The team had also needed to block out some perceived dirty tricks in this desert nation. Coleman revealed there had been a wrong turn and delayed luggage on arrival. Some stadium floodlights also went out as the match neared the final whistle. 'As a player I remember going to places, you know the shenanigans,' he said. 'We arrived on Thursday and the journey from the airport to hotel is 45 minutes. It took us an hour and 55 minutes because our escort 'missed the turn off'.

We used to get angry about it and you walked on the pitch wanting to tear someone in half. Someone gets sent off, you're 2-0 down after 20 minutes and it's all over. 'So we just said, 'Keep calm, we've worked hard to get here, let's not do anything stupid. Be brave with the ball.' We were all of that.

"Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to Wales is that this cauldron of noise, which at kick-off seemed so threatening, was reduced to a quiet hum after the 50th minute. That was the moment when Gareth Bale reminded us why Real Madrid paid £86million for his signature, why the caustic treatment of his recent performances in Spain seems so odd. Having drawn a foul from Eytan Tibi inches outside the box with his pace, he dispatched the ball into the net as simply as if from the penalty spot in any. His shot curled over the wall with surgical placement, leaving goalkeeper Ofir Marciano stock still. It was pure quality.

Referee: Milorad Mazic 7 . MoM: Bale . His rapturous celebration spoke of the goal’s personal significance and collective importance. He answered his critics without uttering a word and made certain a momentous victory in Welsh ambitions to reach Euro 2016. It was his 15th goal in 49 caps for Wales, moving him level with John Charles in the all-time scorers chart. He went past the great man 13 minutes from the end to rubber stamp Wales’s ascension to top of Group B at the halfway stage on 11 points and within sight of a first major tournament since 1958. Aaron Ramsey provided the assist, seizing possession on the left and cutting back for Bale to finish into the corner. It was goal number 20 for Bale in a season that has been judged underwhelming in Spain. Ramsey deserves praise too, having turned in his best performance in a Welsh shirt for some considerable time, getting the opener eight seconds into first-half injury time that sucked the feverish hostility from the throats of Israel’s fans. It was route one stuff. Wayne Hennessey pumped the ball long and Israel allowed it to bounce. Bale stole above Tibi to nod into the path of Ramsey, who delivered a brilliant header over Marciano. Ramsey celebrated by running to the 900 Wales fans and pointing to the skies, his grandmother having died last week. Bale dedicated the win to much-loved kitman Dai Williams, who passed away last month with the players wearing black armbands. By the end, Wales were running through 10-man Israel at will, Tibi having been sent off for a second booking shortly after 2-0 for fouling Bale again. Substitute Sam Vokes, making his first international appearance in a year following serious injury, nearly scored, as Bale twice went close to getting his hat-trick. Israel are no mugs. Their 3-0 win over Bosnia here in November and perfect record prior to this game, is indication of that. But they were made to look woefully short by Wales. Bale said: ‘We’re in a good position now and we’ve got a chance of qualifying. We will keep fighting and working hard and hopefully our performances and results will do all the talking. It’s amazing to be top of the table and we go from here.’ Ramsey (right) wheels away in celebration after putting Wales into the lead at the end of the first half .

Bale was at the centre of attention from Israel's defence but still scored his country five minutes into the second half . Chris Coleman was ebullient, and said Bale had responded in perfect fashion to the scathing judgments in Spain. ‘A plus with international football is when you come away from your clubs, then you are concentrating on something different,’ said the Wales manager. ‘There's a bit of criticism flying at Gareth in Madrid, but he did tonight what he's been doing for some time with Wales.’ Coleman thinks three wins from five remaining matches will seal qualification. All the ingredients to make this a defining night were mixed together in the Sammy Ofer Stadium. Two nations enjoying unprecedentedly good qualifying campaigns with designs on reaching a major finals for the first time in a generation. The noise for the Israel national anthem as thousands held up Star of David flags told you that. The whistles greeting early touches by Wales players were piercing in the extreme. Bale’s name over the tannoy drew louder cat calls than any. ‘Haters gonna hate,’ read a sign in the away section, directed more towards Real Madrid’s critical following than those here in Haifa. He did have at least one fan in the home crowd. A poster of ‘We love you Bale’ could be seen behind one goal. Little battles all over the pitch showed the tension. An early shove by Neil Taylor on Orel Dgani as the pair tussled for a throw in drew high-pitched screeching from the stands. James Collins suggested Eli Guttman might ‘f*** off’ when the Israel manager appealed for a card after Omri Ben Harush dramatically rolled on the turf following a collision for a high ball.

Unfortunately it was Collins, who stood on the ball from two yards out rather than apply the finishing touch that had seemed certain. The pause allowed Israel to clear.

"Lawrence Okoye is set for the next step  in his NFL career. Since swapping the discus for the defensive line, mentor Jim Tomsula said the 6ft 6in man mountain has  adapted to the sport well, but is set to face a steep learning curve in his third year with the San Francisco 49ers. 'The development has been significant. But he’s playing a position that’s not like anything else that he’s done. So everything is completely brand new and that’s a hard transition.' 'This year, he's going to be in there against guys that are going to make the other team. Let's see where we're at,' head coach Tomsula said at the NFL owners meeting. Lawrence Okoye faces a battle to make the 53-man roster and Jim Tomsula is keen to know where he stands . Jim Tomsula spoke about Lawrence Okoye's future and was gushing about Jarryd Hayne's NFL hopes . After signing as an undrafted free agent in 2013, Okoye's first year in the Bay Area was injury-hit. Last season he played against third and fourth-stringers in pre-season before being signed to the practice squad. Despite Tomsula's expertise as a defensive line coach, 23-year-old former Olympian Okoye faces a battle to make the 49ers final 53-man roster due to enormous depth at the position. Even without the likes of Justin Smith and Ray McDonald, Tomsula reckons it's the best positional group he's had in his eight years with the franchise. Tomsula also spoke of fellow NFL-convert Jarryd Hayne, who joined the 49ers from Australia's NRL as a free agent earlier this month. The 49ers plan to use Hayne as a running back but Tomsula would not rule out using him as a returner, and spoke of his excitement at working with the 27-year-old. 'He’s a guy used to being downfield catching a ball with people running at him,' Tomsula said. 'He’s used to making tackles in open spaces. You’ve got a guy used to carrying the ball, catching the ball and avoiding. Obviously, with the explosive qualities that he has, you can’t help but be excited.'","Okoye enters his third year with the 49ers and is set to be tested against better offensive lineman .

Alonso was forced to retire, though, after being called in by his team after 21 laps while Button lasted double the amount of time as his team-mate. Jenson Button was happy to see McLaren be more competitive at the Malaysian Grand Prix . Fernando Alonso only lasted 21 laps in Sepang in his first race of the 2015 season . Button seen on the tail of Toro Rosso driver Carlos Sainz at the Sepang International Circuit . But Button was happy to see his team challenging again after a lonely Australian Grand Prix where he could only manage to nurse the car home. He told Sky Sports: 'I would rather this way around (being forced to retire) than get to the end and be nowhere. 'We were quicker than the Force India. The Sauber was there and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. It was a nice surprise but it was also good to see where our strengths and weaknesses were compared to the rest of the cars. 'It was interesting to race with other people and a little bit unexpected. It wasn't so bad, it was just a little bit messy with the pit stop and safety car.'","Both McLaren drivers forced to retire at Malaysian Grand Prix .

"Bernie Ecclestone is considering a women’s Formula One championship to give fans extra value for money during grand prix weekends. Ecclestone, the sport’s chief executive, floated the idea at a meeting with team bosses before Sunday’s Malaysian Grand Prix. If he manages to get his way, the likes of Williams test driver Susie Wolff, her counterpart at Lotus Carmen Jorda, IndyCar’s Danica Patrick and emerging British talent Alice Powell could all be handed drives. Bernie Ecclestone floated the idea at a meeting with team bosses before Sunday’s Malaysian Grand Prix . ‘I thought it would be a good idea to give them a showcase,’ said Ecclestone. ‘For some reason, women are not coming through — and not because we don’t want them. Of course we do, because they would attract a lot of attention and publicity and probably a lot of sponsors. ‘We have to start somewhere so I suggested to the teams that we have a separate championship and maybe that way we will be able to bring someone through to F1. They could race before the main event or perhaps on the Saturday qualifying day. ‘It is only a thought at the moment but I think it would be super for Formula One and the whole grand prix weekend.’ The likes of Williams test driver Susie Wolff could feature in Ecclestone's proposed women-only race . Lella Lombardi was the last woman to start a Formula One race, in 1976, and the only one to score points. Ecclestone’s support for a female series comes 15 years after he controversially joked that women should dress in white like all domestic appliances. Lotus F1 development driver Carmen Jorda is another driver who could feature in the proposed move .","Bernie Ecclestone floated the idea at a meeting with team bosses before Sunday’s Malaysian Grand Prix .

"Sebastian Vettel now has 40 victories in his grand prix career, which is just one behind the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna though the German has achieved the feat in 21 fewer races. His triumph for Ferrari ends a 34-race winless drought for the famous constructor. Their last victory came at the Spanish Grand Prix in May 2013 when Fernando Alonso triumphed in front of his home crowd. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel celebrates with his team following his triumph at the Malaysian Grand Prix . Alonso, who ended his five-year relationship with Ferrari to join McLaren, retired from the race with a cooling problem after only 21 laps as his troubled start to the season continued. Team-mate Jenson Button’s race also didn’t last the distance. This meant McLaren did not have a classified car for the first time since the 2006 United States Grand Prix, some 158 races ago. Fernando Alonso retired from the race with a cooling problem after only 21 laps . Max Verstappen became Formula One’s youngest points scorer after he finished seventh. At just 17 years and 180 days, he eclipsed Russian Daniil Kvyat’s record by exactly two years. And now with the rules preventing any driver under 18 to be given a super licence, Verstappen’s record will probably never be broken. Max Verstappen became Formula One’s youngest points scorer after he finished seventh in the race . Alonso left Ferrari under a cloud last season and Vettel’s win for the Italian constructors appeared to attract much amusement from the Lotus team. They tweeted: ‘We wonder if the TV channel has been changed in a certain Spanish driver’s room right now?’, as Vettel was presented with the winner’s trophy.","Sebastian Vettel now has 40 victories in his grand prix career .

"Roy Keane has been summonsed to court after he was accused of a road rage rant with a taxi driver at a set of traffic lights. The former Manchester United star has been ordered to attend Trafford Magistrates Court later this month for a Section 4A Public Order offence. Ex-Sunderland and Ipswich Town manager Keane, currently Republic of Ireland coach, was said to have launched into a foul-mouthed tirade and made obscene gestures after jumping out his Range Rover in Altrincham, Greater Manchester. Roy Keane, seen here at his book launch in Dublin last year, has been summonsed to appear at Trafford Magistrates Court following accusations of a road rage rant at a taxi driver in Altrincham, Manchester . Roy Keane was questioned under police caution following the alleged bust-up with taxi driver . Fateh Kerar, 44, claims the row last month was sparked when he and his female passenger spotted the TV pundit at a cash machine in nearby Hale. He says he said 'hello' to the 43-year-old and asked him to 'smile' before Keane got into his car and began following his taxi. It is then alleged that when the cars stopped at traffic lights an 'angry' Keane, who lives in Bowdon, Cheshire, got out and started acting 'very aggressive'. Police launched an investigation into the incident at 11.30am on January 30 and Keane, previously a coach at Aston Villa, was interviewed under caution by officers at a police station earlier this month. Keane coaches with the Republic of Ireland and is pictured ahead of a Euro 2016 qualifier in Germany . Keane worked alongside Paul Lambert at Aston Villa during the first part of the season .

"Brazil's 1-0 victory against Chile may have been an ill-tempered affair, but the Selecao squad seemed in high spirits during a night out in London on Sunday night. Neymar enjoyed an evening at Novikov restaurant before heading to Kensington club Boujis, where former Black Eyed Peas star apl.de.ap was also in attendance. Neymar posed for pictures with fans while clutching a can of energy drink before heading into the popular nightspot while Chelsea star Willian was accompanied by his wife Vanessa Martins.

Willian, Douglas Costa and even Brazil boss Dunga were also out in London, although they didn't join Neymar later on at the nightclub. Earlier on Sunday, Barcelona star Neymar hit out at the 'UFC' style bully-boy tactics deployed by Chile during his side's 1-0 friendly victory at the Emirates on Sunday. The 23-year-old was on the end of some tough tackling throughout the ill-tempered clash and was lucky to escape injury following a nasty stamp from Chile midfielder Gary Medel. The former Cardiff City man seemed to tread on Neymar's ankle following a challenge in the first half, but escaped with even a yellow card.

'This wasn't a game of football,' Neymar said. 'It's meant to be football not UFC. The referee is there to stop these things from happening, but there were four referees and none of them saw anything! 'It seems we have to suffer. I am a sufferer.' A Roberto Firmino strike was enough to seal victory for Dunga's side, who have now won eight games in a row since their disappointing World Cup exit. The Barcelona star is evidently in pain after Medel's stamp on Neymar's leg at the Emirates stadium . Remarkably referee Martin Atkinson didn't punish the stamp by Medel as Neymar was left writhing .","Brazil stars head to Kensington club after 1-0 friendly win against Chile .

"Brazil superstar Neymar has responded to Gary Medel's accusation of 'theatrics' by saying he does not know who the Chile midfielder is. The pair were involved in Sunday's feisty international friendly at the Emirates where Medel was fortunate not to be sent off for what appeared to be a nasty stamp on the Brazilian. After the game, which Brazil won 1-0 through Roberto Firmino's late goal, Neymar commented that he did not consider the way Medel and the Chile players approached the game to be football. Former Cardiff enforcer Gary Medel appears to stamp on Neymar during Chile's friendly with Brazil . Medel walks off nonchalantly during the feisty encounter at the Emirates on Sunday . The Brazilian was left writhing in agony, although Medel accused him  of 'theatrics' after the game . Medel responded by posting a Twitter picture of  the 23-year-old forward appearing to catch him with a tackle accompanied by the caption: 'Some engage in theatrics while others keep playing.' The Barcelona forward reignited the argument on his return to the Nou Camp, telling Mediaset: 'I don't know Medel, I don't know who he is. If he says that it is theatre, from there I will say nothing else. Only that it was a tough match.' Meanwhile, Neymar has picked up the Samba Gold Award, which recognises him as the best Brazilian player plying his trade in Europe. The Barca striker received 19 votes to beat Miranda and Felipe Melo who each collected 16 votes.

"Alexandre Lacazette scored his first international goal as France beat Denmark 2-0 in a friendly match on Sunday. Three days after slumping to its first defeat since last year's World Cup in a 3-1 loss to Brazil, the 2016 European Championship host recovered with a convincing display of attacking football. Although the hosts were less fluid in the second half and allowed Denmark more ball possession, the French were never seriously troubled.

DENMARK: Schmeichel, Wass, Kjaer, Sviatchenko (Hansen), Boilesen, Jacobsen, Kvist (Delaney), Krohn-Dehli, Eriksen (Schone), Bendtner, Vibe (Jorgensen) Lacazette scored from a rebound in the 14th minute with a powerful shot after Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel parried Antoine Griezmann's effort. Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud then doubled the hosts' lead with a shot under Schmeichel from Geoffrey Kondogbia's through ball. Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner hit the post with a header just before the interval and the visitors had a couple of chances denied by France keeper Stephane Ruffier in the second half. 'We did better during the first half, but it's logical with all the changes we made,' said France coach Didier Deschamps.

The Lyon star races away to celebrate handing his side the lead against Denmark in St Etienne . France enjoyed most of the possession in a lively first half, with Dimitri Payet adding pace and creativity in midfield. After earning his sixth cap, Lacazette and his Lyon teammate Christophe Jallet were jeered by sections of Saint-Etienne fans, whose club is involved in a fierce local rivalry with Lyon. But Lacazette's goal silenced them and the whistles stopped. The bulky forward had another chance 10 minutes later but the French league's leading scorer saw his 20-meter shot pushed out for a corner by Schmeichel. The Danish keeper looked well beaten in the next minute when Payet's angled shot ended just a few inches wide of the top corner.

Giroud made it 2-0 in the 38th minute following a devastating run from Kondogbia, who beat the Danish defense before releasing the Arsenal striker. The Danes could not find the momentum that helped them to a 3-2 win over the United States midweek and their only chance of the half came when Michael Krohn-Dehli sent in a cross for Bendtner, whose header hit the base of post. The French were less dominant in the second half and their penalty claims were waived away after Lacazette took a tumble in the area between two Danish players. Saint-Etienne keeper Stephane Ruffier enjoyed a quiet evening but made two decisive saves after the hour-mark, denying Christian Eriksen's shot and another effort from Bendtner when the visitors enjoyed a spell of dominance.

"Roy Keane's court appearance has been rearranged at the request of the defence. The former Manchester United star and current Republic of Ireland coach was due at Trafford Magistrates Court on Tuesday following an allegation that he was at the centre of a road rage rant with a taxi driver at a set of traffic lights. But the first hearing will now take place on Wednesday, April 8. Roy Keane's court appearance for an allegation that he was at the centre of a road rage rant with a taxi driver, has been rearranged at the request of the defence . Keane, seen here during a Republic of Ireland training session, has been summonsed to appear at Trafford Magistrates Court following the incident in Altrincham . Keane was with the Ireland squad and manager Martin O'Neill for Sunday night's last-gasp 1-1 Euro 2016 qualifier draw with Poland in Dublin. Sportsmail understands that the case was put back at the request of the ex-midfielder's representatives. Keane, who managed Sunderland and Ipswich Town, is not required to attend court, but the postponement suggests that he may intend to do so. He was said to have launched into a foul-mouthed tirade and made obscene gestures after jumping out his Range Rover in Altrincham, Greater Manchester on the morning of January 30.
