"It is known for its famous residents, expensive shops and huge sprawling mansions. And now it appears getting a space to lay down your iPad in the posh London district of Mayfair will cost more than anywhere else in Britain. A survey of the 10 biggest cities in Britain revealed that owning less than a square foot of property in Mayfair is likely to cost you 10 times more than purchasing exactly the same size space in Birmingham. Scroll down for video . Mayfair in London is the most expensive place to own property space measuring the size of an iPad air while Birmingham is the cheapest, analysts found as they calculated how expensive property is in Britain's cities . The study took the size of an iPad Air, which measures 9.4ins by 6.7 ins, and worked out how much it would cost to own a space the size of the gadget. It found that in London's posh Mayfair this area would cost £1,430.61, while in Birmingham this is considerably cheaper at a price of £102.85. Property website OnTheMarket.com did the survey to determine where the most expensive property area in Britain is. They used an iPad, rather than the typical measures of a square foot, so that people could visualise the space. This map shows how much it costs to buy property measuring the size of an iPad in 10 cities in Britain . The analysis used the cost of two bedroom apartments in the cities to calculate the different cost of property space across the country, and found that a slice of space in Mayfair in London would cost more than £1,400 . Birmingham is the cheapest city to 'lay down your iPad', with the small space costing around £102.85 . The cost was worked out using the average price of a two bedroom apartment in each of the 10 cities to act as a control. London, Mayfair - £1,430.61 . Manchester - £195.93 . Bristol - £183.03 . Leeds - £123.48 . Sheffield - £144.61 . Newcastle - £143.41 . Liverpool - £133.21 . Glasgow - £122.60 . Nottingham - £115.84 . Birmingham -  £102.85 . Then analysts calculated how much a slice of the property - measuring the size of an iPad - would cost to give a figure. Helen Whiteley, Commercial Director at OnTheMarket.com, said: 'The point of this analysis was to provide a clear visual example of property values and by using the iPad we provide an immediate and easy reference point to visualise a space.' Mayfair was by far the most expensive area to own the area of an iPad. And even London overall topped the list at an average price of £340.16. Lewisham, seen as one of the more up and coming boroughs in the capital, came out with a price tag of £269.58 to own a slice of land, measuring less than a square foot. The next most costly area was Manchester, where an iPad sized plot would cost £195.93. This Grade II listed property in Mayfair that had an asking price of £45million was sold less than six months ago. The mansion, in Balfour Place, boasted a staggering 19 bedrooms, seven reception rooms, six kitchens, 17 bathrooms and a roof terrace. Spread over 13,000sq/ft, the property was around 15 times the size of the average newbuild in the UK. The Arts & Craft property, built in 1891, was snapped up by a wealthy millionaire. The mansion, in Balfour Place, boasted a staggering 19 bedrooms, seven reception rooms, six kitchens, 17 bathrooms and a roof terrace . The property was marketed by Wetherell and Savills estate agents, with the deal confirmed by Peter Wetherell. Due to a confidentiality agreement, Mr Wetherell would not confirm the final price paid or who had bought it. However, if it is anywhere near the £45 million asking price, it would have been among the biggest sales of 2014. The most expensive publicly listed deal of 2014 was £50 million for a flat in Knightsbridge. The property was designed by Eustace Balfour and has a five storey brick facade. It originally featured large entertaining rooms and eight family bedrooms while the fourth and fifth floors were for staff. Over the years it has had a number owners including several industrialists, a Dowager Countess and a City of London metal-trader magnate.

"From treacherous road conditions to soggy jeans and frizzy hair - nobody enjoys cycling in the rain. But now there’s an ‘umbrella’ for bikes that’s designed to keep riders dry as they cycle along. The Leafxpro clip-on windshield, claims to enable cyclists to ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions, including rain, snow and gusty winds. Scroll down for video . The Leafxpro clip-on windshield (the basic version is illustrated), is designed to that cyclists can ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions, including rain, snow and gusty winds . Portuguese engineer and cycling enthusiast Manuel Brito, who came up with the idea, said the Leafxpro can withstand crosswinds of more than 50mph (80kph) because of its aerodynamic shape. ‘Leafxpro is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance and can be used in even the most demanding conditions,’ he said. The shield (pictured) is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance so it can be used in windy weather . ‘The resistance results showed that the kits can be used also in tougher conditions such as mountain biking as well.’ The plastic windshield will stop rain blowing into the face of a cyclist, and it shouldn’t steam up, like other more enclosed canopies. The device is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves, in just one minute. The kit weighs around 2.2lbs (1kg). It’s available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family. Prices range from £99 ($152) for the basic model to £199 (£305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat. Mr Brito, 40, said: ‘The idea of Leafxpro arose because we love cycling and it’s disappointing to have to use polluting means of transport just because of the bad weather. ‘We started thinking that there had to be an efficient, versatile and comfortable solution that would provide a sense of freedom for all people who love cycling.’ It has taken him years to design and test the product, which is a modular structure that adapts to different weather conditions. The canopy is  available to pre-order from Kickstarter in four models - Classic, Advanced, Storm and Family (pictured) .Prices range from £99 ($152) for the basic model to £199 ($305) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat . The device, which is designed to stop oncoming rain and keep a cyclist’s head and back dry, is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves. This image shows an illustration of the family version . ‘The Classic model, designed for episodes of snow, cold and light rain, turns easily into the Advanced or Storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules,’ he explained. ‘LeafXPro kits are designed for the urban cyclist, for anyone who commutes to work by bicycle, for parents wanting to cycle their kids to school or people who want to enjoy bike tours as a tourist during sightseeing.’ ‘The Classic model, designed for episodes of snow, cold and light rain, turns easily into the Advanced or Storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules,' Mr Brito said. The storm version covers a rider's head more as well as their arms . Last summer, a firm in Delft, the Netherlands, invented a simple clamp that fixes to a bike's handlebars to hold a windproof umbrella. The holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too. The umbrella's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph (113kph), because wind is directed over and around it. While its makers, Senz, cautions against riding in high winds, the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling. The clamp costs €39 (£31) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for €25 (£20) and €50 (£40).","Leafxpro clip-on windshield comes in four designs to keep cyclists dry .

"A pub-goer broke his leg as he 'tried to recreate a scene from Dirty Dancing' during a night out. Gary Mackay was drinking in a pub when a female friend jumped up and tried to wrap her legs around him like the dance move in the 1987 film. But he was left needing two bolts and a metal rod in his leg after snapping a bone while attempting the lift. Gary Mackay was left in agony after breaking his leg when a woman tried to wrap her legs around him doing a dance move in a pub in Inverness . Witnesses said the woman involved was trying to react a move from hit 1980s film Dirty Dancing . Mr Mackay, 28, was in Johnny Foxes bar in Inverness, Scotland listening to a local covers band when the accident happened. He said: 'It came out of nowhere. We were just talking about leaving - I wasn't even dancing with her. She just jumped up at me and wrapped her legs around me. 'I wasn't expecting it and I heard my leg snap. When I wasn't getting up I think the band realised and they stopped. 'I knew it was broken straight away - my foot just flopped to the side.' After he was taken  to hospital by ambulance, doctors confirmed he had broken his leg in two places at the ankle and knee and he was not released for several days. The barber needed a three-hour operation to insert two bolts and a metal rod in his leg and he now faces being off work for three months. Bar owner Don Lawson said: 'There was a mix of horseplay and alcohol which didn't end well. A man and his friend were recreating a scene from Dirty Dancing. 'He fell funny which resulted in him breaking his leg. Our primary concern is for the chap who broke his leg. We hope he makes a speedy recovery.' Mr Mackay, pictured shortly before the accident and in a picture he took from his hospital bed afterwards . The accident happened in this pub in Inverness, whose owner said 'horseplay and alcohol' were involved . Mr Mackay said he had not heard from his impromptu dance partner since the accident. He said: 'The worst thing is she's tiny - it's just the way she caught me. She's about five foot four and she's skinny. She's not been in touch but she's told my workmate she's mortified and sorry.' Mr Mackay claims he was lifted up by bouncers, taken out through the fire escape and left on a bench. 'I was screaming, I was asking for someone to get me some help. I didn't want to get up. I wanted a paramedic to come and help me. 'I remember her still standing there when I was shouting. I did hear her saying 'I heard it snap'. That's the last I remember - I was just in so much pain. 'Eventually the bouncers put their arms around me and lifted me up. They just put me on a bench outside the fire exit and left me there.' Bar owner Mr Lawson added: 'We lifted him to a safer part but he declined when we asked him if he wanted us to call an ambulance. His friends just took him. Mr Mackay says the injury was made worse when he was picked up rather than being left for an ambulance . Dirty Dancing, which starred Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, became a huge hit after its release in 1987 .","Pub-goer was out listening to a band in a bar when incident happened .

"Gathered in their hundreds, spectators crowd round to watch as two dogs are forced to fight to the death in barbaric cages. These shocking scenes from northern China drew outrage from animal rights activists in the country, who have called for a change in the law to protect the canines. But the local villagers who organised the event have defended the dogfights as necessary 'entertainment' in an isolated part of the country. Scroll down for video . Barbaric: These shocking scenes from northern China drew outrage from animal rights activists in the country . Bloody: The competition was open to anyone who brought a dog along and the winner of each bout was rewarded with a pack of cigarettes and a china mug . Spectacle: Hundreds of people turn up to watch the dogfights in northern China, which are held to mark the finale of the Spring Festival celebrations in the region . The dogfights, which lasted over several days, were organised by six villagers in Sanjiao village in Jishan county in northern China's Shanxi province to mark the finale of the Spring Festival celebrations. The competition was open to anyone who brought a dog along, and the winner of each bout was rewarded with a pack of cigarettes and a china mug. One of the organisers, Shi Pan, 45, protested that because the village was in a poor rural area, the locals had to resort to creating their own entertainment. He said: 'People in the city criticise our dogfights but they have all sorts of money to pay for entertainments which we don't have access to. We have to organise things to entertain ourselves.' While banned in some countries, dogfights are a common attraction in northern China which hosts more than 100 festivals each year attracting visitors from neighboring provinces and tourists alike. Police have said the event did not breach any laws and that there have been no official complaints. They added that some of the people who who turned up had allegedly grabbed stray dogs off the street, and claimed they were their pets. Attraction: While banned in some countries, dog fights are a common attraction in northern China . Violent: Despite the vicious scenes sparking outrage, organisers have insisted that the dogfights are part of the traditional 'entertainment' in the area . Brutal: The dogs are forced to fight to the death in cages, leading to calls from animal rights activists for new cruelty laws . Rural: Organiser Shi Pan declared the dogfights as a 'great success' and added: 'We plan to do the same thing next year' China has no animal cruelty laws, and a person who damages a dog or another animal can only be prosecuted for damaging property if the animal belongs to somebody. Dogfighting is illegal, but only if it involves bets. Simply allowing the animals to fight purely for entertainment comes into a grey area where it is difficult to prosecute anyone involved. Chung Lu, an animal rights activist in the country said, said: 'Events like these are exactly why we need a functioning animal cruelty law in China, because people do that they want and get away with it unless they know the law can stop them.' But a defiant Shi Pan said: 'It was a great success, we plan to do the same thing again next year. And we don't care what the people in the city say.'","Dogfights organised in northern China to celebrate end of Spring Festival .

"A Maryland mother and father under investigation for letting their two young children walk a mile home from the park alone have been found responsible for 'unsubstantiated' child neglect. Danielle and Alexander Meitiv, who believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, were thrust into the national spotlight just before Christmas when police found Rafi, 10 and Dvora, six, wandering the sidewalk on their own. The decision by Child Protective Services means that the CPS will keep a file on the Meitiv's open for at least five years but Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have said they will continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Scroll down for video . Hands-off: Alexander and Danielle Meitiv with their two children, Rafi (left) and Dvora (six). The Maryland Child Protective Services have deemed them responsible for 'unsubstantiated' child neglect for allowing their kids to walk home alone from the park before Christmas . Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to them. Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action. This seemingly arbitrary ability to place a family under investigation and rule against them has left the Meitiv's, who both work as scientists, furious. Incensed by the ruling of the CPS, the Meitiv's have said they will continue to allow their two young children to walk unsupervised and reject any suggestions they are bad parents - claiming that giving their children independence is their right as parents. 'We don’t feel it was appropriate for an investigation to start, much less conclude that we are responsible for some form of child neglect,' said Danielle Meitiv, who confirmed to the Washington Post that she and her husband are to appeal the decision. 'What will happen next time?' she said. 'We don’t know if we will get caught in this Kafkaesque loop again.' Indeed, the Meitiv's confirmed that they will ignore the CPS and carry on allowing their children independence that most parents would be terrified to grant their own kids. Back on December 20, police in Silver Spring picked up Rafi and Dvora walking home on a Saturday afternoon from the park after a member of the public reported it. Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitiv's make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . Defiant: Danielle and Alexander have said that they will continue to bring up their children as she sees fit . The Meitiv's told police they often let their children walk on their own and that the kids knew the area well. The CPS sent the Meitiv's a letter on February 20 informing them their investigation had been closed and told the Washington Post they would not be commenting on the process. Danielle Meitiv doesn't think she they did anything wrong in giving her children a little independence. 'We're just doing what our parents did. It was considered perfectly normal just one generation ago,' she said on Today in January. Meitiv admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before, but says she wasn't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues. 'Well I've walked home from school before. Not with my sister, but I've done it alone,' 10-year-old Rafi said. 'We walked around the block a lot and we walk home from another park which is just around the block. The Meitivs describe themselves as 'free-range parents' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world. Both parents are highly educated. Alexander Meitiv is a Research Fellow at National Institutes of Health and Danielle is an Oceanographer. Usually they have the kids carry around a card that reads 'I'm not lost. I'm a free range kid' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house. Asked what the CPS would do the next time they are called, they said they would simply follow procedure. What's wrong? Danielle Meitiv (right) appeared on the Today show in January with her 10-year-old son Rafi (center) and 6-year-old daughter Dvora about a month after Child Protective Services launched an investigation because she let the two walk home from a park alone . Parenting choice: Mrs Meitiv (pictured) says she and husband Alexander often let their children Rafi, ten, and Dvora, six, walk alone to teach them about the world . Journey: On December 20, the brother and sister were walking about a mile home from this park when a citizen called 911 after seeing the two without their parents . 'If we get a call from law enforcement or from a citizen, we are required to investigate. Our goal is the safety of children, always,' said Paula Tolson, spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Human Resources to the Washington Post. The Meitiv's espouse the current 'free-range' parenting trend, first popularized in 2008 by New York journalist Lenore Skenazy, in a piece entitled 'Why I Let My 9-Year-Old Ride the Subway Alone.' She was railing against helicopter parenting and speaking to the Washington Post said that she was appalled by the ruling against the Meitiv's. 'The go-to narrative in the last 20 or 30 years for parents was, ‘Take your eyes off your kid for even a second and he’ll be snatched.’ What the Meitiv case did was pivot the story to: ‘Give your kid one second of freedom and the government will arrest you.’ Speaking about her horror at the decision, Danielle Meitiv said she turned to her husband and felt humiliated. 'I was kind of horrified,' she said. 'You try as a parent to do what’s right. Parents try so hard. Even though I know they are wrong, it’s a painful judgment.'","Danielle and Alexander Meitiv notified of Child Protective Services decision late last month .

"Glasses might be helpful for improved vision, but a new type are being tested that allow wearers to be invisible in unwanted photographs. Invisibility Glasses by AVG, a software security company, were designed in a bid to help protect people's online identities in the digital age. With the increased use of cell phone cameras in public, the glasses makes it difficult to capture a person's identity in facial recognition software, for example the kind used on Facebook. Invisibility Glasses by AVG, a software security company, were created in a bid to help protect people's online identities in the digital age. With the increased use of cell phone cameras in public, the glasses make it difficult to capture a person's identity in facial recognition software, for example the kind used on Facebook . The glasses, through the use of infrared light and retro-reflective materials, blocks attempts to get a clear facial capture of the wearer, developers claim . The wearable technology, which does not hide the rest of the person's body, debuted on Sunday at technology showcase Pepcom in Barcelona, according to Gizmodo. The developers of the privacy glasses, AVG Innovation Labs, said that with the advancement in facial recognition technologies like Facebook's DeepFace system, they began investigating how technology can be used when it comes to securing online privacy. DeepFace will be able to determine whether two captured faces are of the same person with 97.25 per cent accuracy. And this coupled with other advancements left developers questioning how to combat privacy. The glasses, through the use of infrared LED light and retro-reflective materials, block a clear facial capture of the wearer, developers claim. The retro-reflective materials on the glasses are designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful only during flash photography (above how retro-reflective materials work on the glasses) The infrared lights, placed around the eyes and nose areas of the glasses, breaks facial detection software. However, a drawback is that some cellphone camera sensors have infrared filters that are capable of cutting off any wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum. Through the use of infrared light and retro-reflective materials, the glasses are designed to protects people's online identities. 1) Infrared LED lights: They are completely invisible to human eyes, and are only detectable by cameras which are sensitive to the wavelengths of these lights. 2) Retro-reflective materials: They are claimed to help maintain privacy at the moment that the image is actually taken. While most surfaces reflect light by diffusing or scattering it in all directions, retro-reflective materials are specially designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful during flash photography. Above, an illustration for how retro-reflective materials in the glasses work . Source: AVG . The retro-reflective materials on the glasses are designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful only during flash photography. Tanweer Ali, Senior Developer at AVG's Innovation Labs, said that they designed the glasses after exploring the increasing risks of privacy in the digital age. 'With the increasing use of cellphone cameras in public places, the possibility of your picture or video being taken unaware and ending up on the internet is ever growing,' Ali wrote in a company blog post. 'Take Google's StreetView example, when they pictured random people in objectionable places or situations such as vomiting, being arrested etc., or filming inside their home fences. 'In some countries, Google is even allowed to keep the uncensored images for six months.' He then asked: 'How much of our visual identity can we protect from unwanted privacy invaders? 'Can we hide ourselves from cameras or interfere with the face-recognition technologies?' Ali's questions highlights a report that revealed depending on a smartphone's settings, the device could be using its built-in GPS capability to embed the exact location of the user into the file of photos captured on camera, according to Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. In this process known as geotagging, if the photographs are shared online, criminals can track the user's movements based on the geotag and also find out where someone lives. Facebook automatically strips out geotags, according to the report. As the glasses are only a prototype, AVG said not to expect them on the market any time soon while they continue to explore how technology can combat privacy issues. Surprisingly, Invisibility Glasses are not the first of its kind to try and disguise people's identities. Earlier this year, Paul McCartney's DJ, Chris Holmes, debuted a line of reflective clothing that intentionally ruins paparazzi's highly-coveted photos by deflecting the light from their cameras. The collection, launched during Betabrand's Think Tank competition, includes a hooded jacket, an infinity scarf and a blazer that look like everyday pieces, but essentially act as a mirror when hit with bright light, rendering the wearer practically invisible in flash photography.

"In Darwin’s theory of evolution, life is able to evolve through a process of ‘natural selection’, where certain traits become more or less common in animals based on their benefit. And now researchers are starting to emulate the same process in robots, so that they can learn how to perform complex tasks. The research involves a similar process of selection but on a larger and faster scale, allowing artificial brains to pick out the most worthwhile traits and continue evolving. Research carried out by a team from Michigan State University used genetic algorithms to model a large population of robot brains (stock image shown). These were asked to perform tasks, such as finding the exit to a maze. Those that performed the task best had simulated 'offspring', creating a better brain . The research, led by computational biologist Dr Chris Adami from Michigan State University, involves using genetic algorithms to model a large population of robot ‘brains’ working on a task. For example, this could be finding the exit to a maze. The brains that performed the task best had the largest number of simulated ‘offspring’, meaning the smartest robots multiplied. The researchers ran this genetic algorithm over thousands, and sometimes hundreds of thousands of generations, and then downloaded the surviving brains into robots that executed the tasks in the outside world. One of the more complicated tasks the team's robots worked on required multiple machines to figure out and remember in which order they would leave a room. The robots were then asked to come back into the room, either in the same order as they left, or in the reverse order. ‘This is difficult because the robots have to ID each other,’ Dr Adami said. In December 2014 scientists mimicked evolution in the laboratory for the first time using droplets of oil. The researchers behind the study claim their work proves that a non-biological system composed of chemicals can be made to evolve. The findings mark an important step towards creating synthetic life and may also help scientists to explain how the first biological cells appeared on Earth more than 3.6 billion years ago. Evolution was long believed to be a process that only biological creatures were capable of, but recent research aimed towards creating synthetic life has begun to question that idea. Professor Lee Cronin, regius chair of chemistry at the University of Glasgow who led the new research, used a robot to create tiny oil droplets from a mixture of four chemicals. Each droplet was dropped into a petri dish of water and analysed for three different types of 'fitness' over the course of a minute using video cameras. The robot then selected the droplet that performed best and the chemical composition of this was used to replicate the experiment, tweaking the mixture slightly each time. Over the course of 21 generations, the oil droplets became more stable in the watery world in which they were being dropped. This, according to Professor Cronin, mimicked the process of natural selection, which Charles Darwin proposed for driving evolution. After the genetic algorithm had run its course, the robots seemed to solve the problem by indicating roles to each other with certain motions. Dr Adami believes that evolving robot brains in complicated worlds that force them to interact with each other is the best path toward self-aware intelligence. ‘When robots have to make models of other robots' brains, they are thinking about thinking,’ he said. ‘We believe this is the onset of consciousness.’ The researchers ran their genetic algorithm over thousands, and sometimes hundreds of thousands of generations, and then downloaded the surviving brains into robots that executed the tasks in the outside world. One of these included finding the exit to a maze (stock image shown) Charles Darwin, British naturalist, is shown here in a portrait from 1878. Darwin started his career on board the HMS 'Beagle' and spent six years surveying the South American seas. He is remembered for his momentous contributions to biology and as the originator of the theory of evolution . Thinking robots will be extraordinarily useful, Dr Adami says, adding that humanity should have no reason to fear a rise of the machines. ‘When our robots are ""born"", they will have a brain that has the capacity to learn, but only has instincts,’ he said. ‘It will take a decade or two of exploration and training for these robots to achieve human-level intelligence, just as is the case with us.’ He added: ‘Previous attempts to design human-like intelligence have failed because we don't understand how our own brains work. ‘But we know how evolution works and we can speed it up inside of a computer.’","Research was carried out by a team from Michigan State University .

"There’s been a lot of focus lately on the rise of virtual reality. But one firm has developed what it considers to be the next level in gaming - a headset that lets you control on-screen and physical objects using just your mind. In a demonstration at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, MailOnline put the technology to the test to see if it lives up to the hype. Brain power: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Australian-based Emotiv have developed what it considers to be the next level in gaming - a headset (pictured) that lets you control on-screen and physical objects using just your mind . The game was developed in partnership with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Australian-based Emotiv. A ‘driver’ is wired up to Emotiv’s electroencephalography (EEG) headset and the device is trained to read their unique brain patterns. The first step involves training the headset to learn the wearer’s ‘neutral’ state. This involves ‘clearing their brain’. They are then asked to think of a repetitive task that will associated with driving the car. This doesn't need to be a driving-related thought; it can be any thought that the wearer can continuously think and repeat. Victoria Woollaston tried out the IEEE and Emotiv technology at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Intense: MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston tries out the cutting-edge technology for herself . ‘This is the first time I’ve worn an EEG headset and expected it to be uncomfortable and intrusive, but it’s the opposite. You hardly notice you’re wearing it, although its not the most discreet wearable. ‘Training the headset took less than a minute, for both the neural and push states, but trying to clear your brain is tricky at the best of times, let alone at a noisy and busy trade show. The ‘push’ state activity can be any thought that the wearer can think about over and over again. The more precise the thought, the more accurate the pattern and command. I chose to think about the chords of Greensleeves on a piano, but this could be anything from writing your name to thinking of person’s face. As long as the thought is the same each time, the technology will work at its most efficient. During the race I didn’t realise I was moving the car because I was too busy thinking about the piano chords. My race time was nine seconds, which put me in 63rd place on the leaderboard or more than 100. It’s a very strange experience. It doesn’t feel like you’re doing anything and you can’t become immersed in the game or pay attention to the position of the cars because you’re concentrating on your thought pattern. The technology feels extremely futuristic and I can see its potential but I felt it took away from the enjoyment of playing the game.’ This is known as the ‘push’ state and for MailOnline’s test this involved thinking about playing Greensleeves on a piano and imaging the finger positions as they move through the chords. Once the headset is trained the game begins. The wheels of an on-screen car begin to spin to signal that the brain patterns are being recognised. The wearer is then asked to think about their repetitive task, at which point the car begins to move. Once the headset is trained the game begins.

The technology is currently a proof-of-concept and there are no immediate plans to release the game and headset. However, the EPOC Emotiv headset is available from $499 (£324) and it will work with existing brain-computer interface games and software that work with EEG readings.

"A mysterious San Antonio 'priest' is offering to absolve sins digitally - by taking confessions using Snapchat. However, the move has raised eyebrows among the local clergy, who fear the sacrament is being abused on the smartphone app, which deletes pictures and messages seconds after receiving them. Despite @priestDavid claiming he wants to make confession easier, others see a cynical ploy to get people to admit their failings and mistakes to a complete stranger, who has not proven he is a member of any church or even a priest. Available to hear your confession: Christian priests in San Antonio have warned against young people offering to confess their sins to @priestDavid . 'It's not confession. It's not what the sacrament is all about,' said local San Antonio priest, the Reverend Tony Vilano to News 4 in San Antonio. 'He's not a Catholic priest. The church teaches when you go to confession, you should go to a priest either behind a divider or face to face.' While it is not known what Christian denomination @priestDavid is, he claims the Snapchat confession is part of a college student's project he is helping with. He also told News 4 he wants to engage more young people and claims he has been a priest for 23-years. The confessions will be heard for two weeks from March 2 to March 16. Unethical: Confession as a sacrament is meant to be performed in person to a priest - either divided by a veil or in some cases face-to-face . Traditional: This is the way that confessions have been heard for over a thousand years . 'Doing it Snapchat, I mean, you can do Snapchat or through the internet and list everything you've done and there's no humility in there. There's no ownership of the sins you've committed,' said Rev. Vilano to News 4. Others are more damning of @priestDavid. Archdiocese of San Antonio Deacon Pat Rodgers vehemntly disagrees with using Snapchat for confessions. He said that in fact the man, if he is a priest, has gone rogue and that confessions must take place face-to-face. News 4 in San Antonio took to the street to ask the public their opinions. 'Ridiculous. Absurd. That's what the Catholic church is for. Internet is not reality. You want confession, go see a priest,' said Richard de Leon III to News 4. In a statement, the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas said: 'The Episcopal Diocese of West Texas recognizes there are various ways churches can reach out to people through social media. However, Episcopalians are not asked to present private confessions to a priest, instead confession is offered in worship, as part of the church's liturgy.'","San Antonio priest  @priestDavid offering confessions via Snapchat app .

"Hidden in a vault in Marrakesh, it has been one of the most highly-anticipated albums in music history. And tonight, after six years, the Wu-Tang Clan finally opened the handcrafted silver box that holds their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin - before sealing it away once more. In an attempt to break free from the Spotify and YouTube era of freely-shared music, rap's most influential collective is selling the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. After a private online-only sale this month through art dealers Paddle8 - which employs Britain's Princess Eugenie - the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with the group's de facto leader RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for the first and last time any of the album would be played before the year 2103. Scroll down for video . Unprecendented: This is the Wu-Tang Clan's record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin that was played on Monday night to a small group before it is sold and kept secret until the year 2103. It has been six years in the making . The record comes in a silver, jeweled box with a specially-designed wax seal and a leather-bound book . The box: It was displayed for potential buyers who are expected to pay millions to obtain the sole incarnation . The Staten Island-born group revived the East Coast as an epicenter for hip hop in the early 1990s . Confirming the rumors that she would make a guest appearance, Cher's voice bellowed out during the 13-minute extract. And though it wasn't played, DailyMail.com understands it to be true that Barcelona FC players also make a cameo appearance. Typical of the group's first record 36 Chambers, it features styles that shook the music scene in 1994 - soul samples, clips of dialogue from movies, and fierce rapping over sound effects of rain and thunder. Reiterating its own grandeur, there are regular skits and pieces of dialogue that say, 'this has never been done before.' All of the Staten Island clan's eight living members appear on it - but had no idea what they were recording when they laid down their parts. The record casing was handcrafted from silver and wood by artists in Morocco, with a seal designed and printed by wax-smiths in Serbia. 'This has never been done before,' RZA told DailyMail.com after playing the record. 'Music is just handed out now, the industry is in crisis. People feel like they deserve to have it for free. This is art. You can take a picture of the Mona Lisa but that's not art. 'The same with this: you can never reproduce it - this is the final thing.' The pre-sale event played up to the idea. Those invited were subjected to airport-style security checks, and electronic devices were confiscated. In a dark room, buyers spoke to auctioneers as light symphony music played. The nickel silver and jeweled case with black cow leather lining was sat on a podium under spotlight, with two bodyguards standing either side. While some  were fans, others were advisers who hailed from as far as Asia to inspect the 'artwork'. One adviser for a Chinese collector, who wished to remain anonymous, told DailyMail.com collectors are clamouring to get their hands on the record and its silver box - whether they like Wu-Tang or not. The box comes inside a cedar wood treasure chest covered with black cow leather and light beige velvet lining. Inside, is a cinematic-style record, plus a leather-bound 174-page manuscript printed on gilded Fedrigoni Marina parchment with lyrics, credits, tales about the recording. The adviser said: 'Someone said it would be worth $1 million. That's nothing. This is something completely different; completely new. I don't think I could put a price on it. 'The concept has not been seen before - and from the biggest rap collective in history... It is huge.' The Wu-Tang Clan formed in the early 1990s, reviving the East Coast's reputation as an epicenter for hip hop. RZA - pronounced 'rizza' - drew together nine MCs, including his own cousins who adopted the pseudonyms Ol' Dirty Bastard and GZA. The remaining slots were filled by Raekwon, Masta Killa, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Inspectah Deck. Ambition: RZA, né Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, wants the long-awaited album to be treated like a work of art . Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA (pictured) but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougar . The new album pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry . With industry domination in their sights, RZA saw that each member of the Clan was signed with different production companies, while maintaining their loyalty as a group. Their first album, 36 Chambers, was hailed as unprecedented, with samples from soul music and kung fu movies. Spanning 128 minutes, the stories and rhymes were largely recorded in Staten Island, New York, and hark back to their original mid-90s lyrics about the Shaolin. It features all eight of the original members plus some affiliate rappers. And as for Cher's cameo appearance, RZA said: 'Did nobody ever have a crush on Cher? She's the ultimate. Ain't nobody like Cher.' Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougarh - a Wu-Tang fan who visited the group's New York office five times until they took him on. Cilvaringz explains he and RZA were already developing the concept of a record charting the Wu's history when the music industry changed completely. Once Upon A Time In Shaolin has been stored in a handmade silver and nickel box embossed with the Wu's Shaolin symbol and a decorative design by Yahya, a British-Moroccan artist . Collectively, the group has produced seven albums - sometimes within months of each other . Within five years singles plummeted to the price of $0.99, and artists were streaming their work for free. Simultaneously, Cilvaringz was chairing an art festival in Morocco, where he saw three tent poles bought for thousands of dollars. 'That [was] the first time I asked myself: ""Why and how are these artists valued at such a price?"" People like Dre or Kanye or RZA are geniuses in what they do, and their music is valued at 99 cents. 'No disrespect to Andy Warhol, Basquiat, Damien Hirst, or any other artists, but if you walk down the streets and ask people randomly, ""Do you know Damien Hirst? Do you know Basquiat?"" they'll say ""Who?"" If you say, ""Do you know Dr. Dre? Do you know Kanye?,"" they'll say ""Yeah.""' The album, he says, pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry. The group became known for their business genius as they created a collective but each had their own solo contracts, thereby dominating the recording industry . 36 Chambers: This was the collective's debut album which revolutionized the hip hop scene . And despite years of disputes erupting between the clan's members, RZA insists that there was 'no tension' when he informed his brethren he had been working on a secret album, adding 'the eight members, excluding myself, are the most talented MCs I have ever encountered. They are true artists because they aren't taught. You can't teach art.' Speaking later with Genius executive editor Sasha Frere-Jones, RZA described his ambitions: 'Maybe Richard Branson will just buy it and put it on one of his planes and send it to another planet. That'd be dope!' However, Cilvaringz conceded, the fact that the buyer cannot commercialize it means that they could distribute it for free. 'I hope they don't,' RZA said. 'This is unique and something only has value if it is rare.'","Wu-Tang Clan is selling new album for millions of dollars via Paddle8 .

"There are currently more than 16,300 nuclear weapons in the world – enough to kill everyone on the planet 100 times over. Now an interactive infographic has been created that tracks the number and history of nuclear weapons in the nine nations responsible for many of these warheads. They include the US, UK, Russia, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. Between them, these nations possess 10,000 nuclear warheads, 4,100 of which are active. To view the interactive infographic click here . There are currently more than 16,300 nuclear weapons in the world – enough to kill everyone on the planet 100 times over. Now an interactive infographic has been created that tracks the number and history of nuclear weapons in the nine nations responsible for many of these warheads . The latest infographic uses data from the 'Nuclear Notebook', which since 1987 has tracked the number and type of the world's nuclear arsenals. 'I don't think people truly understand just how many of these weapons there are in the world,' said Rachel Bronson, executive director of the Bulletin, who publishes the notebook. 'The interactive is a way to see, immediately, who has nuclear weapons and when they got them, and how those numbers relate to each other. 'It is a startling experience, looking at those comparisons.' Russia and the US have most nuclear weapons, followed by the UK and France, according to the graphic. It creators, Hans Kristensen and Robert Norris, from the Federation of American Scientists say that in the past, host countries have learned of foreign nuclear weapons on their soil from the Nuclear Notebook. The left image shows a pock-marked landscape which is the the result of decades of nuclear weapons testing in the Nevada desert. There are currently more than 16,300 nuclear weapons in the world – enough to kill everyone in on the planet 100 times over. Pictured on the right is a mushroom cloud rising above the Nevada desert in 1953 . 'For instance, Japan - which was the target of two atomic bomb attacks and has a law against nuclear weapons on its territory - learned from the Notebook that there were US nuclear weapons on Chichi Jima and Iwo Jima,' the authors write. '[It also learned] about an enormous and varied US nuclear arsenal on Okinawa, US nuclear bombs stored on the mainland at Misawa and Itazuki air bases, and nuclear-armed US Navy ships stationed in Sasebo and Yokosuka.' Data for the US on the interactive map has been compiled using declassified documents from the US government, many of which were obtained using Freedom of Information requests. They combined this with figures from congressional hearings, specialty magazines, and confidential sources. 'Creating estimates for other nuclear-armed states can be more challenging because not all provide as much information as the United States,' the authors write. For instance, Britain and France have published some information about their arsenals, but much is still unavailable. A self-propelled suface to air missile during a drill shown in a North Korean drill . North Korea appears poised to expand its nuclear program over the next five years and in a worst case scenario could possess 100 atomic arms by 2020, US researchers warned last week. And cutting-edge European companies could be unwittingly contributing to Pyongyang's suspect nuclear program with their equipment diverted to the isolated country via China, they said. Unveiling the first results of what will be a 15-month study, Joel Wit, senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said some of their conclusions were very 'disturbing.' Using satellite imagery, North Korean media reports and their deep knowledge of nuclear programs, Wit, and veteran nuclear non-proliferation expert David Albright, have drawn up three possible scenarios based on the progress that Pyongyang from 2009 to 2014. In the first scenario, Pyongyang would almost double its stockpile to about 20 weapons, including plutonium-based weapons which have been miniaturized sufficiently to be mounted on its Rodong-class medium-range ballistic missile, capable of reaching Japan. In the second - and most likely scenario - North Korea continues its current trajectory and manages to produce 50 weapons by 2020. It would also make significant advances in miniaturisation technology enabling it to mount warheads on intermediate-range ballistic missiles. In what Wit dubbed 'the worst case scenario,' the North Korean stockpile would grow more rapidly to 100 weapons and make 'significant advances' in weapons designs to enable it to potentially deploy battlefield and tactical weapons. For Russia and the remaining nuclear-armed, estimates rely on information from Western intelligence organisations, expert studies, news media reports, and satellite imagery. Since the U.S unleashed the first nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki back in 1945 there have been a staggering 2056 nuclear tests recorded worldwide. It took almost a year until the next substantial tests took place but by the mid-50s and 60s, nuclear experiments were being recorded across the globe on almost a monthly basis. The threat of nuclear war that once hung over the world has eased since the Cold War amid sharp reductions in warheads but Russia and the United States, Nato's main military power, retain massively destructive nuclear arsenals. Earlier this month Nato officials said Russia's nuclear strategy appears to point to a lowering of the threshold for using nuclear weapons in any conflict. Meanwhile a separate report found that North Korea is poised to expand its nuclear program over the next five years and in a worst case scenario could possess 100 atomic arms by 2020. Unveiling the first results of what will be a 15-month study, Joel Wit, senior fellow at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said some of their conclusions were very 'disturbing.' Although the North Korea's nuclear program remains shrouded in uncertainty, Pyongyang is currently believed to have a stockpile of some 10 to 16 nuclear weapons fashioned from either plutonium or weapons-grade uranium.","It reveals stockpile changes  in the US, UK, Russia, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea .

"The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme. He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith. Muslim clerics say ISIS just hand picks certain parts of the Koran to boost their cause while ignoring other parts that contradict their selections . Meanwhile Khaled Abou El Fadl, an Islamic law scholar at the University of California, says despite its claims to the contrary, ISIS is a largely political group, borne out of the conflicts of Syria and Iraq. He said: 'The group is trying to make God a co-conspirator in a genocidal project.' Ahmed al-Dawoody, an assistant professor at the Institute for Islamic World Studies at Zayed University in Dubai, agreed. He added that the phenomenon of reading religious sources out of context has existed throughout the ages. He explained: 'We should not grant any legitimacy to those who violate Islam, then hijack it and speak on its behalf. 'This is not Islamic terror, this is terror committed by Muslims.' Muslim clerics also say that while misreading some texts, ISIS also ignore certain Koranic verses which promote mercy, preservation of life and protection of innocents, all of which are binding under Islamic Shariah law. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate' Many mainstream clerics compare the group to the Khawarij, an early sect that was so notorious for 'takfir,' or declaring other Muslims heretics for even simple sins, that it was rejected by the faith. Part of the problem in countering the group's ideology is that moderate clerics have struggled to come up with a cohesive, modern interpretation, especially of the Koranic verses connected to Muhammad's wars with his enemies. Militants often point to the Koran's ninth sura, or chapter, which includes calls for Muslims to 'fight polytheists wherever you find them' and to subdue Christians and Jews until they pay a tax. Moderate clerics counter that these verses are linked to specifics of the time and note other verses that say there is 'no force in religion.' And while moderate clerics disagree with the Islamic State group's interpretation point-by-point, at times they accept the same ideals. Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand imam of Egypt's Al-Azhar, one of Sunni Islam's most prestigious seats of learning, denounced the burning of the Jordanian pilot as a violation of Islam. But then he called for the perpetrators to be subjected to the same punishment that ISIS prescribes for those who 'wage war on Islam' - crucifixion, death or the amputation of hands and legs. There are citations in the Hadith of Muhammad of ordering beheadings, and verses in the Koran setting out rules for dealing with slaves. Most Muslims denounced the burning of a Jordanian pilot as a violation of Islam with some calling for the perpetrators to be subjected to the same punishment . Pivoting off these, ISIS contends that anyone who rejects beheadings or enslavement is not a real Muslim and has been corrupted by modern Western ideas. One ISIS cleric, Sheikh Hussein bin Mahmoud, wrote a vehement defence of beheadings after the killing of American journalist James Foley. He wrote: 'Those who pervert Islam are not those who cut off the heads of disbelievers and terrorise them but those who want (Islam) to be like Mandela or Gandhi, with no killing, no fighting, no blood or striking necks. 'Islam is the religion of battle, of cutting heads, of shedding blood.' To support beheadings, the group cites the Koran as calling on Muslims to 'strike the necks' of their enemies. But other clerics counter the verse means Muslim fighters should swiftly kill enemies in the heat of battle, and is not a call to execute captives. Sheikh Hamadah Nassar, a cleric in the ultraconservative Salafi movement said: 'It appears the Islamic State have adopted violent ideas first, then searched books of religious interpretation to find a cover for their actions.'","ISIS purport to recreate conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad .

"Opening statements in the trial of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev set for Wednesday . After two months of jury selection, a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was seated Tuesday for the federal death penalty trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The all-white panel included 10 men and eight women, 12 of whom will vote on Tsarnaev's fate at the end of a trial expected to wrap up in June. Six will serve as alternates. Opening statements in the case are scheduled for Wednesday. Tsarnaev, 21, faces 30 charges in connection with twin bombings at the finish line of the marathon April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured. He is also charged in the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days after the bombings. If the jury convicts Tsarnaev, the trial will move on to a second phase to determine his punishment. The only two options available for the jury are life in prison or the death penalty. Judge George O'Toole Jr., prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers questioned prospective jurors individually. Many potential jurors were excused when they said they had already formed an opinion on Tsarnaev's guilt or were morally opposed to the death penalty. Many others were dismissed because of personal connections to the bombings, including people who have friends or family who were near the finish line when the bombs went off or who knew first responders who treated victims. During the jury selection process, Tsarnaev's lawyers tried repeatedly to get the trial moved out of Massachusetts, saying he could not find a fair and impartial jury because of the emotional impact the bombings had in the state. O'Toole rejected three change-of-venue motions, saying the process of carefully questioning jurors to detect bias was successful in finding impartial jurors. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals twice refused to order the trial moved. The jury selection process began in early January when more than 1,350 potential jurors filled out questionnaires on their ties to the attack and their views on the death penalty. To be eligible to serve, candidates needed not to have formed a set opinion of Tsarnaev's guilt and to be willing to consider voting for execution if he was found guilty. Tsarnaev's lawyers last week asserted that the court had violated its own procedures about random selection, reordering jurors as they arrived in a way that reduced the number of black candidates questioned. Tsarnaev's attorneys on Monday offered a possible glimpse into their strategy when they argued that they need to be able to discuss the defendant's relationship with his older brother, Tamerlan, early in the trial. They described 26-year-old Tamerlan, who died following a gun battle with police three days after the bombing, as the driving force behind the attack, saying that his younger brother participated out of submissiveness.

Not to be thwarted, Mr Cluderay and Mr Needham managed to source £400,000 through loans and investments from elsewhere which has seen Approved Food achieve a £4million turnover. 'It's all very exciting and we have lots of plans to take the business further,' said father-of-two Mr Cluderay. He said his journey to success began when he was forced to have a career rethink after being made redundant from his job at an IT firm in 2001. Andy's idea didn't excite Dragons' Den investors, from left to right, Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen, Deborah Meaden, Piers Linney and Peter Jones . Inside the Approved Food warehouse which stocks a range of products from toilet roll to dog food . Bag a bargain: Slim-Fast mix  available for £.199 and 99p pineapple juice are some of the drinks on offer . Together with his wife, Nichola, the pair set up market stalls in Hull, Leeds and Doncaster selling branded chocolate, fizzy drinks and crisps which had been shunned by a range of supermarkets as they were either fast approaching or past their 'best before' date. For six years, come rain or shine, the couple, who hail from Worksop, sourced and sold the goods to a loyal band of shoppers. However, it was after taking delivery of a crate of Twinings nettle tea that Mr Cluderay said he had his 'eureka moment'. 'I suddenly realised that while there might not be the demand for nettle tea in Doncaster, if I could match the goods with customers looking to buy, I'd be on to a winner,' said Mr Cluderay, who has two sons, nine-year-old Rudi and Jay, five. While still working seven days a week on the market stalls, he utilised all his computer skills to start forming a plan to launch his business, Approved Food. Dan Cluderay (right) with his partner Andy Needham at their busy Sheffield Warehouse . Check out: The warehouse in Sheffield is dispatching 600 orders a day . Mr Cluderay also sells household products on his out-of-date goods website . 'I was working on my idea wherever I could,' said Mr Cluderay. 'Even in my son's playroom I'd be beavering away.' It was on 14 August 2008, that Mr Cluderay received his very first order, the day after his website went live. 'I'd collected the names and address of 300 people who I thought would be interested in buying products which are perfectly fine but have have just gone past their sell by date,' he said. 'I was excited sending out the list but even more excited when someone bought something the next day!' Since then, Approved Food has gone from strength to strength as thrifty mothers and other savvy shoppers make the most of items such as loo roll, dog food, sweets and sauces. 'There are only two dates people really need to know about,' explained Mr Cluderay. 'The ""best before"" date which means that the food will be at its optimum before that date and acts as a guide to the quality, and then there's the ""use by"" date which is concerned with the safety aspect. 'It's only the ""use by"" date that means food has to be eaten by then or it could make you ill, which is the case with fish and meat, for example. 'Food is perfectly fine to be eaten way past its ""best before"" date, as people know, but the large supermarkets won't do that and that's where we come in. Dan reveals how he made his millions by selling out-of-date food on tonight's Bargain Fever Britain . A Twix for 29p and 19p Special K crisps are among the deals on the Approved Food website . Busy, busy, busy: The team prepares to pack hundreds of items proving popular with shoppers . 'We sell food, such as cans of baked beans, pasta sauce, tins of tuna, which may have gone past their ""best before"" date by a few weeks, but everyone knows they will taste just the same as the products which have weeks left to run.' Mr Cluderay said they dispatch around 600 orders a day with his average shopper spending around £40 a week buying cupboard staples such as pasta, pasta sauce, flour and  toilet rolls. 'By comparison, they'd be spending around £100 at one of the major supermarkets so they're actually saving around £60 which they can then spend on something else. 'We don't touch food that has a limited shelf life such as fresh chicken and fresh fish, but we do sell hardy vegetables.' Currently operating from a huge warehouse in Sheffield and employing 50 full-time staff, he says he can imagine a time when they have bases around the world. 'I can imagine warehouses in many countries. The Germans in particular are very savvy shoppers and love branded goods, they also love English chocolate, so we get a lot of orders,' he said. 'We also sell huge Polish chocolate bars, which cost around ten pence each to buy from us which is also extremely popular. 'Our biggest customers are by far and away mothers as they're the ones usually in charge of the  purse strings and are always thinking how to feed their families. If they're happy, then so are we.' Mr Cluderay and Approved Food will be featured on the television programme Bargain Fever Britain tonight on ITV at 8pm. The show takes a look at the UK's insatiable appetite for deals and discounts and will also go behind the scenes at American wholesale giant Costco, car supermarket Motorpoint and the shoe chain Shoe Zone. USE BY... You will see 'use by' dates on food that goes off quickly, such as smoked fish, meat products and ready-prepared salads. Don't use any food or drink after the end of the 'use by' date on the label, even if it looks and smells fine. This is because using it after this date could put your health at risk. For the 'use by' date to be a valid guide, you must follow storage instructions such as ‘keep in a refrigerator’. If you don't follow these instructions, the food will spoil more quickly and you may risk food poisoning. Once a food with a ‘use by’ date on it has been opened, you also need to follow any instructions such as ‘eat within three days of opening’. But remember, if the ‘use by’ is tomorrow, then you must use the food by the end of tomorrow, even if the label says ‘eat within a week of opening’ and you have only opened the food today. If a food can be frozen its life can be extended beyond the ‘use by’ date. But make sure you follow any instructions on the pack, such as ‘cook from frozen’ or ‘defrost thoroughly before use and use within 24 hours’. Shoppers should make sure they don't risk their health by eating goods after the end of its use-by date . BEST BEFORE... ‘Best before’ dates appear on a wide range of frozen, dried, tinned and other foods. ‘Best before’ dates are about quality, not safety. When the date is passed, it doesn't mean that the food will be harmful, but it might begin to lose its flavour and texture. Eggs can be eaten after their ‘best before’ date as long as they are cooked thoroughly until both yolk and white are solid, or if they are used in dishes where they will be fully cooked such as a cake. Cooking eggs until both the white and yolk are solid will kill any bacteria, such as salmonella. People who are in ‘at-risk’ groups should only eat eggs, or food containing eggs, that have been thoroughly cooked. These groups include: babies and toddlers; elderly people; pregnant women; people who are already unwell. Every year in the UK we throw away 7.2m tonnes of food and drink, most of which could have been eaten. So think carefully before throwing away food past its ‘best before’ date. Remember, the ‘best before’ date will only be accurate if the food is stored according to the instructions on the label, such as ‘store in a cool dry place’ or ‘keep in the fridge once opened’. DISPLAY UNTIL/ SELL BY... Date marks such as ‘display until’ or ‘sell by’ often appear near or next to the ‘best before’ or ‘use by’ date. These are instructions for shop staff, not for shoppers. The important dates for you to look for are the ‘use by’ and ‘best before’ dates. Information on the NHS website .","Dan Cluderay specialises in selling out-of-date food .

"What was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime turned into a nightmare for an Australian man when the formerly fit university lecturer was left stranded in a foreign hospital for five weeks after a severe stroke. John and Christine Rose were on a holiday in Slovenia in June last year, visiting their daughter Bernadette Smon, her husband, and their grandson, when the sprightly 70-year-old suffered an unexpected and significant stroke and was rushed to hospital in the capital Ljubljana. The couple had taken out the highest level of travel insurance with Allianz Global Assistance, and despite being assured on the day of her husband's stroke that the funding needed to bring him home would be quickly provided, Mrs Rose was left helplessly begging the insurer for five weeks before any action was taken. The holiday of a lifetime turned into a nightmare for an Australian man when the formerly fit university lecturer was left stranded in a foreign hospital for five weeks after a severe stroke . John (right) and Christine Rose were on a holiday in Slovenia in June last year, visiting their daughter Bernadette Smon and their grandson (left), when the sprightly 70-year-old suffered an unexpected and significant stroke . 'The whole experience was terribly traumatic. Seeing your father have a stroke and nearly die is awful enough, and then to have the company not provide coverage just made everything worse,' Mr Rose's daughter, Bernadette Smon told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Rose had no pre-existing medical conditions, and was extremely fit for his age, riding 35 kilometres to his work on the Gold Coast each day. The stroke left the Mr Rose with severe memory loss- to the extent that he could not remember which country he was in- and without the ability to walk. Mrs Rose was initially assigned a case worker, but over the course of five weeks allegedly spoke with at least 18 different staff members with Allianz, who she claims had not read the case notes before they rang her. 'It was so upsetting to hear her be asked the same questions over and over, and to have supposedly medically trained staff ask to speak to my father who was very clearly not in a position to communicate,' Ms Smon said. 'Every day that they delayed my father declined. He lost 18 kilograms while he was in hospital, and every time my mum asked why Allianz was unable to fly my dad home they came up with an excuse,' she said. The Rose's claim that the delay in funding by Allianz prevented Mr Rose from receiving the rehab he needed . The 70-year-old (before the stroke) was rushed to hospital where he waited five weeks to be sent home . 'In emails they blamed 'world events' and 'time zone differences', which made no sense because we were checking them all the time. My father was stuck in a foreign country where neither he nor my mum spoke the language which is completely unfair,' she said. A statement from Allianz said that it was important to highlight that 'what may be interpreted as ‘taking time’ to make decisions and get someone home is actually a highly rigorous process that has the safety and well-being of the patient at the forefront of every decision.' 'Ensuring we take the time to understand the exact situation and impacting factors is paramount to ensuring a safe and secure transit home,' the statement said. Mrs Rose was informed that Allianz was waiting on a report from her husband's neurologist to confirm that he had not had a pre-existing medical condition and that their claim was valid, despite providing medical history to the company when they took out the insurance. A customer service representative allegedly told Mrs Rose that the company was trying to prove that her husband did have a condition, in order to avoid paying the claim. 'They were legitimate customers, they knew what their age was and did the smart thing and took out proper travel insurance,' said Ms Smon. 'In the end he just became a number to them, a projective cost that they didn't want to pay,' she said. Mr Rose spent five weeks in the Ljubljana Hospital in Slovenia (above), and lost 18 kilograms . Mr Rose was also not able to start rehabilitation while he was in the Slovenian hospital, as the doctors understood him to be leaving any day to go back to Australia . 'When we are informed that one our customers requires medical treatment we ensure that we are obtaining medical information from the treating medical team overseas. Coinciding with this we also request a medical report from our insured’s GP in Australia,' the statement from Allianz said. 'This allows us to have a view of any current or previous medical history our insured may have, understand whether there are any existing medical conditions we need to be mindful of when looking at repatriation options and to assess whether the claim falls within the insured’s travel cover,' 'In some instances, as was the case with the Rose family, the information provided by the GP may lead to further questions or require further clarification from other involved medical professionals. In this case we ensure we speak to all appropriate medical specialists to understand exactly what the medical history of the insured is.' Ms Smon said that the way her father was treated was very clinical and claimed that the company has lost touch with the fact that it deals primarily with people in need. 'Obviously what they forgot is that he is a father, a grandfather, and a husband, and that every minute of every day he was declining,' she said. Mr Rose was also not able to start rehabilitation while he was in the Slovenian hospital, as the doctors understood him to be leaving any day to go back to Australia. Ms Smon said that despite doctors at the Slovenian hospital recommending that Mr Rose be flown back to Australia lying down with trained medical nurses to accompany him, Allianz asked for a family member to fly with him. Mr Rose's daughter said that Allianz did not provide an ambulance to transport Mr Rose to the airport . Mr Rose with his grandson before the stroke, which left him unable to walk and significant memory problems . She said that the Chief Medical Officer of Allianz directly denied the recommendations of the hospital, which her family believes was due to the high cost of contacting the nurses. 'My father had to be put on antidepressants, and by the time he left his dosage had doubled. I cannot emphasize enough the emotional impact this had on my whole family,' Ms Smon said. 'In the end after hearing my mum talk to the 18th person I decided to get on Facebook and complain publicly and ask them what the hell they were doing,' she said. 'Within two hours I had been contacted by Allianz and the funding to send my father back to Australia was all approved. It took a public threat to make them take action, which just goes to show what kind of company they are.' Mr Rose's daughter said that Allianz did not provide an ambulance to transport Mr Rose to the airport, and had never been contacted by the company's local agent, who was meant to be organising all the paperwork on the ground. 'It was my mother and I who were standing at hospital photocopy and fax machines trying to get everything sorted. We were just left on our own,' Ms Smon said. 'Where a stretcher repatriation with 2 medical escorts is deemed the safest form of travel (as was the case with the Rose family), we must speak to airline providers to understand the availability for the transfer home – peak travel periods can make this difficult as stretcher repatriations require up to 10 economy class seats for the patient and the medical escorts,' the statement from Allianz said. Mr Rose (above left, with his wife) had no pre-existing medical conditions, and was extremely fit for his age, riding 35 kilometres to his work on the Gold Coast each day . Ms Smon said that her mother (left) has never received any follow up on the incident, despite sending multiple emails, and has been left quite traumatised by the whole experience . 'Airlines can take up to 7 days to clear a patient for travel as it requires their medical team being happy with the information as well as clearance from the engineering team. If the airline requires further medical information from the treating hospital, this can add to the time it takes to get clearance.' Ms Smon said her father's rehabilitation has been significantly delayed due to the amount of time it took to bring him back to Australia, and that he is still not able to walk up stairs and has no feeling in his left hand. 'His mental health deteriorated in the period he was there, he thought he was in Poland and kept saying how long it had been since I'd seen him when I'd visited only a few hours ago,' Ms Smon said. 'We are talking about a smart, fit, Australian man who taught IT at university, whose hard-earned money went to insurance coverage,' she said. 'We weren't trying to wrought them; we just wanted to bring him home. Now he needs a full-time carer and we are dealing with the effects of the stroke on a day to day basis.' Ms Smon said that her mother has never received any follow up on the incident, despite sending multiple emails, and has been left quite traumatised by the whole experience. 'It affects us every single day- emotionally, physically, and mentally. For us to even hear the name Allianz brings up terrible images of my dad withering away in the hospital,' Ms Smon said, . 'It was terrible and unnecessary and there was a complete lack of reality behind it all,' she said. 'You can vote with your dollar, and until people in ivory towers start to treat customers like people and not like numbers this won't get better.' 'We are glad that the Rose family has returned home safely and that we were able to cover approximately $90,000 AUD in costs to repatriate John home. Repatriations are very complex and require the safety of the patient to be at the forefront of every decision,' the statement from Allianz said. 'It is vital that the right information is received, which can at times be difficult, particularly in countries where the language and medical treatment may differ from what is standard in Australia.'","John and Christine Rose were on holiday in Slovenia in 2014 .

"Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study has warned . Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study warns today. It found that patients prescribed high doses of the painkiller for long periods were up to 63 per cent more likely to die unexpectedly. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed. Paracetamol is considered by doctors to be safer than aspirin, which can cause stomach bleeds, and ibuprofen, which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes. But British researchers who looked at studies involving 666,000 patients say the risks may have been underestimated and are calling for a major review to be conducted into the drug’s safety. They think paracetamol may be causing illness by preventing the action of an enzyme in the body called COX-2. Scientists from the Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine looked at eight studies that contained information on patients taking paracetamol daily for up to 14 years, for conditions such as arthritis and severe back pain. They also covered patients who took the medicine less often or hardly at all. Philip Conaghan, who led the research, pointed out that for most patients the risks were very small and those given paracetamol over a long period would have illnesses likely to kill them early. For this reason it was difficult to be sure the drugs were causing problems. But the professor added: ‘I am a bit worried that paracetamol at high dose for long periods could be associated with side effects that we hadn’t previously associated.’ He said patients being prescribed the drugs for long periods for arthritis or muscle and joint pain should talk to their doctor about alternative treatments, such as exercise. Published in the journal, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, the study concluded: ‘Given its high usage and availability, a systematic review of paracetamol’s efficacy and tolerability in individual conditions is warranted.’ Professor Conaghan said it was not possible from the studies to work out how the average person’s lifetime risk of a heart attack or stroke would increase if they took paracetamol for a long period. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed, for those who took the drug for longer periods . Statistically, one in six men and one in ten women will die from heart attacks, strokes and other complications of heart disease. Other scientists played down the risks. Professor Nick Bateman, who specialises in clinical toxicology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ‘Based on this study the risk is minimal. Paracetamol remains the safest analgesic available, and this study should not stop people taking it. ‘Based on these results, the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period is advised, this is common sense for all medicines.’ Paracetamol is the most commonly used painkiller in the UK and 22.5million prescriptions are handed out each year. A further 200million packs are sold over the counter. Although the NHS does not keep figures, evidence from Canada suggests that 5 per cent of the population are given at least one high dose prescription of paracetamol over the course of a year. A 2013 Oxford study warned that for every 1,000 patients on ibuprofen or a similar drug, three would suffer a heart attack within a year, of which one would be fatal.","Those taking drug for long periods up to 63% more likely to die suddenly .

"An iconic London landmark, the Grosvenor House Hotel, has been put up for sale after its owner was placed into administration by creditors. The five-star hotel, ideally situated on Park Lane across from Hyde Park, boasts 420 rooms, 74 suites and one of the largest ballrooms in Europe. Purchased by Indian conglomerate Sahara for £470 million in 2010, the company is now attempting to sell off the property, reportedly in order to raise funds for its jailed boss. London's iconic Grosvenor House Hotel is up for sale after its own was placed into administration by creditors . Sahara's  purchase of the property from the Royal Bank of Scotland was record-breaking for the hospitality industry at the time and the hotel is expected to fetch even more now. Administrators from Deloitte are working with Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) to find a buyer after Sahara defaulted on debts. Any sale, however, will not effect the current operating lease with Marriott. In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, a spokesperson for Marriott Hotels said: 'Marriott International has a long term lease agreement to operate Grosvenor House, A JW Marriott Hotel and is not directly involved in the sale or ownership of the building. 'The hotel will continue to be managed by Marriott under the terms of our existing management agreement and will continue to operate at the same high level of service that our JW Marriott guests have come to expect.' The property first opened its doors in 1929 and boasts 27 meeting rooms, over 400 guest rooms and one of the largest ballroom's in Europe . The Great Room once housed an ice rink where Queen Elizabeth II took skating lessons, but it was turned into a banqueting space in 1934 . The hotel's Great Room, which once housed an ice rink, is still one of the the capital's largest. In fact, Queen Elizabeth II herself learned how to ice skate on the rink, but it was turned into a banqueting space in 1934. Since then, many high-profile events have been hosted at the hotel, such as last year's Q Awards, with Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith in attendance, and past BAFTA ceremonies. The grand hotel, located on Park Lane across from Hyde Park, has played host to a variety of high profile events like last year's Q Awards . Aside from it's 420 well-appointed guest rooms, the property also offers 74 luxurious suites, decorated in calming beige and grey tones . Indian conglomerate, Sahara, purchased the hotel from the Royal Bank of Scotland in 2010 for a whopping £470 million . Since being purchased by Sahara over five years ago, the owner of parent company Sahara India Pariwar group, Subrata Roy, has been jailed for contempt of court after failing to return more than 200 billion rupees to investors. Those involved with the sale have reason to believe that the property will generate significant interest. Mark Wynne-Smith, global chief executive at JLL hotels and hospitality group, told the Telegraph: 'The last hotel transaction on Park Lane took place two years ago and the market has strengthened since then.' The company has opted to put the property up for sale in hopes of raising funds to be put toward the £1 billion bail for its jailed boss . The administrators, Deloitte, along with JLL are overseeing the sale, which they believe will generate a great deal of interest . Just how much the landmark hotel will bring in remains to be seen, though the 2010 purchase did fall short of the £600m price tag that was discussed at the time. Aside from The Great Room, which can seat up to 2,000 delegates, the hotel also includes 27 meeting rooms, and, more importantly, boasts a storied past.

"Actress Mariel Hemingway shuns Botox, fillers and facelifts, and chooses to age naturally. The 53-year-old, best known for her portrayal of Woody Allen's teenage lover Tracy in the film Manhattan, shopped makeup free at Erewhon in Calabasas for fresh fruits. Unlike most actresses who fight the ravages of time with the help of more and more surgery, the yoga enthusiast says she uses pumpkin peels and clay masks at night. Getting older in Hollywood is 'hard as hell,' she told People magazine in 2009. Life's the berries: Actress Mariel Hemingway shuns Botox, fillers and facelifts, and chooses to age naturally. She likes her fruit natural too. Unlike many actresses who fight the ravages of time with the help of surgery, the yoga enthusiast says she uses pumpkin peels and clay masks at night . Hemingway was akk decked out at the 2014 Creative Arts Emmy Awards in LA last August . She also admitted to trying Botox, fillers and plumpers but not liking them. Hemingway began her film career at the tender age of 14 in Lipstick in 1976. The film wasn’t considered particularly good but audiences noticed the young Hemingway girl and so did Woody Allen. Two years later, Mariel played a high school student in Manhattan for which she picked up an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her fresh faced good looks and blonde hair made her a 1980s' sex kitten. In 1983, she acted in the film, Playmate of the Year the story of Dorothy Stratten, a Playboy Playmate in 1979, who died tragically in 1980. For the film role, Mariel opted for a breast augmentation that she later replaced with smaller saline implants. The implants ruptured sending silicone into her blood that took a long time and a lengthy process to get out of her system. She admitted to using Botox injections to reduce facial lines but went public saying they made her face feel ‘all wrong..I felt bloated’. The complications of the breast augmentation put her off on any further extensive cosmetic surgery and made her willing to live with somewhat shocking facial age lines in an industry obsessed with youth. The granddaughter of writer Ernest Hemingway - who defined American fiction in the 20th century - her family history has been plagued by tragedy. Woody Allen plays harmonica to Hemingway in a scene from the 1979 film Manhattan 1979 . She told People magazine that getting older in Hollywood is, ""hard as hell."" She also admitted to trying Botox, fillers and plumpers but not liking it . Her famous family was haunted by depression, alcoholism, mental illness and five suicides over four generations. Mariel was born in 1961 only a few months after her grandfather Ernest pulled the trigger on a double-barrelled shotgun he had pressed against his forehead and blew his brains out. The idealized life that the writer was selling to the world was a coverup for the truth of his self-dramatisation and a chronic self-identity crisis, his alcoholism, and his attraction to war. His life started to fall apart when he learned his own father had shot himself in the head with a Civil War revolver. Family suicides didn’t end there. Mariel’s old sister, Margaux a very troubled and beautiful fashion model and actress, shockingly committed suicide in 1996. Margaux and another old sister, Joan had both been sexually abused by their father Jack, Ernest’s son. Somehow, Mariel escaped the sexual transgression. Her own family was riddled with alcoholism and arguing. Her younger sister, Muffet, a heavy drug used in her teens, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and spent years in mental hospitals. Now desperate to escape the cycles of severe mental health issues that have plagued the Hemingways, Mariel has remained strong and committed to a healthy life – and learning how to overcome the family demons. But at a cost of the typical Hollywood root of extensive facial plastic surgery.","Actress Mariel Hemingway, 53, shopped makeup free at Erewhon natural market in Calabasas .

High tech: The cockpit will feature all of the latest technological advances as China seeks to break into the lucrative aviation market . The single-aisle twin-engine jetliner has been designed to go head-to-head with Boeing's 737 and Airbus A320 in the lucrative aviation market. Assembly of the first prototype airframe is almost complete, says People's Daily, with the main landing gear and forward landing gear also now installed. Some major works - such as the installation of the avionics, flight control and hydraulics systems - are still to be completed. COMAC C919 . Wingspan: 35.4 metres . Cruise speed: Mach 0.76 . Maximum altitude: 12,100 metres . Passengers: 168 . BOEING 737: . Wingspan: 35.8 metres . Cruise speed: Mach 0.74 . Maximum altitude: 12,500 metres . Passengers: 210 . The various systems will then have to be fully integrated and rigorously tested before the test flight, which is scheduled to happen before the end of this year. The various parts of the aircraft - including the nose, front and middle fuselage, wings and tail sections - were designed by the corporation and manufactured in Chengdu, Shenyang and Harbin. COMAC are reported to have already secured more than 450 orders from 18 different customers, most of which are believed to be local airlines and leasing firms. The manufacturer is targeting 2017 for C919 certification, with first deliveries also scheduled for that year. China is keen to develop a successful commercial aircraft to prove it can match the developed industries of the United States and Europe. Airbus has forecast that China's domestic aviation market will become the world's biggest within the next decade. China’s air-passenger traffic will increase 8% annually from 2013 to 2032 - compared with an expected global annual growth rate of 4.8% - as many more affluent Chinese passengers take to the skies. It is hoped that an official date for the first test flight will be announced in the near future.

"This is the moment that a racist thug pushed a policewoman onto train tracks in a drunken rampage through a station. Construction worker Kevin Pythian, 32, shoved the slightly-built woman officer onto the railway line as she bravely tried to restrain him in Oxford Road Station, Manchester. Moments before he had accused a ticket inspector of being a member of Al-Qaeda and sprinted across the live tracks to get to the opposite platform. Pythian was jailed for two-and-a-half years at Minshull Street Crown Court after admitting a string of offences. The unnamed WPC can be seen lying on the railway track after being pushed by drunken thug Kevin Pythian as she tried to restrain him after a drunken rampage . The construction worker, 32, was jailed for two-and-a-half years . The court heard Pythian had been drinking in Manchester city centre when he walked into the station at around 8.55pm on February 17. Northern Rail worker Narinder Singh asked to see his ticket he replied, 'I've got a ticket, I want to see your ID'. When Mr Singh showed him his badge, Pythian said: 'I know you're Indian. I want to see your ID. As far as I know you could be Al-Qaeda.' After being spoken to by supervisor Sean Lynch, Pythian staggered to Platform 4 but then ran across the track onto Platform 3 - causing an incoming train to break sharply. He was then chased by the 36-year-old PC before a scuffle which resulted in her being thrown from the platform on to the track. The constable was knocked out and suffered a gash to the head, a broken finger and cuts and bruises. She remains off duty with her injuries. Pythian went on to punch Mr Lynch and threaten to bite his ear off before running along tracks towards Deansgate. Trains had to be halted for 11 minutes because of the incident. Pythian had only recently been freed from prison, after being jailed for 10 years for an armed robbery at a north Wales supermarket in 2009. Describing the attack on the slightly-built PC, prosecutor Barrie Darby said: 'He seemed to have calmed down and wiped his face but then he raised his hands and pushed her in the face with such force she went off the platform.' Pythian had been drinking in Manchester city centre when he walked into the station at around 8.55pm .

The police officer can be seen falling onto the railway line after being shoved by Pythian . The constable was knocked out and suffered a gash to the head, a broken finger and cuts and bruises . For the defence, Graham Robinson said: 'Having assessed the CCTV and time to reflect, he is utterly remorseful for what he has done and totally ashamed of his behaviour. Pythian, from Runcorn, Cheshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of assault, endangering rail safety and racial harassment. Judge Geoffrey Lowe said: 'You could have stopped after each of these episodes. If you had things wouldn't be nearly as bad as they are for you now.'","Kevin Pythian, 32, jailed for two-and-half-years by crown court judge .

"A couple that made headlines around the world when their baby son allegedly spontaneously burst into flames four times are back in the news after their second newborn baby son also caught fire. In the first incident in 2013 the couple's first baby, Rahul, ended up in the intensive care ward at a hospital in south-eastern India's Viluppuram District, in the Tamil Nadu State, after neighbours had heard him screaming, and rushed into the house from outside to discover the child on fire in his cot. His mother, who was working in the fields, took him to hospital and since then he has caught fire another three times, she claimed. Indian mother Rajeshwari Karnan claimed that her 10-day-old baby son (pictured) spontaneously combusted . Medics at the Government Kilpauk Hospital said that the boy had about 10 per cent burn damage to his feet . One of the first serious accounts of it appeared in the august journal Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society in 1745, which recorded how a 62-year-old Italian countess had gone to bed one night feeling ‘dull and heavy’. The next morning, all that was found in her bedroom was a pile of ash and her legs. Many other cases followed, and by 1806, one scientist thought he had the answer. In An Essay On The Combustion Of Humans, Pierre Lair suggested that the problem was the demon drink, and he subtitled his article, Products Of The Abuse Of Spirituous Liquors. The explanation that alcohol was to blame quickly caught on, especially among moralists who were against the hard stuff. In 1832, a popular Victorian magazine claimed all those who suddenly burst into flames were ‘habitually drunken’. The notion was so widespread that when Charles Dickens included an episode of spontaneous human combustion in his 1852 novel Bleak House, the victim — the villainous Mr Krook — was said to be ‘continual in liquor’. British research biologist Brian J. Ford argued in two articles, one of which appeared in the New Scientist, that spontaneous human combustion may be caused by a chemical called acetone that is produced naturally in the body, the chemical often used as a solvent in nail-varnish removers. In healthy humans, acetone is normally disposed of through urine, but when people suffer from certain illnesses, acetone levels can build up in the body, and can even be smelled on the breath. On the website Mumsnet, one poster wrote that her young daughter had 'acetone breath', and that 'apparently children have higher than normal acetone levels'. Professor Ford has noted that many of the people who have combusted spontaneously were unwell at the time, and as a result, may have developed a condition called ketosis, in which acetone in the body increases. Ketosis can have a range of causes, including alcoholism, diabetes, a high-fat diet, and even, in babies, teething. Furthermore, acetone infuses itself well into human fat. And it is also extremely flammable. Unable to find a human volunteer to test his theory that a build-up of acetone causes spontaneous human combustion, Professor Ford made a model from pieces of pork - the animal flesh that most closely approximates ours. The 'pork puppet' was marinated in acetone, dressed in clothes, and placed in a chair. Professor Ford then held up a gas lighter, and the result was dramatic. The 'body' burst into a fireball, and in under an hour, it had been completely consumed by flames. In fact, the acetone was so volatile, that even just a static spark from synthetic fabrics could have caused the conflagration. All that was left - as is so often the case with spontaneous human combustion - were the legs, which Professor Ford suggests remain unburned because there is not enough fat in that part of the body to store the flammable acetone. For a year-and-a-half, however, there have been no more incidents, until now, after the same problem returned to affect his newborn brother. The child, not named, was rushed into the Government Kilpauk Hospital by his mother, Rajeshwari Karnan, who claimed that her son's feet had spontaneously combusted while she was in the bath and that she had managed to beat out the flames before rushing him to hospital. Medics said that the boy had about 10 per cent burn damage to his feet in an incident that happened when he was 10-days-old. Rajeswari said she had heard him screaming and found his feet on fire in a repeat incident that mirrored the 'spontaneous combustion' of his older brother. After over a month in neonatal intensive care unit, the burns have healed and the baby is now fit for discharge, according to hospital dean Narayana Babu. However, social workers are now looking at the issue of whether it is safe to release the child back to his parents. He said: 'All tests reveal he is completely normal, and the parents too, went through psychiatric counselling and were found to be normal.' However medics are still reluctant to hand the child over for fears that one of the parents, they suspect the mother, is suffering from the Munchausen by proxy syndrome in which a parent seeks to harm their child in order to get attention. Child psychiatrist Shiva Prakash Srinivasan told local media: 'This need for attention is fulfilled by bringing the child into a hospital with a medical condition, and getting attention, and in this case with worldwide headlines there was certainly a lot of attention.' Spokesperson for Tulir - the Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse - Vidya Reddy said: 'From all that I have read, it definitely seems like the mother has this syndrome. It is vital that she be assessed appropriately and helped as soon as possible. Also, the child protection systems in the state must intervene in this case immediately.' Rajeshwari, 25, said the suggestion that she had caused the fire that damaged her two sons was ludicrous. She said that she and her husband Karnan Perumal, 28, had been the only ones around each time the incident happened but it was ridiculous to suggest either of them were to blame. At the time speculation had circulated around the world that baby Rahul was a victim of spontaneous human combustion. The couple also have an older daughter, Narmatha, who has not yet been a victim of the condition. Medics who suspect the mother is to blame for the incidents pointed out that the phenomenon has never been proven to exist, given the large amount of water the average human body contains. Crematoriums use at least 30 cubic metres of gas, along with 600 cubic metres of pre-heated air, to incinerate a corpse. However British research biologist Brian J. Ford argued in two articles, one of which appeared in the New Scientist, that spontaneous human combustion may be caused by a chemical called acetone that is produced naturally in the body, the chemical often used as a solvent in nail-varnish removers. In healthy humans, acetone is normally disposed of through urine, but when people suffer from certain illnesses, acetone levels can build up in the body, and can even be smelled on the breath. On the website Mumsnet, one poster wrote that her young daughter had 'acetone breath', and that 'apparently children have higher than normal acetone levels'. Professor Ford has noted that many of the people who have combusted spontaneously were unwell at the time, and as a result, may have developed a condition called ketosis, in which acetone in the body increases. Rajeshwari Karnan (pictured) has dismissed claims that she is attention-seeking by harming her babies . Ketosis can have a range of causes, including alcoholism, diabetes, a high-fat diet, and even, in babies, teething. Furthermore, acetone infuses itself well into human fat. And it is also extremely flammable. Unable to find a human volunteer to test his theory that a build-up of acetone causes spontaneous human combustion, Professor Ford made a model from pieces of pork - the animal flesh that most closely approximates ours. The 'pork puppet' was marinated in acetone, dressed in clothes, and placed in a chair. Professor Ford then held up a gas lighter, and the result was dramatic.

All that was left - as is so often the case with spontaneous human combustion - were the legs, which Professor Ford suggests remain unburned because there is not enough fat in that part of the body to store the flammable acetone. In the case of baby Rahul, doctors found average levels of acetone. But many believed the parents and a large amount of money was raised to help them after they were forced out of their village with locals fearing that the baby might start a major fire. They were even bought a new house with the money and sceptics say the family are clearly looking for another handout by producing a second burning baby.","Ten-day-old baby was rushed to Government Kilpauk Hospital in India .

"A young Australian woman is spearheading a global campaign petitioning Facebook to remove 'body shaming' emoticons and status options from the social media site. Rebecca Guzelian, along with seven other women around the world, has partnered with Endangered Bodies, an international movement challenging body image standards, to launch a campaign to remove the ‘I feel fat’ and ‘I feel ugly’ emoticons from the social media site. Ms Guzelian, a counsellor and intern psychologist, is one of over ten thousand people to back the 'Fat is not a feeling' petition, and claims that the options perpetuate and normalise body shaming, especially in young people. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Guzelian has partnered with Endangered Bodies in the 'Fat is not a feeling' campaign . Ms Guzelian launched the Australian 'Fat is not a feeling' petition and shared her personal experiences . 'When I first heard that the 'fat' and 'ugly' feelings options were made available for people to select on Facebook, I was shocked and definitely felt compelled to work alongside Endangered Bodies to do something about it,' Ms Guzelian told Daily Mail Australia. Endangered Bodies has been petitioning Facebook to remove the options from their site, and has partnered with the women to start national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website. Women from the UK, Ireland, the US, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia have partnered together to post their personal stories and experience with body shaming to promote the campaign, which has garnered  thousands of signatures in just a few days. Facebook has long held itself up as a community driven social media site, and over the ten years since it's inception, has introduced different features to reflect the habits of the millions of people on the site. The 'fat' and 'ugly' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the 'feelings' feature for status updates, along with almost 100 other emoticons that can be individualised to reflect a user's mood. Ms Guzelian said the emoticons normalise body shaming and encourages young people to use the words publicly to speak negatively about themselves. 'Encouraging this kind of 'fat talk' is not okay – and that’s exactly what Facebook is doing by offering these words as options,' Ms Guzelian said. Eight women have partnered with Endangered Bodies, a movement challenging body image standards . The eight women have all started national petitions to remove the options from all forms of the website . Psychologist Sarah McMahon from Endangered Bodies Australia, along with her colleagues from around the world, have been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced but have received no response. 'Facebook has not been listening. Not only do these features remain as emoji selections, Facebook have not addressed the critcisms that this plays in contributing to culture of body shaming,' Ms McMahon said. 'This is despite the fact Facebook claims that one of their core values is to build social value- which in this instance they are not doing. This is particularly concerning when research demonstrates that Facebook use is already associated with increased risk of eating disorders, weight concern and anxiety,' she said. '""Feeling fat"" was once the language of clinical eating disorders and it is now normative in our society. It is well documented that ""fat talk"", as using such terms is known, perpetuates body image issues and body shame rather than reduce it. Women from the UK, Ireland, the US, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia are campaigners . Endangered Bodies has been petitioning the social media giant since the status options were introduced . Over 10,000 people have signed the 'Fat is not a feeling' petition on Change.org . Ms Guzelian said that she and the other women hope that the social media giant will recognise that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues, and that it is a concern for Australians. The petition explains that '‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ are adjectives. They describe physical characteristics, NOT feelings.' 'Having these word choices completely normalises using derogatory descriptive terms in the place of real feelings. What’s worse is that these adjectives are judgemental and forced on us by society to make women (and increasingly men) feel negatively about their otherwise healthy bodies,' the petition says. 'When someone says “I feel fat” what they’re really communicating is that they feel unattractive, unhappy, embarrassed and insecure about their body. And believe it or not, these feelings are most commonly a response to the unrealistic, culturally promoted ideals of thinness and beauty that are shoved in our faces every single day.' Ms Guzelian, who works as a counsellor at The Butterfly Foundation, Australia's leading body supporting people who struggle with eating disorders and body image problems, said that young people are becoming increasingly obsessed with how they look. 'For young people, who are on Facebook from nine, ten, 11 years of age, having a huge platform like this tell them it's normal to speak about themselves like that is a huge issue.' 'Facebook encourages people to focus on and scrutinise the way they look, so as to present the best version of themselves in the online world. Doing this really places an extreme focus on the external, instead of the internal,' she said. The 'fat' and 'ugly' emoticons were first introduced in 2013 as part of the 'feelings' feature for status updates . Ms Guzelian said  that the emoticons are contributing to body shaming issues . The petition explains that '‘fat’ and ‘ugly’ are adjectives. They describe physical characteristics, NOT feelings' 'We begin to measure our worth by the way that we look – because let’s face it, Facebook isn’t the place that we are all posting about the important reasons why we are great, wonderful valuable and worthy people on the inside.' Ms Guzelian said that the campaign was as much about encouraging a positive discussion about body image as it was a bid to have the emoticons removed. 'There are things everywhere in the world that tells us to be ashamed of how we look, and why we feel bad about ourselves,' she said. 'There are cues everywhere around us, guiding us down that path and if we can prick up our ears and take notice, then we can choose to see ourselves and others in a different light.'

"A 53-year-old pastor who reportedly impregnated 20 members of congregation claims the Holy Spirit ordered him to have sex with them. Nigerian police have now arrested Timothy Ngwu for abusing the young girls and women at Vineyard Ministry of the Holy Trinity. Ngwu's abusive behaviour was finally reported to the police by his estranged wife Veronica who grew tired of his adulterous behaviour - and reportedly impregnated her young neice. A spokesperson for the Enugu State Police command told Naij.com he claims to be obeying the 'spiritual' urge to carry out the will of God, 'irrespective of whether the woman is married or not.' Ebere Amaraizu added: 'When the woman is delivered of the baby, the child remains in the ministry with the mother for life.' Pastor: Timothy Ngwu (second from right) allegedly impregnated 20 members of his congregation because 'God told him to' Ngwu told the same website he has 13 children with five different wives and the mistresses God's 'prophetic' will told him to acquire. He also claims he never had sex with any married woman unless their husbands consented to the Holy Spirit's request. Calista Omeje and Assumpta Odo both left their husbands to live with the pastor based on these holy commands. Mother-of-eight Odo said Ngwu impregnated both her and her daughter, whose age is not known. And Calista - who has 10 children with her husband - said the pastor impregnated her but the baby died. She also revealed that she 'gave' her daughter to him. The pastor's brother - who did not want to be identified - said he had warned both Ngwu and his family about the self-proclaimed clergyman's behaviour for a long time but they refused to listen. He claims the arrest is 'God's wrath falling on his brother', adding: 'God's anger has befallen my brother, we have severally appealed to him to stop what he was doing but he refused. 'He has colonised our compound, bearing children with recklessness. He accused us of being jealous of him because he is doing the will of God.' Sickening: The pastor was arrested for abusing the young girls and women (pictured) - some of whom were married . Pointing at the church's compound, he continued: 'Look at these buildings here... He has converted all of them to himself in the name of vineyard. 'He sacked his betrothed wife who has three children for him and embarked on impregnating married women and young girls. Look at the whole compound littered with children of different sex and age.' 'All members of the vineyard are fools, how can a woman abandon her husband for another man in the name of worshiping God and practice adultery? I cannot get myself involved in this matter. 'Let them sort themselves out with the police but I want the ministry to be shut down completely,' he added.'","Timothy Ngwu says he has 13 children with five wives and his mistresses .

"Former head of Knox Grammar Ian Paterson has denied touching a young woman's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys, as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse. In the second shocking day of evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, Dr Paterson said he did 'absolutely not' touch Lucy Perry, who was 15-years-old, during a rehearsal of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1989. 'They were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer,' Dr Paterson told the inquiry, under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission David Lloyd. Dr Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Knox Grammar, has provided evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse for two days . Lucy Perry, the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of Guys and Dolls. She said the action was greeted by a 'roar of approval' from young men in the crowd . Lucy Perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry, with many standing up to applaud her as she left . In explosive testimony on Wednesday, Dr Paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by Inspector Elizabeth Cullen in 1996. Ian Paterson said on Wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at Knox about whom there had been complaints, he did not give her full information. In reply to David Lloyd counsel advising the royal commission, which is inquiring into Knox's handling of sex abuse complaints, Dr Paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation. Ms Perry, 41, now the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson, the show's producer, had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between Knox and Roseville College. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and (I) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' Ms Perry was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. Knox Grammar former headmaster Ian Paterson said on Tuesday that he is 'deeply and profoundly sorry' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student . An arrest warrant has been issued for former Knox teacher Christopher Fotis after he failed to appear at a royal commission hearing last Tuesday . His testimony followed a day of evidence on Tuesday where it emerged Dr Paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years. Others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to resign and Dr Paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures. The hearing on Tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school, and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files. Dr Paterson said Knox conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities, but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or DOCs to protect the school's reputation. He said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had 'made a very silly mistake' and had 'enormous potential in the profession'. In a case involving another teacher in 1987, Dr Paterson said he sent a 15-year-old student to the library to 'think about what he said' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a 'dramatical boy' who 'liked to exaggerate stories'. Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student in 1988. He added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member. On Tuesday, Dr Paterson was questioned about former teacher Craig Treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite Dr Paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987. Treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years. Dr Paterson said former Knox general duties master Stuart Pearson called him late in 1987 and told him Treloar had shown pornography to a young student. He said he had not asked any further details, including how many boys were shown the tape, how often it had occurred or if he'd propositioned any boys. The hearing continues through Wednesday.

"Grandmother Anna Maria Thomas, 61, from Putney, London, was strangled to death by her lodger, six months after she met him at church . A lodger strangled a Mormon grandmother to death after she invited him to stay at her flat to avoid paying the so-called bedroom tax. Anna Maria Thomas, 61, asked Felix Gutierrez-Cortez to live at her two-bedroom home in Putney, south west London, after they met in June 2013 through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The 34-year-old, who previously slept rough at Clapham Junction station, moved in to act as Ms Thomas's carer but also to fill her second befroom, which would have otherwise been subject to the Government's controversial under-occupancy charge. The charge, which came into force in April 2013, limits a tenant's housing benefit  if they have an unused bedroom in their property. But the Old Bailey heard how Ms Thomas was killed by her lodger, just six months after the arrangement was made. The court heard how Ms Thomas was found strangled to death in her flat on December 10, her face swollen and her eyes bulging out of her head. She was covered with a pink duvet and propped up by a blood-soaked floral pillow, the court heard. Paramedics had gone to her flat after Gutierrez-Cortez phoned 999, saying he had found her lifeless body on the living room floor. But it later emerged that Ms Thomas had been lying dead in her flat for up to two days. The Old Bailey was told that the postmortem gave the cause of death as compression of the neck, which was most likely caused by strangulation. The Spanish-born Belgian national was today cleared by a jury of murdering his landlady, but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He has been remanded in custody to be sentenced on 24 April. Judge John Bevan QC told him: 'You have been convicted of causing Anna Thomas' death, but it is clear that you are ill and therfore you have been convicted of manslaughter and not murder.' The court heard how the pair would attend church together at St Marks in Battersea, although Gutierrez-Cortez was not with her when she was last seen alive on Sunday 8 December. The pensioner had invited Felix Gutierrez-Cortez, 34, to live with her at her two-bedroom flat in Southfields (pictured) so that she could stop her housing benefit being reduced due to the so-called bedroom tax . Prosecutor David Howker QC told the court: 'Before he lived there he had been a rough sleeper in and around Clapham Junction. 'Their cohabitation was no doubt a convenient arrangement providing him with a rent free roof over his head and it meant she would avoid the spare bedroom tax and have someone around the house.' The pensioner's last movements included a visit to church, followed by a trip to the library and Sainsbury's in the Clapham Junction area. The last sighting of her alive was when she was seen getting off the bus near her flat, two days before she was reported dead. 'The prosecution say she met her death at the hands of the defendant. Most likely on the evening of 8 December,' said Mr Howker. The court heard how Gutierrez-Cortez said he had been away since Sunday and had only returned on Tuesday to find his landlady on the floor. He later told police he had slept on the sofa from Sunday until Tuesday when he had found the body. He said she had gone into the spare room to meditate, and he had stayed in the living room for two days. Officers became concerned about his mental state when he claimed to have been a Vatican researcher. He was taken back to the police station where he was later arrested for murder. Doctors concluded he was 'extremely psychotic' and he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Gutierrez-Cortez, of no fixed address, denied murder and manslaughter, but was convicted of the lesser charge because of his mental illness. Investigating officer Detective Inspector Andy Rees had previously asked people who knew the victim to come forward. He said: 'Our investigations demonstrated that she was a caring mother and grandmother and a deeply religious woman with a wide circle of friends who will miss her deeply - I hope the conviction today provides them with a measure of comfort.' The bedroom tax restricts the amount of housing benefit that council and housing association tenants can claim. The amount of rent you can claim housing benefit for is reduced by 14 per cent if you have one 'spare' bedroom. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'Many people live with lodgers in or out of social housing and this tragic and isolated incident should not be seen as an indictment of this practice, nor of the broader policy.'","Anna Maria Thomas, 61, met Felix Gutierrez-Cortez at church in June 2013 .

"Savers have missed out on £130billion of interest payments as a result of ultra-low rates – around £5,000 for every household in the UK – a report reveals today. The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a historic low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009 at the height of the Great Recession. Almost exactly six years on, figures lay bare the crippling impact low rates have had on prudent households, including many pensioners and hard-working families. The Bank of England (pictured) slashed interest rates to a historic low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009 at the height of the Great Recession, which has had a crippling impact on prudent households . Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at savings and investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, which produced the report, said: ‘It’s been a gruelling six years for savers in the UK who have seen the income from their cash obliterated. The future doesn’t look too much rosier either. ‘While interest rate rises may be on the cards next year, when they come they are likely to be small and slow.’ Interest rates were 5 per cent in September 2008 – the month US investment banking giant Lehman Brothers collapsed. But they were cut aggressively as the global financial crisis deepened, before reaching an all-time low of 0.5 per cent on March 5, 2009. Had rates stayed at their September 2008 level, savers would have received £130billion more interest on their nest eggs, Hargreaves Lansdown found. And according to Bank of England figures, the amount of cash held in accounts that pay no interest at all has risen from £47billion to £150billion since the financial crisis struck. Laith Khalaf (pictured), a senior analyst at savings and investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the future 'doesn’t look too much rosier either' However, Mr Khalaf said that without ultra-low interest rates ‘we would almost certainly have been left in a much sorrier state by the financial crisis’. He added: ‘There have also been beneficiaries of low interest rates, most notably borrowers, who have seen their mortgage payments fall substantially.’ Bank of England governor Mark Carney has admitted low rates ‘help debtors at the expense of savers’. The Bank is expected to leave rates at 0.5 per cent again tomorrow, when the monetary policy committee finishes its latest monthly meeting. Mr Carney has suggested that rates could even be cut again – possibly to 0.25 per cent or even closer to zero – if ultra-low inflation persists. But he and other senior Bank officials have also claimed the next move in interest rates will probably be up. It is thought rates could start to rise late this year or early next year, although Mr Carney has insisted increases should be ‘limited and gradual’. Dr Ros Altmann, a government advisor and pensions expert, said the over-65s have been offered ‘a bit of relief’ through so-called pensioner bonds. These offer 2.8 per cent on one-year bonds and 4 per cent over three years. But she added: ‘Anyone younger than 65 is really struggling to make their savings pay.’","Bank of England slashed interest rates to historic 0.5% low in March 2009 .

"Renowned conductor Sir Simon Rattle is joining the London Symphony Orchestra as music director, it was confirmed yesterday. But the 60-year-old will be in Britain for only four months a year, remaining based in Germany for the sake of his wife and three children. Sir Simon, whose youngest child with Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kožená, 41, is seven months old, has directed the Berlin Philharmonic since 2002. Sir Simon (right), whose youngest child with Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kožená (left), 41, is seven months old, has directed the Berlin Philharmonic since 2002 . He said: ‘It’s crazy to be someone in their 60s with an extremely young family, but given that that’s the fact I have to think: what does my family most need?’ Sir Simon, who will join the LSO in 2017, said the move was ‘a very obvious step’. The announcement follows months of speculation that he would take up the post. Last month, Chancellor George Osborne gave his backing to a campaign led by Sir Simon to build a concert hall, and a feasibility study is now under way. The Liverpool-born conductor’s contract with the Berlin Philharmonic ends in 2018, the year after his move to London, but he said he would be working with both orchestras during that year. The feasibility study into a new concert hall for London is being led by National Theatre artistic director Nicholas Hytner, and is backed by the Chancellor and London Mayor Boris Johnson. The 60-year-old will be in Britain for only four months a year, remaining based in Germany for the sake of his wife and three children . Sir Simon said: ‘The feasibility study has been announced, which is a wonderful thing because what I wanted to do was at least be able to kick-start the conversation about the possibility of a change, of expansion.’ ‘It’s wonderful news that Nicholas Hytner is the titular head of the feasibility study because I think he has enormous experience with buildings, enormous experience of bringing culture of all types to a wider audience.’ The feasibility study is planned to report back its findings this autumn. Sir Simon said: ‘We wait with real interest.” Mr Osborne said in February: ‘Speaking to the likes of Sir Simon Rattle has impressed on me the significant artistic, educational and economic benefits that a modern concert hall would bring not just to London but the whole country.’ Sir Simon made his first appearance with the LSO in 1977, at the age of 22. He conducted the orchestra at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, performing Chariots Of Fire with actor Rowan Atkinson as Mr Bean. He has also performed with the LSO earlier this year in the Barbican Centre. Sir Simon said of his appointment: ‘During my work with the LSO over the last years, I noticed that, despite the orchestra’s long and illustrious history, they almost never refer to it. ‘Instead, refreshingly, they talk about the future - what can they make anew, what can they improve, how can they reach further into the community? ‘In terms of musical excellence, it is clear that the sky’s the limit, but equally important, in terms of philosophy, they constantly strive to be a 21st century orchestra. ‘We share a dream in which performing, teaching and learning are indivisible, with wider dissemination of art at our centre. ‘I cannot imagine a better or more inspiring way to spend my next years, and feel immensely fortunate to have the LSO as my musical family and co-conspirators.’","Sir Simon Rattle to join the London Symphony Orchestra as music director .

"Bomb disposal experts were called to a university campus after a student's experiment went wrong, creating a chemical that is 'highly volatile' and at risk of causing a huge explosion. Students had to be evacuated and emergency services called after concerns were raised about a sample of a acetone peroxide - a highly dangerous chemical often used in improvised attacks by terrorists - being accidentally turned into an explosive form at a Manchester University laboratory. The incident came just hours after a student was injured after a chemical explosion at a Liverpool University lab, which was so forceful it blew off the doors and broke windows. Emergency services: Students had to be evacuated after concerns were raised about a sample of a acetone peroxide being accidentally turned into an explosive form at a Manchester University laboratory (above) On the scene: Army bomb disposal experts and the emergency services were called to a chemistry lab in the Pariser Building shortly at Manchester University before 11.30am today . Danger: The emergency services were called after concerns were reported to police that acetone peroxide had become 'crystalised' during an experiment in a lab, making it volatile . Army bomb disposal experts and the emergency services were called to a chemistry lab in the Pariser Building shortly at Manchester University before 11.30am today. They were called after concerns were reported to police that acetone peroxide had become 'crystalised' during an experiment in a lab, making it volatile. Acetone peroxide is a highly explosive chemical made by mixing acetone, hydrogen peroxide and acid. It is extremely unstable and can explode due to mild heating or shock. It has become popular amongst terrorists and has been used in a number of improvised attacks. After emergency services were alerted the building on Sackville Street and other nearby university buildings were evacuated. Sackville Street, Whitworth Street, Princess Street and a slip-road of the Mancunian Way were closed as the police and emergency services cleared the area. Merseyside Fire and Rescue arrived at the scene in Liverpool this morning and rescued the PhD student . Paramedics arrived at the Liverpool site with the fire crews and the man was given first aid at the scene . A firefighter (left) creates a cordon while a member of Liverpool University staff (right) looks on . Police are investigating why the experiment was being carried out and what precautions had been taken. A university worker, who declined to be named, told the MEN: 'From what I've been told, they were mixing two chemicals together and it crystalised and became a threat. 'At least a couple of hundred people staff and students have been evacuated. We're just waiting for the Army bomb disposal squad to arrive. 'In our office in the George Begg building the we didn't know what was happening at first. Then university security came in and evacuated all the building.' A Manchester University spokesman said: 'The university's Pariser Building on Sackville Street was evacuated this morning after a chemical crystallised and became unstable. 'The police and fire service were called and a major incident has been declared. 'Two neighbouring buildings have been evacuated on the advice of the emergency services. We are working closely with the police and fire service who remain in charge at the scene.' Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service urged people to avoid the area but stressed the situation was 'stable at the moment'. Firefighters were called to help the man at the University of Liverpool and helped give him first aid . Liverpool University has said it is investigating the cause of the explosion which has not yet been disclosed . A spokesman said: 'There is an evacuation of the building and surrounding buildings as well as road closures. We have a 150m cordon in place and the Army bomb disposal squad have been called to assists us. 'I would stress that the situation is stable at the moment. However, it would be helpful of people and traffic would avoid the area.' Police and firefighters remained at the scene to assess the risk to the public. Just hours earlier a male PhD student had to be rescued at Liverpool University after an explosion in a laboratory. The student had to be rescued from the fourth floor of the university building at about 8.45am. Crews raced to the University's Oxford Street campus to deal with the blast which blew a door of its hinges and shattered windows. Area manager Nick Searle, from Merseyside Fire and Rescue, said: 'Firefighters were called to the fourth floor of the building and a man at the scene was given first aid by firefighters. 'We were called after a small explosion involving a chemical at the site. 'Firefighters are liaising with staff on site and are stood by with dry powder extinguishers and a hose. Paramedics were also requested to check the man who was given first aid.' A University of Liverpool spokesman said they were investigating how the incident took place.","Bomb disposal experts were called to Manchester University this morning .

"A woman who spent eight years desperately searching for her mother has finally found her after a selfie of her wearing a large 'Find My Mum’ message board went viral on Facebook. Stacey Lee had become separated from Brenda Drake in 1993 when she was just two years old after a family breakdown and she went to live with her father and two brothers. Aged 15, the schoolgirl desperately wanted to find her mother and began trawling through the electoral roll, Facebook and the internet in a bid to find her. Scroll down for video . Stacey Lee decided to make a last ditch bid to find her mother by posting this picture on Facebook . At long last: An emotional 23-year-old Stacey hugs her mother Brenda for the first time in 21 years . After eight years of being met with dead ends, 23-year-old Stacey was resigned to the fact that she would never see her mother again. However, Stacey's boyfriend, 22-year-old Martin Smith, encouraged her to create a message board made out of cardboard with her mother’s name on it along with details such as her birth date and the hospital where she was born. Stacey's friend then took a photograph of her holding the message board and posted it to her Facebook page sparking the image to be shared more than 100,000 times. Within 20 hours, Stacey had a call from a woman who said she might be her cousin and put her in touch with 46-year-old Brenda on the social media network. The Facebook messages which will lead to mother and daughter being reunited at last . Later the pair were reunited during a tearful meeting at a pub near Brenda's home in Blackpool, Lancashire. ‘When I clicked on my mum’s Facebook profile I couldn’t believe it – she looked just like me!’ said Stacey, who lives in Chorley. ‘I sent her a message and told her that I had missed her and that I wanted to build a relationship with her. ‘She sent me her phone number and I called her. I was shaking as I dialled the number and I just sat staring at the phone for 15 minutes before I made the call. ‘Mum told me that she had four other children and that she had always thought about me and my older brothers. A teary-eyed Stacey is reunited with her mother, Brenda, and meets sister Shannon, for the first time . ‘We cried together on the phone. It was very emotional and I was so happy that I had finally found her. ‘I arranged to go and meet my mum the following day in Blackpool. My arms felt like jelly for the whole journey. ‘I went to meet her in a pub and when I saw her I just hugged her and we both cried. We were in shock. It was very emotional. We look a lot like each other and I am quite shy and quiet like her.’ Stacey said she had never seen a photograph of her mother, and although she knew her name was Brenda Elizabeth Davies and that she had been born in Leyland, she didn’t know her age. ‘Growing up I had always wondered about my mum,’ said Stacey. ‘I was born in Manchester but when I was two I went to go and live with my dad, David, then two years later I moved to Runcorn to live with my granddad and two brothers. 'As I approached my teenage years, I always thought about my mum. Martin Smith came up with the idea for Stacey to post the photograph on Facebook which was shared 100,000 times and help reunite mother and daughter in just 20 hours . 'My friends had good relationships with their mums and I often wondered what it would be like to have a mother-daughter relationship. 'Occasions like Mother’s Day and Christmas Day were particularly difficult and when I reached the age of 16 I started looking for my mum on Facebook and the electoral roll. 'When I first met my partner, Martin, five years ago, I confided in him about my long-lost mother and he was so supportive. He's been my rock. 'There were times when I thought I would never be reunited with my mum. She could have passed away or moved abroad for all I knew. 'Last week Martin and I were talking about my mum again and he encouraged me to create a sandwich board and use it to look for her on Facebook. 'I had seen similar posts on social media and I just thought ""why not?"" I had nothing to lose. 'I wrote my birth date and the hospital I was born in along with my mum’s full name and birth place. 'I knew my mum might have changed her name since I was born but it was worth a shot.' Ten hours after posting the picture to her Facebook profile, the image had been shared 100,000 times, and the next day Stacey was contacted by Kerianne Davies, a friend she had known in her teenage years. Stacey said: 'I received a Facebook message from a girl I had known when I was younger. She told me that she had some information about my mum, and that she was my cousin. I was so confused, but it turned out that her father was my mum’s brother. 'I used to go round to Kerianne’s house a lot when I was a teenager, so it turned out that I had known my uncle all along! Lots to talk about: Stacey and sister Shannon share details of their lives after growing up apart . 'It was unbelievable, I couldn’t believe that I had known some of my relatives. Kerianne had the same surname as my mum’s maiden name but we never put two-and-two together because Davies is quite a common surname.' Stacey was told her mother had changed her surname and after a quick search, found her mother’s Facebook page and sent her a message. Within an hour Brenda had replied and the pair exchanged phone numbers. Brenda explained that she had changed her surname to Drake after getting married, and had moved to Blackpool soon after she had been separated from Stacey and her brothers Stuart, now 26, and Steven, now 25. She went on to have four more children, Shannon, 19, Shona, 15, Aaron, nine, and Sabrina, eight. Stacey kisses Martin who she has described as 'her rock' throughout her search . Brenda said she was delighted to finally have been able to see Stacey again and had also searched for her and her two sons. 'I regret losing contact with my three eldest children,' said Brenda. 'I thought about them a lot, especially at times like Christmas. 'I tried looking for them but I always came to a dead end. I always thought that they would come looking for me when they turned 16 but I never heard anything from them. 'When I received the Facebook message from Stacey, I just couldn’t believe it. 'She was so beautiful and I just couldn’t wait to meet her. 'Stacey is so sweet and adorable and my other children were so pleased to find out they had an older sister. 'We're all looking forward to the future and I am going to be reunited with my two sons Stuart and Steven too.'

"The US Senate failed Wednesday to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill approving construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. It's expected to be the first of many confrontations between the Republican-controlled Congress and the White House this year over energy policy. The 62-37 vote involved eight Democrats voting with all 54 Republicans. A ninth Democrat, who also favors the pipeline project, missed the vote. At best, then, the GOP would have needed four more Democratic converts to override the veto and send the package to the House for its own attempt. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . NOT A HAPPY CAMPER: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, seen in the Capitol on Feb. 23, couldn't muster enough votes to override President Obama's Keystone XL veto . NOT TODAY: Obama signed the Homeland Security Department's budget into law on Wednesday, but has no intention of signing a Keystone construction bill . Pipes sit at the TransCanada Corp. Houston Lateral Project pipe yard in Mont Belvieu, Texas, waiting to be hooked up to a massive flow of Canadian oil from Alberta's tar sands . Democrats Michael Bennet of Colorado, Tom Carper of Delaware, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana and Mark Warner of Virginia crossed party lines. Joe Donnelly of Indiana was the nonvoting supporter of the override. The same exact group of nine joined together earlier this year to give Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell enough votes to pass the bill, dubbed 'S. 1' because it was the Senate's first order of business in January. Already, the White House has issued more than a dozen veto threats on legislation favored by Republican lawmakers. The White House did not have an immediate comment on the vote, but Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted a rejoinder almost immediately. 'It seems GOP's decision to spend most of their first couple of months in charge on Keystone was not as good an idea as it seemed on paper,' he wrote on Twitter. Obama himself told Reuters in an interview Monday that he would reach a final decision on the project by the end of his term, leaving wiggle room for a future deal. And Danielle Droitsch, Canada Project director at the Natural Resources Defense Council,vlaimed Canada's 'dirty tar sands oil pipeline is simply not in America's national interest.' Proponents of the Keystone bill have said since its introduction that they didn't have the two-thirds of the Senate vote needed to override Obama's veto. They've already been discussing other way to force the pipeline's approval, either by attaching it onto must-pass spending bills or other, broader, energy legislation. 'If we don't win the battle today, we will win the war because we will find another bill to attach this pipeline to,' said North Dakota GOP Sen. John Hoeven, the chief sponsor of the bill, before the vote. Democrat Heidi Heitkamp, the state's other senator, said afterward that 'more work remains to gather additional support for this project.' 'Last Congress I successfully recruited ten Democrats to support Keystone,' she said, 'and I’m not one to back down from a fight.' McConnell pleaded with Democrats for more support of the bill, which he said advanced the president's own priorities. 'If you're interested in jobs and infrastructure and saving your party from an extreme mistake, then join us,' he said. 'Vote with us to override a partisan veto and help the president pursue priorities he's advocated in the past.' Obama has repeatedly resisted Congress' attempts to force his hand. SHORT-LIVED: Republicans signed their Keystone bill on Feb. 13 and sent it to the White House, but it came back to them with Obama's 'veto' signature . His veto of the bill, the third of his presidency, said that the bill circumvented longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border pipelines serve the national interest and cuts short consideration of its effects. The $8 billion project would transport oil extracted from Canada's tar sands to pipelines linked to Gulf Coast refineries, and would also include some oil from North Dakota. Environmentalists have framed the pipeline as a test of Obama's commitment to address climate change, arguing that it would open up a path for tar sands oil to get to market. Republicans have pushed the pipeline as a job-creating infrastructure project that will supply the U.S. with oil from a friendly neighbor, rather than unstable regimes. The State Department's analysis found that the oil would be harvested regardless of whether the pipeline is built, a conclusion that the EPA said needed to be re-examined given low oil prices. The same review said the pipeline would create thousands of jobs during construction, but ultimately it would require 35 permanent employees to maintain. State did not tackle an estimate of how many jobs the project might create in the petroelum industry as a new gusher of oil flows to the U.S. Gulf Coast.","Obama's first veto this year killed approval of the Canada-to-Texas oil pipe .

"A Chinese father who became a national hero after claiming he lived in a cave to save money for his family has now admitted he never sent a penny home - after his wife caught him out. Shi Zhiyong, 35, hit the headlines after claiming that he was sleeping in a 10-metre long cave in order to keep all of his £300-a-month pay to help his wife and two sons. Shi, who had a job as a dockworker in China's coastal Shandong province, was reported to have been sleeping in the cave for the last six months. Scroll down for video . Caveman: Shi Zhiyong partially blocks the entrance to his cave with rocks - but it is far from secure . Home: Shi reveals the cramp conditions he had been sleeping in for the last six months . Rather than pay up to £20-a-month for rent, Shi said he had decided to save every penny he could from his £300-per-month salary to send back home to his family in Handan in Hebei province. He told People's Daily: 'I have two children, aged 11 and six. I have to save up money and support the family.' But he has now admitted that he had fabricated his past and said: ’Sorry I lied. I didn't go back home for the Chinese New Year. 'I bought all my food by myself. I didn’t save money all these years and have never sent money home.' Shi had said that he sacrificed his home comforts to ensure his beloved family had more money, and is believed to have slept on simple bedding spread on the floor of the cave while lighting fires from kindling to keep warm. He kept very few belongings with him, carrying just a quilt, a radio, a water bottle and a flashlight, along with some clothes. But after his bizarre living arrangements came to national attention in China, Shi's uncle tracked him down to the top of Yao Mountain where he had been sleeping. He said: 'It’s been six years, we need to have a good hug! ‘I saw his picture from my phone today, then I searched online and confirmed it was him. He left home six years ago without a trace since.’ Confession: But Shi has now admitted he made his story up and said: 'I bought all my food by myself. I didn’t save money all these years and have never sent money home' Attention: But Shi's story was exposed when media in China became interested in his bizarre living conditions and his family tracked him down . Shi's uncle could not explain why Shi’s wife and two sons had not come to find him, nor did they explain why Shi had left home six years ago, simply adding: ’There might be some small friction.’ Shi said he was forced to carrying his meagre belongings around with him after discovering villagers had been entering the cave and looking through his things whilst he was at work. 'When I come back from work at night, often the cave had been explored top to bottom by others,' he told the Jinan Times. He had claimed that he ate at his company's cafeteria during working hours and, when there was no work available, survived on just a couple of sesame seed cakes each day. The report added that he showers just once a month at a local public bathroom. Belongings: Shi kept very few belongings with him, carrying just a quilt, a radio, a water bottle and a flashlight, along with some clothes . However, Shi yesterday abandoned the cave and his boss said Shi had resigned last April. The boss said: ’He did work as a loader and does have a family back home. He took holidays twice a year, claiming that he was going back home. He is an honest man and a hard worker.’ When Shi’s story was first reported in China, he was offered work and accommodation by more than 10 companies. Now, Shi said he wanted to ‘live life properly at home’, adding that he would put on some clean clothes and have a good wash before returning. His forgiving family - who believed he was dead - have agreed to let him return to Jinan to continue working.","Shi Zhiyong said he had been sleeping in the cave to save money .

"Self-styled revolutionary Russell Brand believes  Britain's 'corrupt' society is to blame for turning Jihadi John into a terrorist executioner. In an extraordinary ten-minute rant on YouTube, the outspoken millionaire comedian young Muslims in the UK are so disenfranchised they ‘turn to mad jihadism’. The millionaire comedian-turned-anarchist spoke out in a video blog he called: 'Could I have been Jihadi John?' He said: ‘The kernel of truth in the sprawling, bewildering, bramble of ISIS madness is society isn't working, the system isn't working, it’s totally corrupt. Scroll down for video . Controversial comedian Russell Brand posted an extraordinary ten-minute rant on YouTube saying Britian's society was to blame for turning Jihadi John into a terrorist executioner . ‘That’s the thing that resonates in the core of young people, that’s the thing that pulls them into mad jihadism.’ And he went on to muse: ‘The developing news narrative in most of its permutations doesn't address the core problems. 'If Muslims have been here in significant numbers since the fifties, why is this only happening now?’ And he heaped blame on society at large for failing to incorporate and understand the ISIS atrocities. Brand explained that while society can 'incorporate' problems like drugs, drink and homelessness, it has so far failed to understand jihadism in the same way. 'The beheadings can’t be incorporated into the main narrative of apathy, alienation, isolation,’ he said. In the outburst, Brand also accused the media of failing to address the 'core problem' behind the ISIS atrocities . Brand also explained that while society can 'incorporate' problems like drugs, drink and homelessness, it has so far failed to understand jihadism in the same way . ‘It’s merely an extreme example of something that is commonly understood. That our cultural story at the moment makes no sense. ’ In the outburst he also accused the media of failing to address the 'core problem' behind the ISIS atrocities. However, it is not the first time that Brand has spoken out about ISIS. In another Youtube rant in September, he argued that attitudes in Britain towards Muslim youth are to blame for men and women leaving the UK to join extremists abroad. Meanwhile in December, he took aim at the Australian government and Prime Minister Tony Abbot following a siege at a cafe in Sydney where two people died. Mohammed Emwazi, left, who was revealed to be ISIS executioner Jihadi John. Brand suggested that not incorporating Muslims into British society is the reason they turn to ISIS . Brand previously criticised Australian media for calling the Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, pictured, a terrorist, saying he was simply a 'mentally ill criminal' Brand criticised the way gunman Man Haron Monis was branded a terrorist by some media outlets, saying instead he was simply a mentally ill criminal. 'This man is clearly a mentally ill criminal with a long history of mental illness and criminal behaviour and lots of evidence of instability,' Brand said in a video. The comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame, amid worldwide fears about ISIS. He added: 'It's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around ISIS because currently there's an appetite to increase security measures domestically, to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends.'","The outspoken star posted an extraordinary ten-minute rant on YouTube .

"She's been keeping a pretty low profile since the end of the X Factor in December. But yesterday, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini took to Instagram to make a special announcement: she'd had a hair cut. Debuting a new bob Cheryl said: '#newdo colour is @lorealparisuk Casting Creme Gloss Berry Red 565. @percyhair thanks for the chop.' Scroll down for video . Loving her look: Cheryl posted a picture of her new hair this morning telling her Instagram fans that she is still getting used to her new look . Cheryl said her new style was inspired by a bygone era with the star saying: 'I love the 70s,' she also remarked that the cut was, 'long overdue.' This morning a natural and fresh faced looking Cheryl posted a second picture of her new look with the caption: 'Morning people .. Getting to grips with my new ""do"". The chop comes after Cheryl spent months with long hair extensions. Whilst on the X Factor she had them highlighted before swapping for a darker look once the show ended. Her hairdresser, Percy Reed, who created the new look for the singer, and whose products are available on QVC said: 'Creating a new look has been talked about for a while but this cut was just done on the spur of the moment. 'We were backstage in Cheryl's dressing room and we both knew the look we wanted to create, and so, an hour and a half later Cheryl had a completely new look. 'I wanted to give Cheryl a cut that was feminine and sexy and almost an easy, 'ready to go' cut, that daily can just fall into place. Cheryl showed off her new look on Instagram telling her followers that she was 'long overdue' a hair cut . Percy, who says his Wonderbalm is great for using on wet hair before styling, continued: 'The cut is subtly graduated with a shaggier texture. It's got a slight 70's, Joan Jett texture that keeps it cool. 'What I really like about this style is that it's so wearable and easy to maintain - it looks amazing after it's just been styled but then it also looks great the following day when it's slightly lived in and undone. Cheryl has great hair, so it's always a pleasure to cut' This isn't the first time the L'Oreal model has gone for a drastic hair-over. In the 13 years since she first shot to fame on the ITV show Pop Idol, she's tried out many different styles. She started out with glossy short black hair, has had bright highlights, long extensions and after famously being ditched from the US X Factor she came back with a brand new blonde bob. Cheryl, who is married to French entrepreneur Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, has previously described why she likes changing her hair so much. She once said: 'A different hair colour gives you a boost. It makes you feel new and different.' Here we look back over her hair-volution... Heading to a court appearance in 2003 Cheryl looks barely recognisable as the glamour puss she is today . Crazy cornrows: Performing on stage in 2003 Cheryl thought it would be a good idea to get cornrows . Supporting her man: Not long after she started dating Ashley Cole in 2004 Cheryl was spotted at an Arsenal match with this choppy blonde do that looked as though it had been inspired by Jennifer Aniston's 'Rachel' cut . By 2006 Cheryl had toned down her highlights and was rocking a half up, half down hairdo . Young and in love: Ashley Cole, Cheryl's first husband, seemed to like her blonde hair which she pulled back from her face with a little red clip . Fancy fringe: In 2007 Cheryl decided to go for the chop again, this time going for a blunt fringe - unfortunately though, her new look did not distract from her see-through top . Headband times: Pictured with her Girls Aloud band-mates in 2007 (L-R) Sarah Harding, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh, Cheryl accessorised her fringe with a coloured hairband . Getting Glam: By 2008 Cheryl was getting more and more glamorous, swapping her bangs for a softer look and adding some high-lights . Ravishing in red: As a wax work of Cheryl was unveiled at Madame Tussauds in 2010 the singer showed off a berry coloured red hair do . The X Factor disaster: In 2011 Cheryl was hired as a judge on the US X Factor, only to be dumped by Simon Cowell a few weeks later, at the time fans said she looked 'unrecognisable' with this giant do . Birthday girl: After going into hiding following her X Factor nightmare Cheryl stepped out for her 28th birthday a new woman with a new haircut, rocking a super blonde bob . Big bouffant: When she didn't feel like wearing the bob down Cheryl pulled it up into a giant beehive, like when she attended a Stylist Pick party at Home House in September 2011 . Cheryl loved this look so much that she kept it for a few months, wearing it both straight and tousled . Back to black: By June 2012 as Cheryl promoted her new album, A Million Lights, she was back to her long hair having dyed her locks considerably darker . The Fishtail: Cheryl famously loved wearing her hair in a fishtail plait prompting many others to try out her look . As Cheryl was spotted leaving Radio 1 in October 2012 it was slightly lighter hair and an injured arm . She's back! Not only did March 2014 signal the announcement that Cheryl was coming back to the UK X Factor it also gave her a chance to show off this long blonde look .

"A Nigerian woman filed for divorce from her husband because his penis was too big, according to media reports. Aisha Dannupawa, a housewife and mother-of-three, asked for her marriage to husband Ali Maizinari to be dissolved due to his large manhood. Their divorce was granted after just one week of marriage in a Islamic Sharia court in Nigeria's Zamfara State. Decision: The court in Zamfara State, Nigeria, granted the divorce. It was the first state in the country to introduce Sharia law . She told the court she had married Maizinari after her first marriage failed. As part of the local tradition, before settling into her husband's home the bride was invited to move into his parents' house. But it was only when the couple first had sex she claimed that the trauma began. 'When he came, we had sex but the experience was a nightmare. Instead of enjoying the sex, it turned out to be something else, because his penis was too big,' she told the court, according to Nigeria's Tribune. After their first unsuccessful attempt at making love, she took medication given to her by her mother. 'I told my mother the experience but she told me to endure and that with time, I will be able to cope. She then gave me some drugs,' she said to Nigerian media. According to Dannupawa, the couple had sex again but it was 'too much to bear' and the couple concluded that no drug could help their sex life or their marriage. Maizinari did not deny the accusation and told the court he was willing to dissolve the union if his dowry and money spent during the courtship was paid back. The state of Zamfara is in the north-west of the country and is approximately 500 miles away from Lagos, Nigeria's capital. It was the first state to introduce Islamic law. The average length of an erect penis is 5.2 inches (13.12 cm), according to a report released yesterday. Length: Experts plotted graphs showing the size distribution of the length of the average penis when flaccid, flaccid and stretched and erect. The graph above shows average penis length of men - in centimetres - in each percentile . Tthe average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches (9.16 cm) and 5.2 inches (13.24 cm) when flaccid but stretched. And when it comes to girth, the average erect circumference was 4.6 inches (11.66 cm) and 3.7 inches (9.31 cm) when flaccid. The British research also found there was a small correlation between the erect length of a penis and a man's height. Girth: The researchers also plotted a nomogram showing the size distribution of the girth of the average penis. The graph shows the average penis girth of men in each percentile - again in centimetres .","Aisha Dannupawa asks court to dissolve one-week old marriage .

"Yesterday, as she dazzled in diamonds and a crimson floor-length dress, Mexican First Lady Angélica Rivera looked regal enough to rival the Queen. But while the 45-year-old might look like the consummate political wife, her telenovela acting career has repeatedly come back to haunt her. Most recently, her embattled husband, President Enrique Peña Nieto, has been derided for indulging in 'soap opera politics' as scandal after scandal has engulfed him - and his First Lady. Scroll down for video . Early days: Ms Rivera's career began at 17 and she was briefly a bikini model before becoming an actress . Of all the contretemps, none has struck quite such a chord with the angry public as the ongoing controversy over Ms Rivera's purchase of a multi-million pound mansion in Mexico City in 2010. First reported by local journalist Carmen Aristegui late last year, the purchase allegedly came about after a murky deal was struck between the First Lady and a government contractor. Ms Rivera, who initially counteracted the claims by insisting that the reason the title deeds were not in her name was because she hadn't finished paying for it, was forced onto the back foot as more revelations came to light. Most concerned the involvement of Ingeniería Inmobiliaria del Centro, a subsidiary of Grupo Higa, a key government contractor. The business, in whose name the property is held, had been granted more than $8bn pesos (£377m) in construction projects during Peña Nieto's tenure as governor of Mexico State. All change: Yesterday saw Ms Rivera, resplendent in a cream ensemble, meet the Queen in London . Honour: She later attended a state dinner at Buckingham Palace with the Queen and Prince Philip . Chic: Ms Rivera won plaudits from critics for her striking choice of outfit, including serious jewels . Interestingly, days before the report emerged, a high speed rail contract handed to Constructora Teya, an affiliate of Grupo Higa, was mysteriously cancelled. With suspicions mounting and Peña Nieto being accused of fostering the sort of corruption he had campaigned to put an end to during the 2012 presidential campaign, a chastened Rivera appeared on national television to announce she intended to sell the house and had 'nothing to hide'. 'I have taken the decision to sell my interest in the purchase contract of the house,' she announced. 'I have nothing to hide. 'I don’t want this to continue to be a pretext to offend and defame my family. Today, I am here to defend my integrity, that of my children and of my husband.' Whatever the truth of the matter, there is no doubt that the scandal, coming hot on the heels of the disappearance of 43 student teachers, was a disaster for the Peña Nieto regime. Considered handsome but dim by most voters during the 2012 presidential campaign, tough economic reforms sent his popularity ratings tumbling, while the furore over the students could prove terminal. Peña Nieto, who had come to power pledging to end the bloody rule of the drug cartels, mishandled the situation, say critics, when in September last year, 43 students were kidnapped in Iguala. While the precise details of what happened remain unclear, what is known is that the men were handed over to the Guerreros Unidos crime syndicate and, according to the Mexican government, murdered and their bodies burned. Expenses: The latest scandal is about a 2010 house purchase, while Ms Rivera was still a soap actress . Soap star: Ms Rivera was once a familiar face on Mexican TV thanks to her soap acting career . Performer: Ms Rivera in Destilando amor (left) and dressed up for the red carpet at a press event (right) The crime immediately sparked nationwide protests which intensified when Iguala's mayor, José Luis Abarca Velázquez, and his wife María de los Ángeles Pineda Villa, were accused of masterminding the massacre. Worse still, a number of police officers were also implicated - putting paid, in the process, to Peña Nieto's claims that his anti-cartel war was being won. And the controversy is still not over - even as the embattled Peña Nieto and Ms Rivera flew into London on Monday, critics were questioning whether the visit should go ahead. David Cameron, who will meet Peña Nieto at Downing Street today, has also said that he plans to raise the issue of human rights abuses with the Mexican President. Such controversy is all a far cry from the early days of Ms Rivera's career when, as a fresh-faced 17-year-old in Mexico City, she entered a newspaper modelling competition and won. Risque: Her sometimes racy soap career has made Ms Rivera one of Mexico's most colourful public figures . Clinch: Since becoming First Lady, she has toned down her look and given up her telenovela career . Romance: The couple were pictured in 2008 at a football match. Ms Rivera was still married at the time . That early success launched a career that would go on to include a brief spell as a swimwear model followed by a move into acting, starting in 1989 when she won a small part in telenovela Dulce Desafío. A long - and apparently lucrative - career, most of it spent at Mexico's largest broadcaster Televisa, was born, with Ms Rivera going on to star in succession of low-budget soaps, among them Alcanzar una estrella II and, most recently, Destilando amor. But her biggest coup came in 2008 when she was hired by Peña Nieto to help publicise his work as state governor. Ms Rivera, then still married to her ex-husband, TV producer José Alberto Castro, with whom she has three daughters, was smitten by the charismatic Peña Nieto. The pair swiftly became an item and in 2010, she married the widowed Peña Nieto in a ceremony attended by her daughters and his three children, Paulina, Alejandro and Nicole. Even then, however, the marriage wasn't without controversy, with critics pointing to rumours of affairs during his first marriage to Mónica Pretelini. Lucky break: Ms Rivera in bridal white at her wedding to President Peña Nieto in 2010 . Support: During the 2012 presidential election, Ms Rivera was a constant presence at Peña Nieto's side . First Lady: Since Peña Nieto took office, Ms Rivera has embraced a more conservative style of dressing . Following Peña Nieto's election in 2012, the Washington Post noted of his marriage to Ms Pretelli, who died in 2007, that: 'Women love him and he had extramarital affairs.' Presumably, those 'extramarital affairs' are now a thing of the past, with Ms Rivera now in charge of an increasingly public portfolio, not least her installation as president of DIF (National System for Integral Family Development) in 2013. She is also a constant presence at the president's side, always immaculately, if conservatively, dressed - a far cry from the racy outfits she favoured during her soap star days. The acting career is also gone, with Ms Rivera declaring her intention to focus on 'this great responsibility by his side' shortly after her husband was elected. But with scandal after scandal hitting the Peña Nieto regime, it seems the days of starring in soap operas aren't quite over yet. All smiles: But while Ms Rivera smiled and chatted to Prince Philip, she is mired in scandal at home .

"A genetic condition has left Jen Scheuermann  paralyzed since 2003, but revolutionary new technology is allowing her the ability to feed herself chocolate, give high fives and even fly a fighter jet. Last week, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (known as DARPA), unveiled the amazing results of a two-year experiment involving the 55-year-old quadriplegic woman, which they carried out in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Scheuermann agreed to let the super-secretive agency surgically implant pea-sized probes into her brain as they sought a way to turn her thought to actions. Scroll down for video . Revolutionary: Jen Sheuermann (right), who suffers from quadriplegia, is now able to move a robotic arm thanks to technology being developed by DARPA . Amazing: DARPA implanted two pea-sized probes into Sheuermann's brain two years ago to find a way to turn her thoughts into actions - like feeding herself a bar of chocolate . The experiment was a success as the research team was able to successfully translate Scheuermann's brain movements to a robotic arm, which was then able to move on her behalf to move a chocolate bar to her mouth and make gestures like a thumbs up. In addition to moving a robotic arm, Scheuermann was also able to experience piloting a plane with the same technology. The research team let Scheuermann connect to a flight simulator, where she had amazing results flying an F-35 jet and Cessna airplane not with a joystick - but with her thoughts alone. While the results give hope to anyone who suffers from limited mobility, they also draw up questions about whether the technology could be used for destructive purposes - such as soldiers controlling surrogate versions with their minds, out of combat. The ability to fly: Researchers also found a way to hook Scheuermann up to a flight simulator, and she was able to use the device to fly a F-35 and Cessna with her mind . 'In doing that work, we can now see the future where we can free the brain from the limitations of the human body,' DARPA Director Arati Prabhakar said at the New America Foundation forum in Washington last week. 'We can only imagine amazing good things and amazing potentially bad things that are on the other side of that door.'

"A 'white witch' who abused young girls, the youngest of whom was just four, over a period covering three decades, has been jailed for 22 years. Redvers 'Barney' Barnard claimed that he was a Pagan who practiced healing 'white magic'. But a Manchester Crown Court trial heard he was a 'terrifying' figure who manipulated and abused young girls in Greater Manchester over a twenty-year period. Redvers Barnard, pictured, has been jailed for 22 years for abusing young girls over a three decades . The court heard that Redvers began abusing one underage victim, before raping her. Then he took indecent photographs of the youngster. She was subjected to such 'grooming and coercion' the sex continued into her adulthood. By that time, Barnard was also abusing two other young girls. The court heard that Barnard raped one of these girls and forced the second one into lewd acts. Barnard also abused three other young girls at addresses in Salford, bringing the total number of victims to six. Barnard, 56, formerly of Eccles, was branded a dangerous offender by the judge shortly after being found guilty of abusing his six victims, who were as young as four when the abuse began. He had denied all the offences, which stretched back to the early eighties, claiming the victims were all lying. Manchester Crown Court, pictured,  heard that Barnard must serve at least two-thirds of his 22-year sentence . Barnard, who was last living in Middlesbrough, Teesside, has now been jailed for 22 years, with an extended licence period for the public protection. This means that unlike ordinary prisoners, he must serve at least two-thirds of his sentence, rather than half, and can only be released when the parole board think it is safe to do so. Even after his release, he will remain at risk of being recalled to prison until 2042. In total, Barnard was found guilty of three rapes and sixteen indecent assaults. Sending him down, Judge Michael Henshell said Barnard, formerly known as Peter Barnard, had treated his victims as his 'sexual property' and bullied them into keeping quiet. 'I'm abundantly satisfied you are a dangerous individual so far as children and sexual offending is concerned. 'Throughout your life you have demonstrated you are sexually attracted to young girls. You are also highly manipulative and have used coercion. You have corrupted children and by turns terrified them', the judge added. Thanking the jury, the judge added: 'At a time when matters of this nature are on the news everyday...you have seen at first-hand the ordeal faced by people recounting events from their childhood.'","Redvers Barnard claimed that he was a 'white witch' to heal people .

"A massive sinkhole has opened up just yards from the fence of a prison - but officials insist there is no chance of any inmates escaping. The hole first appeared just outside the walls of HMP The Mount in Bovingdon, Hertforshire in January. Staff at the 770-capacity prison filled the sinkhole with soil and concrete - but it re-emerged and is now believed to be about 6ft wide and 15ft deep. A massive sinkhole has opened up close to the fence of HMP The Mount Prison - but officials insist there is no chance of any inmates escaping . A 15ft sinkhole has emerged yards from the walls of HMP The Mount Prison in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire . The Mount, operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, opened as a young offenders institution in 1987 on the site of a former RAF station . It was immediately fenced off but officials at the category C jail have refused to confirm the exact size and depth. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We are aware of an issue regarding the land next to HMP The Mount and are working to resolve it. 'There is no risk to members of the public, prisoners or prison staff as the area has been fenced off and is on private property with no public access. 'We are still in discussions with the Homes and Communities Agency regarding future options for the surplus land. 'The Ministry of Justice is required to dispose of any surplus property as quickly as possible while ensuring we get the best value for taxpayers' money.' The Ministry of Justice insist there is no chance of inmates escaping - even though the hole has emerged close to the prison . Local resident Ross Butcher, 32, said: 'All of us had a right laugh about it at the beginning and kept comparing it to the Shawshank Redemption or something. 'I still haven't ruled out the possibility that some prisoners will just pop out of it. It's only a couple hundred yards from the prison fence. 'There is some concern that more could appear as that land has already been earmarked for a housing development.' The hole comes after a similar crater opened up in nearby Hemel Hempstead, Hertforshire, last February. It is believed to have been caused by former chalk mines beneath the surface of the ground being exacerbated by the previous winter's heavy rain. The Mount, operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, opened as a young offenders institution in 1987 on the site of a former RAF station. Over the years it changed into a prison for adult males. It is classed as category C meaning it is a closed prison for inmates 'who cannot be trusted in open conditions but who are unlikely to try to escape'.","Sinkhole appeared outside HMP The Mount in Bovingdon, Hertfordshire .

"A man who found a travel partner after raffling his ex-fiancee's honeymoon place has returned from an 'amazing holiday' - but claims there was no romance. John Whitbread, 32, - who became known as Jilted John - advertised on eBay after his girlfriend told him at Christmas she did not want to get married. Desperate to find a holiday partner for the £1,950 trip to the Dominican Republic, John, from Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, tried to find a companion for the trip on eBay. Scroll down for video . The pair were united on live television just under two hours before they will board the flight to the Dominican Republic . John Whitbread went in for a hug as he met raffle winner Kelly for the first time at the airport this morning . But he was left frustrated after the two highest bidders both failed in turnup to pay the winning sum for the holiday - which included all-inclusive accommodation at a four-star luxury resort. Finally, after instead selling £10 raffle tickets - raising £1,410 for testicular cancer charity Balls To Cancer he jetted off to the Caribbean with lucky winner Kelly Wood - who he met for the first time at the airport. John said he is constantly asked if they have become a couple. But he said this could not have been further from his mind. He said : 'Everyone is hoping I've found romance again. Obviously not. I only recently split up with my girlfriend.' He added: 'I have made a friend out of it and it's brilliant. It could have easily gone the other way. 'To go on holiday with a complete stranger and get on is incredible. The pair admitted they were both feeling the nerves, as Miss Wood told Good Morning Britain her hands were shaking and Mr Whitbread said he didn't know what to do with himself . 'Hopefully we will stay friends. I don't see why not.' Ms Wood, an attractive blonde, wrote on Facebook: 'We are having a fantastic time and getting on like a house on fire as they say!' She later added: 'Such great memories to take away with me though and an amazing new friend for life!! John Whitbread was dumped by his ex-fiancee Amy just weeks before their Valentine's Day wedding . 'Loved every second of this crazy adventure!! Couldn't have asked for more!!' Mr Whitbread was left heartbroken after his ex-fiancée Amy told him she wasn't 'ready to get married' and left him with a spare ticket to the Dominican Republic. Instead of cancelling the trip, Mr Whitbread decided to give the opportunity to a stranger to join him by auctioning off the £1,950 ticket, with offers starting at 99p. But when the two highest bidders - who offered £8,000 and £7,900 - failed to pay up he decided to raffle off the tickets for £10 instead. He was united with raffle winner Kelly Wood for the first time on ITV just under two hours before he was due to board the plane at Manchester airport for the two-week all inclusive break. The advert said his desired companion must be an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss'. Arriving at the airport with his parents, Mr Whitbread waited anxiously to see if the woman would arrive. He said: 'I feel nervous. I don't know what to do with myself. I know her name is Kelly and what she looks like but I'm trying to save it all for the plane.' Mr Whitbread was undecided on how he would greet her and was debating whether to give her a hug, a kiss - or 'a high five' and added 'I'll see what comes naturally'. When they were finally introduced by a television crew they gave each other a hug. Instead of cancelling the honeymoon he decided to auction off the tickets to a stranger who might like to join him. The two highest eBay bidders failed to pay up, so he decided to sell raffle tickets instead . Miss Wood, who had set up her own Facebook campaign called 'Take Kelly Wood' said: 'I'm nervous - my hands have just started to shake. I feel like a swan, quite calm on the front but underneath I'm paddling away.' A television crew from Good Morning Britain, which filmed the moment they first met, asked the pair a few 'Mr & Mrs' style questions before they boarded the plane. Asked who would get the window seat Miss Wood offered it up to Mr Whitbread and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both. Miss Wood also revealed that she 'sleeps in the middle of the bed' and the worst habit Mr Whitbread could have would be snoring, which he previously revealed he did. His new companion was then introduced to Mr Whitbread's parents, who embraced her and their son. The pair flew to the Caribbean region, where they stayed in the honeymoon suite in single beds, and returned on March 3. This is the moment the pair first met live on breakfast television this morning. Before then all they knew were each others names and what they looked like. Mr Whitbread said he wanted to save chatting for the plane . Explaining his decision to sell off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said: 'I was gutted when she said she didn't want to get married but I realised I couldn't mope forever and I didn't want what I'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste. 'Besides, I think it will be good for me to get away. I'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun.' He claims his girlfriend of two years, Amy, told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on Valentine's Day this year. But when he tried to cancel their holiday the Co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him. With the help of his best friend Craig Gibson, he set up an eBay auction to find someone to travel with him. Mr Whitbread, who described himself as a slim, 5ft 9in, with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh, wrote on the advert: 'I'm not boring, I'm adventurous otherwise I wouldn't be doing something as ridiculous as this'. The pair stayed for two weeks at the honeymoon suite at the Blue Bay Villas Hotel in the Dominican Republic . Kelly Wood had campaigned to win the ticket and was introduced to her holiday partner for the first time at the airport. Miss Wood compared herself to feeling like a swan - fine on the surface but paddling underneath . Although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry on Valentine's Day, Mr Whitbread says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee. Speaking after the split, he said: 'I'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - I suppose I've got to respect her honesty. 'But I'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by. 'When I found out at the travel agent I could only get half my money back I was looking at other deals and places I could go but I thought, 'No, I wanted to go on this holiday'. 'I called my best friend and he agreed so I headed straight to his house to make the ebay page. 'Everyone I know is taken and I'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that I'd never otherwise get to meet. Mr Whitbread admitted he could only get half his money back from the travel agent and decided he wanted to go on this holiday but would like some female company . A friend help him set up an advert where he asked for an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss' 'I'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before. 'I'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday. If the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too.' After being overwhelmed with the response, Mr Whitbread pledged to donate any money over £1,050 to testicular cancer research. He added: 'People have said I've got real balls to do this so I thought I might as well try and make some money for charity if I can to.' Kelly Wood set up her own Facebook page to get people to buy tickets and donate to Mr Whitbread's cause and eventually won the seat herself. She posted this message this morning after keeping her win a secret . His ex-girlfriend Amy said: 'I just didn't feel ready to get married and John wasn't my soulmate. Obviously it's difficult for John, I'm finding it hard too. 'It's obviously not nice to finish with someone over Christmas but I thought it was better that he knew now, sooner rather than later. 'It was better that I called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it. 'Fair play to John. I'm pleased that he's doing something positive.'","John Whitbread, 32, was dumped by fiancée weeks before wedding day .

"An Egyptian couple horrified guests at their wedding by hiring fake jihadis to  hijack the ceremony and force them in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a Jordanian pilot. The marriage ceremony was held in Menoufia, north of Cairo and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point. The only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend 'attack' in advance were the groom, his best men and wedding photographer Ahmed Kassem - although the bride is said to have been told to expect something 'different' from the ceremony. It is unclear from the video whether the bride and groom are Muslim or Christian. Scroll down for video . Hijacked: The marriage ceremony was held in Menoufia, north of Cairo, and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point . Trapped: The fake jihadis took control of the ceremony and force the bride and groom in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a Jordanian pilot . Video footage of the ceremony shows one of the groom's knife-wielding best men wearing a black balaclava and  religious song - known as a nasheed - that has previously featured prominently in genuine Islamic State propaganda videos. Having stormed the stage, the men force the couple to climb in to a cage in a chilling imitation of the ISIS video that showed Jordanian pilot Mu'ath Al Kassasbeh being burnt alive earlier this year. Once inside the cage the couple stand up and dance while guests clap and cheer them on. Not everybody was enamoured by the proceedings, however, with the Youm7 newspaper reporting that several of the wedding guests mistakenly thought it was a genuine terrorist attack. It is believed that even the bride was unaware at what the groom had planned, and that the only people aware of the 'attack' in advance were the best men playing the roles of jihadis, and the photographer, who had been ordered to make sure everything was caught on camera.

Last month ISIS terrorists in Libya carried out the mass beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea close to the militant-held port town of Derna. Egypt responded to the atrocity by carrying out sustained airstrikes on ISIS targets in Libya, where radical Islamist group's are increasing in both number and power amid the ongoing chaotic fallout from the 2011 death of former dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Egypt is battling its own Islamic State-linked insurgency on the Sinai Peninsula, which has killed scores of people in a wave of terror attacks and mass beheadings so far in 2015.","Groom convinced best men to pretend to be ISIS terrorists at his wedding .

"British holidaymakers face three more years of being ripped off by extortionate mobile phone 'roaming charges' after Brussels failed to scrap them as promised. EU governments agreed that the roaming charges for mobile phone users abroad should stay in place until at least until the end of 2018. The decision comes despite MEPs voting for an end to the charges which they said were too high. The European Parliament had said roaming charges should be scrapped by the end of 2015. British holidaymakers face three more years of being ripped off by extortionate 'roaming charges' for using their mobile phones abroad . But at a meeting in Brussels, EU governments tonight agreed to allow large mobile phone firms to continue levying extra charges on travellers for at least another three years, when the situation could be reviewed. Governments said consumers should be given a small roaming allowance to use outside their home country from the middle of next year, but any usage above it should still be subject to further charges. The decision is a major blow to British tourists travelling to Europe. A recent study showed that the average British person spends an extra £120 on their mobile phone on each trip abroad. The issue of scrapping roaming charges has seen the EU come head-to-head with the telecoms industry, who argue it will affect their revenues. Tonight's decision comes despite the European Parliament's decision to scrap roaming charges  by the end of 2015 . Some members of the parliament immediately criticised the decision. The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats said: 'The only winners from it are national telecoms operators themselves. Member states should hang their heads in shame.' European consumer groups, speaking through an umbrella organisation, the BEUC, condemned the plan as 'outrageous'. 'Roaming is not justifiable in a single market,' they said. The member states must now agree a common position with both the European Parliament and Commission before changes take effect, so negotiations in the coming months are likely to be hard-fought. Current charge caps are €0.24 (20p) per minute for calls, €0.08 (7p) per text message and €0.45 (37p) per megabyte of data, all excluding VAT. From July 2014 those will be reduced to €0.19 (16p) per minute for calls, €0.06 (5p) per text and €0.20 (17p) per MB of data.

"Caroline Bailey, 46 (pictured with her husband Neal Connor), worked at Broad Oak High School in Bury, Greater Manchester, for 23 years but was found dead at a quarry after being bullied, an inquest heard . A senior RE teacher was found hanged at a quarry after claiming she was being bullied by other staff members at her secondary school, an inquest heard. Caroline Bailey, 46, worked at Broad Oak High School in Bury, Greater Manchester, for 23 years but became stressed at work and began suffering panic attacks and insomnia. The mother-of-two ended up taking sick leave and made several attempts to self-harm during the school's summer holidays, the inquest in Oldham heard. She was later admitted to a psychiatric unit at Fairfield General Hospital, Greater Manchester. On the day of her death in September 2012, she told staff at the unit that she was going out to buy a newspaper but instead went to Castle Hill Quarry near Rochdale, where she was later found dead. The inquest heard how the tragedy occurred after Ms Bailey was appointed head of humanities at the school, where she was described by the headteacher as an 'outstanding classroom practitioner' who 'always put children first.' The hearing was told how she started talking about self-harm over undisclosed issues she had with a fellow teacher and was eventually prescribed anti-depressants. She became so stressed that she began locking herself in her own classroom to eat lunch at the school instead of joining her colleagues in the staff room. Her husband Neal Connor, 36, said she also began calling herself 'stupid' after a fellow teacher was promoted above her and said: 'I have nothing.' Mr Connor, a recovery operator from Prestwich, said: 'She had been suffering from panic attacks while she was at work. She had felt them a couple of times while she was teaching. 'She had also felt the same sort of feeling when she had been in the presence of a couple of other members of staff as well, to the point that since December I noticed she had not been eating properly at home. 'She avoided going to the staff room on multiple occasions because she wanted her own time. She did not want to be in the presence of certain staff. She locked herself in her own class room for dinner. 'She had problems with members of staff at work and in my opinion it was a form of strategic bullying. 'There were ongoing issues from school and they were on her mind. She was made aware that a person was promoted above her position and she came out with comments like 'I have nothing,' and called herself 'stupid.' In the months before her death, Ms Bailey was advised by her GP to seek counselling and also paid for her own hypnotherapy sessions. However, she ended up going on sick leave and began self-harming during the school's summer holidays. Neal Connor told the inquest in Oldham that he believed his wife Caroline (together above) was being subjected to 'strategic bullying' at the school. He said she called herself 'stupid' after a colleague was promoted over her . Following one instance of self-harm, her husband took her to A&E and doctors suggested that she be treated in a psychiatric unit at Fairfield Hospital. However, she begged not to be admitted as it was so close to the school where she worked. Mr Connor said: 'When she got to Fairfield that night she looked like a frightened child. She said she wanted to be anywhere except there. When she walked from the ambulance she was frightened of seeing someone she knew - she looked through every single window to see who was there. 'There were some boys from the school sat at the entrance to Fairfield and her biggest fear was the fact that she had taught there for that long that some of the kids she taught at 15 would be 25. 'The biggest fear would be that they recognised her but she would not recognise them and that it would go out into the community that she was at that sort of ward.' Following the treatment at hospital, Ms Bailey was allowed to return home for the weekend and appeared to improve. However, three days before her death, her condition worsened when she began receiving text messages from a work colleague, the inquest heard. Mr Connor added: 'There had been a lot of interaction that day with work colleagues who had been texting her. She struggled to reply to these texts. 'She had had several texts regarding work issues from a history teacher who was quite a close friend of hers. She was aware that Caroline had been pretty bad but not aware she was on a ward. 'They were lengthy messages and she struggled to reply to the messages and read through to make sure what she was writing made sense. 'She was fixated on work. There had been a promotion of a person she had problems with. Ms Bailey took sick leave from Broad Oak school in Bury, Greater Manchester (pictured) and was admitted to a psychiatric unit at Fairfield General Hospital. She was found dead after being allowed out to buy a newspaper . 'When she first went off on leave, she was still scheduling work and work were contacting her. There were other teachers covering the lessons and she would see what they were doing but it was not sufficient for what she was happy with. She felt she was letting the kids down. 'At all times, whether it would be a female, man or child, or anyone around her at school, others would come first. 'She had a gift as a teacher and she was very much well-known for being able to take the most stubborn pupil and near enough turn them around her little finger. That was the way that she was. She was very much a loving, thoughtful person.' After the weekend break, Ms Bailey returned to the psychiatric unit at Fairfield Hospital. However, staff allowed out her to go out on September 2, 2012, to visit a nearby newsagents. When she failed to return to the ward, doctors rang her husband and he tried to call her mobile but  got no response. She was found dead at the quarry a short time later. At the inquest, coroner Simon Nelson said: 'It is clear Caroline had many qualities. 'She adored her children, she was a dedicated mother, a dedicated wife and dedicated teacher who cared about all of her pupils. 'She remained concerned about the work and welfare and success of her children. She also put others before herself. ' The inquest continues.

"Celebrities are donning stockings on their head to show support for a seven-year-old girl who lost her hair after her cancer treatment. The social media craze, known as #tighthairdo, was inspired by schoolgirl Jordyn Miller who found a creative way to cope with bullies after she was teased for losing her her hair due to chemotherapy. As people became aware of little girl's experience, they have posted photos on social media with stocking on their heads just like Jordyn did in a sign of solidarity, accompanied by a hashtag declaring 'Jordyn is beautiful'. TV chef Manu Feildel, Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan and presenter Jessica Rowe are just some of the people that have ptaken part to raise money to help children recovering from cancer battles. Scroll down for video . Jordyn Miller (left) was diagnosed with stage one cancer when she was five. She and her sister Charli (right) would wear tights and tea-towels on their heads to help Jordyn cope with losing her beloved hair . Big Brother winner Tim Dormer posed with tights on his head to support little Jordyn and encourage people to donate to help children with cancer . Celebrity chef Manu Feildel and TV presenter Jessica Rowe also joined in to help Jordyn and Camp Quality . On her first day of school, the six-year-old refused to remove her hat and was bullied for 'looking like a boy' At just five-years-old Jordyn was diagnosed with 'Wilm's tumor', a cancer of the kidneys. After five months of chemotherapy and a long recovery from surgery, the kindergarten student was so nervous to return to school that she refused to remove her hat. The little girl from Wingham on the north coast of New South Wales, was upset after losing her long, wavy hair. 'She used to have beautiful, long curly hair that she used to love – she's a very girly girl and the chemo caused it to fall out which was a big deal for Jordyn,' Her mother Tarin Miller,33, told Daily Mail Australia. Unfortunately, her fear that the other kids would make fun of her was not unfounded. 'When she first started school, she was shy about it and kids being kids used to tease her about looking like a boy. They'd call her ugly.' One of her daughter's coping mechanisms was to wear a pair of tights or a tea-towel on her head. 'One day Jordan just come out of her room with the tights on her head and said 'this is my beautiful long hair' and Charli, being her little sister, just copied,' she said. Newsreader Mark Ferguson and Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan also posed with tights on their head . Members of the Sydney Kings basketball team posed in colourful stockings to help kids with cancer . The kindergarten student had her left kidney removed after she was found to have a Wilms tumour . The sibling would spend entire days with tea towels or tights on their heads, even enlisting their cousin whenever she would visit. Camp Quality posted the pictures on their Facebook page. The beautiful images of Charli and Jordyn grinning with their stocking hair were shared widely. Touched by the image of sisterly support, people chose to join in by posting images of themselves with tights on their head with #tighthairdo and #jordynisbeautiful. Camp Quality decided to use the opportunity to start a social media campaign, inspired by the success of the 2014 craze, the Ice Bucket Challenge. The challenge raised money for ALS by asking people to throw icy buckets of water on their heads, donate money to the cause and nominate friends to do the same. Jordyn, pictured with her parents Tarin and Anthony (left), also underwent five months of chemotherapy in which she lost all her hair . TV chef Miguel Maestre also wanted people to wear tights and nominate people to help raise money for puppet shows which help make school children aware of how to be kind and considerate of children returning to school after cancer treatment . Camp Quality set up a text donation platform, so people could donate to nominate the next friends they wanted to see post a #tighthairdo. Celebrities who have already gotten behind the campaign and posted a #tighthairdo include TV chef Manu Feildel, Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Olympic swimmers Eamon Sullivan and Alicia Coutts and former Vogue Editor Kirstie Clements. News presenter Mark Ferguson, TV presenter Jessica Rowe and Sydney Kings basketball players have also shown their support for Jordyn and all children undergoing cancer treatment. Jana Cooper, Camp Quality's Marketing Manager, said: 'The point of difference between this campaign and the Ice Bucket Challenge or the #nomakeupselfie, is that the whole idea centres around kids.' 'It was created by kids, it raises money for kids and we've seen many kids get involved. Something else that makes it unique is that it was born in Australia and it uses an Australian text donation service. To be involved, people simply need to text 'Jordyn' to 0476 000 222 to donate. Camp Quality has been performing a puppet show in schools across the country to encourage students to support  their peers who are suffering or recovering from cancer . All funds donated to the campaign will help fund Camp Quality’s touring puppet show for schools. These shows teach pupils how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer. The performance is incredibly effective in preventing and tackling teasing, staring and name-calling when a child returns to school post-treatment. A urine infection led to the discovery of a tumour in Jordyn's left kidney. She was quickly diagnosed with stage one cancer and was signed up for surgery to remove the organ. According to Gary Nunn from the cancer charity Camp Quality, Jordyn is one of 10,000 children across Australia who are currently newly diagnosed, under treatment or in remission from cancer treatment. The show discourages bullying and expels myths that children hold about cancer, including that it is contagious, encouraging them to support and include kids with . Mr Nunn told Daily Mail Australia that after all the emotional and physical hardships endured by the children throughout their treatment, just as things are starting to look up, one of the most common problems they encounter is bullying. 'We've heard about everything from pointing and staring and: 'mummy, why does she looks so different?' to exclusion and isolation,' Mr Nunn said. 'Exclusion is one of the more common ones, kids are often left out because other kids think that they can catch cancer and it's contagious. 'We hear it a lot and there was one incident of name calling recently where we had a mum ringing us up and saying her daughter was being called 'baldie' and some of the kids were taking off her beanie and throwing it and playing catch with it'. Camp Quality is determined to change this mentality and teach children that there is no need to cover up the effects of their cancer treatment, while educating their peers about how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer. The charity has been roaming the country with their educational puppet show on the request of parents and teachers, to expel the myths around cancer. Gary Nunn, a spokesperson for the cancer charity, said that by the end of the show ,the kids are all cheering for the bald puppet character to take off her hat . Former Vogue editor Kirstie Clements posted a photo on Twitter encouraging people to take part in the Camp Quality campaign . Their show has been viewed by over 230,000 children in the last year and relies on public support to continue running. It involves a bald cancer-patient puppet who tries to decide if she should take off her hat - just like little Jordyn. 'By the end of the show the kids are all cheering for her to take off her hat,' Mr Nunn explains. 'Once our puppet show had come to one school, we heard of a girl who went back to her class and quietly removed her hat and she didn't wear it from then on. Once we teach the students about it, that child becomes a sort of hero for all they've been through and they have other children falling over themselves to be their friend.' After Mrs Miller asked Camp Quality to come to her daughter's school to perform their puppet show, she said there was an instant change in attitude. Now, whilst her hair is still much shorter than it once was, Jordyn - who is now in remission - often tells her mother how much she's looking forward to having long hair again.","Jordyn Miller was diagnosed with stage one cancer at five years old .
She underwent five months of chemotherapy and had her kidney removed .

"Her boyfriend’s dreary taste in furnishings is said to be the spark that first set Chrissie Rucker off in pursuit of all things white. Faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery in his flat in Fulham, West London, she rushed to the shops to find replacements in more neutral tones, but struggled when it came to buying good quality bed linen in the purest of whites. She didn’t know it at the time, of course, but that day in 1993 marked the moment Rucker began to dream of setting up a shop selling everything in white. Scroll down for video . Chrissie Rucker is the founder and director of The White Company and is pictured here with a selection of her products . More than two decades on, the 46-year-old founder of The White Company is one of the UK’s wealthiest businesswomen having transformed what began as a 12-page mail-order catalogue selling white towels and bed linen into a home furnishings and fashion empire. Her business sells everything from £20 scented candles to £200 cashmere jumpers, and while she has branched out to shades such as ‘biscuit marl’ and ‘cloud grey’, Rucker remains obsessed with all things pale. Her white revolution has seen sales soaring at her 53 High Street stores — even the Queen has sent out her ladies-in-waiting to buy bedspreads — and has spread across the Atlantic where she launched a U.S. website last year. Latest figures show that the mother-of-four’s company made pre-tax profits of £6.5 million last year — an increase of 38 per cent. Her position on the Sunday Times Rich list has climbed steeply from 427th to 326th. She and her husband’s combined wealth is estimated at £295 million. Aside from the money pouring into company coffers, Rucker owns three stunning properties, all decorated from roof to floor in her trademark sweeping white interiors. There’s a £12.5 million 17th-century manor house in Buckinghamshire, set in 51 acres of parkland, a £4 million townhouse in London’s fashionable Holland Park and what is widely regarded to be the finest property in the Swiss Alps, Haus Alpina, a luxury chalet with full-time staff which Rucker rents out for a staggering £26,000 a week. Chrissie, pictured at her Buckinghamshire home, realised she had found a gap in the market when she was looking to decorate her future husband's house all in white . Even at Rucker’s main residence, the country mansion, the only flashes of colour you’ll see are the bright pony rosettes awarded to her horse-mad daughters. All in all, it’s a rather surprising state of affairs for a woman who disappointed her parents by leaving school at 16 with six O-levels and signing up at the Lucie Clayton finishing school which promised to prepare girls for marriage, society and ‘the season’. However, it was not long before Rucker decided she wanted to do something more interesting with her life than flutter her eyelashes at eligible young bachelors on the London social circuit. Indeed, the statuesque blonde’s path to fortune is rather more colourful than her dazzling white shops might suggest. Belinda Christian Rucker, as she was named by her parents, was born in 1968 into an illustrious military family — her maternal grandfather, Sir Harold Pyman, was Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces in Europe and a recipient of the Knight Grand Cross and Distinguished Service Order. The daughter of commodity broker, Patrick Rucker, Chrissie, as she was known, grew up in Kent and attended £5,275-a-term Combe Bank School in Kent. Her parents divorced, and aged seven, she and her younger sister, Jo, went with their mother Rosemary, a horse breeder, to live with their new step-father, estate agent Jeremy Calcutt. Those days, she recalled, were happy but chaotic. ‘My mother was really only interested in her horses,’ she said, ‘so the stables were immaculate, the house a tip.’ Chrissie's husband, Nick Wheeler (pictured), set up his shirt company, Charles Tyrwhitt, in 1986 while a geography student at Bristol University . It was all a far cry from the vision Rucker would later create of domestic interiors as a haven of white and light. Her early ambitions lay in fashion. While at Lucy Clayton she studied dressmaking and design. But as a teenager in London in the late Eighties, Rucker seemed intent on immersing herself in a ‘Sloane Ranger’ lifestyle. In 1987, she was a debutante at the Savoy hotel’s Berkeley Ball, where she and fellow socialite and fashion journalist Plum Sykes were among a select bunch of girls chosen by judges including hairdresser Vidal Sassoon and fashion designer Jean Muir to appear in the Berkeley Dress Show. Even at Chrissie and Nick's home in Buckinghamshire (pictured) you will see only flashes of colour, mainly in the bright pony rosettes awarded to their horse-mad daughters . Wedding dress designer Anneliese Sharpe, who was also on the judging panel, recalls that even among the ‘incredibly beautiful, leggy’ girls who paraded in front of her, desperate to be picked, 18-year-old Rucker stood out. Cannily, she used her introduction to Sharpe to ask for work experience. ‘Chrissie used to come every day,’ says Sharp. ‘She was completely different from the other debutantes. She was incredibly hard-working with no airs and graces.’ However, Rucker decided that life as a designer was not what she wanted after all. She began work at Conde Nast, the owner of several glossy magazines including Vogue and Tatler, first as a receptionist, then as a fashion assistant. She enrolled on a journalism course, later describing it as a ‘complete waste of time’, and flitted from there to Clarins, where she worked as a PR girl. She was poached from there by Harper & Queen’s health and beauty editor Tina Gaudoin in 1991. Gaudoin recalls: ‘She was so efficient and impressive, I said: “Are you interested in coming to work for me?” She dropped off her CV at 5am. I was so struck by her ability to be focused and unflappable that I hired her as my assistant. She has a great humility about her, which I find extraordinary, bearing in mind she is so successful.’ By the time she met her future husband, Rucker was still struggling to work out exactly what she wanted to do with her life. But although she fell in love with Old Etonian Nick Wheeler, she did not feel the same way about his taste in interiors. Chrissie (pictured) used a £6,000 legacy from her grandmother to launch The White Company in March 1994 . According to Rucker herself: ‘I thought; “This is my chance. I’ll show him what excellent wife material I am.” So I went shopping and kitted it out — I bought white bed linen, white towels, white china, white napkins and white bathrobes. But I just found it impossible to buy plain white sheets on the High Street. ‘The only place you could get them was in department stores and shopping there was a horrible experience. All the salesgirls would look at you snootily, as if to say: “You can’t afford this.”’ While Rucker believed she had spotted a hole in the market, her husband-to-be was perfectly placed to advise her when it came to launching her own business. Chrissie (pictured) grew up in Kent and attended £5,275-a-term Combe Bank School before going on to the Lucie Clayton finishing school . Wheeler had set up his shirt company, Charles Tyrwhitt, in 1986 while a geography student at Bristol University. ‘I don’t think I would have done it if it hadn’t been for Nick,’ Rucker later claimed. ‘He guided me through the process, helped me write my first business plan.’ She began by calling up London department stores, pretending to be a journalist writing articles on homeware while ascertaining that up to 50 per cent of their sales involved white linen. She also quizzed PRs, manufacturers and friends. Chrissie (left) was inspired to start The White Company in 1993 after being faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery of her future husband, Nick's (right) flat in Fulham, West London . ‘My mission was to bridge the gap between first-class designer quality and what was affordable without the big designer margins,’ she has said. Rucker used a £6,000 legacy from her grandmother to launch The White Company in March 1994. Wheeler gave her £5,000 in return for a 25 per cent stake, and she also received a £50-a-week enterprise grant. She produced her first mail-order catalogue, a 12-page leaflet, on a computer in Wheeler’s attic, delivering her first orders in her sister Jo’s Mini Metro. The company was an instant hit, turning over £258,000 in its first year, but Rucker remained committed to hard graft, working 16-hour days, right up until the birth of her first child. Chrissie is pictured here at home with her children; Ella, Tom, Bea and India, when they were younger . Since then, The White Company has gone from strength to strength. In 2010, Rucker was made an MBE for services to the retail industry, attracting mirth among some palace officials because of the black outfit that she wore to receive the honour at Windsor Castle. She and her husband — together with their four children aged from ten to 18 — now reap the rewards of their entrepreneurial spirt. They almost split up when he failed to propose during a romantic holiday in Thailand the year Rucker launched her business. Upon returning to the UK, a feisty Rucker gave him his marching orders, storming into his office and returning his £5,000 investment in cash. In 2010, Rucker was made an MBE for services to the retail industry (pictured) attracting mirth among some palace officials thanks to her all black outfit . A shell-shocked Wheeler left the money on the roof of his sports car and drove off without it. When the couple did finally marry in 1995, Rucker gave him back one per cent of the company as a wedding gift. As a 99 per cent stake-holder, however, it is Rucker who remains at the head of a retail empire which has revolutionised tastes in home furnishings, a woman who continues to live and breathe the colour that made her a multi-millionaire. ‘For me, white is timeless and always very relevant,’ she insists. ‘Wherever you live, whatever your style, white works.’ Additional reporting: Simon Trump .","Chrissie Rucker was inspired by her boyfriend's house in 1993 .

"An adorable video has surfaced of a koala stopping to pose for a little boy's photo before continuing to stroll down one of the main streets of a coastal town in Victoria. Chris Kerrigan was having coffee at a café in Portland, on the south-west coast of Victoria, on Monday when she noticed the tiny marsupial walking along the footpath. Ms Kerrigan posted a video of the koala on Facebook which has received more than 180,000 views. She said that a young boy who was with his mother at the same café jumped up to take a photo of the koala, and the koala seemed to oblige. An adorable video has surfaced of a koala stopping to pose for a little boy's photo in Portland, Victoria . Chris Kerrigan was having coffee at a café in Portland, on the south-west coast of Victoria, on Monday when she noticed the tiny marsupial walking along the footpath . 'The boy had a camera in his hand and wanted to take a photo,' Ms Kerrigan told Daily Mail Australia. 'He sat down as if to say ""Righto hurry up and take your photo."" 'It was really interesting he wasn't the least bit phased by people around him, he looked quite calm.' In the video the koala can be seen casually strolling past shops. He then stops in front of a small blonde boy who is holding a camera phone and waits for him to take a picture before continuing his walk. Ms Kerrigan said after she stopped filming the koala crossed the road  before climbing a tree. Ms Kerrigan, who has only recently moved to the area from South Australia, has heard that it was not uncommon to see koalas on the outskirts of the town.

Ms Kerrigan posted a video of the koala on Facebook which has received more than 180,000 views . 'There seems to be quite a large koala population because of the vegetation around Portland,' she said, . 'But it's not that common to see them walking down the footpath.' The cute video follows reports that hundreds of koalas have been killed in secret by wildlife officials in Victoria due to concerns over starvation. The Victorian government euthanised 686 koalas at Cape Otway, on the same stretch of coast but about 250km west of Portland, in 2013 and 2014 in response to overpopulation in manna gum woodlands in the area. The koalas were killed via lethal injection after being captured in trees. Animal activists are furious and have condemned the government for their 'cruel' treatment of koalas and questioned why the program was conducted in secret.

"A man was caught trying to smuggle more than $770,000 out of the U.S. in cash hidden in boxes of drug store products, officials said. Abdulkarim Altareb, 48, from Yemen, insisted the wads of crisp banknotes belonged to him and 'his brothers' when he was busted by suspicious customs officials at New York's JFK Airport. He is now in jail charged with 'bulk cash smuggling', but police sources told the New York Post there was no indication the money was meant for terrorist groups. Loadsamoney: Packs of common drug store products and even a pair of trainers were used to conceal more than $770,000 which Abdulkarim Altareb was caught with as he tried to board a flight to Qatar on Sunday . Not so clean getaway: Packs of Dove soap were used to conceal wads of crisp dollar notes in Altareb's luggage. He said the money was for building works and police sources say they don't suspect terrorism . Altareb had claimed he was carrying just $6,500 - well under the $10,000 limit - before trying to board a plane to Qatar on Sunday, according to court papers seen by the Post. But when asked to present the cash he pulled out just $5,870, stoking the suspicions of U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers who then decided to search his luggage. Inside they found boxes of soap, Band-Aids, Thera-flu, Splenda and Alka-Seltzer, all stuffed with thick rolls of $100 and $50 bills. 'Cash was also hidden in soles of shoes, and in the lining of a jacket inside of one of the checked bags,' a court filing said. Under interrogation, Altareb is said to have told Homeland Security agents he was taking the money to the Middle East to fund building works. 'This is my brothers’, two brothers’ money,' he told them according to the criminal complaint. It added: 'The defendant also said, in sum and substance, that some of the money was his money, and some of the money belonged to his family, and that he has a big family.'

"First Big Brother's Josie Gibson and Geordie Shore's Charlotte Crosby brought out fitness DVDs - and now another reality star is following in their footsteps. Dee Kelly, aka White Dee from Benefits Street, is launching her own workout routine after losing three stone in two months. With her anniversary of living off handouts coming up this month, and a trip to Las Vegas in the pipeline, the new lean, happier Dee, 43, wants to share her exercise tips with the world. Scroll down for video . Benefits Street star White Dee is planning to release a fitness DVD later this year after losing three stone, here she is pictured with her trainer John Fox (left) and a friend . Dee, who is 43-years old, has been working out in the gym and says that her exercise regime has helped her to battle her depression . She wants to put together her fitness regime by the summer after shedding the pounds since leaving the Celebrity Big Brother house last September. She has been regularly put through her paces during private boxing and weightlifting training sessions at her local gym in Birmingham. The mum-of-two has also been working out with pal John Fox, who is a DJ for the city's biggest radio station Free Radio. Yesterday her agent Barry Tomes, 57, said the pair have now started filming a fitness DVD together, which will be released later in the year. Dee has been trying out lots of different equipment in the gym, including the cycling machine and the treadmill losing an impressive three stone in two months . Dee gets to grips with the treadmill, she is working on her DVD with the DJ John Fox who works for Free Radio, he has been helping to train her over the last few months . He added: 'Dee lost three stone in two months. She has been in the gym regularly since she left Celebrity Big Brother. 'She is recording and releasing the fitness DVD with Foxy from Free Radio. I think he is part excited and part nervous. 'He has been training in the gym with her recently because he wants to get fit for his wedding. He has lost two stone in two months. 'So we are writing up a full programme for the workout, so everything from a warm-up to a cool down as you would do at the gym. Dee's weight has gone up and down over the years, but she's now lost three stone and is planning to release a fitness DVD. Here she is pictured before losing three stone . 'People assume that fitness exercises are for people who are slim and fit but actually we are going to go to the beginning. 'Dee has been amazing. She has not always been fit and it showed in her weight. But she has been very good and I am hugely impressed at her weight loss. It has helped her with her depression too, which is great.' Mr Tomes also revealed Dee is set to undertake TV work in the United States and has intended to get in shape as she bids to crack America. He added: 'She has been going to the gym a lot because she has been trying to get fit for Las Vegas when we go out there soon. They're so image-conscious in the States but this could help her crack it.' Dee has suffered from depression in the past and her agent has revealed that losing the weight and exercising more has helped her to cope with it . Barry revealed that Dee - who previously tried to lose weight with a £1,000 treatment called Lipoglaze - will have been off benefits for a year on 22 March and so they are heading to Vegas to celebrate. He also hopes that she will be able to launch her career out there. He said: 'We are talking about getting her on programmes over there that are the equivalent of Good Morning Britain, that sort of thing. 'There are more beggars in LA than anywhere else in the world. That is because they don't have a benefits system in America. '[Dee's story] shows you can change your life with a little bit of help and the Americans like that story.' Dee starred in Benefits street in January 2014, filmed on James Turner Street in Birmingham. The fly-on-the-wall documentary followed her and her friends and neighbours as they lived their lives on benefits. She went on to star in Celebrity Big Brother in 2014 alongside Lauren Goodger and Edele Lynch, she came fifth in the show.","Dee Kelly, known as 'White Dee,' has lost three stone in just two months .

Hamas' Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement that Hassanat 'was a brilliant leader of the Islamic movement' Hamas has held sway in Gaza since 2007. Israel said on Monday it has busted an Israeli-Palestinian smuggling ring that funneled iron, electronic equipment and other prohibited materials to Gaza, bypassing Israel's stringent border security to help Hamas rebuild its militant infrastructure following last year's war. Nine people in the ring, among them three Jewish Israelis who own companies that sell the materials, were charged with assisting an enemy in wartime, terror financing and fraud. The remaining ring members were said to be Palestinians from Gaza. Hamas, a bitter enemy of Israel's, suffered heavy losses in the 50-day war, in which Israel carried out some 5,000 airstrikes throughout Gaza. Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel. The fighting killed more than 2,200 Palestinians and 72 people on the Israeli side. Hamas is suffering from international isolation and a cash crunch and has been trying to rebuild the coastal territory since the fighting ended.","Hammad Al-Hasanat co-founded the terrorist group on December 14, 1987 .

"Ronnie Morshead's catering company has been investigated after a Salmonella incident . My Kitchen Rules judge Manu Feildel’s ex-partner has been linked to a Salmonella outbreak at a primary school thought to have been caused by to a raw egg sauce that was served. Jamaican-born chef Ronnie Morshead, who has in the past catered for the likes of Elton John and Andrew Lloyd Webber, runs Red Sage Catering – the company that provided the food served at Double Bay Public School, in Sydney, which is thought to have left a number of people ill. The Salmonella incident  took place in December 2014 at a Year 6 leavers’ event, the Daily Telegraph reports. When six people were affected, South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service reported the incident to the NSW Food Authority who investigated the possible cause. A NSW Food Authority spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Upon receiving notification of a possible foodborne illness event from South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service, the NSW Food Authority commenced an investigation into the incident.’ The authority said the investigation is now complete. ‘The outcome of the source was a possible link to a raw egg sauce served. Raw eggs are a common source of salmonella outbreaks around Australia,’ the spokesperson said. ‘The NSW Food Authority has worked with the home based catering business involved in the reported incident and provided the operator with advice, guidance and information in relation to food safety requirements.’ Double Bay Public School in Sydney's east suffered a Salmonella poisoning incident at Year 6 leavers' event . Professor Mark Ferson, Director, Public Health Unit, South Eastern Sydney Local Health District, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘[we were] alerted to a Salmonella/food poisoning incident at a Year 6 farewell event at Double Bay Public School, following lab notifications of a particular strain of Salmonella linked to the school event.’ Professor Ferson said a total of six confirmed Salmonella cases were linked to this incident. ‘Due to the low number of confirmed cases, we are unable to provide specific details to protect the identity of those confirmed cases,’ Professor Ferson added. Symptoms relating to Salmonella poisoning include headache, fever, stomach cramps, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. They usually become apparent 6-72 hours after infection and last for 4-7 days, sometimes much longer. ‘In Australia, most Salmonella infections occur after eating contaminated food or sometimes after contact with another person with the infection. Safe food handling including thorough cooking of meat, poultry and eggs and good hand hygiene can prevent infection,’ Professor Ferson said. Ronnie, who learned her trade in the UK, met TV chef Manu while working in London. They separated in 2009 . Professor Ferson said a total of six confirmed Salmonella cases were linked to this incident . Ronnie, who learned her trade in the UK, met TV chef Manu while working as an A La Carte chef in award winning restaurant Livebait, in Waterloo, London. In 1999, the couple relocated to Sydney and Ronnie gave birth to their son Jonti in 2005. They separated after 12 years together in 2009 and 40-year-old Manu is now engaged to Clarissa Weerasena. Speaking recently to Daily Mail Australia, Manu said about Clarissa: 'She's going to be delivering very soon.' Clarissa gave birth to their baby on February 9. When asked if the two had set a date to be married, Manu revealed the pregnancy changed their plans. Manu Feildel used his former partner Ronnie Morshead's catering service for his 40th birthday party . 'Not yet, the baby came before... we were supposed to get married first so everything has been changed!' 'I think it was good timing, Clarissa being pregnant while I was working [on MKR] and now it's going to be down time for me.' Ronnie and Manu remain friends, with Ronnie’s Red Sage catering company providing the food for Manu’s 40th birthday party. In a glowing testimony on her website, Manu wrote: ‘I’d like to say thank you to Ronnie and her team for the fantastic food and service provided for my 40th. ‘The food was absolutely delicious; we had an amazing selection of very creative little bites packed with flavour. ‘All of our guests commented on both the food and service provided and the ability to provide a tailored menu for our guests with dietary requirements. I have since recommended Red Sage to everyone who comes to me for recommendation. ‘If you are after quality food served by a highly professional and friendly staff then you cannot go past Red Sage. See you at my 41st!’ Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ronnie Morshead for comment.","Manu Feildel's ex Ronnie Morshead runs Red Sage Catering .

"Up to 80 per cent of women fake orgasms, according to recent research - and that might not be a bad thing. Turns out some women fake it in order to make it a real orgasm happen. Researchers surveyed 481 heterosexual females, all sexually active but not in serious relationships. Scroll down for video . The most common reason is faking an orgasm is to protect a man's feelings, says sexpert Tracey Cox . The results, published in The Journal of Sexual Archives, threw up the usual, predictable reasons for faking - but also a surprising one. The women gave four main reasons for faking orgasm. The most common reason was ‘altruistic deceit’ - to protect the man’s feelings. Second, fear and insecurity. Wanting the sex to be a positive experience, rather than a negative one. Fourth, was faking it to end the sex session. No surprises there (though it’s usually further up the list!) The most interesting reason came third on the list. ‘Elevated arousal’ - faking orgasm to make yourself feel more turned on. The women said by pretending to orgasm, they were attempting to increase their arousal levels. And do you know what? I believe them. The ‘fake it till you make it’ theory is based on the assumption that if you act out the thing you want to happen, sometimes it will. Psychologists use the same technique on depressed patients: the act of smiling triggers hormones which make us feel happier so a forced smile eventually turns into a real one. Sexpert Tracey Cox says for some women pretending to climax could actually bring on the real thing . The women in the study said if they pretended to orgasm, their partner got more excited, which got them more excited. By reenacting the lead-up to a real orgasm - breathing faster, making noise, moving your hips, tensing your muscles - you might just push yourself over the threshold to the point where orgasm becomes involuntary. But there are two crucial points that need to be made here. First up, the study was based on women who weren’t in relationships so the overall percentage of ‘fakers’ (80 per cent) is hopefully lower in couples who are more comfortable with each other. It’s also best not to use the ‘fake it to make it’ technique at the beginning of relationships (unless you explain that’s what you’re doing, which is unlikely). How is your partner ever going to learn to give you a real orgasm if they think they’re doing it already? The absolute worst time to fake an orgasm is at the start of a relationship, which is, of course, when most women (and some men) do it. Keep on doing it and you’ve set up a pattern of behaviour that’s based on deception and dissatisfaction. He’ll keep on using the same ineffectual techniques because he thinks he’s turning you on; you’ll remain frustrated and irritable every time you have sex. Having the courage to say “Actually, that does nothing for me,” isn’t easy but you really must. Communication is the key to good sex - and faking orgasm (for reasons that aren’t so helpful) isn’t necessary if admitting to not having one isn’t a problem!

Christopher North, managing director at Amazon.co.uk Ltd, said: ‘Amazon.co.uk sold more than 5.5 million items on Black Friday 2014 at a rate of 64 items per second. ‘We are now proud to invite our customers to see first-hand how our world-class employees and advanced technology in our fulfilment centres come together to make this magic happen.’ Visitors will get a behind-the-scenes look at how millions of products are moved from the warehouse to delivery vans. And they will see people at work for a company which has been at the centre of allegations of harsh conditions such as zero-hour contracts and tracking tags worn by employees. The inaugural tours at Amazon's 'fulfilment centre' in Rugeley were open to family and friends of employees . Tours are open to anyone over the age of six, with each visit lasting about one hour. The distribution centre is 700,000-square feet in size, which is the equivalent of nine-and-a-half football pitches. Amazon said it has created hundreds of new permanent jobs in its ‘fulfilment centres’ in the last few months, bringing its total roster of employees to 7,000 at eight warehouses and corporate offices. John Tagawa, Amazon.co.uk Ltd’s director of UK operations, said: ‘We’re extremely proud of the efforts of everyone who works in our fulfilment centres and opening our workplaces up to these tours is the perfect way to recognise all of their achievements.’ Similar tours are offered at Amazon warehouses in the US and Germany, and there are plans to expand the programme to more European countries.","Amazon's 'fulfilment centre' in Rugeley will soon open for guided tours .

"A California man has fallen 1,000 feet to his death in a paragliding accident while his teenage daughter, who was flying in tandem with him, survived. Veterinarian Ronald Faoro, 60, died after witnesses say he fell from his glider and landed in a steep canyon area on Sunday morning. Faoro's daughter, 16-year-old Sierra, stayed strapped into the glider and eventually crashed into a mountain about a quarter of a mile from where her father's body was found. Scroll down for video . Ronald Faoro, 60, died after witnesses say he fell from his glider near Santa Barbara on Sunday morning, his daughter Sierra stayed strapped into the glider and eventually crashed into a tree . Hickers captured footage of Sierra Faoro crashing landing into the side of a mountain just minutes after her father had fallen to his death near Santa Barbara . Sierra, who was not an experienced pilot, suffered only minor injuries and was lifted out by helicopter and flown to a nearby hospital. According to the Santa Barbara County Fire Department, Faoro was not adequately clipped in to the harness and during the course of the ride, he became detached and fell to his death. A UC Santa Barbara Geology Department field trip group was in the area and witnessed the accident. Members of the group were helpful in locating the victims and when rescue teams declared Faoro dead upon arrival. The coroner's office is investigating the accident to determine how it happened. Dr. Faoro owned and had worked at the St. Francis Pet Clinic in Santa Barbara since the early 1980s, reports Noozhawk. KEYT . Authorities believe Faoro - who was an avid paraglider, was not adequately clipped in to the harness and during the course of the ride, he became detached and fell to his death . Dr. Faoro owned and had worked at the St. Francis Pet Clinic in Santa Barbara since the early 1980s, while daughter Sierra survived the ordeal with only minor injuries . 'It is with great sadness that we mourn the loss of Dr. Ron Faoro,' the clinic said in a statement. 'He was an amazing veterinarian, clinic owner, mentor and friend. At this time the family and staff has requested privacy as they struggle to handle this sudden and unexpected loss.' He lived locally with his wife, Elizabeth, and daughter, Sierra. According to his Facebook page, Faoro was an avid paraglider. Paragliding resembles a combination of hang-gliding and skydiving, where a pilot launches on foot and sits below a fabric wing that catches the wind. Faoro's death was the first paragliding fatality in the Santa Barbara area since 1978. It is a ​mecca for free-flying with people coming from all over the world to train and fly there.","Ronald Faoro, 60, died after witnesses say he fell from his glider near Santa Barbara on Sunday morning .

"New York public schools will add two Muslim holidays to their vacation calendars, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday, a promise he made during his election campaign. The policy change was hailed  by Islamic leaders in New York City. Under the new policy, the city's 1.1 million-pupil public school system will close on Sept. 24 for Eid al-Adha, which is also known as the Festival of Sacrifice. The holiday of Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, will be observed during summer school in 2016. Scroll down for video . NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio (pictured today promised in his election campaign that New York public schools would add the Muslim holidays to their vacation calendars . Mayor Bill de Blasio announced today that NYC will become largest school district in the nation to recognize Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha . Ramadan is based on the Islamic lunar calendar and moves each year. 'Hundreds of thousands of Muslim families will no longer have to choose between honoring the most sacred days on their calendar or attending school,' Mayor Bill de Blasio said in his announcement. Muslim leaders welcomed the announcement. 'After years of advocating by New York City's Muslim community, Muslim public school students will finally and thankfully no longer be penalized for observing their religious holidays,' said Zead Ramadan, a board member of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Linda Sarsour, a Muslim community advocate and public school parent who joined de Blasio for the announcement at a school in Brooklyn, said, 'This is what New York City is all about — recognition, inclusion and respect.' Estimates of the number of Muslims living in New York City vary from 600,000 to 1 million. Community leaders have long urged adding the two Muslim holidays to the school calendar, and the City Council passed a resolution supporting the change in 2009. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg opposed making the change but de Blasio and the other major candidates who campaigned to succeed Bloomberg in 2013 all said they would implement it. The new calendar will keep the total number of school days unchanged at 182: the state-mandated 180 plus two more in case there are snow days. New York City public schools have long closed for major Jewish holidays such as Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur as well as the Christian holidays of Christmas and Good Friday. Other public school systems that have moved recently to observe Muslim holidays include those in Waterbury, Connecticut and Frederick County, Maryland.

"One plane was diverted and another delayed to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled air space without warning in February, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) said. The disruption is believed to have occurred during the same February 18 incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort two Russian bear bombers identified flying close to British airspace. The move was seen as a show of strength by Russia amid tensions over the conflict in Ukraine, where Prime Minister David Cameron has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of challenging the territorial integrity of Kiev. A file picture showing a Russian bear bomber being escorted by an RAF jet. A commercial plane carrying hundreds of passengers was forced to divert after an incursion into Irish air space by two Kremlin aircraft . The Irish authority said the two Russian aircraft were flying with their transponders switched off - devices that help aircraft to be identified by air traffic control radars. The two Typhoons, armed with air-to-air missiles, were launched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire after the Russian bombers were spotted at 6.30pm. They were escorted as they flew south, then turned around and flew north past the Irish coast. 'One aircraft's departure from Dublin was delayed due to the activity of the Russian military aircraft in UK-controlled airspace,' the IAA said in a statement. 'The routing of one en route aircraft was changed to ensure that its track was sufficiently separated from the track of the two Russian military aircraft,' it added. Footage released on Russian TV shows the moment two RAF jets escort the Russian bomber last month . Since January last year, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. The diverted and delayed planes were commercial jets 'carrying hundreds of people', the Irish Examiner newspaper reported. However, the IAA sad there had been 'no safety impact to civilian traffic in Irish controlled airspace'. The aircraft did not enter Irish sovereign airspace, but flew in Irish controlled airspace within 25 nautical miles (46.3 km) of the Irish coast between 3pm GMT and 7pm GMT, according to the authority. That incident came after one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of Bournemouth in January. British Defence Minister Michael Fallon warned that NATO needs to be ready for 'any kind of aggression from Russia' following the incident, which came after London summoned the Russian ambassador over a similar episode in January. On Tuesday, leaders of the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and EU head Donald Tusk called for a 'strong reaction' from the international community to any major violation of a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine in a bid to increase pressure on Russia. Both Kiev forces and pro-Russian rebels accuse the other of continuing to mount attacks in defiance of a deal forged in a bid to end 11 months of bloodshed that has killed over 6,000 people, according to the UN. Nevertheless, violence has abated over the past week, increasing hopes the agreement could hold. The move has been seen as a show of strength by Russia amid tensions over the conflict in Ukraine, where David Cameron has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of challenging the territorial integrity of Kiev .","One civilian jet changed course and another delayed take off from Dublin .

"A Turkish man accused of helping ISIS militants smuggle jihadis into Syria has also been charged with forcing Syrian refugee children into joining his paedophile prostitution ring, it has been claimed. Turkish investigators examining the links between Ahmet Yumuşak and the terror group are said to have discovered the 29-year-old talking with potential clients about the price of sex with refugees. He allegedly recommended certain women to his 'customers', who were inquiring about paying for sex with young females fleeing the Syrian warzone for what they had believed to be the safety of Yumuşak's native Hatay region of southern Turkey. Sick: Ahmet Yumuşak was originally accused of helping would-be jihadis reach ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa (pictured). The investigation led to additional charges of him also running a prostitution ring in Turkey . Location: The young girls forced into prostituon had fled Syrian warzones for what they had believed to be the safety of Ahmet Yumuşak's native Hatay region in southern Turkey . Yumuşak's alleged crimes came to light after local detectives launched an investigation into an attack by Islamic State militants on police officers in the Turkish town of Niğde in March last year. 11 people, including Yumuşak, have already been charged in connection with that attack, according to Turkish newspaper Hürriyet. Investigating officers using wiretaps to investigate the case are said to have caught Yumuşak arranging for vulnerable Syrian refugee women to have sex with 'customers', even going as far as to make personal recommendations, saying: 'the 16-year-old one is terrific'. The alleged people smuggler has since been charged with forcing underage girls into prostitution. Another suspect in the case, named as Ayhan Orli, is accused of using his contacts in Hatay to procure 50 kg of aluminium powder, which can be used to make explosives. According to the charge, a local police officer then cooperated with Orli to smuggle the powder over the border into Syria, where it was handed over to members of the militant group Ahrar ash-Sham. Terror group: Currently the majority of would-be jihadis travel to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, where people smugglers help them make the short journey to ISIS' Syrian stronghold Raqqa (pictured) NATO member state Turkey has long been accused of not doing enough to stem the flow of Western would-be jihadis arriving in the south of the country. Currently the majority travel to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, where people smugglers  help them make the short journey into Syria, where they are met by militants in ISIS-held Tell Abiad. From Tell Abiad the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa is just a 60 mile journey along Highway 6. Last month three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green are believed to made that exact journey, having first arrived in Turkey on a direct flight from London to Istanbul. Scotland Yard was facing questions over how the girls – Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and a 15-year-old German girl - were able to board a flight to Turkey unchallenged, despite having no parent or guardian with them. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man  to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay. Stomach-churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group's de facto capital Raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim. With the baying crowd clambering on to rooftops to get a better view of the savage scene, the blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death. Barbarians: Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay . Horror: The blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death . The images were released by local activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the ISIS stronghold to expose the terror group's atrocities. The photographs carry the distinctive yellow logo of ISIS' propaganda wing Al Hayat Media Centre, suggesting they come from an as-yet unreleased video of the savage murder. The photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run-down building in the west of the city, which ISIS captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the Syrian Civil War. So many people are seen in the streets to watch the man being thrown to his death that vehicles are unable to pass along the streets, although it appears the militants have erected metal railings to keep the crowds in line, giving a chilling sense of order to the savagery. The blindfolded victim - who is understood to be in his 20s - is seen being dragged to the top of the building by three black-masked militants while two armed but undisguised fighters stand at their side using mobile phones to film the gruesome murder. The next image shows the man plunging to his death, falling face first from behind a white metal railing towards the ground several stories below.

"Road rage has become a major problem across the world, but in Australia the first example of road reassurance may have taken place. Motorcyclist Mathew Sant was travelling along Canberra Avenue toward the city on Tuesday in an 80km/h zone when he was rear-ended. Instead of reacting furiously though, he gave the guilty driver a thumbs up. 'Traffic had backed up ahead and come to a stop,' he said on YouTube after uploading a video of what happened. All things seem to be going well as motorcyclist Mathew Sant stops in traffic along Canberra Avenue . Suddenly he is thrown in the air off his motorbike after getting rear-ended by a car . Instead of losing his temper at what happened Mr Sant gives the driver a thumbs up . To make it even clearer there are no hard feelings he shakes the driver's hand . 'As I came to a stop I checked my mirror and moved to the right of the road in case the car behind wasn't paying attention. 'I saw him come to a stop and relaxed, looking away. The next thing I knew I was looking at the sky.' In the YouTube video Mr Sant is seen going steadily along, minding his own business, in a lane of traffic and all seems to be going well. However, after coming to a standstill because the cars in front have stopped, a car comes up behind the motorcyclist and crashes into the back of him. It's only when he looks back that he sees the rest of the carnage that has taken place . Mr Sant would have been within his rights to give the driver what for, but flashes him a thumbs up instead. It's the last thing the driver expects and he asks worriedly: 'Are you all right mate?' Even then Mr Sant remains cool and composed. He shakes hands with the driver and laughs at all that just happened. It is only then that the motorcyclist walks back to see the carnage that occurred behind him. Mr Sant has then a chance to see how lucky he was after the accident . After breathing a sigh of relief he thanks his lucky stars the accident didn't turn out to be worse . He soon realises that he wasn't the only victim as the initial crash caused a three-car pile up, with other motors badly damaged. After surveying the scene the reality of how lucky he was finally dawns on him. 'I can't believe I'm all right,' he says thankfully.","Motorcyclist Mathew Sant was travelling along Canberra Avenue .

"A taxi driver was tricked out of a fare  by two passengers who left a fully clothed mannequin in the car for the final leg of the journey - and promised their 'sleeping' friend would settle the bill. The driver, known only as 'Stutter', was hailed for a late-night journey from Brighton train station to London by three men who agreed on a fee. They all got into the cab and headed up to the capital but one of the passengers was said to be 'sleeping'. The driver dropped the first man off before heading to the second person's home. The unnamed taxi driver was duped by two men who carried a mannequin (file picture), fully clothed and wearing a hat, into the cab . Upon arrival, the second man got out, thanked the driver and gave the address of their friend in the back seat and asked him to wake him up when he got to his house. The driver then arrived at the last address and tried to wake the person up to let them know he was home - but realised it was a fully-clothed mannequin. Andy Cheesman, CityCabs boss in Brighton, East Sussex, said: 'Three people got into a cab at Brighton train station. 'It was about 2am in the morning and they asked to be taken to London and agreed a fee with the driver. 'When they got to London the first one got out then asked for his friends to be dropped off at a second address. 'When he got to the second address the guy got out and said ""my mate is still asleep, can you take him to his address, please"". The driver dropped the first two passengers home and was given the address of the third 'man', and told to wake him upon arrival where he would settle the fare . 'When he got there the driver couldn't wake him up to start with, then he realised it was a fully-clothed mannequin wearing a hat. 'He was expecting the last passenger to pay the fare so he lost the whole lot. It would have probably been around £140. 'It has been the funniest thing which has happened to one of our drivers. You can imagine the stick the driver got from the other workers when he got back to Brighton - it was hilarious.'","The men travelling from Brighton to London carried a mannequin into cab .

"The pressure increased on embattled Gold Coast Titans star Greg Bird as it was revealed he allegedly supplied cocaine at his own buck’s party and the day after his wedding.

The Courier Mail reported that the NSW Origin star and former Titans co-captain has denied the allegations and will look to prove his innocence in court. Scroll down for video . Greg Bird, pictured playing for Australia against England, allegedly supplied cocaine at his own buck's night . Court documents allegedly show that Bird’s two counts of supplying cocaine stem from dates in November and December last year, the same time as his buck’s party and the day after his wedding. On the same night as the second allegation Bird was caught urinating on a police car in public in Byron Bay. It was an incident that later cost him the co-captaincy of his side. Titans players Beau Falloon and Jamie Dowling along with Queensland Reds vice-­captain Karmichael Hunt will face Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday after they were the first footballers charged over the cocaine controversy. The buck’s party for Bird in Byron bay had several NRL players in attendance. In particular one-time Titans teammate Joe Vickery, who faces seven counts of supplying cocaine.

"Ben Carson stated in an interview on Wednesday that he thinks being gay is 'absolutely' a choice. The potential Republican presidential candidate then used the example of prisoners to provide support for his statement. 'Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight — and when they come out, they’re gay,' said Carson. Scroll down for video . Ben Carson (above) said in an interview on Tuesday that he believes being gay is 'absolutely' a choice . The comments were made during an interview on the CNN program New Day when host Chris Cuomo asked the retired doctor if he did in fact believe that being gay was a choice. Carson followed up his comment by implying that something happens to incarcerated individuals while behind bars that makes them choose to be gay. 'So did something happen while they were in there?' he said. 'Ask yourself that question.' He then went in on the issue of gay marriage. 'Why do gay people want to get married? Why do they say they want to get married? Because they want to have various rights -- property rights, visitation rights,' he said. 'Why can't any two human beings, I don't care what their sexual orientation is, why can't they have the legal right to do those things? That does not require changing the definition of marriage.' For this reason he said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level, this on the same day the Alabama Supreme Court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. Carson is in favor of civil unions. Carson has long been outspoken when it comes to his opinions on gay marriage, which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech. In an interview with Sean Hannity, Carson said; 'My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are.' He continued by saying; 'They don't get to change the definition. So he, it's not something that is against gays, it's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.' The comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point Carson has come across as an affable and moderate Republican in a series of interviews. The backlash was so strong, especially among young Americans, that Carson was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater Johns Hopkins. Earlier this week Carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president, becoming the first high-profile Republican candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race.","Ben Carson said in an interview on Tuesday that he believes being gay is 'absolutely' a choice .

"Claims emerged on Tuesday that Karrueche Tran's on-off boyfriend Chris Brown had fathered a child with another woman. And by Wednesday morning the 26-year-old dumped the singer via Twitter, writing: 'Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family.' 'No baby drama for me,' the model and socialite concluded, breaking up with the troubled young man (once again) on the micro-blogging site. She's done: Karrueche Tran broke up with Chris Brown on Twitter on Wednesday, pictured on Tuesday, following claims he fathered a child with another woman . It is unclear if Brown, 25, was on a break during his tumultuous relationship with Karrueche when he allegedly fathered the nine-month-old child. When the news first broke on Tuesday, Karrueche was seen make-up free and looking downcast as she took her dog for a walk in Los Angeles. TMZ reported short after that Karrueche was 'blindsised' by the baby news, having no idea about he child. The model and socialite was casually dressed in sweats and trainers as she appeared a bit tired while clutching her cellphone and a pink dog leash. Dumped: The 26-year-old broke up with the singer once again via the micro-blogging site . A new dad? Brown, pictured on Monday in Atlanta, has fathered a nine-month-old baby with a model named Nia, according to TMZ . Brown's baby mama, according to TMZ, is an aspiring model and nursing student from Texas named Nia Amey. Pictures from the 31-year-old's modelling site see her topless as she describes herself as someone who is always up for adventure. The Hispanic Texan says in her modelling profile from 2009: 'My name is Nia Amey. I am a 25 year old aspiring model. Before the storm: Brown is pictured last month with on/off girlfriend of four years, Karrueche, who is not the mother of his young child . Happier time: The on-off pair pictured sitting front row at a NYFW runway show last month . 'I'm a full time nursing student and a very outgoing person. I love photography and always up for new adventures.' TMZ claims, Nia has 'known Chris for several years'. Sources connected to both Nia and Chris told the site they are 'on very good terms', however they are currently not dating. And perhaps adding insult to injury Karrueche has met Nia before.

The Loyal singer has been romantically liked to model Karrueche for the past four years. However the pair's relationship has always been rocky, and the pair have frequently split before reuniting. The pair were seen together last month, hand in hand at New York Fashion Week. But back in December, Chris launched a lengthy attack on his girlfriend via Instagram. Out and about: Karrueche, 26, was seen out with a friend in Studio City on Monday night . After pulling her up on only visiting him once during his four months in prison, he then accused her of 'going on dates with Drake'. He added: 'I made it clear to the world who my girl was and and made your life equal to mine even at the cost of me not focusing on my career at times. 'When this relationship first started u knew what it was and even participated in threesomes. I slowed all that s*** down.' Before dating Karrueche, Chris was in a relationship with singer Rihanna who he started dating in 2008. On February 8, 2009, an argument in the Deuces singer's car ended with a physical altercation that left the then-20-year-old Bajan beauty hospitalised with multiple contusions to her face. Chris, then just 19, turned himself in to police, where he was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats. He was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats, before pleading not guilty at his arraignment. Forgiven: Chris was involved with singer Rihanna before his romance with Karreuche. They started dating in 2008, split in 2009 and briefly reunited in late 2012. They're seen at the 2013 Grammy Awards . On June 22, 2009, the star pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years' formal probation, and domestic violence counseling. Chris started dating model Karreuche in 2011 before splitting up in late 2012 when he became romantically involved with Riri again. After the couple split in May 2013, Chris resumed his relationship with Karreuche.",TMZ report Karrueche had 'no idea' about the child .
"An 18-year-old North Carolina woman who made headlines last year as the 'cute mugshot girl' after her arrest on drug charges has landed behind bars - and in front of a camera - once again.

Last month, a man named Sean Kory who bares a striking resemblance to Jeremy Meeks was arrested for assaulting a man with a Tennis racket on Halloween. He was reportedly arrested over the weekend after yelling 'I hate Fox News' and attacking a person dressed as a Fox News reporter at a Halloween parade, reports RawStory. Despite hating the news, his mugshot happened to show up in various media outlets along with his other good looking counterparts behaving badly.

"If you have tried and failed to play everything from the violin to the drums and your attic is a graveyard of neglected instruments, a new gadget may be for you. ‘Instrument 1’ claims to be one electronic device that lets you ‘be the whole band’ because it can be used as a variety of instruments, including a guitar, violin, bass, piano and drum machine. The gadget which slightly resembles a guitar’s fret board, connects to a smartphone, tablet or computer, to allow a user to play any instrument, style and sound on it. Scroll down for video . ‘Instrument 1’ (pictured centre) claims to be one electronic device that lets you ‘be the whole band’ because it can be used as a variety of instruments, including a guitar, violin, bass, piano and drum machine . It can be used with hundreds of musical apps, such as GarageBand because it recognises universal gestures, such as strumming, tapping, bowing and sliding, for example.

For example, it can be held under the chin like a violin or laid flat on a table like a piano.

It has digital strings that stand in for a guitar’s, for example, or separate notes and areas so it can be played like a piano, where frets become keys. The sound of notes can be changed by using guitar techniques on the fingerboard or by strumming on the bridge, as well as pressing hard and softly. ‘If you’re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine,’ the firm said. ‘And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.’ The device enables musicians to re-tune it instantly and turn frets on and off, allowing people to slide between notes seamlessly and use vibrato to make the sound ‘quiver’ - a technique used by professional violinists.

"A Massachusetts teenager's confession to police that he killed his math teacher cannot be used in his murder trial, a judge ruled Tuesday even as he allowed a bloody box cutter and other key pieces of evidence to be admitted. The ruling came in the case of 16-year-old Philip Chism, who has pleaded not guilty to raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer on school grounds in October 2013. Chism's lawyers had argued that police coerced their client, then 14, into making detailed statements about the killing, despite invoking his right to remain silent. Prosecutors maintained Chism and his mother had never absolutely demanded a lawyer. Scroll down for video . Confession not admissible: Philip Chism - seen here in a Massachusetts court in January - confessed to police that he killed his math teacher, however a judge has ruled it cannot be used in his murder trial . Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett, through a spokeswoman, said his office was still reviewing the decision. Calls to Chism's public defenders seeking comment were not immediately returned. Ritzer's family said in a statement it respected the court ruling and was confident that law enforcement 'acted responsibly and lawfully' in investigating their daughter's killing. The 48-page decision came after days of arguments and testimony on the defense's motion to suppress key pieces of evidence in the case. Salem Superior Court Judge David Lowy concluded that Chism had willingly talked to police in the town of Topsfield on the night of the killing, calmly answering questions and even correcting officers at various points. But Chism's demeanor changed when he was taken to the Danvers police station and further interrogated in his mother's presence, the judge noted. At that point, Lowy said, Chism grew uncomfortable and somewhat hostile. Murdered: Colleen Ritzer was a popular and enthusiastic math teacher at Danvers High School. Phillip Chism has pleaded not guilty to her rape and murder . Charged: Philip D. Chism was indicted by an Essex County grand jury today on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery in 2013 . He twice indicated his disinterest in speaking with Danvers police and 'did not appear to be fully engaged' or to appreciate the seriousness of what officers asked him as they explained his Miranda rights, the judge wrote. 'It is clear that the defendant wanted to talk to the police without his mother present in the room,' Lowy said in his ruling. 'It is also clear that he had no intention of talking while his mother was in the room.' As a result, the judge said, he would allow the statements Chism made to Topsfield police to be introduced as evidence but not his taped confession at the Danvers police station. He also allowed items gathered at Danvers High School, as well as those seized from Chism's pockets and backpack. They included Ritzer's ID and credit cards, a bloody box cutter and women's underwear. In memoriam: The campus of Danvers High School was flooded with flowers and other tokens following the October 2013 murder of teacher Colleen Ritzer . R.I.P.: Danvers High School community mourns the tragic death of beloved math teacher Colleen Ritzer whose body was found behind the school . But Lowy ruled prosecutors cannot use evidence from Chism's and Ritzer's cellphones, which were found near a movie complex. Authorities say surveillance video from October 22, 2013, shows Chism following Ritzer into a school bathroom, wearing gloves and a hood, then later walking out of the bathroom alone. A short time later, the video shows Chism pulling a recycling barrel through the school and outside. Ritzer's body was later found in nearby woods, naked from the waist down and with her throat slit and a note that read, 'I hate you all.' Authorities said she was sexually assaulted with a stick. A bloody recycling bin was found nearby.

Chism, who had recently moved to Massachusetts from Clarksville, Tennessee, was found that night by Topsfield police walking along a nearby highway. Prosecutors allege that after the killing, Chism used Ritzer's credit card to buy fast food and attend a movie at the mall. Chism's trial is scheduled for October 7.

"Islamic fanatics are stealing the life savings of UK pensioners to bankroll jihad in Syria. Masquerading as policemen, the extremists cold-call their targets and claim their bank details have been compromised. The frightened and unsuspecting victims are told to switch all their cash to another account to keep it safe. But the account belongs to the fraudsters and the money vanishes. It will be used to buy weapons, ammunition and combat gear for Islamic State militants. Police last night warned the public to avoid becoming a victim of the ‘cash for jihad’ telephone scam that mirrors swindles used by domestic con men. Anti-terror police are today searching seven addresses around London in relation to an alleged scam in which the elderly were targeted and thousands of pounds of their money being sent to extremists. File photo . The extremists have cheated one pensioner of £150,000. Two other victims, both aged in their 80s and from Cornwall, have lost £130,000 between them. Their only hope of getting their savings back is if the police can catch the culprits and find the cash. And yesterday Scotland Yard said that counter-terrorism officers had just arrested two men – aged 29 and 37 – in west London and a man of 23 in east London. They were being questioned last night on suspicion of fraud and money laundering. ‘Officers are investigating a large-scale fraud linked to UK extremists travelling to Syria,’ a Scotland Yard spokesman said. ‘The arrests form part of an ongoing fraud investigation, whereby unsuspecting vulnerable and elderly victims are cold-called on their home phone by a suspect impersonating a police officer, informing them their bank account has been compromised and deceiving victims into transferring money to an account under the control of the suspect. ‘Members of the public are strongly advised, if you receive a call like this to from someone claiming to be a police officer, hang up the phone, wait at least five minutes to make sure the phone line has cleared, or use another phone line, before ringing the phone number on your bank card.’ The Government is being urged to do more to stop the flow of money to Islamic State. Police suspect fraudsters linked to jihadists in Syria are targeting the elderly and vulnerable. File photo . It is considered to be the richest terror group in history and may have access to more than £1.2billion in cash. Its funds come from the revenue of captured oil fields, business extortion and hostage ransoms. There are also concerns that donations to British aid organisations are being diverted to terrorists. The Charity Commission is scrutinising 86 foundations it believes could be at risk from extremism. Thirty-seven are working to help victims of the Syria crisis. The commission has launched full-scale investigations into four charities operating in the Middle East, including the group that hostage Alan Henning was working for when he was kidnapped and later killed. Another organisation under suspicion is said to have been infiltrated by a suicide bomber. High street banks are closing or freezing accounts held by UK charities working in conflict zones, a think tank claimed yesterday. Salaries paid to the bank accounts of aid workers who live outside the UK have also been delayed or blocked, the Overseas Development Institute said. Scotland Yard announced today that it has arrested three men over an alleged cold calling scam funding terror . Tom Keatinge, a researcher for the ODI, said: ‘Tens of thousands of people in conflict areas such as Syria, Somalia and Gaza are depending on the life-saving assistance provided by UK charities, but these are precisely the locations that present the highest risks to banks under counter-terrorism legislation.’ The ODI wants the Treasury to give improved guidance on how banks, credit card firms, online donation websites and internet payment companies can comply with the law without adversely affecting legitimate aid activities. It also recommends that charities ensure their funds are adequately safeguarded from financing terrorism. One charity, which asked to remain anonymous, has been forced to give up donations worth £2million over the last 12 months as a result of funds being blocked by a bank. Fanatics have previously posed as charity collectors in town centres across the country to raise jihadi money. The arrests come after Terri Nicholson, of the Met's counter-terrorism command, warned benefit fraud, charity scams and student loan cash was being used to fund Islamic State fanatics in Syria. Speaking in November, she said: 'We are seeing diverse fraud including substantial fraud online, abuse of the benefits system, abuse of student loans, in order to fund terrorism. 'We have had a number of cases in recent times where student loans have been abused to fund both crime and terrorism. 'We have seen some cases where virtual currency is being considered and used by both criminals and terrorists. And so we are increasing our understanding of the abuse of those methods.' Speaking at the time, she urged the public to be careful when donating to charities to ensure their money is not diverted by 'undesirable individuals'. In the past two years months, police in London have seized £2.5million of donations destined for criminal and terrorist gangs. Ms Nicholson said police are adopting a 'cradle to the grave approach' to finding and stopping the financing of terrorism. She said: 'Together with the security service, we work extremely closely to understand those individuals who are at the heart of the terrorist financing effort and the enablers to that activity, because to cut off that supply route is the critical aim.'

"Military chiefs should resign over defence cuts before British troops become America’s ‘cannon fodder’, politicians and former top brass warned last night. Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, a member of the defence select committee, called for the Joint Chiefs to sacrifice their careers over plans to slash defence spending despite growing threats from Russia and Islamic State. Speaking at a meeting of the UK National Defence Association (UKNDA), he said the generals should make the people they command their priority and resign on principle, instead of focusing their efforts on ‘getting another star’. Colonel Bob Stewart, a former British commander in Bosnia, said Britain's military forces were in a 'parlous state' and could not take any further cuts . Later he said he was considering resigning himself, from either his seat or the select committee, adding: ‘I’m thinking about it to be honest – but that won’t make any difference.’ His comments came as it emerged more than 6,000 British troops are preparing to deploy under the command of an American unit as part of a high readiness reaction force. Fresh details emerged of future military operations after the head of the US army, General Raymond Odierno, said he was ‘very concerned’ about UK defence cuts. He told the Telegraph Britain will be demoted to a more junior role in future campaigns if spending is inadequate. David Cameron has resisted calls to make a public pledge not to cut military spending below 2 per cent - but had insisted he will not cut the size of the army any further . Former defence secretary Liam Fox has urged the Government not to cut military spending below 2 per cent . And yesterday, Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the idea of a UK brigade working under a 20,000-strong US division was ‘humiliating’. Air Commodore Andrew Lambert added: ‘The trouble with this is you provide the man power but with none of the authority. Why should we provide the man power – some people might call it cannon fodder – when what we would like to do is have a seat at the top table?’ During the meeting, former military top brass put pressure on the Government to commit Britain to meeting the Nato target of spending at least 2 per cent of national income on defence beyond 2016 – a prospect which looks unlikely. In a blistering attack on UK military spending – which has diminished as Russia’s defence capabilities increase – Sir Michael added: ‘It is token already and if we start cutting it any more it becomes laughable.’ Colonel Stewart, who commanded UN forces in Bosnia, said: ‘If we are really [in] a parlous state in defence, why are the Joint Chiefs of Staff not tendering their resignations? ‘They should actually put their responsibilities to the people who they command as their top priority, rather than getting another star.’ A damning report published by the UKNDA said that if Britain is forced into a conflict with Russia, our force levels are ‘pitifully small’ compared to those at the end of the Cold War. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We will meet the 2 per cent Nato spending target this year and next and have also committed to spending £163billion on equipment and equipment support to keep Britain safe.’ General Raymond Odierno, the Chief of Staff of the US army, last week warned he was 'very concerned' about the scale of the Coalition's military cuts .","MP Colonel Bob Stewart says UK military forces are in a 'parlous state'

Judge Flavio Roberto de Souza was dismissed from the high-profile case of Eike Batista, a former multi-billionaire tycoon who is accused of insider trading.

Luxury: Judge de Souza was caught behind the wheel of the £100,000 Porsche Cayenne - similar to the one pictured - that he had ordered to be seized from former billionaire Eike Batista . The judge claimed that police had no appropriate place to park the car - which was confiscated after an order that he issued - so he decided it was for the best if he took it home for safe keeping. Mr de Souza's decisions in the case have now been annulled, meaning a retrial is now required. A new judge is now expected to be appointed in the case, which began last November. Mr Batista was once Brazil's richest person, with an estimated £20 billion fortune. He is accused of manipulating market charges in the sales of shares of two of his companies. The 58-year-old made his fortune in mining, oil and gas exploration. He was listed as the seventh wealthiest person in the world as recently as 2012. He has denied any wrongdoing at the case being heard in Rio de Janeiro. If convicted, he faces up to 13 years in prison. Charged: Eike Batista was once Brazil's wealthiest man. He is on trial accused of manipulating market charges in the sales of shares of two of his companies . Last month, police seized 11 vehicles, including a Lamborghini Aventador as well as the Porsche, from Mr. Batista’s homes. They also removed expensive jewellery, a grand piano and a fake Fabergé egg as guarantees to repay investors if the entrepreneur is eventually found guilty. The cars were to be sold at auction and the proceeds held by a third-party until the conclusion of the trial, an action which is allowed under Brazilian law. The piano, which was being kept at the apartment of one of Mr de Souza’s neighbours, along with one of the seized cars have been returned to Mr Batista, said a court spokesperson.","Judge Flavio Roberto de Souza suspended driving supercar home .

"Electrical giant Currys-PC World has been censured by the advertising watchdog for selling ultra-high definition televisions with bogus promises about extra clarity. The retailer claimed the smart LG sets with 4K resolution, starting at £849, would allow customers to 'watch your favourite Christmas movies in greater detail'. But the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled that this was exaggerated and misleading because no British TV channel is yet broadcasting in 4K resolution. These broadcasts are currently only available via internet based subscription services such as Netflix. False claims: Currys-PC World claimed that the smart LG sets, like the one pictured, would allow viewers to watch Christmas movies in 'greater detail.' The Advertising Standards Authority found this to be 'exaggerated and misleading' as no British TV channel is broadcasting in 4K resolution yet . Currys-PC World said the LG set has 'automatic upscaling' to ensure images are sharper and clearer than on a normal HD set . Manufacturers including LG, Samsung and Sony have spent millions of pounds developing the technology – said to be four times sharper than existing HD TV. Currys-PC World said the LG set has 'automatic upscaling' to ensure images are sharper and clearer than on a normal HD set. As such, owners of the sets would see an improvement in picture quality regardless of whether the broadcast was in 4K. An offer of a 'free trial' of Amazon's Prime delivery service has been banned after the watchdog found the online retail giant misled consumers about subscription fees. The direct mailing sent to consumers with Amazon accounts included a plastic card stating '30-day free trial', information about the associated Amazon Prime Instant Video and a letter. Small text at the bottom of the letter said: 'Paid subscription starts automatically after free trial unless cancelled.' Six people complained that the ad was not sufficiently clear that a paid subscription would start automatically if not cancelled during the trial and did not state the cost of the subscription. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said a paid subscription starting automatically at the end of the trial was a commitment and a significant condition of the 'free' offer, and should therefore be made clear to consumers. But the ASA said the advert failed to give evidence of how effective this would be, although it accepted images may well be better on LG sets. It said: 'We also considered viewers would understand that the improved quality was achieved because the televisions were '4K Ultra HD', that this particular technology was therefore used to achieve the image quality and that the image quality achieved was subsequently of full and genuine 4K quality. 'Because there was such limited native 4K content available in the UK, we understood that any improvement in quality in films or programmes watched over the Christmas period was unlikely to be achieved by the use of 4K technology specifically.' It ruled the advertisement should not be repeated. The first 'HD Ready' sets and services emerged in 2006 to be followed by a new generation of sharper still 'Full HD' TVs in 2011 and then 3D televisions in 2013. Since then, there has been the super slim OLED screens that mean the sets can be hung on the wall like a work of art, together with curved screens claimed to improve viewing angles. And the innovations do not stop at 4K, as leading manufacturers are starting to demonstrate the new 8K TVs, which are eight times sharper than conventional HD sets and will be arriving in stores within two years. Currys-PC World said there were only three complaints to the ASA. A spokesman said: 'We will of course ensure future adverts are clear on this topic for customers.'","Claimed smart LG sets would show Christmas movies in 'greater detail'

"A local fisherman believes that trophy killings by tourists were behind the horrific mutilation and death of two large saltwater crocodiles at Dundee Beach in the Northern Territory on Wednesday. The NT Times reported that Darwin man Jake Hinton, 27, found the dead crocodiles while driving with his parents to go on a family fishing trip. Hinton's father found the first one on the ground in the run off from a little creek. It was missing a head and half-skinned, but did not appear to have any bullet holes. One crocodile had been there for a while. It was bloated and rotting . TOne of the crocodiles was missing a head and half-skinned on the ground . The second crocodile was found by Hinton about 200m from the mouth of the Finniss River. 'I could smell this one before we saw it, it had been there for a while and was bloated,' he told the NT Times. 'This one had nothing removed from it and there was an obvious bullet wound in its skull, which is probably why they didn’t take it. The second crocodile was found about 200m from the mouth of the Finniss River . 'I think it’s just senseless joy killing by idiot tourists looking for a trophy.' A spokeswoman for the Parks and Wildlife Commission said the department was investigating the incidents.

"Britain’s top prosecutor was yesterday forced to deny conducting a ‘witch-hunt’ against journalists after tens of millions of pounds were spent investigating them. MPs accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders of needlessly ruining lives by pursuing reporters over allegations then allowing them to languish on bail without being charged. Police and prosecutors have been criticised for arresting journalists on suspicion of a range of offences in the wake of phone-hacking allegations, rather than concentrating on terrorism, violent crime and serious fraud. MPs accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders (pictured) of needlessly ruining lives by pursuing reporters over allegations then allowing them to languish on bail without being charged . An ongoing four-year investigation into alleged wrongdoing by reporters had cost £33.5million up to the end of September 2014. Since 2011, 64 journalists have been arrested but only ten convicted, four of them being jailed. One has accepted a caution and seven have been acquitted. No further action was taken against 25 of the other journalists investigated. Mrs Saunders was challenged as she gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs select committee on police bail, following concerns suspects are being left in limbo. Conservative MP Michael Ellis said: ‘Are you conducting – you, the Crown Prosecution Service – a witch-hunt? An ongoing four-year investigation into alleged wrongdoing by reporters had cost £33.5million up to the end of September 2014 (file picture) ‘It is being suggested by more and more people that a witch-hunt is being conducted against journalists and celebrities. ‘Is it because of the groundswell of attention in this area that you are pursing these cases with insufficient evidence?’ Mrs Saunders said: ‘We are not conducting a witch-hunt against anyone, be it journalists or celebrities. 'We do not make any distinction when we look at cases as to who it is we are looking at. What we look at is the evidence.’ She insisted decisions should not be ‘made in haste’.","MPs have accused Alison Saunders of ruining lives by pursuing reporters .

"A New York City club for Republican women is being torn apart by a vitriolic fight after one member accused of board member of saying 'we don't want' lesbians at the exclusive 95-year-old league. Marilyn Thomas sent an email to the 1,000 members of the  Women's National Republican Club accusing 72-year-old Irene Marmott of scoffing at the membership of lesbian Republicans. According to Page Six, Ms Thomas accuses Mrs Marmott of declaring: 'We obviously can’t say that but, of course, we don’t want them here.' Irene Marmott, 72, (left) has been accused of saying 'of course we don't want' lesbians at the Women's National Republican Club in New York City by member Marilyn Thomas (right) The Manhattan club was founded by suffragists in 1921 as a way to educate female voters . Mrs Marmott denies making the remark. A lawyer for the club told the Post: 'She has no recollection of saying anything that could be construed as inappropriate.' The club on West 51st Street in Manhattan, charges at $544 initiation fee and $822 a year in dues. Founded in 1921 as a suffragist organization to educate female voters, it lists former First Ladies Barbara Bush, Laura Bush and Nancy Reagan as honorary members - though it refers to them on its website as Mrs George H.W. Bush, Mrs George W. Bush and Mrs Ronald Reagan. Ms Thomas, who works in film, also says Mrs Marmott had scorn for Republican commentator Margaret Hoover, a frequent speaker at the club who is also a prominent gay rights proponent within the GOP. 'Irene said that she had no idea that Margaret was ""wrapped up in something like that,'"" according to the email. Club dues are $822 a year and the initiation fee is $544.

"When Nina Langley experienced excruciating pain seven-and-a-half months into her pregnancy, she assumed she was going into labour early. The 32-year-old went to A&E, prepared to give birth to her baby son, Teddy. Instead, she was given the devastating news that the pain was being caused by bowel cancer that had spread to her liver. A year ago she had also been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a disease which sometimes has similar symptoms to bowel cancer. Scroll down for video . Nina Langley, 32, was rushed for an emergency Caesarean section at seven-and-a-half months pregnant, after doctors discovered she had cancer. She is pictured with son Teddy . Miss Langley began suffering unbearable pain and believed she was going into labour early, but when she went into hospital tests revealed she had bowel cancer that had spread to her liver . Miss Langley's fiancé, Ed Cusick, who had proposed five months ago, said hearing Nina had cancer was the worst moment of his life . Then, throughout her pregnancy she had suffered rib and shoulder pain, but doctors reassured her this was probably being caused by the strain of carrying a baby. Miss Langley was rushed for an emergency Caesarean to deliver her son Teddy six weeks early so she could start life-saving treatment. Now she is set to start chemotherapy once her body has recovered from the operation. Her fiancé, Ed Cusick, who proposed five months ago, has been left heartbroken by her diagnosis. Mr Cusick, 38, a musician, said: 'Nina is my whole world and I'm completely devastated that she has been diagnosed with cancer. 'We were so excited about becoming parents but Nina's shocking diagnosis has overshadowed our happiness.' Miss Langley, a graphic designer from Buckingham, had consulted doctors about the rib and shoulder pain she was suffering, but had been reassured it was pregnancy-related. Then on February 8th, the pain became so unbearable she began to worry she might be going into labour and so went to A&E. As Teddy was born six weeks prematurely, he was kept in hospital so doctors could monitor his growing . Mr Cusick is terrified his fiancé will not live to see her new son grow up, and has began researching specialist cancer treatments online and fundraising to pay for them . Mr Cusick said: 'The thought of meeting our new baby filled us with months of excitement but suddenly the experience turned into a living nightmare. 'I never expected it be to cancer, I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. 'But I need to stay strong for Nina and I decided to put a status on Facebook as a cry for help and that led to me setting up a fundraising page to help with the costs of life-saving specialist treatments that aren't available on the NHS.' Doctors believed Miss Langley might have an infection in her liver, but a biopsy confirmed she had primary bowel cancer that had spread to the organ. She was sent for an emergency Caesarean on February 17 to deliver her son Teddy, who was born prematurely, weighing 5lbs 13oz. Mr Cusick said being told of the diagnosis was the worst moment of his life. He said: 'It was a moment of complete dread and fear when we first heard the word cancer. 'Nina was a lot braver than me at first, I just can't imagine losing her as she's my whole life along with Teddy.' The news was all the more devastating given that Miss Langley's own father had passed away from cancer in October. Now, Miss Langley is due to start chemotherapy next week, after her body has healed from the emergency Caesarean. The couple have decided not to ask doctors what Miss Langley's prognosis is, in order to remain positive. Mr Cusick said: 'We haven't asked about what the future holds for Nina, we just need to stay positive as possible. Mr Cusick has been left heartbroken by the news Nina has cancer. He said: 'I just can't imagine losing her as she's my whole life along with Teddy' A year ago, Miss Langley was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a disease which has many of the same symptoms as bowel cancer. She is pictured with her fiancé on holiday last year . 'It's a petrifying worry for Nina that she won't see our Teddy grow up but with the help of specialist treatments and those provided on the NHS we aim to throw everything we've got at this cancer so we can stay together as a family.' After Miss Langley was incorrectly diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Mr Cusick hopes her story will be a warning to others with similar symptoms to seek help. She was suffering stomach cramps and going to the toilet more often than usual, which doctors said was due to IBS. But because she was so young, no further tests were carried out. Mr Cusick said: 'I hope other people read Nina's story and seek a second opinion if they feel they have worrying symptoms.' The couple were allowed home on February 22, two weeks after first going to A&E with possible labour pains. 'She is my soul mate, I can't believe this has happened,' Mr Cusick said of the cancer diagnosis . As Teddy was born prematurely, he was kept in hospital and fed via a tube, so doctors could monitor his growing, . The finally was finally reunited when he came home three days ago. Mr Cusick said: 'Teddy coming home has really lifted Nina's spirits, I haven't hardly slept since he has been home but it's amazing that we are finally all together. 'We are supposed to be excited new parents but this joy has been masked by the fear of Nina's diagnosis. 'Nina watched her dad die from brain cancer in October and having Teddy this year the light at the end of the tunnel, it's just so cruel and unfair that Nina has been diagnosed with cancer as she is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. 'I proposed to her five months ago, she is my soul mate, I just can't believe this has happened to us.' Desperate not to lose his fiancé, he has began researching specialist treatments online, many only available abroad, which he hopes may prolong her life. He has even begun fundraising money to pay for treatment, if doctors agree they could help beat Miss Langley's cancer. He said supportive friends and family have rallied round the couple, pledging thousands of pounds towards the treatments and organising a fundraising events for Miss Langley's cancer fight. Mr Cusick said: 'The support we have received has been fantastic, every little helps and I want Nina to receive the best possible treatment available so if we need to go half way across the world to get it we will.' 'One of the specialist treatments we are considering is called Nano Knife which targets tumours faster alongside her chemotherapy, we just need to hit her cancer with everything possible. 'Losing Nina is not an option, I would devote to my whole life to ensure she beat this.' To donate, visit Miss Langley's fundraising website. Three three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools, abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits such as looser, more frequent stools . The three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools, changes in bowel habit (such as to more frequent, looser stools) and abdominal (tummy) pain. However, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually due to something you have eaten. As almost nine out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over 60 years old, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments. Most people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following symptom combinations: .

"Families face having to wait for four weeks for household rubbish, including food waste, to be collected (file picture) Families face having to wait for four weeks for household rubbish, including food waste, to be collected. Labour-run Fife Council yesterday became the first local authority in the UK to announce a trial of monthly bin pick-ups. It means food scraps and rubbish including soiled nappies, pet waste, used kitchen towels and sanitary products will be left to rot for weeks. Other councils are monitoring the scheme and East Ayrshire Council is to bring in three-weekly collections by the end of May. Last night the initiative – which Fife Council claims will save £900,000 a year from 2021 when extra limits will apply to landfill waste – was criticised as another reduction in the service to householders as councils escalate their ‘green’ crusade. Scottish Tory environment spokesman Jamie McGrigor said: ‘People across Scotland have been deeply unhappy about bin collections being reduced to fortnightly. ‘They will be even more furious at the prospect of this halving again. ‘It’s a huge inconvenience for families, particularly those with babies, and frankly this experiment has gone far enough.’ Fife Council says it has to bring in the scheme because of a need to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill, due to punitive EU taxation. In addition, from January 1, 2021, landfilling will no longer be an option for biodegradable waste disposal because of new waste regulations. The main alternative is incineration which the council believes ‘may be significantly more expensive than landfilling.’ A separate Fife trial, in addition to monthly collections, will see such general waste picked up once every three weeks, with the council upping recycling collections to help householders cope with the build-up of festering rubbish. Four bins are used by Fife householders: one for general or non-recyclable waste – also known as ‘residual’ rubbish – another for cans and plastic, a third for paper and card and the fourth for food and garden waste. Under the four-weekly scheme, families who use nappies will be offered fortnightly pick-ups of their general waste. But the people participating in the three-weekly trial who throw out nappies will have to wait for the full three weeks for them to be picked up – though they will be able to get bigger bins. The scheme means food scraps and rubbish including soiled nappies, pet waste, used kitchen towels and sanitary products will be left to rot for weeks (file picture) Council officials said ‘criteria will be developed for this’ so it is clear when people will be entitled to a larger landfill bin, for example if they have nappies or medical needs. At the moment, the council offers ‘additional capacity for those who have two or more children aged three or under and those with the medical requirements.’ In the winter months, between November and February, food and garden waste will only be collected once a month under both of the Fife trials, with fortnightly pick-ups during the summer. At the moment, all food waste in the region is picked up every fortnight throughout the year. But the changes will fuel fears of vermin infestation. Rentokil has previously warned that rats will target rubbish regardless of the time of year and can gnaw through food packaging. Chris Ewing, chief operating officer of Resource Efficient Solutions - the new company set up by Fife Council to provide waste and consultancy services - said: ‘Fife is well-placed to meet the Scottish Government target of 60 per cent recycling by 2020 but considerable effort will have to be made now to meet the 2025 target of 70 per cent recycling of all wastes. ‘If no improvements are made to the current four bin system and the cost for landfill disposals stays the same this could cost the council an extra £1.5 million a year.’ Scottish Tory environment spokesman Jamie McGrigor (pictured) said people across Scotland have been 'deeply unhappy' about bin collections being reduced to fortnightly . The council hopes the changes will be extended across the region by 2018 depending on the outcome of the trials. Locations have not yet been decided. But last night a spokesman for TaxpayersScotland said: ‘Bin collection is one of the most basic services which taxpayers expect in exchange for their council tax. ‘Allowing food waste to fester in people’s bins for a month is simply outrageous. ‘What exactly is the council spending residents’ money on which justifies this drastic cut in basic bin collection?’ Last year, Highland Council also revealed plans to cut the frequency of collections including food waste but backed down and dropped them after a backlash. The Scottish Government has said it is ‘up to individual councils to decide what is best for their local area in close consultation with residents.’ A Scottish Daily Mail investigation in 2013 found that most councils had moved to fortnightly collections, or were considering doing so, with officials mounting a crackdown on families who failed to fit two weeks’ rubbish into one wheelie bin. In 2013, Falkirk Council announced it would become the first in Britain to introduce bin collections every three weeks, for ‘residual waste’, saying the change would save £1.4 million a year, as landfill taxes soar. The money, it claimed, could pay for ten elderly people in a residential home or fund ten nursery classes. The Mail has also revealed that bins will be cut in size by almost half, with councils set to replace half a million wheelie bins with miniature versions. Four of Scotland’s largest councils - Fife, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Perth and Kinross - are cutting bin sizes from the standard 240 litres to only 180 litres or even 140 litres, to be picked up every fortnight. Families in Aberdeen and Edinburgh risk a criminal record if they overfill these new bins and could be taken to court simply for leaving out extra black bags. The cost of the new bins could hit £20.5million, plus the cost of disposing of the old ones.","Fife Council is first local authority in UK to announce monthly bin pick-ups .

"A Victorian book detailing plans to build a railway in Burma that was found in the personal library of Eric Lomax, the Scots army officer who became known as the Railway Man, is being sold along with photographs of West Africa's Gold Coast Railway being constructed. The book is an account of a survey carried out to assess the feasibility of laying tracks from China to Rangoon in 1888 - 54 years before Mr Lomax was forced to work on the Death Railway in Burma. It was found in his library along with hundreds of black-and-white photos and postcards showing the construction of the Gold Coast Railway in West Africa, which Mr Lomax worked on later in his life. Mr Lomax was one of 60,000 Allied prisoners-of-war made to build the Burma Railway under horrific conditions and his autobiography about his own ordeal was turned into the 2013 film The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth. This is one of dozens of images found in the personal collection of Eric Lomax that is being auctioned off. It's one of several photographs celebrating the opening of the first 26 miles of the Eastern Division of the Gold Coast Railway in Africa in 1910 and shows dignitaries aboard the train .

Mr Lomax worked on the Burma Railway under horrific conditions and his autobiography about the ordeal was turned into the 2013 film The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth. This book predates his time there by 54 years . Since his death in 2012, his widow Patti - played by Nicole Kidman in the critically-acclaimed movie - has been sorting out his library at their home in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland. The snaps had been lovingly compiled into two albums by war veteran Mr Lomax, a huge railway enthusiast who spent his life collecting books, documents and photos. They show British engineers overseeing the construction of the Gold Coast Railway in the early 20th century. After his brutal ordeal as a Japanese PoW, Mr Lomax struggled to adjust to civilian life and joined the Colonial Service, which administered most of Britain's overseas possessions. He was posted to the Gold Coast where he helped to build a huge dam across the Volta river and oversaw the construction of a 600 mile, 3ft 6in gauge railway. The photos, postcards and the book, Railway Connexion of Burmah and China, are now being sold by his family at auction in London. Henry Baggot, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'This book and the albums of photographs were left over from Eric Lomax's own library and they are now being sold by his family. 'The book is quite poignant when you consider what happed to him in the Second World War. 'When he came back from the Far East to the UK Mr Lomax struggled to settle down to a normal life again so he joined the Colonial Service and he was posted to the Gold Coast. 'Being the railway enthusiast that he was, he picked these photos and postcards up during his time there.' The first album contains 101 photos celebrating the opening of the first 26 miles of the Eastern Division of the Gold Coast Railway in 1910 and shows dignitaries aboard the train. The second is made up of 450 photos of the East, Central and West Divisions and shows surveying in the jungle, tree felling, construction of bridges, culverts and railway buildings. The rare copy of the book written by Archibald Colquhourn and Holt Hallett explores the possibility of building a railway between Rangoon, Burma, and south western China. Mr Lomax was posted to the Gold Coast where he helped to build a huge dam across the Volta river and oversaw the construction of a 600 mile, 3ft 6in gauge railway. This picture predates this project and is one of 450 that shows surveying in the jungle, tree felling, and construction of bridges, culverts and buildings in the East, Central and West Divisions of the African railway . The photographs and books were found in Mr Lomax's study and provide a fascinating insight into Colonial engineering . This picture shows dozens of men in Africa building a line through the jungle some time in the early 20th century . The latest sale of photo albums and the copy of the Railway Connexion of Burmah and China are said to be worth £900 and are being sold on March 18 . The work on the railway started in 1938 and was abandoned and never resumed due to the Japanese Army advancement in the Far East in the Second World War. The British had also looked into building a railway between Burma and Thailand but the route of the line - through hilly jungle terrain divided by many rivers – was considered too dangerous and difficult to undertake. Nonetheless, after the Japanese invaded Burma in 1942, they used forced labour involving nearly 200,000 Asian civilians and 60,000 Allied PoWs to work on building the railway. Of these, about 90,000 civilians and 12,600 PoWs died from disease, malnutrition and beatings. Last year Patti Lomax sold at auction an extensive collection of books relating to military history and the railways in the Far East which her late husband used for research on his autobiography.

When they arrived in the courtroom, Hannah's grieving parents were greeted with a hug by Gil Harrington, the mother of another slain college student. Authorities have said forensic evidence links Matthew to the 2009 death of 20-year-old Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, who vanished while attending a Metallica concert at University of Virginia. Matthew has not been charged in that case. 'I really felt honor-bound as Morgan's mother to be here today,' Harrington said after the hearing. 'Being a witness to these proceedings is one of the few things I can do for her.' Harrington said she made eye contact with the handcuffed and shackled Matthew when he was brought into court. 'It's a strange feeling,' she said. Matthew, 33, looked around the courtroom upon entering but said nothing during the hearing, which was attended by his relatives. Matthew's family members also were silent as they left the courthouse. When asked how Matthew was doing, defense attorney Jim Camblos said, 'He's holding up.' Prosecutors did not object to the defense motion to delay the trial, which had been set for June 29. A new date will be set at a status conference May 5. Albemarle County Circuit Judge Cheryl Higgins also approved a defense request that the state provide a DNA expert. Commonwealth's Attorney Denise Lunsford did not object.

"An Ohio couple charged with imprisoning three of their adopted children - two girls and a boy - for 22 hours a day and abusing them have pleaded not guilty, in a case that began after the girls managed to escape the 'house of horrors' and crashed the family van. The 58-year-old adopted father is charged with sexually abusing the two girls, who were 11 and 13 at the time of the alleged ordeal. He and his 64-year-old wife are both charged with kidnapping, felonious assault and endangering children in Ashtabula County, about 50 miles east of Cleveland. The suspects are not being named, in order to protect the identities of the victims. Abuse: Between September 2011 and September 2013, two juvenile girls and a mentally handicapped adult male were locked in their bedrooms 'virtually all day every day' and abused, prosecutors say. Their adoptive parents - who are not being identified - plead not guilty Wednesday to a variety of charges . County Prosecutor Nicholas Iarocci said the couple also abused and neglected their adopted son, now 21, who is mentally disabled. Iarocci said Wednesday that the couple 'repeatedly and harshly' beat the girls and older son with a paddle that police found to be stained with blood. The three victims were given little to eat and were malnourished, Iarocci said. He called living conditions inside the home 'deplorable.' The victims were typically allowed out of their rooms for two hours a day for school lessons, to eat and to use the bathroom, Iarocci said. They were not allowed to socialize with other children in recent years, he said. Iarocci could not explain why a younger adopted son, now 13, was not abused. Indictments allege the abuse occurred over a two-year period starting in September 2011. The investigation began after the two girls managed to pick the lock on their shared bedroom - the windows of which were boarded up - and escape in August 2013, speeding away in the van before getting into an accident, Iarocci said. After telling responding officers that they feared going home, the girls reluctantly revealed their squalid living conditions. The sisters did not mention the alleged abuse until after they were charged in the accident, and then they told their probation officer, according to the prosecutor. 'To be honest with you, as these children told me the story, it was hard to hold back some of the tears,' Iarocci told Fox 8 Cleveland. House of horrors: Two girls and an adopted boy were locked up in bedrooms in the couple's home, pictured, and the abuse only emerged after the girls escaped and stole the parents' car - but later crashed . Buckets and a metal container were left in the bedrooms for them to use as a bathroom when they were locked away, he said. The three children and the man were  removed from the home and placed in foster care a month after the crash. The couple adopted six children about 11 years ago but the abuse began only after two older boys left the family home after turning 18, Iarocci said. We can't explain why these people did what they did and when it started,' Larocci said. The abuse inflicted psychological damage on the girls, but they and their older adopted brother have thrived in foster care, Iarocci said. 'They're almost different children,' he said, adding that the girls are being adopted by another family. An attorney for the husband declined to comment on Wednesday. The wife is expected to be assigned an attorney in the next few days. Each are being held on $50,000 bail. Horrific: County prosecutor Nicholas Iarocci, pictured, said he cried when the girls detailed their abuse and he believes the system failed when they put the children in the couple's home . The children had been previously placed in the couple's home by Ashtabula County Children Services following background checks - but Iarocci said he didn't know how it had happened. 'I can't explain how these children ultimately were adopted by them - how they were originally fostered by these folks,' he told Fox 8. 'I think it's a failure of our system. Our system was broke. For any child to be placed in the custody or care of [the accused] was a terrible mistake.'","Father, 58, of Ashtabula County, pleaded not guilty to sexual abuse .

"A Laura Ashley boss worth £440 million has been ordered to pay his estranged former beauty queen wife £400,000 after he failed to persuade a judge that he has 'cash flow' problems. Lord Justice McFarlane today said it was 'very hard to understand' how someone of Khoo Kay Peng's wealth had 'cash flow difficulty' after he claimed he needed a month in order to borrow money and pay Pauline Chai. The couple, who were together for more than 40 years and have five children, have been locked in a bitter divorce battle for two years. Laura Ashley boss Khoo Kay Peng (right), who is worth £440 million, has been ordered to pay his estranged wife Pauline Chai £400,000 after he failed to persuade a judge that he has 'cash flow' problems . The judge was analysing the latest stage of the couple's money fight at a hearing in the Court of Appeal in London during which he was told that Dr Khoo owed Ms Chai around £400,000. He had been ordered to pay the amount to cover her living expenses and legal fees pending final decisions on money, but his lawyers claimed there was a 'cash flow' issue. Dr Khoo, 76, who is non-executive chairman of Laura Ashley Holdings, and Ms Chai, 68,  have been embroiled in litigation for around two years. Ms Chai estimates that Dr Khoo is worth at least £440 million and says she should get half of that. She also claims he has failed to give a 'proper account' of his assets, which Dr Khoo disputes. The former couple also cannot agree whether decisions about who should get what ought to be made in English or Malaysian courts, and litigation has been launched in both countries. Dr Khoo, who is based in Malaysia, says the marital home was in Malaysia, and that Ms Chai wants to fight in England because an English court will give her a more generous award. Lord Justice McFarlane today said it was 'very hard to understand' how someone of Khoo Kay Peng's wealth had 'cash flow difficulty' after he claimed he needed a month in order to borrow money and pay Ms Chai, a former Miss Malaysia . Ms Chai says they moved their home to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, before separating last year and therefore decisions should be made in an English court. And she claims Dr Khoo is making a 'desperate attempt' to avoid fighting over money in an English court. A number of judges have analysed the dispute at hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London, and three Court of Appeal judges are due to consider the case at a hearing in July. Lord Justice McFarlane today considered a number of preliminary legal issues prior to that hearing. The judge was told that Dr Khoo owed Ms Chai around £400,000 he had been ordered to pay to cover her living expenses and legal fees pending final decisions on money. A lawyer representing Dr Khoo accepted that the arrears 'must be paid' but said that was a 'cash flow issue'. 'We are talking about quite substantial sums,' said Timothy Scott QC. 'One way or another he has to borrow.' He added: 'Some time will be needed for the formalities. The appropriate time would be 28 days.' But  Lord Justice McFarlane ruled that the money should be paid in 14 days. 'It is very hard to understand how someone of the wealth of (Dr Khoo) has a cash flow difficulty,' said the judge. 'I am not at all persuaded that there is a cash flow difficulty.' He added: 'The time has come to be absolutely plain ... These sums need to be paid.'","Pauline Chai, 68, and Khoo Kay Peng, 76, split after 43 years of marriage .

"Take a look at the amount of fuel for star formation in the universe, compared to the number of stars, and you'll notice something strange - there should be 10 times as many stars as there are. It's a problem that has perplexed scientists, but now a study claims to have an answer, saying that the heat in star-forming clouds may be hindering stellar formation. They say that the temperatures are likely too hot to allow reasonable amounts of star formation, which leads to the observed lower number of stars we see in the cosmos today. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michigan State University have proposed a new theory for the lack of stars. Based on the amount of stellar fuel there should be 10 times as many. But the reason is because temperatures stop them forming. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field image is shown here . For a star to form, it relies on a cloud of gas to cool sufficiently so that it can gather into the large mass required for stellar formation. In particular, intracluster gas - that near the centre of a galaxy cluster - is normally a prime region for stellar formation. But just a handful of stars in  are born every year in some galaxies, despite an abundance of this gas, so there must be something hindering the gas from cooling and forming stars. Last month astronomers discovered stars forming in a remote region of the Milky Way not thought possible before. The stars were seen in a cloud of molecular gas 16,000 light-years below the flattened disc of our galaxy - further than any others ever seen. And if any planets were to form around these stars, inhabitants would see the entire glory of the spiral galaxy above them in their night sky. The amazing discovery - led by Dr Denilso Camargo of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil - marks the first time that star-forming clusters that are part of the Milky Way have been found this far from our galaxy. ‘This is the first time astronomers have found stars being born in such a remote location,’ said Dr Camargo. ‘Our work shows that the space around the galaxy is a lot less empty than we thought.’ 'The amount of fuel for star formation outpaces the amount of stars 10 times, so these clusters should be really star-rich,' said Dr Michael McDonald, a Hubble Fellow in Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. 'You really need some mechanism to prevent gas from cooling, otherwise the universe would have 10 times as many stars.' The theory proposed by the researchers from MIT and Michigan State University suggests a number of reasons for why this is so. For some galaxy clusters, the researchers say, the intracluster gas may simply be too hot - on the order of hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius. Even if one region experiences some cooling, the intensity of the surrounding heat would keep that region from cooling further - an effect known as conduction. 'For these hotter clusters, they're stuck in this hot state, and will never cool and form stars,' Dr McDonald says. 'Once you get into this very high-temperature regime, cooling is really inefficient, and they're stuck there forever.' He added to MailOnline that maybe, over tens of billions of years, they would cool down enough for stars to form. Dr McDonald told MailOnline that one of the only clusters observed to be 'cool' enough to allow rapid stellar formation was the Phoenix Cluster, shown here. 'This system was identified in the paper as the only cluster that appears to be undergoing a massive cooling-induced starburst,' he said. Meanwhile, for so-called 'cool core' galaxy clusters, the gas near the center may be cool enough to form some stars. However, a portion of this cooled gas may rain down into a central black hole, which then spews out hot material that serves to reheat the surroundings, preventing many stars from forming - an effect the team terms 'precipitation-driven feedback.' 'Some stars will form, but before it gets too out of hand, the black hole will heat everything back up -- it's like a thermostat for the cluster,' Dr McDonald said. 'The combination of conduction and precipitation-driven feedback provides a simple, clear picture of how star formation is governed in galaxy clusters.' Dr McDonald also explained to MailOnline that, if a human were to venture into one of these hot clusters, they 'probably wouldn't feel hot, because the particles are very low density.' 'So the heat exchange between your body and the hot gas would be very slow,' he added. 'You'd likely be killed by the lack of oxygen and extreme low pressure much faster.' The team collected data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (illustration shown) and the South Pole Telescope - an observatory in Antarctica that searches for far-off massive galaxy clusters. Dr McDonald and his colleagues compared their theoretical framework to observations of distant galaxy clusters, and found that their theory matched the observed differences between clusters. The team collected data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the South Pole Telescope - an observatory in Antarctica that searches for far-off massive galaxy clusters. The researchers compared their theoretical framework with the gas cooling times of every known galaxy cluster, and found that clusters filtered into two populations - very slowly cooling clusters, and clusters that are cooling rapidly, closer to the rate predicted by the group as a critical threshold. By using the theoretical framework, Dr McDonald says researchers may be able to predict the evolution of galaxy clusters, and the stars they produce. 'We've built a track that clusters follow,' Dr McDonald said. 'The nice, simple thing about this framework is that you're stuck in one of two modes, for a very long time, until something very catastrophic bumps you out, like a head-on collision with another cluster.' The researchers hope to look deeper into the theory to see whether the mechanisms regulating star formation in clusters also apply to individual galaxies. Preliminary evidence, he says, suggests that is the case. 'If we can use all this information to understand why or why not stars form around us, then we've made a big step forward,' Dr McDonald said. This Hubble  image of galaxy NGC 1275 reveals the fine, thread-like filamentary structures in the gas surrounding the galaxy. The red filaments are composed of cool gas being suspended by a magnetic field, and are surrounded by the 100-million-degree gas in the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster .","Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michigan State University have proposed a new theory for the lack of stars .

"A short circuit has temporarily rendered Nasa's Curiosity rover  inactive as engineers investigate the problem. The Mars rover stopped work when an electrical problem was discovered while it was using its arm to move powder into its sample container. The severity of the problem is not yet known, but Nasa said they expected to resume operations in several days if it can be resolved. A short circuit occurred in the rover's arm as it was moving. Nasa engineers in California are now investigating the problem. The rover (shown here in a recent mosaic image taken by its arm) had been transferring rock powder into a sample analysis container . 'We are running tests on the vehicle in its present configuration before we move the arm or drive,' said Curiosity Project Manager Jim Erickson, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'This gives us the best opportunity to determine where the short is.' The short circuit occurred while the rover was moving its arm on 27 February. When the rover detected the anomaly, it stopped the movement of its arm. Nasa said that such a brief short could have little effect on rover operations, or it 'could prompt the rover team to restrict use of a mechanism'. Quite how much lasting damage the short will have caused, if any, is not yet known. On Twitter the official account for the rover, @MarsCuriosity, said: 'Call me Johnny Five. Some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit.' The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. The fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover. This powder was taken from a rocket target called Telegraph Peak. Curiosity has successfully analysed five samples from drilling targets before in 2013 and 2014, but this is the first time this problem has arisen. On this particular occasion, Curiosity revealed the true colour of Mars was not red - but blue and grey. By drilling a few centimetres into the ground, the drill dug up material that had a different colouration to the surface. The fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover. This powder was taken from a rocket target called Telegraph Peak. The material appears blueish-grey, seen here, because it had not yet oxidised in the Martian air . The reason is that Mars is mostly made of silicon and oxygen, and also contains significant quantities of iron, magnesium, aluminium, calcium and potassium. When the soil is exposed to the air it oxidises and 'rusts', giving it its red appearance. 'We're sort of seeing a new colouration for Mars here, and it's an exciting one to us,' Joel Hurowitz, sampling system scientist for Curiosity at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), said in a statement. This raw-color view from Curiosity's Mastcam shows the rover's drill just after finishing a drilling operation at Telegraph Peak on 24 February 2015. Three days later, a fault-protection action by the rover halted a process of transferring sample powder that was collected during this drilling . On Twitter the official account for the rover, @MarsCuriosity, said: 'Call me Johnny Five [pictured]. Some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit.' One of the reasons for the particularly different colour might be the large amounts of silicon that were dug up, as analysed by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) on the rover. 'When you graph the ratios of silica to magnesium and silica to aluminium, 'Telegraph Peak' is toward the end of the range we've seen,' said Curiosity co-investigator Doug Ming, from the Nasa Johnson Space Centre in the US. 'It's what you would expect if there has been some acidic leaching. We want to see what minerals are present where we found this chemistry.' Curiosity is now continuing to climb Mount Sharp, at the centre of Gale Crater, to look back into the geological history of Mars - and analyse soils at different altitudes. The rover had been transferring material to the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument, seen here in a previous image taken by Curiosity. It has successfully analysed four drill samples before, but has not yet experienced this short circuit failure .","A short circuit occurred in the rover's arm as it was moving .

"TV star Martin Clunes left some viewers unconvinced when he attempted to master a Scottish accent in new drama Arthur And George. The Doc Martin actor, 53, plays Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the three-part ITV series, which made its debut last night. But his attempt at delivering the novelist's Edinburgh accent left some unimpressed, with many saying that his brogue kept changing in the new biopic. Scroll down for video . Martin Clunes, pictured, has been criticised on the internet over his 'wandering Scottish brogue' The Doc Martin star, left, was playing Edinburgh born writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle beside Arsher Ali, right . One Twitter user said: 'Martin Clunes does a good Scottish accent, shame he forgot to do it in the first scene' Steve Oliver wrote: 'Martin Clunes does a good Scottish accent, shame he forgot to do it in the first scene.' Matt Hill said: 'Was going to ask what part of Scotland Martin Clunes's accent was meant to be from, but he keeps changing it!' Shona Gibbs added: 'Don't think I can stand Martin Clunes' Edinburgh accent any longer.' Mark Grainger wrote: 'The biggest mystery in Arthur and George is where Martin Clunes' accent keeps wandering off to.' And Adam Cooke said: 'Martin Clunes' Scottish accent is atrocious.' The show started with more than 6 million viewers, but this slipped back to an average of 5.49 million, compared to last week's Broadchurch finale which averaged more than 7 million viewers. Some Broadchurch fans complained when the show returned in the New Year, that the former Dr Who star David Tennant was too Scottish, with some taking to Twitter to claim they needed to turn on the subtitles to follow the action. Clunes, pictured, said he was worried about playing Doyle as he was a 'very famous Scotsman' Others defended the star, with one viewer, tweeting as 'perfecto-cheese' writing: 'Not every Scot speaks like Billy Connolly!' William Forbes wrote: 'Really impressed with Martin Clunes' Edinburgh accent.' Annette Gordon added: 'I thought Clunes pulled off a Scottish accent very well. Very subtle'. The comments came after the Men Behaving Badly star admitted that he was daunted by the role and that he used a dialect coach to work on his Edinburgh accent. 'Conan Doyle is a very famous Scotsman so I had to speak with an authentic Scottish accent,' he previously said. 'I was terrified at the thought of playing him.' Arthur And George is adapted from Julian Barnes' book and tells the story of the novelist's attempt to clear the name of George Edalji, who was wrongly convicted of a crime in the 1800s. ITV chiefs were left red-faced last night after a modern lorry could clearly be seen in the background of the 1903 drama Arthur & George. The drama featuring Doc Martin star Martin Clunes faced mixed reviews last night over the main character's Scottish accent. The story is based on the life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who created Sherlock Holmes. The lights of the modern day lorry can be seen behind the actor on the right's shoulder . The show's creators took a great deal of time ensuring that the characters were dressed in period appropriate clothing and used vehicles from the time. But in one scene, overlooking an area of open space, a modern lorry can be seen slowly moving across the screen from right to left with its headlights switched on.","Twitter users criticised Martin Clunes for his attempt at a Scottish accent .

"A woman and her boyfriend were mown down in a jealous attack by her obsessed love rival, who used her car as a weapon to drag them 40 metres along the road in a horrific attack. Sonita Claire smashed into Kevin O'Neill - the father of her child - and Mary Jane Kimble at 30mph, hitting them from behind as they walked hand-in-hand on a busy Derby street. Miss Kimble needed 22 stitches and her hair, scalp and blood were left on the bonnet of Claire's car, while her boyfriend Mr O'Neill suffered a broken neck and collar bone. But despite the 'horror movie-style attack'  the couple, from Derby - who were both struck while Claire drove at 30mph towards them - are now engaged to be married and expecting a child together. Miss Kimble suffered serious injuries after she was hit at 30mph by her obsessed love rival . Mary-Jane Kimble (right) needed 22 stitches and her hair, scalp and blood was left on the bonnet of Sonita Claire's car, while her boyfriend Kevin O'Neill (left) suffered a broken neck and collar bone . Miss Kimble, 34, said that when she was first told what had happened to them after waking from a two-day coma she did not believe it. 'It sounded like the plot of a thriller movie,' she said. 'We were left unconscious in pools of blood. 'Kev had a broken neck and collar bone and I needed 22 stitches in my head. Claire, kitchen worker Mr O'Neill, and Miss Kimble had been caught in a 'love triangle' which had left Claire 'bitter and hurt', a court had previously heard. Mr O'Neill had first been in a relationship with Miss Kimble, and the couple had a child together, . But Miss Kimble said she became close to Claire, 28, in 2007 after her relationship with Mr O'Neill ended when their daughter Lily was around 15 months old. Sonita Claire, an aspiring actress from Derby, was jailed for seven years after she appeared at Nottingham Crown Court in January 2014 . Mr O'Neill started seeing Claire, a waitress at the bar where he worked, and Miss Kimble lost contact with both of them . But it was during this relationship that Claire, 28, started a dangerous obsession with Miss Kimble, and later secretly pretended that she and Mr O'Neill had split so she could befriend her love rival. A heavily pregnant Claire stopped Miss Kimble in the street, and told her she had split with Mr O'Neill and wanted their children – who would be half-siblings – to be close. Over the next seven years the pair became 'inseparable', with Miss Kimble and Claire bonding over their shared experiences. But it emerged that Claire was lying and had never split with Mr O'Neill. Miss Kimble only discovered the truth during a chance meeting with her ex-partner in the dentist – when he told her he had only recently spilt up with Claire. He also revealed Claire had become obsessed with Miss Kimble and lied about having passed on messages to Mr O'Neill from her. When Miss Kimble found out and got back together with Mr O'Neill, Claire – furious with jealousy – ran them both over. Claire, an aspiring actress from Derby, was jailed for seven years after she appeared at Nottingham Crown Court in January 2014. She admitted two counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. Judge Michael Stokes QC told her: 'Heaven has no rage like love turned to hatred, nor hell a woman like a woman scorned.' Mr O'Neill had first been in a relationship with Miss Kimble (pictured after the accident), before splitting and starting a romance with Claire . It was during this relationship that the Claire, 28, started a dangerous obsession with Miss Kimble, secretly befriending her while pretending that she and Mr O'Neill had split . Miss Kimble recalled how she met Mr O'Neill  in 2002. 'He had sparkly eyes and cheeky grin,' she said. 'Friends and family reckoned it wouldn't last. We got engaged and although we didn't get round to planning the wedding, three happy years on, in January 2005, we had a daughter Lily. 'One evening, I took our baby girl to see Kev at the bar where he worked as a bouncer. Walking in, I noticed a pretty waitress chatting away to him. Kev told me she was called Sonita. 'He said she had a thing for him. But then he said, ""She's got nothing on you"".' Miss Kimble said problems started emerging around this time with Mr O'Neill spending less time at home. When their daughter was 15 months old in 2007 they separated. She continued: 'We didn't part on good terms and lost all contact. I heard through mutual friends that he'd started dating Sonita. It was months later when I came face-to-face with Sonita – she had a huge bump.' A card Sonita sent Mr O'Neill from prison . Miss Kimble said Claire told her she was Mr O'Neill's girlfriend and their child was due in a week. She continued: 'Six months later I bumped into her again. This time she was pushing a pram. 'She told me things were over with her and Kev. I felt sorry for her as I knew how tough it was being a single mum. 'So I arranged a play-date with her and a few weeks later she came round. She told me she had been sleeping with Kev when we were still together. 'I felt the wind knocked out of me, but we stayed friends. Years went by and Sonita and I became inseparable. 'Her and her boy would come for sleepovers and we'd gossip into the early hours over a glass of wine.' Miss Kimble said in January 2013 she told Claire she was planning to get back in touch with Mr O'Neill. 'I told her Lily needed her dad,' she said. 'Sonita kindly offered to pass on my messages, but I heard nothing from Kev. But one day in the dentist I bumped in with him. 'He told me he'd just broken up with Sonita. He said she'd become fixated on me. 'I was confused because Sonita had said they'd broken up seven years ago.' Mr O'Neill told Miss Kimble this was not the case – and explained the reason for their break up. 'He said Sonita had got weird,' she said. 'He said she had started dressing like me and was obsessed with us getting back together. 'I called Sonita and she admitted the truth. She said, 'I wanted to tell you but couldn't find the right time'. 'I told her she was crazy. After that Kev came round regularly to see Lily and the old feelings came back. Claire and Mr O'Neill in happier times, after the birth of their child. But she soon became dangerously obsessed with his ex-partner, Miss Kimble. She later ran the pair over after they got back together . 'We started dating and were happy. But Sonita bombarded me with abusive messages every day, even started waiting outside Lily's school. One day she texted, ""I'm going to run you over"". 'She sent Kev the same thing.' The pair were on the way to the police station to report the messages on October 6, 2013 when they were hit. 'I heard a car speeding up behind us,' Miss Kimble said. 'Then everything went black. 'The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital, my mum at my side.' The couple underwent treatment with Mr O'Neill needing surgery on his neck. They were in court to see Claire jailed. 'Now I'm pregnant again, and Kev and I are planning our wedding,' Miss Kimble said. 'This time it's forever.'","Mary-Jane Kimble needed 22 stitches and Kevin O'Neill broke neck .

"Victor Razumov Jr., who stands accused of murder, gouged out both of his eyes in prison in December . A man accused of murdering an elderly widow in her home during a robbery has gouged out both of his eyes in separate incidents in prison, it has emerged. Victor Razumov Jr.'s horrific injuries were revealed as it emerged he will receive a competency hearing due to the two incidents in New Jersey State Prison in Trenton last December. 'He was transported to Trenton State Prison where he apparently, according to the guards, put his own eye out and was brought to Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia,' his attorney Robert Baer told the New Jersey Herald. 'Then he was brought back to Trenton State Prison and the next thing you know, he was back in the hospital and they're having to take his other eye out. Now he is completely blind.' It is not clear how Razumov gouged out his eyes. Baer said he is still waiting for further information as to what exactly happened. He will now undergo a hearing to determine if he's fit to stand trial, NJ.com reported. A status conference on the case is scheduled for May 30, his attorney said. Razumov was 18 when he was charged with murder for allegedly stabbing Virginia 'Suzy' Sommer, 73, to death during a robbery at her Wantage home in November 2012. Police tracked him down several days later after they found some of her stolen jewelry at local pawn shops. Locked up: Razumov, who had been transferred to a state psychiatric hospital after his November 2012 arrest, took out both of his eyes while behind bars at New Jersey State Prison, pictured . Among his multiple charges, he faces counts of stealing jewelry, selling stolen jewelry and tampering with a probation receipt by eating it, the New Jersey Herald reported. Razumov was a senior at High Point Regional High School at the time. His older brother, Alexey Razumov, was also charged in the crime after allegedly driving his younger brother to the pawn shops. He was charged with third-degree conspiring to deal in stolen property and third-degree conspiring to receive stolen property. After Victor Razumov was arrested, he was transferred to a state psychiatric hospital and placed under suicide watch, authorities said. It is not clear if he remained under suicide watch at the time of the eye-gouging incidents. Sommer, a retired nurse who lived about half a mile from Razumov, was found by a family friend who had been unable to reach her on the phone. She had been stabbed several times. Scene: Virginia Sommer, known to her friends as Suzy, was found stabbed to death inside this home where she lived alone after her husband passed away. Her jewelry was stolen and  turned up in a pawn shop . Police said there were no signs of forced entry and that nothing was out of place, and only the jewelry appeared to be missing. She left behind her three children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her late husband, Bob, had served as mayor of Lafayette. 'She was intelligent and she had a good sense of humor and she'd tell it like it is, you know a hard worker,' her friend Marie Flaumenbaum, 82, told the Sparta Independent after the murder. 'She was a wonderful person. She didn't deserve this.'","Victor Razumov Jr. gouged out his eyes in two separate incidents in Trenton State Prison, New Jersey in December, his attorney has said .

'This woman gave me her name and her badge number and said she was informing me that they were filing a warrant for my arrest,' Cadenhead said. Part of the scam: The scammers instruct their victims to put their cash onto prepaid MoneyPak cards . 'For tax fraud; and she started listing all the things they were going to do.' The women then allegedly threatened Cadenhead and said that is he didn't do what she told him to do she would freeze all of his accounts. 'My heart was racing. It was racing. I am very afraid at that point,' Cadenhead said. Even though Cadenhead didn't think that he did anything wrong, he feared for his reputation and was under extreme pressure. 'I don't want to cause embarrassment to my family, to my church. I'm retiring in a few months. This is not how I want to be remembered, being arrested,' Cadenhead said. Real threat: Treasury Department deputy inspector general for investigations Tim Camus said that the hoax is the 'largest, most pervasive impersonation scam in the history of the agency' Cadenhead recalls being on the phone for an entirety of 5 or 6 hours as he gave into their scheme. As directed by the woman, Cadenhead took out money from his banks and bought several prepaid MoneyPak cards. He then told her the pin number for the cards and they were able to steal $16,000, reports the Charlotte Observer. 'They knew just one intimate detail after another,' Cadenhead said on Friday at a news conference. They scare you to death.' 'This scam impacts everybody.

Over $70,000 had been raised for the 28-year-old's children by Wednesday afternoon, only two days after the Go Fund Me page was created by her high school friend Emma Luke . 'Everybody's touched by it. She has so many friends and other people who just want to help her kids at this time. Her family is massive as well, so lots of support for them,' Ms Luke told Fairfax. Ms Costigan's cousin, Nathan Costigan, confirmed that 'all of the money raised would be forwarded to the three children whose safety and wellbeing he said were the family's first priority right now'.

While more than 1,400 people have submitted donations on the page, hundreds more have offered clothing and toys after being touched by the tragedy. 'I am donating today because if my wife and I were to pass I would want to know that my little ones were looked after too. No one should have to grow up without their parents but should that happen its nice to know that society has your back,' one donor wrote.

"Smart home technology sounds promising but the costs for individual devices soon add up. Indeed a recent study found that making the average home 'smart' costs £1,509 ($2,519). But now Canadian-based Piper has created an all-in-one security and home automation device that looks like a regular camera but syncs with an app that is used to control appliances. Discreet: The small device (pictured in black on table) has a HD Panoramic camera with 180° fisheye lens and zoom alongside humidity, temperature and motion detector sensors . And because it works with an accessory called Z Wave plugs, the Piper and Piper nv (night vision) can turn even dumb gadgets, lights and more into smart devices. Piper nv is on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The small device has a HD Panoramic camera with 180° fisheye lens and zoom alongside humidity, temperature and motion detector sensors. Piper nv additionally has an infrared camera to make detecting intruders more accurate. Once connected, users can remotely monitor the inside and outside of their house using the cameras. From the app, homeowners can turn on lights, turn on the heating, switch on the TV, play music and more . Because Piper (pictured) works with an accessory called Z Wave plugs, the Piper and Piper nv (night vision) can turn even dumb gadgets, lights and more into smart devices . Security: Customise three security modes - home, away and vacation - motion detector and 105 decibel siren. Automation: Integrate Z-Wave accessories into Piper’s security modes, control them remotely, on a schedule, or using environmental data. HD Panoramic camera: 180° fisheye lens, electronic pan, tilt, and zoom, 1080p camera sensor . Customised alerts: Phone call, text message, email, and push notifications to users and their trusted circle when security rules are triggered . Environmental sensors: Monitor and control home temperature, humidity, ambient light and sound . Hardware: ARM processor, battery backup, internal memory for video storage, Wi-Fi. App: Available on Android and iOS smartphones and tablets . Two-way audio: Talk directly to occupants through Piper through its app on your mobile device. Multi-Piper setup: Supports up to five different Pipers within a home . Bedside mode: Featuring an active panic button, Bedside mode lets users manually turn on a siren in case of an emergency . If the cameras detect movement an alert will be sent to the homeowner (pictured) , and an optional siren will sound at 105 decibels . The device syncs with a free iOS and Android app and lets users set up three security modes - home, away and vacation. Once connected, users can remotely monitor the inside and outside of their house using the cameras. From the app, homeowners can turn on lights, turn on the heating, switch on the TV, play music and more. In fact, the app can control any smart device, or dumb device plugged into a Z Wave, so the possibilities are virtually endless and settings can be customised. For example, lights can be programmed to turn on at a set time. If the cameras detect movement an alert will be sent to the homeowner, and an optional siren will sound. This siren is 105 decibels - equivalent to sitting in a front row of a rock concert. Or if the homeowner doesn’t want to sound the siren they can set up phone call, email or text alerts. Alternatively, if a user is at home they can enable Panic mode. The Panic button sits permanently on their phone’s lock screen and is pressed to activate. This sounds the siren to warn off burglars. The app can also be programmed with ‘trusted circle’ contacts who are contacted in the case of emergency, or to check on the house if the homeowner is away and an alert is detected. The original Piper, without night vision mode, costs €199 (£145) while the latest Piper nv is €299 (£217) each. Z Wave plugs start at €59.95 (£43) each.","Piper nv is on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

"At the height of her fame she wouldn’t get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day. But now Linda Evangelista is facing rather more prosaic money issues after getting embroiled in a row over who's going to pay a $1.5 million (£980,000) bill to repair the roof of her luxury Manhattan penthouse. The Canadian model and other occupiers of the top-floor units at the Spears Building in Chelsea are suing the owners of the apartment block over the demand they pay the full cost of the work. Linda Evangelista is in a dispute with the owners of the building in which she has her Manhattan penthouse over a $1.5 million bill to replace its roof . The Spears Building, where penthouse residents including Miss Evangelista want the cost of replacing the roof to be shared by all residents. It is in an area of Chelsea where some apartments go for as much as £5 million . In a lawsuit filed on Monday, Miss Evangelista and other fellow top floor residents charge that the owners of the building at 525 W. 22nd St intend to violate the condominium’s bylaws by landing them with the entire seven-figure cost. They argue the expense is supposed to be covered by the owners of all 30 units in the luxury loft complex in a wealthy neighbourhood where apartments cost as much as £5 million. The lawsuit says the owners got a legal opinion in 2011  that only those with private rooftop terraces on the sixth floor had to contribute anything towards the ongoing cost of maintaining the roof, but that residents of the entire building would be expected to put money towards a full replacement . Instead of carrying out the replacement then, the board started charging unit owners extra monthly fees to build up a fund to pay for it at later date, the lawsuit alleges. Canadian Miss Evangelista, 49, was one of the original supermodels who ruled the catwalk in the 1990s . But the board reportedly decided last month to go back to the original plan and replace the roof but with penthouse residents only now expected to pay the entire cost, including financing. A formal vote on the proposals by the board is scheduled for Thursday night, but Miss Evangelista and other plaintiffs are seeking to postpone it. They want more information about the extent of the work needed so the penthouse owners can properly resolve the issue of who should pay for it. The group argue it is unacceptable how one of the penthouse owners was told he would have to cough up $177,000 (£116,000), minus $12,000 he had already paid into the roof maintenance fund. Miss Evangelista, 49, who was born in Canada, was one of the group of supermodels who became famous in the 1990s for ruling the catwalk. She supposedly coined the phrase: ‘We don’t get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day’ which came to symbolise the high money, high fashion world they lived in. Her spokesman was not available for comment.","Supermodel and other top-floor Spears Building residents in joint lawsuit .

"ESPN host Robert Flores is the latest person to take a pot-shot at Australian popstar Iggy Azalea over her huge success as a global hip hop star. Flores was presenting SportsCenter on Sunday evening when he made the wisecrack about Azalea while talking about her boyfriend, L.A. Lakers star Nick Young. A couple of weeks ago, 24-year-old Azalea had revealed that Young is terrified of dolphins because one once tried to kill him. Flores was presenting SportsCenter on Sunday evening when he made the wisecrack about Iggy Azalea while talking about her boyfriend, L.A. Lakers star Nick Young and his fear of dolphins . Basketball star Nick Young took to Twitter to express his anger at Flores for joking about his girlfriend . ‘We learned that, according to the Lakers’ Nick Young, a dolphin recently tried to kill him,’ said Flores during the What Did We Learn? segment of Sunday's show. ‘So, Nick, while dolphins are trying to kill you, your girlfriend is trying to kill hip-hop. Let’s call it even, okay?’ Azalea has remained quiet on the dis after quitting Twitter last month, but her boyfriend was far from amused at Flores' criticism. 'Your job is to talk about sports, not what me and my chick got going on,' he angrily tweeted. Young also appeared to threaten Flores, tweeting 'we got a problem' and 'I'm pretty sure we are going to run into each other soon.' Appearing on the Sedano and Stink radio show on Monday, Flores appeared to downplay any possible 'beef' between him and Young and said the joke was 'all in good fun.' The Australian pop star has been accused by a number of hip hop artists including Azealia Banks, Snoop Dogg, Q-Tip, Eve and soul singer Jill Scott of cultural appropriation . Flores however couldn't resist continuing the joke and said that he wasn't too worried about Young's apparent violent threat . 'If you look at his numbers, there is a 70 percent chance that — if he takes a shot at me — he’s going to miss. I’m just looking at the numbers, so I’m good.' As Azalea’s fame has grown, she has faced a growing wave of criticism – although up to now from hip hop artists – who have accused her of stealing from their culture and repackaging it for the mainstream. Before departing Twitter last month Azalea, whose real name is Amethyst Amelia Kelly, had become embroiled in various wars of words online with rival Azealia Banks as well as Snoop Dogg, Q-Tip, Eve and soul singer Jill Scott. Banks has accused Azalea of not caring about 'black issues'. 'Its funny to see people Like Igloo Australia silent when these things happen... Black Culture is cool, but black issues sure aren't huh?,’ she tweeted last year. The singer and boyfriend LA Laker Nick Young , seen at the UCLA Men's Basketball Game at The Galen Center in Los Angeles in January . Azalea rowed online with both Azealia Banks and Snoop Dogg before announcing that she was quitting Twitter last month . While Azalea accused Banks of having a bad attitude. She wrote: 'Special msg for banks: There are many black artists succeeding in all genres. The reason you haven't is because of your p**s poor attitude. Azalea has also rowed with Snoop Dog after he posted a picture on Instagram of a person with pale skin and cornrows, claiming it was a photograph of Iggy wearing no make-up. Snoop compared her to the two main characters from the film White Chicks naming the photo, 'White Chicks 2 starring Iggy'. She fought back comparing him to the type of guy that asks for your number and then says you are 'ugly when you say no'. Last month Azalea announced that she is taking a break from social media. 'I want you to know I am taking some time away from social media. I need to be happy and it is too negative and draining,' she told her followers. Minutes later she added: 'To become nasty because of the way I feel I am treated would be a disservice to my fans and I promise I will try to keep smiling.' She explained: 'I feel the hatred and pettiness I see online at all times is making me become an angry person and I cannot be that.'","Flores dissed Australian popstar Iggy Azalea during a short segment about her basketball-playing boyfriend on Sunday .

"Immigrants arrived in Britain at the rate of almost one every minute during the ‘open door’ years under New Labour, a devastating audit reveals. The influx caused the foreign population to swell by 3.6million between 1997 and 2010. The figure was four times higher than the previous 13 years and equivalent to the population of Britain’s five largest cities outside London – Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Sheffield and Bradford. Scroll down for video . One-way ticket: Polish migrants from Zychlin board a coach in Warsaw to start a new life working in Britain . The report was released as immigration – ranked the second most important issue by voters – finally came to prominence in the general election campaign. Ukip leader Nigel Farage came under attack from both the Tories and Labour after ditching his party’s commitment to cap net immigration at 50,000. And Ed Miliband attempted to seize the initiative on the issue, ridiculing David Cameron at Prime Minister’s Questions over the Tories’ failure to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Today the spotlight switches back to Labour’s own record, following the publication of a comprehensive study by the think-tank MigrationWatch. It found that, through a combination of deliberate policies and ‘cock-up’, 7.23million immigrants were allowed to arrive in the UK – almost one every minute. The figure includes relatives and children who accompanied their parents – but not offspring born to parents since arrival in the UK. Ed Miliband attempted to seize the initiative on the immigration issue at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday over the Tories’ failure to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ Discounting the number who left over the same 13-year period, net foreign immigration was 3.6million. However, the figure also excludes the huge numbers who are suspected of sneaking into the country illegally. Factors behind the surge in arrivals included the relaxation of visa rules for non-EU workers, a five-fold rise in foreign students as bogus colleges flourished and an ‘amnesty’ for more than 200,000 asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. Labour also made it harder for border guards to stop suspected sham marriages. But the most decisive factor was the party’s decision not to impose controls in 2004 when Poland and seven other former Eastern Bloc countries joined the EU. Ministers predicted only 13,000 would arrive each year – yet more than one million came. The MigrationWatch study argues that the mass immigration policy had such huge implications it should have been outlined in Labour’s election manifestos. But in 1997 the only reference was that ‘every country must have firm control over immigration and Britain is no exception’. The think-tank’s report says: ‘The New Labour years were characterised by a change in culture that was not shared by the wider public. ‘The mood at the top of government circles... was distinctly internationalist in its outlook and viewed national borders as an increasingly archaic feature in this new globalised world.’ The BBC is blamed for stifling debate on the subject, while anyone who dared to voice their concerns risked being ‘thought to be racist’. Damagingly for Mr Miliband, the analysis concludes that Labour may pursue similar policies if it returns to power – pointing out that the party leader forgot to mention immigration in his conference speech last year. Labour refuses to impose a target for net migration and has said it would remove foreign students from figures. MigrationWatch also points out the failure of Mr Cameron to meet his ‘tens of thousands pledge’ – with official figures last week showing net migration was almost 300,000 in the year to September 2014. Ukip leader Nigel Farage came under attack from both the Tories and Labour after ditching his party’s commitment to cap net immigration at 50,000 . But it warns Labour is ‘unable to capitalise on the Conservative failure as their legacy on the issue is as close to toxic as is possible’. MigrationWatch chairman Lord Green of Deddington said: ‘This is a fascinating but very sad story of how a small but determined group appear to have manipulated immigration policy while deterring any opponents with false allegations of racism.’ It doubted Labour would reduce the scale of immigration to a ‘sensible level’ and said pressure from pro-immigration groups would ‘very likely lead to the gates being thrown open once more’. The report by the independent think-tank says one possible explanation for Labour’s policy was a desire to win future elections. Once settled in the UK, migrants were entitled to apply for citizenship and vote in general elections. Labour also decided not to strip voting rights from one million people from the Commonwealth living in Britain who do not have citizenship. Under arcane rules, they can register on the electoral roll as long as they have an address in Britain. Open borders dogma that led to anarchy . Through deliberate policy changes and rank incompetence, Labour presided over the largest wave of immigration in modern history. Here, JAMES SLACK examines the key decisions which brought 3.6million foreign nationals to Britain... EASTERN EUROPE . Labour, unlike in almost every other major European economy, opted not to impose transitional controls when eight former Eastern Bloc countries joined the EU in 2004. Officials predicted only 13,000 would arrive. What followed was one of the largest peacetime movements of people in European history. At the end of 2004, there were 167,000 Eastern Europeans in the UK. Within two years the number had increased by 250,000. The total now stands at 1.077 million. Under Labour, Britain developed a reputation as a soft touch for asylum seekers – with gangs massing at Calais to try to leap aboard lorries or Eurostar trains. Pictured, illegal immigrants attempt to board a lorry . ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT AMNESTY . More than 220,000 failed and delayed asylum-seekers and migrants were granted permission to stay permanently from 2006 onwards in what was dubbed an effective amnesty. In many cases, the applicants had been stuck in the system for so long that it would have been a breach of their human right to a family life to kick them out. The Tories inherited a backlog of a further 368,100 cases from Labour in 2010. WORK VISAS . The rules for letting non-EU workers into the UK were relaxed, allowing skilled migrants to come in without first having a job offer. This was a deliberate strategy designed to produce economic growth. In 1997, 62,975 visas were granted to non-EU migrants for work, plus their dependants. By 2005 that figure had more than doubled to at least 137,035 a year. Tony Blair launched his Prime Minister’s Initiative to in 2009 to increase dramatically the number of non-EU students - but 50,000 students were bogus . BOGUS STUDENTS . In 1999 Tony Blair launched his Prime Minister’s Initiative to increase dramatically the number of non-EU students. Numbers duly rocketed from 39,000 in 1997 to 180,000 a year by the time Labour lost power in 2010 – but little care was taken over who was coming in. The National Audit Office found that in 2009 as many as 50,000 bogus students may have entered the UK to work rather than study. PRIMARY PURPOSE RULE . One of the new Government’s first acts in 1997 was to abolish a rule that placed the burden on foreign spouses to prove that it was not the primary purpose of their marriage to a British citizen or settled person to obtain residency in the UK. Immediately, it led to a sharp jump in the number of marriage visas – 32,200 were given out in 1998 compared to 21,000 in 1996. ABOLITION OF EXIT CHECKS . In 1998 Labour abandoned the system of logging people out of the country. The report claims this is likely to have led to more people overstaying their visas and becoming illegal immigrants. In 1997 17,000 citizens of the New Commonwealth departed – this number fell to 10,000 in 1998 when the checks were scrapped. ASYLUM CHAOS . Under Labour, Britain developed a reputation as a soft touch for asylum seekers – with gangs massing at Calais to try to leap aboard lorries or Eurostar trains. In 2002 almost 85,000 applications were received – up from 32,500 in 1997. The Human Rights Act introduced in 1998 made it harder to remove failed claimants.","During 'open door' years of 1997 and 2001 the number of immigrants rose .

"Claims emerged on Tuesday that Chris Brown has fathered a nine-month-old child with a longtime friend. The woman in question, according to TMZ, is an aspiring model and nursing student from Texas named Nia Amey (aka Nia Gonzalez). And perhaps adding insult to injury Brown's now ex girlfriend Karrueche Tran (she broke up with him on Wednesday via Twitter) not only knows Nia, she has partied with her. Meet the 'baby mama': Claims emerged this week that Chris Brown has fathered a nine-month-old child with a longtime friend and model named Nia Amey . They've met before: Karrueche Tran pictured with her arm around Nia in an Instagram snap from a Las Vegas party in May 2013 . The two women are in Brown's circle of friends and were both seen at a party in Las Vegas in May 2013. Karrueche was even pictured with her arm around Nia in an Instagram snap as the two women wore bikinis and blew kisses at the camera. Meanwhile, pictures from 31-year-old Nia's modelling site see her topless as she describes herself as someone who is always up for adventure. Party girls: Brown can be seen with the two women and host of other ladies partying . With the boys: Brown pictured at the same Vegas party in 2013 . The Hispanic Texan says in her modelling profile from 2009: 'My name is Nia Amey. I am a 25 year old aspiring model. 'I'm a full time nursing student and a very outgoing person. I love photography and always up for new adventures.' TMZ claims, Nia has 'known Chris for several years'. Sources connected to both Nia and Chris told the site they are 'on very good terms', however they are currently not dating. MediaTakeOut claims that Nia has been raising the child with another man, who has been led to believe he is the father. In school: In 2009 the now 31-year-old Texan said she was a nursing student and aspiring model . A new dad? Brown, pictured on Monday in Atlanta, has been friends with Nia for years . On Wednesday morning Brown's on-off girlfriend Karrueche dumped the singer via Twitter, writing: 'Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family.' 'No baby drama for me,' the model and socialite concluded, breaking up with the troubled young man (once again) on the micro-blogging site. It is unclear if Brown, 25, was on a break during his tumultuous relationship with Karrueche when he allegedly fathered the nine-month-old child. The Loyal singer has been romantically liked to model Karrueche for the past four years. However the pair's relationship has always been rocky, and the pair have frequently split before reuniting. She's done: Karrueche Tran broke up with Brown on Twitter on Wednesday, pictured on Tuesday, following claims he fathered a child with another woman .

But back in December, Chris launched a lengthy attack on his girlfriend via Instagram. After pulling her up on only visiting him once during his four months in prison, he then accused her of 'going on dates with Drake'. He added: 'I made it clear to the world who my girl was and and made your life equal to mine even at the cost of me not focusing on my career at times. Happier time: The on-off pair pictured sitting front row at a NYFW runway show last month . Full of love: Karrueche shared this snap accompanied by the caption 'my two baes' with Christina Milian . 'When this relationship first started u knew what it was and even participated in threesomes. I slowed all that s*** down.' Before dating Karrueche, Chris was in a relationship with singer Rihanna who he started dating in 2008. On February 8, 2009, an argument in the Deuces singer's car ended with a physical altercation that left the then-20-year-old Bajan beauty hospitalised with multiple contusions to her face. Out and about: Karrueche, 26, was seen out with a friend in Studio City on Monday night . Chris, then just 19, turned himself in to police, where he was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats. He was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats, before pleading not guilty at his arraignment. Forgiven: Chris was involved with singer Rihanna before his romance with Karreuche. They started dating in 2008, split in 2009 and briefly reunited in late 2012. They're seen at the 2013 Grammy Awards . On June 22, 2009, the star pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years' formal probation, and domestic violence counseling. Chris started dating model Karreuche in 2011 before splitting up in late 2012 when he became romantically involved with Riri again. After the couple split in May 2013, Chris resumed his relationship with Karreuche.","Nia Amey is a 31-year-old Hispanic model from Texas .

"Inventor: An Peishi, a university lecturer from Sichuan, is the inventor of 'panda tea' China is embracing the harvest season of possibly the world's most expensive and bizarre tea. Locals dressed in panda costumes participate in the annual spring tea-picking festival in Ya'an, Sichuan Province, according the People's Daily. Tea leaves in this plantation are known as 'panda tea', which is green tea cultivated with the faeces of China's symbolic animal. The first pick is expected to sell for ¥440,000 (£46,000) per kg. The man behind the brew is An Yanshi, a super panda enthusiast from Sichuan and a lecturer at Sichuan University. Since he invented the tea in November 2011, An has collected 10 tons of panda droppings to fertilise the plantation. He promises drinkers they can expect 'a mature and nutty taste'. Mr Yanshi said: 'Pandas have a very poor digestive system and only absorb about 30 per cent of everything they eat. Poo power: Mr An has used 10 tons of droppings of these cuddly animals since 2011 to grow green tea . 'That means their excrement is rich in fibres and nutrients. 'Just like green tea, bamboo contains an element that can prevent cancer.' First batch of tea every year, usually picked in spring, is considered the best brew in China. An said he hoped his 'panda poo tea' could make it into the Guinness Book of World Records as the most expensive tea.

"David Beckham's rippling abs, Cristiano Ronaldo's toned legs and David Gandy's chiselled jaw may sound like attributes of the  perfect man but, if the latest research is anything to go by, they're far from it. The major discrepancy between what men think women want and what women actually want has been brought to life after extensive research into body confidence. The research shows that 62 per cent of men still believe that women prefer the gladiator look - and suffer pangs of anxiety when they fail to match up to this image. The perfect man? Prince Harry's cheeky smile, comedian James Corden's hair, and Take Me Out host Paddy McGuinness' arms are all attributes of the ideal husband. Women also seek a stomach like rugby star Ben Cohen's and legs like Jonathan Ross' While men state that a woman’s ideal man would be made up of Justin Bieber’s hair, Gerard Butler’s chiselled face, Hugh Jackman’s movie-star arms, David Gandy’s tight abs and Cristiano Ronaldo’s smooth legs, the response from women showed a contrasting view. The reality of what women seek when it comes to bagging a keeper shows that they’re after Prince Harry’s cheeky smile, comedian James Corden's hair, and Take Me Out host Paddy McGuinness’  arms. A combiantion of James Corden, left, and Prince Harry, right, fits the reality of what women seek when it comes to bagging a long-term lover to start a family with . They also seek a stomach like rugby star Ben Cohen’s and, perhaps more curiously, legs like Jonathan Ross. Indeed, the survey revealed that a more rounded ‘boy next door’ physique is the more favourable look with 72 per cent of women who want to form lasting relationships.

The research also revealed that the most successful relationships had been made with a 'boy next door'. A spokesperson for Jacamo, who commissioned the research, said: 'Women tell us that men with ordinary bodies are seen as good family makers who pay more attention to their partners than they do to themselves. 'While hunks will always catch the eye, many women regard them as bad bets in the long run because they may be self-obsessed and more concerned with their own looks and needs rather than anyone else.'

"Mrs Clinton has yet to comment on the row over her private email server . Hillary Clinton arranged for a ‘homebrew’ email server to be set up whilst Secretary of State amid an atmosphere of ‘what Hillary wants, Hillary gets’. A former senior IT official in the Department of State told Dailymail.com that Mrs Clinton was ‘demanding’ and that staff had to get things done without asking too many questions. The existence of the server at her private home in Chappaqua, upstate New York, would have been known to just a close circle of friends as ‘these are things that are not discussed’, he said. The former official also spoke of his frustration that Mrs Clinton’s actions had deprived the public of vital historical records. He said: ‘I don’t agree with it. This is history that you are throwing away here’. Mrs Clinton, who is expected to run for President in 2016, has yet to comment on the row over her private email server, which she set up in 2009 when she came to office. Federal law requires all letters and emails written by government officials to be retained for Congressional committees, historians and so the media can access them. However Mrs Clinton did not even have a government email address whilst serving as America’s top diplomat for four years until 2013. Mrs Clinton’s actions mean it will be harder to obtain copies of the emails through Freedom of Information laws - and could have been a breach of federal law. The former official said he did not know at the time what Mrs Clinton was doing but said that he was ‘not surprised’ when it became public knowledge. He said that under her watch the mantra was: ‘This is what the Secretary wants, this is what the secretary gets.’ He said: ‘If you’ve ever met a Secretary of State they are demanding...that’s the reason they head the Department of State. Hillary was no different’. The former official said that the rules from the National Archives are ‘antiquated’ and say that it falls on the individual to save their emails for archiving purposes. There is little oversight meaning that Mrs Clinton would have effectively been able to decide herself how she would be presented in the history books, which the official said was wrong. He said: ‘Once you get into the senior levels of government, anything we talk about is going to be of historical merit, even if it might be minor now. ‘Twenty years from now it could be a major thing’. Mrs Clinton’s actions mean it will be harder to obtain copies of the emails through Freedom of Information laws - and could have been a breach of federal law . The row over the server is acutely embarrassing for Mrs Clinton and has stoked fears among Democrats that she might make the kind of missteps in 2016 that she did when she lost to Barack Obama in 2008. Republicans have said that, aside from the potential breach of security, what she did was ethically wrong. Mrs Clinton has so far not described her motivation for using a private email account - hdr22@clintonemail.com - which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym, Eric Hoteham. According to the Associated Press, that name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or Internet background searches. Eric Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton's $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010. The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton's email server. The former president's full name is William Jefferson Clinton. Jonathan Mayer, a PhD candidate in computer science & law lecturer at Stanford University, said that Mrs Clinton may have told her Internet service provider that she was starting a small business to allow her to set up the server. He said that Internet companies like Time Warner are wary about allowing individuals to do so as they might be hackers looking to send spam. Mr Mayer added that after carrying out his own tests it appears that Mrs Clinton’s server is still up and running, despite the ongoing row. He told Dailymail.com that it ‘does appear that it’s the same server, though I cannot be sure’. A Department of State spokeswoman has insisted that Mrs Clinton did not send any classified emails from her personal email account. She has also said that Mrs Clinton has handed over 55,000 emails to the National Archives, though not only after they were vetted by her team.

"Most parents dream of their children growing up to become doctors, lawyers or astronauts. But when Richard and Sara from Newport think of their nine-year-old son Toby's future, they see prison. The schoolboy, who features in a new programme tonight on Channel 5 called My Violent Child, has suffered from bouts of extreme violence since he was very young - even at the age of four he threatened his older brother, then five, with a knife. Scroll down for video . Sara and Richard from Newport are struggling to control their nine year old son Toby, who suffers from violent outburtss . Despite still not reaching double figures, he has already been in trouble with the police for causing permanent damage to a fellow child's mouth after hitting them with a brick. His father Richard said: 'From a very young age he was very aggressive. When he was about four, he held a knife to Casey and threw bricks at Casey.' He continued: 'We've had police at the house where he's thrown brick - a child ended up injured and needing dental treatment. 'I expect for Toby in his teens to be locked up, we're expecting that. Because he doesn't care.' Sara comforts Toby after one of his outbursts . The couple, who have three other children; Casey, 10, Corey, seven, and Jacob, four, have been unable to control Toby's behaviour for years because they have no idea what the root of the problem is or what will start him off. Sara said: 'Absolutely anything sets Toby off, it can be anything as daft as two items of food touching on his plate, a noise, a smell or something he sees - it can be anything. 'He's physically abusive, he's mentally abusive, he really gets to you - to the point that he makes me want to cry sometimes. 'Sometimes I just let him pinch me and hit me and then he'll calm down and sometimes he does. 'I don't want to live on edge every day when he wakes up, I should be able to enjoy being his mum.' Toby attacks his mother during a tantrum . Sara and her son Casey try to get Toby off a bike during one of his outbursts . The brunt of Toby's behaviour is borne by his parents - Richard and Sara have both been strangled by their son and during the hour-long programme, he is regularly filmed punching, biting and kicking them both. But the violence also extends to his brothers, including four-year-old Jacob, who is filmed being kicked by Toby in the park. His nature has become so unpredictable that Sara reveals she is worried about leaving them alone in a room. Sara reveals that she often just allows Toby to kick and punch her to calm him down . Sara said: 'I can't leave him with his brothers because I know he'll hit them.' The strain has become so great on Sara and Richard that it has almost split them up several times. Richard said: 'It has driven us to the point where we could have parted ways many times. 'When there's no more you can do for each other and we're struggling, it gets to the point where it would be easier to turn and walk away.' In an effort to find out what is causing Toby's outbursts, the programme makers call in parenting expert Sarah Evans. Following a discussion with Sara, she discovers that the very early years of his life were fraught with stress from the family's living situation. From left: Father Richard, Casey, 10, Toby, nine, Corey, seven, Jacob, four, and Sara . Sara and Richard had their eldest child Casey when Sara was just 14 years old, then 10 months later she gave birth to her second son Toby. Because of the strain of having two children so close together, Sara reveals that she was very stressed and admits that she didn't bond with Toby as well as she would have hoped. Sarah Evans then talks the family through a series of tricks that she can use to enforce the bond between mother and son and explains that much of Toby's behaviour may be down to the lack of affection. Sara attempts a bonding exercise with Toby . As Sara starts to use tactile behaviour, including hugging Toby when he is having a tantrum or lightly touching his hand, she sees that her son starts to come out of his tantrums much quicker. Sarah also discusses the importance of Richard spending time with his family. Richard works long hours six days a week in a car business in order to provide for his family, but Jane emphasises that his children also need him to be around at home. The family then spend a day at the farm together and the couple admit that they are beginning to see big improvements in their son. Sara said: 'It is early days but I hope that if I persevere with it then we'll get results down the line and I think that day will come.'

"Former German leader Helmut Schmidt today stunned his countrymen by revealing he cheated on his wife during their 68-year marriage. The disclosure came when extracts of his new autobiography were printed in a German magazine. 'I had a relationship with another woman,' said Schmidt, who lost his wife Loki five years ago. Schmidt, 96, revealed his deepest personal secret in his book What I Still Want To Say, which is being serialised by the magazine Stern. He would not reveal the identity of his mistress nor how long the affair lasted. Former German Chancellor Helmut Schimdt  has admitted to having an affair during his 68-year marriage to Loki (pictured, above, with her husband in 2009) sometime in the late 60s or early 70s . 'It was at the end of the 60s or the beginning of the 70s,' he said, adding that his wife found out about it. He said she realised how 'close' it was and offered to leave him. 'I told her that was a totally fallacious idea,' he added. According to Stern, the woman was a colleague in the social democrat party which he led. He remained in contact with her 'for a long while' after the break up and attended her funeral two years ago. Back in the day: Schmidt (left) is pictured with then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on St Giorgio's Island for a summit of leaders of the European Economic Community in 1980 . Following the death of his wife, he began a relationship with Ruth Loah, 81, his long-time secretary and they are still together. 'Ruth saved my life,' said Schmidt, who was chancellor of Germany from 1974 until 1982. During his time as West Germany's chancellor he lead the country through Cold War tensions and a bloody wave of terror by far-left radicals, the Red Army Faction. He won the Iron Cross for his services in WWII which included action on both the eastern and western fronts. Last year, he revealed he had stashed 38,000 menthol cigarettes in his home because of fears the EU would try to ban them. He is well known for being excused for smoking in places where it is banned. Der Spiegel reported that the 40-a-day smoker has in the past managed to get away with it both in television studios and congress halls.","Schmidt, 96, reveals affair 'at the end of the 60s or beginning of the 70s'

"The printing press, the computer, sliced bread, the internet: Sometimes an invention comes along that changes the world as we know it. Whether or not D Free will be seated among these revolutionary inventions is hard to say at this stage, but the company behind it certainly thinks so. This small wearable device is worn on your belly and can tell you when it’s time to go the toilet, with an app on your phone sending you reminders. Scroll down for video . A San Francisco-based company has created a toilet alert wearable. D Free attaches to your belly button and monitors your intestine activity. When it is almost time to go an app gives you a 10-minute warning. It also tracks daily stats and tells you how many times you have gone . The company behind it, Triple W in San Francisco, said in a video that D Free ‘helps you to take back control of your life.’ They continued: ‘You’ll no longer feel stressed about unpredictable bowel movements.’ While technical details on the device are not known at the moment, it appears to take readings from your belly, and feeds them to an app. There are thousands of public toilets around the world, but finding one - especially when you’re desperate - can prove impossible. Plus, it's increasingly difficult to find one that is in working order and free to use. The Flush Toilet Finder app was created to solve this problem. It uses your phones GPS to find nearby public conveniences around the world that are free, and those that offer disabled access. It was built by Jake Ruston, 21, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and is based on a global database of 100,000 public toilets. The app knows when you when you need to go to the toilet, and gives you a 10-minute reminder when it’s nearly time to go. 'We have detected activity in your intestines,' the app says when it, well, detects activity in your intestines. The release date for the product is estimated to be December, and according to RocketNews24 an Indiegogo campaign will be launched in May of this year. The site also suggests that D Free will cost about £130 ($200) at first, but will eventually come down in price to about £35 ($50). Apparently, over time the app will learn more about your bowel movements, improving the accuracy of its information. From the video it also seems that the app will track the length of your bathroom breaks, and also shows you how often you are going each day. The developers say that it is especially useful for people who suffer from incontinence or those who have lost control of their bowel. ‘People with disabilities that need ample preparation time to go to the bathroom: the elderly, people with bowel dysfunctions, it can happen to anyone,’ the narrator in the video says. ‘When you go outside with D Free, D Free will notify you when it’s time for a bathroom break. You’ll have plenty of time to find a bathroom and accommodate your needs. No rushing required.’ The app knows when you when you need to go to the toilet, and gives you a 10-minute reminder when it’s nearly time to go (left).

"Militants fighting for the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front in Syria have released images showing them posing with American anti-tank missiles captured from Western-backed rebels. The terrorists are seen wearing military fatigues as they pose with deadly American-made BGM-71 TOW missiles in a warehouse in Atarib, a town 15 miles west of the city of Aleppo. The showboating images show the masked militants pointing to America logos on cardboard boxes filled with food and weapons, which were seized when the Western-backed moderate rebel group Harakat Hazm recently disbanded and allowed their headquarters to be overrun with  jihadis. The emergence of the photographs comes as Nusra Front militants announced they are considering splitting with Al Qaeda in order to create an antonymous terror organisation that can rival the Islamic State's reign of terror in Syria and Iraq. Showboating: The terrorists are seen wearing military fatigues as they pose with deadly American-made BGM-71 TOW missiles in a warehouse in Atarib, a town 15 miles west of the city of Aleppo . Taunting: The American food and weapon supplies are now in the hands of Al Qaeda-backed terrorists, who used social media to goad the U.S. military . The warehouse in Atarib had been held by members of Harakat Hazm since November but the fall of a nearby former government military base known as Base 46 led to the rebel militia declaring its disbandment last week. The United States military had provided Harakat Hazm with vast shipments of weapons and food supplies in recent months, according to the International Business Times. With the Nusra Front  having now seized control of Harakat Hazm-held buildings and territory, these supplies are now in the hands of Al Qaeda-backed terrorists, who used social media to goad the U.S. military. 'Thanks be to God, Allah let the Mujaheddin take these weapons after we fought the traitors [Harakat Hazm],' a Nusra Front-linked Twitter account boasted. 'Tens of American TOW missiles became for the Mujaheddin,' the message added, alongside pictures of militants pointing at the stamped boxes that prove the products are U.S.-made. Vast: The supplies were seized when the Western-backed moderate rebel group Harakat Hazm recently disbanded and allowed their headquarters to be overrun with jihadis . The photographs emerged as Nusra Front leaders announced they are considering cutting their links with Al Qaeda in order to form a new entity backed by Gulf states. Sources within and close to Nusra said that Qatar, which enjoys good relations with the group, is encouraging the terrorists to go ahead with the move, which would boost the militants' funding. The exercise could transform Nusra from a weakened militia group into a force capable of taking on Islamic State at a time when it is under pressure from bombing raids and advances by Kurdish and Iraqi military forces. It could also boost the influence of Qatar and its allies in the campaign to oust Assad, in line with the Gulf state's growing diplomatic ambitions in the region. Qatari officials were not available for comment. Extremists: Nusra Front militants (pictured) announced they are considering splitting with Al Qaeda in order to create an antonymous terror organisation that can rival the Islamic State's reign of terror in Syria and Iraq . Intelligence officials from Gulf states including Qatar have already met Nusra Front's leader Abu Mohamad al-Golani several times in a effort to encourage him to abandon Al Qaeda, sources say. They promised funding once it happens. 'A new entity will see the light soon, which will include Nusra and Jaysh al Muhajereen wel Ansar and other small brigades,' said Muzamjer al-Sham, a prominent jihadi figure who is close to Nusra Front and other Islamist groups in Syria. 'The name of Nusra will be abandoned. It will disengage from Al Qaeda. But not all the Nusra emirs agree and that is why the announcement has been delayed,' said Sham. The Qatari-led bid to rebrand Nusra and to provide it with new support could further complicate the war in Syria as the United States prepares to arm and train non-jihadist rebels to fight Islamic State. Nusra Front is listed as a terrorist group by the U.S. and has been sanctioned by the UN Security Council. But for Qatar at least, rebranding Nusra would remove legal obstacles to supporting it.","Nusra Front militants seized American weapons and food supplies in Syria .

"Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan may not be executed this week despite having just spent their first night on 'death island'. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has reportedly told an Al Jazeera journalist that there will be no executions this week. Al Jazeera's Indonesia correspondent Step Vaessen tweeted on Wednesday night: 'President Jokowi told me no executions this week at sidelines of interview I had with him this afternoon.' An official statement of when the duo will be killed by firing squad is expected to be announced later today. On Wednesday, Chan and Sukumaran left the cells that have been their home for much of the last decade at Kerobokan jail in Bali. They were arrested for the 2005 Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot. Scroll down for video . Myuran Sukuraman arrives in Cilacap - the closest port to Nusakambangan - on Wednesday morning local time . Fellow Bali Nine member Andrew Chan was also onboard the chartered flight to Cilacap . Indonesia deployed its heaviest security for the transfer - more than 100 police, armoured cars and even fighter jets. The Australians walked calmly from their cells as they were transferred, stopping to thank officers for their care and shaking their hands before they were handcuffed. Chan, now a Christian minister, took a Bible, and Sukumaran, an accomplished painter, took pencils and a drawing book. They were flown to Nusakambangan, and spent Wednesday night on the island where they are expected to face a firing squad. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has reportedly said there will be no executions this week . Al Jazeera's Indonesia correspondent Step Vaessen tweeted after her interview the Indoesian president on Wednesday night . On Thursday morning MPs in Australia gathered outside Parliament House in a final plea for mercy. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Labor leader Bill Shorten, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek all put their differences aside to stand together in a candlelight vigil. Ms Plibersek said a sense of 'helplessness' had united the MPs as they prayed and hoped for the lives of the Bali Nine duo to be spared. The Sydney Morning Herald reports Mr Abbot said: 'As people have been pointing out over the last little while here at this vigil, it would ennoble Indonesia if they were to extend mercy.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten (left) and Prime Minister Tony Abbott at a dawn candlelight vigil at Parliament House in Canberra, Thursday, March 5 .

Greens leader Christine Milne, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek at a dawn candlelight vigil held for Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew ChanP . President Joko Widodo emphasised to Al Jazeera that the decision to execute the two Australians had been made by the Indonesian court system, 9News reported. He also defended the country's notoriously corrupt justice system's ability to hand out appropriate penalties for drug offenses, saying the decision was 'valid.' Chan and Sukumaran's families are expected to arrive in Cilacap, the nearest town to the island, on Thursday, flying from Sydney and Bali. They will be allowed to visit the men, Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo says, but he is yet to announce a date for the executions, saying only it will be as soon as possible. He is also reconsidering how many prisoners should be executed at one time, after planning for weeks for 10 to be shot simultaneously. 'We want to show the world that Indonesia is trying very hard to combat drugs,' he said. The prisoners will get 72 hours' notice of the executions. This is their final journey to Nusakambangan before they will be executed by firing squad .

"It is one of the most toxic substances known to man and has been used to poison kings, emperors and even prize winning racehorses. But scientists have discovered one small population of people living in a remote part of the Andes in north west Argentina who have developed some resistance to arsenic. They have found that over thousands of years the local inhabitants there have developed a genetic ability to metabolise the arsenic to reduce the impact it has on their bodies. Local women in San Antonio de los Cobres in the Andes (pictutred above) carry a genetic variant that gives them greater tolerance of the poison arsenic by helping them to metabolise the element more efficiently . Worldwide arsenic poisoning caused by contaminated water and food is thought to harm more than 137 million people. Even low levels of arsenic poisoning can cause damage to the lungs, heart, kidneys and liver, leading to cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Napoleon Bonaparte’s mysterious death has generated a host of murder conspiracy theories over the years. The Emperor was said to have died from stomach cancer. The physician who led the autopsy found evidence of a stomach ulcer but some people said it was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of the Emperor. Napoleon's father died of stomach cancer. In 1955 the diaries of the leader's valet were published, which included the description of bed-bound Napoleon months before his death. Based on the description, scientists put forward other theories as to why he died - which included arsenic poisoning. Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. It was noted in a later book that Napoleon's body was found to be remarkably well preserved when moved in 1840 and arsenic is a preservative. In 2007 a toxicologist said he found mineral arsenic in napoleon's hair shafts, which supported the theory that he was murdered. The wallpaper used in the emperors bedroom on St Helena also contained high levels of arsenic compound used by British manufacturers as a dye. It has been suspected that if the wallpaper got hot it might have emitted the poisonous gas arsine, but other scientists think the poison would have had to be consumed internally - or that the leader really did die of cancer. In higher doses it can damage the immune system, trigger bleeding, convulsions and eventually coma and death. However, people living in the sparsely populated area around San Antonio de los Cobres, a village high in the Andes in the Puna region of Argentina, appear to have developed a way of dealing with the poison more effectively. For close to 11,000 years the indigenous population there, who are descended from the Atacameños people, have been drinking water contaminated with arsenic. Dr Karin Broberg, a researcher in environmental medicine at Lunds University in Sweden, and her colleagues found that some time between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, the local populations in the region underwent some genetic changes that have given a greater resistance to arsenic. They found that the people living in the area are able to consume more than 20 times the levels that are currently considered to be a safe expsoure level. Dr Broberg told MailOnline: 'The arsenic is in the volcanic bedrock and at some places in higher concentrations. 'The arsenic has then been released into springs that are used for drinking water purposes. 'Yet the people living in this area have a relatively high arsenic exposure and a efficient and less toxic metabolism.' Dr Broberg and her colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, studied the genome of 124 Andean women living around the village of San Antonio de los Cobres. They also screened the women for their ability to metabolise arsenic by looking for levels of the mettaliod element in their urine. They pinpointed a key set of mutations in their genes that appear to have given them the ability to tolerate far high levels of arsenic exposure. They found one gene in particular - AS3MT, which is thought to play a role in arsenic metabolism - occurred in far higher frequencies compared to populations living in Columbia and Peru. The village of San Antonio de los Cobres is located in a remote part of the Andes in north west Argentina . Arsenic was commonly used as an ingredient in medicine and cosmetics but also was often used as a poison . They estimate that the increase in this gene variant occurred around 10,000 to 7,000 year ago based on high levels of arsenic found in the hair of a mummy excavated in the region. Other populations around the world are known to carry this particular AS3MT gene variant, with the highest frequencies in Peruvians, Native Americans and Vietnam. The researchers say this is an example of human adaptation to an environmental poison - something that is often seen in animals such as rats. Arsenic contamination can occur as a result of industrial activity such as gold mining but also occurs naturally. During the Elizabethan era arsenic trioxide was used to create makeup for women's faces. It was also used to make poisonous gas lewisite during the First World War, which caused its victims to blister before they died. The bedrock in the area around San Antonio de los Cobres (shown above) contains high levels of arsenic . The poison was also implicated in the causing maddness of King George III and the death of Napoleon Bonaparte. In 2008 the authorities in China also confirmed that Emperoro Guangxu, who was the second last emperor to rule the country, was poisoned with a massive dose of arsenic. King Faisal I of iraq was also found to have suffered symptoms of arsenic poisoning while in Switzerland in 1993 and South American independence leader Simon bolivar is thought to have died due to chronic arsenic poisoning. The successful race horse Phar Lap was also found to have died after a massive dose of arsenic. Dr Broberg said although the people in San Antonio de los Cobres were not consuming anything near these levels, they did have more resistance than other populations. she said: 'These levels do not result in acute toxicity but arsenic slowly damages cells and tissues and can result in later diseases. 'It is important to emphasis that the people living in this area also can get adverse effects of arsenic, as arsenic is very potent, despite having a more efficient metabolism. 'Their potential degree of tolerance is something we want to look into.'","Locals in San Antonio de los Cobres, Argentina have resistance to poison .
Their water supply is contaminated with arsenic 20 times level deemed safe .

"A South American coati which was wrongly mistaken for a 'small bear' has  been captured after it spent two months on the run. The animal escaped from its private owner in Fawley, in Buckinghamshire, just after New Year and the RSPCA were inundated with calls from people claiming to have seen a 'small bear'. Animal welfare officers began hunting the clawed coati after he was spotted up a tree in a garden in Marlow, last month. Scroll down for video . Found: The South American coati was spotted by members of the public, who believed it was a 'small bear' He was finally caught in a humane trap last Monday in the village and was reunited with his owners. Dennis Lovell, the charity's animal collection officer, said the caoti had been missing a month before they were contacted. He said: 'In early February we received a flurry of calls regarding a small bear like animal that was spotted in and around the Marlow area. 'It was eventually established it was actually a coatimundi that was on the loose after escaping from a home in the area. 'We soon discovered where he had escaped from and were in contact with the owners about getting him home safely. 'The coati seemed to be favouring three gardens by the river to visit for food so we laid a humane trap with pieces of fresh fruit at one of the properties. 'Thanks to the help of the nearby householders we were able to keep an eye on the trap and as soon as he was in there I was able to go down, collect him and return him to his owners. Caught: The coati escaped from its private owners after New Year and was finally captured in a humane trap . 'Considering he had been on the run for around two months he was in a very good condition and it was lovely to be able to reunite him with his owners.' Coatis, full name coatimundis and distant relatives to the raccoon, can be difficult to look after because their needs are so specialist. They are native to South, Central and parts of North America and are commonly found in tropical forests, living primarily on a diet of insects. The RSPCA has recommended that anyone considering getting one as a pet thoroughly researches the species.","Animal escaped from private owner in Buckinghamshire after New Year .

Matt, 36, refuses to speak his 71-year-old father's name and simply refers to him as 'my perpetrator' Matt, who claims he's 'not mad' about the situation, does sometimes use his hold last name when he speaks on behalf of Peaceful Hearts, his nonprofit organization, according to Bleacher Report. He started the foundation with his second wife Kim to help victims of childhood sexual abuse. Matt said: 'With the foundation, I'm Sandusky. 'Because, like it or not, people identify the name with everything that happened. 'And that's important to the cause.' Even though Matt will speak about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father, he refuses to say his name and simply calls him 'my perpetrator'.

Before the child abuse scandal Sandusky was best known for working under Hall of Fame Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. Matt was placed in foster care with the Sandusky family in January 1995. and adopted  after he turned 18. After revealing Sandusky's abuse, Matt was paid a civil settlement by Penn State. Dottie Sandusky, Jerry's wife, has always maintained her husband's innocence. Another one of their adopted sons, 39-year-old Jeff, also says his father is innocent. Given coach Paterno's legendary status in State College, some residents and football fans did not take kindly to Matt revealing what had happened to him. That was one of the reasons Kim and Matt picked out a new last name in August of 2013. According to Kim, Matt's four children (three with his first wife) were being hassled due to their surname. She said: 'The bullying was very bad. 'So as a family we decided to start new and let the kids avoid being stigmatized.' Coach Paterno's legendary status in State College led to Matt's four children being bullied at school . They did consider leaving, but opted to stay because 'there are a lot of caring people here', according to Matt. As of now, he plans to stay in State College and continue to spread his message.

"A man at his wit's end after inexplicably piling on 150lbs in just a year has finally had his medical mystery solved after being diagnosed with Cushing's disease - a rare form of brain tumor. Donelle Trotman, a father-of-two in his thirties from New York's Staten Island, underwent a series of tests by doctors who couldn't figure out his mysterious symptoms - major weight gain concentrated only to his upper body, as well as skin problems and crippling fatigue - but it was a medical intern who solved the riddle when he noticed unusual tell-tale stretch marks on his arms. Luckily for Mr Trotman, who told Today he had never been 'skinny', but never been 'overweight' before got sick, surgery to remove the mass was successful, and doctors expect him to make a full recovery within a year. Scroll down for video . Transformation: Donelle Trotman, pictured (left) before he suddenly gained 150lbs and (right) as he is now, was diagnosed with Cushing's disease, a rare form of brain tumor which is fatal unless treated in time . Mr Trotman first starting gaining weight three years ago. He was 180lbs when he was 18, but after his illness took hold, he rocketed up to 366lbs. Cushing's disease is caused by a tumor on the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain. It triggers excess levels of the steroid cortisol to be released in the body. Symptoms include upper body obesity, a swollen face, acne, skin bruising and purple stretch marks. Untreated, Cushing's disease can be fatal, but the prognosis is good if the growth is surgically removed in time. The disease affects fewer than 50,000 people in the U.S. each year. 'I doubled, like, I got a whole person on me,' he said. 'It was just specific places; my stomach, under my arms, my back of my neck, my face, the bottom of my back. 'My legs stayed the same for a long time.' Despite running and lifting weights, he continued to expand, and was soon so tired all the time that even chewing left him out of breath. Unbeknownst to Mr Trotman, the tumor on his pituitary gland was causing his brain to produce vast amounts of a natural steroid called cortisol. Mr Trotman went to New York's Lennox Hill hospital after he started experiencing double vision, but a slew of tests got doctors nowhere.

Jasem Emwazi, 51, feels there is 'no proof' that the black-clad knife-wielding man featured in chilling hostage execution videos is his eldest child, it was reported today. His Kuwaiti lawyer, Salem Al-Hashah, told Kuwait's respected Al-Qabas newspaper: 'He is not sure that he [Jihadi John] is his son. 'There is no proof that the man shown in the videos and photographs is his son, as the media has reported in the last few days.' Scroll down for video .

Mr Emwazi (left) was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by Kuwaiti police about his son's activities . He added: 'There is no evidence that Mohammed is the man in the videos because his face was covered.' The lawyer's comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by Mr Emwazi, who is said to have told a colleague that his son is 'a dog, an animal, a terrorist' and called for him to be killed. Mr Emwazi, who moved to the UK from his native Kuwait in 1994 and holds a British passport, was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by Kuwaiti police at the weekend about his son's activities. A Kuwaiti journalist present at a meeting in his lawyer's office in the upmarket Salmiya district of Kuwait said Mr Emwazi looked 'very scared' and was shaking. Mr Al-Hashah said the father is not responsible for what his son has done and that there is nothing to prove his father agreed with his son, or helped him in any way. The lawyer added: 'Jasem Emwazi is under stress. Many people are calling him names. He can't leave his home and can't walk outside. He is scared of people because everyone believes all the rumours that have been written about him.' The comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by Mr Emwazi (left) who allegedly told a colleague that his son is 'a dog, an animal, a terrorist'. Pictured right: Mohammed Emwazi in a 1996 school photograph . Mr Al-Hashah said Kuwaiti police called Mr Emwazi at the weekend and he was interviewed by officers for two to three hours before being allowed to go without any restrictions. The lawyer said no foreign intelligence services have tried to contact Mr Emwazi since his 26-year-old son was identified as Jihadi John last week. Mr Al-Hashah said Mr Emwazi and his eldest daughter Asma, 25, are currently in Kuwait. His wife Ghaneya, 47, and other children are in Britain. He said Asma, who studied architecture at university in London, has denied reports that there are other extremists in her family.

The lawyer insisted that Mr Emwazi does not have a job in Kuwait - although MailOnline yesterday spoke to three colleagues who said he is employed as the manager of a co-operative farm supplies depot near the Iraqi border. Mr Al-Hashah said he is in Kuwait temporarily to visit his mother and his daughter and had been in the country since November 30. Mr Emwazi now intends to sue media outlets and social media users who have damaged his family's reputation, his lawyer said. 'I have a message to the Kuwaiti people that many of the rumours are false,' he told the daily. Media and experts identified Emwazi as the ISIS militant believed to be responsible for beheading at least five Westerners. A recent film is believed to show Emwazi shortly after he arrived in Syria in 2013 (pictured) 'Because I felt that some people have believed it, I have assigned a lawyer to defend me and to prove ... that what is being said is untrue,' he said. It was not clear why he appeared to be retracting statements reported earlier that he and his wife had recognised their son's voice. His lawyer Salem al-Hashash said he would from Sunday file lawsuits against those who made accusations against Emwazi senior and his family. Hashash said his client was interrogated by the interior ministry for three hours and released. The Emwazi family were living in a house in north London (pictured) but Mr Emwazi is now in native Kuwait . A lawyer had been appointed in Britain to defend family members there, Hashash said. Mohammed Emwazi, the alleged executioner, was born in Kuwait to a stateless family of Iraqi origin. His parents moved to Britain in 1993 after their hopes of obtaining Kuwaiti citizenship were quashed. Emwazi visited Kuwait several times, the last time between January 18 and April 26, 2010, Al-Qabas said. A year later, he was denied entry to Kuwait after his name came up during investigations into attacks in Britain. Media and experts have identified Emwazi as the Islamic State group militant believed to be responsible for beheading at least five Westerners.","Jasem Emwazi not convinced balaclava-clad butcher is son Mohammed .

"The answer to life’s questions may not lie at the bottom of a bottle of whisky, but a smart label on its side could offer some words of 'wisdom'. Soon smart labels could grace the sides of Johnnie Walker whisky bottles, which would send advertising messages to consumers who scan them with their phones. The labels can also detect when the bottle is sealed and when it is opened. Scroll down for video . Soon smart labels could grace the sides of Johnnie Walker whisky bottles, which would send advertising messages to consumers who scan them with their phones (illustrated). A prototype bottle has gone on show at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . The prototype ‘smart bottle’ has gone on show at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It is the brainchild of drinks giant Diageo and ThinFilm Electronics, which develops printed electronics. The bottle has sensor tags using ThinFilm's OpenSense technology on its labels that allow the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky, or afterwards. It uses a smartphone’s near field communication (NFC) capabilities so that a handset can be hovered over the label to unlock its digital secrets. The bottle has sensor tags using ThinFilm's OpenSense technology on its label that allows the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky, or afterwards. It also tells a user that the bottle was properly sealed and when it is open (illustrated by the prototype) Scanning the label could, for example, give consumers special offers, cocktail recipes or film content. The technology could also be useful for the London-based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes. The sensor tags will remain readable after the factory seal has been broken so that they provide ‘an additional layer of security in protecting the authenticity of the product,’ Diageo says. This is because unlike static QR codes, which are easy to copy and don’t include sensors, the new labels will be permanently encoded in the factory do they can’t be copied or electronically modified. Scanning the label (pictured) with a phone could, for example, give consumers special offers, cocktail recipes or film content. The technology could also be useful for the London-based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes . The cloud-based software behind the integration is powered by a company called Evrything, which is delivering the mobile experience activated through the product label. ‘Mobile technology is changing the way we live and as a consumer brands company we want to embrace its power to deliver amazing new consumer experiences in the future,’ said Helen Michels, global innovation driver, at Diageo. ‘Our collaboration with Thinfilm allows us to explore all the amazing new possibilities enabled by smart-bottles for consumers, retailers and our own business and it sets the bar for technology innovation in the drinks industry.’ Davor Sutija, CEO of Thinfilm, said: ‘Today's conventional NFC mobile marketing solutions are not technologically advanced enough to create immersive or customisable consumer experiences.’ But he says that the ‘smart bottle’ technology will provide Diageo with intelligence as well as creating ‘engaging experiences for its customers’. Rare, vintage bottles of whisky can cost anywhere up to $1.4 million (£874,150) and can be aged in oak barrels stored in cellars for years. But there's a wooden tool that saves time and money called ‘Whiskey Element,’ which claims to be able to make cheap liquor taste expensive in just 24 hours. The oak sticks are specially designed to ‘age’ the drink by filtering out impurities and infusing the whisky with a more woody flavour similar to pricier tipples. Whiskey Element claims to make cheap alcohol taste like expensive whiskey by infusing it with a woody flavour when placed in a decanter (pictured) The sticks have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall-surface area touching the liquid. They are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whisky to replicate the taste of a more expensive tipple. They do this via ‘accelerated transpiration through capillary action,’ according to the Portland, Oregon-based company’s Kickstarter page, which means the liquid travels through tiny tubes in the wood. Tony Peniche explained that wood barrels are used for containing whisky because the wood is cut vertically so that capillaries are not exposed to the liquid, meaning that it doesn't slowly seep out of the sides of the wood. The sticks are made by cutting the wood horizontally to provide a ‘shorter distance for whisky to travel through its repetitive exposure to the capillaries, so it matures much faster and becomes of a much higher quality.’ To test the product, the inventors put their sticks through their paces in the lab, where they compared top shelf whiskey costing over $100 a bottle that had been aged for over 10 years, with cheaper versions treated with a Whiskey Element. They analysed the chemicals found in expensive and cheap whisky. Researchers found that the cheap bottles contained high levels of Methoxy-phenyl-Oxime – found in pig and mouse faeces – and Acetaldehyde, a compound blamed for hangovers. In comparison, the expensive aged bottles contained almost none of either. The researchers then added the oak sticks to the cheap liquor and waited 24 hours before testing them again. Mr Peniche said: ‘The results were amazing. They showed characteristics found in top-shelf aged whiskeys with notably higher levels of the chemicals responsible for good flavours and smells, as well as a significant reduction in Methoxy-phenyl-Oxime and Acetaldehyde.’ A two pack of the sticks cost $12 (£7.50).","Prototype ‘smart bottle’ is on show at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

It was the first time I had seen Lauren happy in a while. She was so bubbly and over the moon about her relationship with him. ‘In the long term they were looking to be together here. It was her world because her mum was here and the kids were settled in nursery. It was quite a shock for us to get the phone call about it.’ She added that her friend had been a sociable person who enjoyed going to the gym, saying: ‘She was so energetic and always loved being on the go, meeting up with all her friends and catching up for lunch.’ Yesterday, a relative who lives with Mr Digby in Aberdeen said his father had flown to Tenerife to be with him.

"A mother whose husband shot dead their two young children before taking his own life has revealed that her son and daughter continue to come to her in visions four years on. Speaking out for the first time since the tragedy, Zoey Mendoza, 41, has shared her heart-wrenching account of her final moments with five-year-old Jada and three-year-old Jordan, who were killed by her husband Kurtis Birth in Ringwood, New Jersey in October 2010. She also revealed that three weeks after their deaths, she read a book, Lessons from the Light by George Anderson, about how children continue to be with their families after they die. 'All of a sudden I heard my children giggling,' she told Yahoo Parenting. 'I sat straight up in bed and my room was bright white. It was like the sun was blazing though the windows, but it was nighttime. Missed: Zoey Mendoza has spoken out about the pain of losing her two children, five-year-old Jada, left, and three-year-old Jordan, right, who were killed by their father in New Jersey in October 2010 . 'There was a white staircase next to my bed and my kids were standing at the top, smiling. The second our eyes met, they ran to me. They held me and laughed. They let me know that they love me and will always be with me.' Mendoza said her son and daughter continue to come to her in visions, which gives her comfort as she continues to struggle with the pain of losing them. Troubled: Kurtis Birth, 38, killed his children and himself as the couple went through a separation . Recounting the weeks leading up to the murders, she said she had told her husband of 12 years that she wanted a separation but that it was something he didn't want. As he struggled to cope with the impending split, he attempted suicide and was put in a psychiatric hospital and they agreed they would attend therapy sessions together, she recalled. He promised to take medication for depression - although she later found out he had not - and they continued to care for the children together under one roof, she said. 'As a mother, my job was to protect my children, and one of my most defining struggles is that I never thought they were in danger with their father,' she said. 'I never knew I had to protect my babies from Kurtis.' On October 18, 2010, she took the children to their daycare center in Wayne for the final time. 'I gave [Jada] a big bear hug and Jordan jumped on my back,' she recalled. 'We were all tangled up together - warm and in love - for the last time.' Later that day,  Mendoza received a desperate call from her husband. 'I love you and I want to make this work,' he told her. 'Why don't you love me anymore? I don't understand why we can't fix this – please.' She told him they would speak about it later - but after an hour, he texted her to tell her he was going to pick up the children, which was not what they had previously decided. Tragedy: She recalled the hugs she shared with her kids before she said goodbye for them for the last time . Scene: The children were found dead inside an abandoned home belonging to their father's parents, while he was found dead inside his car. They were killed after he picked them up early from daycare . Fears: After finding out police had gathered outside the home hours an hour after she had reported her children missing, Mendoza rushed there and screamed that her husband had killed her babies . She raced over to their daycare center but learned they had already been collected. Mendoza urged police officers to look for her husband and children at his parents' Ringwood home, which was abandoned but still filled with odd furniture and belongings. 'This is where Kurtis found his grandfather's 20-year-old rifle that he used to kill our children,' she told Yahoo. At 7.30pm that evening, a friend called her to say the home was surrounded by police. 'I was frantic,' she remembered. 'On the 20-minute ride all I said was: He killed my kids. He killed my kids. He killed my kids.' Birth had shot Jada and Jordan in the back of their heads with a .22-caliber rifle before taking his own life in his parked car. When Mendoza arrived on the scene, she screamed: 'Those are my children!' After the tragedy, friends told news stations that they were baffled as to what had driven Birth, a account executive for Cablevision and a doting father, to take the lives of his children. New love: Mendoza, who now lives in a New York town, has remarried and has three stepchildren . There were no warning signs, they said. 'Those kids were everything to him and his wife was everything to him,' best friend Carlton Myers told The Record at the time. 'That's what makes it so much more unbelievable... He had more friends than anyone I knew.' Now Mendoza, who has re-married and has moved to a small town in New York, said she keeps her children's spirits alive by talking about them as often as she can. 'I talk and talk and talk to all of my dear family and friends about my feelings,' she said. 'I don't numb my pain. I live in it and walk through it every single day. I will honor my children for the rest of my life by sharing pictures and stories and dreams and memories.' When she re-married in 2012, their pictures hung either side of her during the ceremony. She is also working on her feelings towards her former husband and has tried to forgive him. 'The truth is that my children lived a beautiful, happy life with both of us,' she said. 'I know who Kurtis was before he was engulfed with depression and anxiety.'","Zoey Mendoza's five-year-old daughter Jada and three-year-old son Jordan were shot dead by her husband Kurtis Birth in New Jersey in 2010 .

"The nephew of John Travolta has come forward in a new interview to describe his decision to leave the Church of Scientology, and what his life has been like since. Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave Scientology in 2007 after almost taking his own life, and has now been forced to live on the run. 'It's psychological warfare and after a while it gets to you,' he said of being a member of the polarizing religion. 'Things got so bad that I tried to jump off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2007, trying to kill myself.' He spent 28 days in a mental institution following this incident, and that is when he finally left the church. Scroll down for video . The nephew of John Travolta (above with wife Kelly Preston) has come forward in a new interview to describe his decision to leave the Church of Scientology . Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave the Church of Scientology (above) after he tried to take his own life, at which point members began mouthing to hi, 'You are dead' Speaking with The National Enquirer, Sam did however say that his famous uncle did everything he could to help him, but even he could not stop the attacks that were waged against him after his decision to leave. 'Planting drugs on me' and 'spreading rumors around town that I was psychotic, and even worse - a pedophile,' are just two of the ways Sam claims members of the church tried to bring him down after his decision to leave Scientology. ''My uncle told me, ""Sorry, Sam, I can't help you. They don't care who I am.""' His uncle does however supply Sam with a monthly allowance, which is greatly appreciated by the struggling screenwriter. Sam also says in the interview that Travolta has never pressured members of his family into joining Scientology, though he does say he would be 'friendlier' to those individuals who were members of the church. The other claim Sam makes against the church, and one that has been brought up frequently by former members, is the amount of work required of members for little to no pay. Sam claims he worked as a file clerk, 'making $36 for a 60-hour week.' Then, there was the treatment he received from other members shortly before he left the church. Sam, claims they 'would mouth to me, ""You are dead,"" over and over again. It was all about mental control for them.' The 47-year-old says he has moved on now that the attacks have stopped, and he is finally trying to get his life back on track. Sam's interview meanwhile could not come at a worse time for the church, with the HBO documentary Going Clear set to premiere later this month. The film takes a look at the religion, and how its treatment of A-list members like Tom Cruise and Travolta, differs from others in the church. It is based on the book of the same name, which was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2013, and is based on interviews conducted with over 200 members of the religion who decided to leave the church. John Travolta's lawyer has denied the claims made by his nephew in this interview.","Sam Travolta Jr., the nephew of John Travolta, is discussing why he left Scientology in 2007 in a new interview, and what life has been like since .

"The bassist in a popular indie band has ruled himself out of the group's upcoming tour after he literally shot himself in the foot. Nick Gardner from Perth ensemble San Cisco was on a friend's farm taking some time out last week to hunt pests when the unfortunate incident occurred. The band member was with a friend near the West Australian town of Collie, about 200 kilometres south of Perth, when they were driving through rough terrain and the gun went off. The bass player in Perth band San Cisco has ruled himself out of the first leg of the band's upcoming tour after he literally shot himself in the foot . 'As we were driving through an exceptionally rough paddock, I reached down to stop the gun from bouncing around and before I knew it, it had gone off,' Gardner said. 'The bolt had slid down and the jolting had triggered the gun. Somewhat of a freak accident. I realised I had been shot and ripped off my boot and sock to reveal a hole in my foot and blood everywhere. Gardner then explained the mate he was with, Isaac, quickly jumped into action grabbing his first aid kit and bandaging his friend's foot up. The gun went off accidentally while the bassist was in the car on the way to hunt pests . 'He then started driving towards the nearest hospital, which was 100kms away. I passed out in shock and came to shaking and being yelled at. 'By the time we got to the hospital I was calm, but in excruciating pain. The doctors got morphine into me and put me in an ambulance headed for a bigger hospital,' he continued. 'I eventually made it to the Perth hospital where a specialist has done a great job putting my foot back together.' San Cisco (Nick Gardner is pictured left) kick off their international tour across the US, Mexico and Europe later this month . Although the bassist is now on the mend, he will miss the first leg of San Cisco's tour, which sees them hit the US and Mexico before heading to Europe. Gardner said he's devastated to be missing the band's first festival in Mexico, but will rejoin San Cisco in Europe 'when I'm not completely knocked out by painkillers'. 'However I know the band will do me proud and there will still be the same show, just without my embarrassing dancing!,' he added. This news comes ahead of the release of the band's latest album, Gracetown this Friday March 6.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW .

"A Good Samaritan who shoveled his neighborhood's sidewalks was left stunned after an irate neighbor dumped the snow back on the walkway before grabbing him and telling him to keep away. Will Immke, 23, had cleared the snow from a disabled neighbor's driveway and sidewalk in Eastlake, Ohio on Sunday so that she could move around safely. But the good deed didn't impress 69-year-old Larry Myers, who lives next door to the woman. He grabbed his snowblower and started blowing snow back towards Immke as he cleared it up. When Immke told the man he was clearing the sidewalk for the neighbor and so that children could reach their school buses, Myers told him the kids could walk in the street, WKYC reported. Scroll down for video . Spat: Larry Myers, left, can be seen blowing snow onto a sidewalk as Will Immke, right, clears it for a disabled neighbor in Eastlake, Ohio on Sunday. Myers later grabbed Immke and now faces an assault charge . 'And I said ""Are you stupid?""' Immke told the channel. 'And that's when he grabbed me by my throat and my face and shoved me back.' Myers didn't deny grabbing the man but said he only held on to the front of his shirt. 'I grabbed him... and I said ""Leave my sidewalk alone"",' he said. 'I specifically told him I don't need you to shovel my section of the sidewalk,' he added to WOIO. After Immke went back into his home across the street, Myers covered the sidewalk with the snow that had just been removed. It means that Myers has been left with a massive frozen wall of snow on his section of the sidewalk. 'When everybody else around here cleans their sidewalks, I will clean mine,' he said defiantly. Myers complained to Eastlake Police, but they say they are now investigating him for a misdemeanor charge of assault. Immke, pictured, said he told Myers he was clearing the sidewalk for children, and Myers said they could walk in the road instead. When Immke asked him if he was stupid, Myers grabbed him as pictured right . No denial: Myers, pictured, admitted that he had grabbed Immke and told him to stay away from his sidewalk . 'Not very neighborly,' they wrote on their Facebook page as they announced the pending charge. They also shared a photograph taken by a neighbor across the street showing Immke clearing the snow while Myers' snowblower forced snow back on to the path. 'As the complainant continued the snow removal, the suspect returned with a snow blower intentionally blowing snow on the victim shouting for him to leave the area,' the police wrote. The neighbors told WOIO that it's not their first run in. 'This was over snow,' Immke said. 'In the fall it's over the leaves. It's just constant.'","Will Immke, 23, cleared snow from the sidewalk in Eastlake, Ohio for a disabled neighbor and so that children could reach the school buses .

"Transatlantic flights are bad enough, imagine the horror of having to spend 10 hours cooped up in an enclosed space with a spoiled brat on a drug-fueled meltdown. That's what British-born life coach Patricia Mitchell went through when she flew from London to LA last summer on board the same flight as hotel heir Conrad Hughes Hilton III, younger brother of the famous Paris. Hilton was arrested for his disturbing behavior on board the British Airways flight on July 31, in which he smoked marijuana in a lavatory, threw punches and threatened to 'f****** kill' multiple crew members. On Tuesday, as Hilton celebrated his 21st birthday, GQ published Mitchell's account of the transatlantic flight from hell which ended in Hilton being escorted off the plane in cuffs (though his lawyers have since saved him from any serious punishment). Embarrassing: Hotel heir Conrad Hughes Hilton III turned 21 on Tuesday, but he'll be spending his birthday week in court - pleading guilty to assault for the disturbance he caused on board a British Airways flight this past summer . Famous siblings: BA passenger Patricia Mitchell gave a blow-by-blow account of Conrad's tantrum in a recent story. Conrad pictured above with his very-famous older sister Paris in 2009 . According to an affidavit written by an FBI agent who investigated the incident, Hilton first started to cause a disturbance when he refused to turn off his phone before take off. In a suit: Hilton spotted leaving a federal courthouse in Los Angeles on February 3, 2015 after turning himself in for a public meltdown on the flight. His arraignment is scheduled for Thursday . Just a few minutes later, when the fasten seatbelt sign was still illuminated, Hilton got up from his seat on the second deck business class and went downstairs to wander the plane. Mitchell was seated on the lower deck where Hilton appeared and noted: 'It was during that bit when the stewards are up but nobody else should be. My ears were popping, and I was waiting for the drinks trolley, when suddenly, he's coming down the aisle. I thought, ""Whoa, that's not normal."" 'He was dressed posh casual, expensive haircut. He looked like a polo player and walked with a sure-footed march, being loud... I heard a lot of ""f****."" After crew asked him to return to his seat and he refused, Hilton 'threatens to hit someone seated four rows behind him.' Mitchell added, 'I thought he was in the middle of a psychotic episode.' For the next few hours Hilton paces around, swearing and threatening the crew and Mitchell wonders if the plane will be turned around. At one point, Hilton approached a member of the crew to complain about a passenger who was giving him the 'stink eye' when Mitchell considered taking out her phone to record the meltdown. But just one look from Hilton froze her in place. 'He looked at me, really threatening. I don't often watch horror movies, but you know how the walking dead have a look in their eye? I thought, ""He's going to come at me next."" He turned around and said, ""Now everybody's judging me.""' The flight attendants then closed the curtains. 'As Hilton wanders around the plane, he lashes out at the customer service manager who is shadowing him to protect the passengers and his 21-member crew,' she added. '""Stop following me!"" Hilton yelled, adding: ""I am going to f*** kill you!""' Mitchell remembered. He is also said to have screamed, 'I will f****ing own you!' After going back to business class, Mitchell said he 'punched the bulkhead 10 centimeters away from the attendant's head.' Numerous times, Hilton yelled, 'I will f***ing own anyone on this flight; they are f***ing peasants!' according to the complaint. Hilton then reportedly tells other random passengers that  he is already banned by other airlines, has just broken up with a girlfriend, and that his behavior will 'probably turn into a lawsuit for his father to pay.' He then says he wants to smoke marijuana. At 9:15 p.m. 'he locks himself in a lower deck restroom.' 'A smell of weed is detected in the cabin,' according to a report. He then leaves the cabin and goes to the upper deck where he allegedly smokes a cigarette. 'Upon exiting, he surrenders his lighter and cigarettes, returns to his seat and falls asleep,' Wallace reported. An hour later Hilton wakes up and 'approaches yet another flight attendant and says he's ""going to f***ing kill"" him three times,' it was added. British-born life coach Patricia Mitchell (pictured) reveals details of the flight from hell and describes the temper tantrum thrown by Patrick Hilton after he strolled out of business class and started berating passengers on the lower flight deck, calling them 'f****** peasants' All together: Conrad is pictured with the rest of the Hilton clan at a Christmas Eve dinner. From left: Siblings Paris, Conrad, Barron and Nicky Hilton and their parents Richard and Kathy Hilton . What a parent will do: According to an affidavit of the incident, Conrad claimed at one point to have been banned from other airlines and that the last time this happened his dad paid $300,000. Conrad pictured above with his father Richard in a photo posted to Instagram three weeks ago . 'He grabs the man's shirt and name badge saying, ""I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss!"" He says, ""My father will pay this out, he has done it before. Dad paid $300,000 last time,""' it was detailed in the complaint. He then offered to fight the co-pilot. After several more outbursts, the co-pilot 'comes out from the flight deck to present Hilton with a final written warning. Hilton rips it up.' At 2:20 a.m. London time, 'a second safety briefing is held to discuss restraining Hilton, who is again asleep,' reported Wallace. Hilton is then handcuffed while asleep. When he awakes he starts screaming. 'A buzz went around the plane that he had been restrained and we were all, ""Fantastic. Good. Happy about that,""' added Mitchell. At about 3:15 a.m. London time [8:15 p.m. Los Angeles time], Flight 269 lands. Police come aboard and escort the handcuffed Hilton to the terminal, it was detailed in the affidavit. 'I remember coming off and seeing him sitting on a bench with what I assume was some kind of federal agent. You would have thought butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, he was so cool. He looked all innocent, like, ""I don't know what the fuss is all about,""' said Mitchell. Her two brothers: Paris - now 34-years-old - pictured with both Conrad and Barron on the beach in 2014 . His other famous sister: Conrad with Nicky, 31, a fashion writer and fiancee of James Rothschild . Hilton's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, told TMZ.com that Hilton took a sleeping pill before the flight, which may have caused his behavior. Shapiro also said Hilton voluntarily checked himself into a 30-day rehab program after the flight. On February 2, Hilton was charged with intimidating or assaulting the flight crew to the point where he interfered with their ability to perform their duties - a crime which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. He was released on $100,000 bail and just last week his lawyers struck a plea deal, in which he will plead guilty to one count of simple assault which has a maximum sentence of six months in jail, a year of probation and fine of $5,000. He will hear his sentence on Thursday. No one had heard of Hilton's in-flight meltdown until February when a federal criminal complaint was filed. Hilton was travelling aboard an AIRBUS A380 and was sat  on the top deck before he wandered down stairs and started abusing other passengers .","Conrad Hughes Hilton III was arrested after causing a disturbance on board a British Airways flight from London to LA last July .

"A U.S. court of appeals in . Washington, D.C. has decided to hear oral arguments on May 4 . in a lawsuit that challenges President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration. A lower-court federal judge threw out the case in December, brought by Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. His lawyer, conservative firebrand Larry Klayman, told reporters outside the courtroom after he pleaded his case that 'we have serious issues of constitutionality involved.' Arpaio claims the White House's plan to mainstream more than 5 million illegal immigrants is clearly unconstitutional. Lawsuit: Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio has a date with a federal appeals court, which will re-hear his legal challenge against President Barack Obama's controversial immigration executive actions . Larry Klayman of the conservative nonprofit Freedom Watch represents Arpaio's sheriff's office, and wants an injunction to stop Obama from granting legal status to millions of illegal immigrants . Obama plans to give them Social Security numbers, residency cards and work permits, even though they snuck into the United States illegally. The lawsuit argues that the policy changes, made without approval from the Republican-dominated Congress, amount to an amnesty and will encourage more people to cross the border. Last month a Texas judge ordered the Obama administration to halt its implementation of the plan, saying it would be impossible to roll back the action if a higher court ruled that it violates the U.S. Constitution. Last week, the Department of Justice requested an emergency stay to put that decision on hold so the Homeland Security Department could move ahead. Arpaio, a colorful and polarizing figure, is known for his 'tent city' jail where inmates brave the elements are are forced to wear pink underwear and clothing. Some of his deputies also use pink handcuffs while on duty in the jails. He has employed 'chain gangs' to force inmates to work outside his facilities. And he once put inmates on a bread and water diet for desecrating an American flag. Arpaio also famously claimed in 2012 that President Obama's birth certificate was 'fraudulent.' The administration has been busily fending off a handful of legal actions . designed to stop it from guaranteeing that millions of illegal immigrants could live in the U.S. with a guarantee that they won't be deported. Arpaio's suit is the first to reach the level of a federal appeals court, the final step before a possible Supreme Court review. Beryl Howell, the U.S. District Court judge who tossed his legal action late last year, was nominated to the federal bench by Obama in 2010. She ruled that the sheriff lacked legal standing to challenge Obama's immigration program, and it should be tackled in Congress. But Klayman, the attorney, had argued that the president's plan would burden U.S. law enforcement as more illegal immigrants enter the country and commit crimes. 'It's not policy,' Klayman said in December. 'He's creating law and he cannot do that under the U.S. Constitution.' Inspired by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, other law enforcement agencies are now forcing inmates to wear pink; these jailed men are in Grovetown, Georgia . This week Republicans in the House and Senate failed in a bid to tie Homeland Security funding to an order prohibiting the government from spending any money implementing Obama's immigration vision. Arpaio has suffered stinging political defeats in his attempts to slow the flow of illegal immigrants into his Arizona county. Maricopa County has already disbanded its squad of deputies that has raided businesses, arresting more than 700 immigrants who were charged with using fake or stolen IDs to get jobs. On December 17 Arpaio threw in the towel on the effort, which won him popularity among voters but was gradually dismantled by the Obama administration and the courts.","Court of appeals in Washington, DC will hear the case in May, the last stop on a journey that may end in the Supreme Court .

"Two brothers kidnapped a 16-year-old runaway and sold her for sex to as many as two dozen men every day, prosecutors in Miami said. Bogacski Thomas and Tavarus Ballard, both 24, allegedly held the girl for two weeks, continually dosing her with drugs while they pimped her out to make money for hotel rooms, food and drugs. They are said to have plied her with cocaine and MDMA, and threatened to hurt her family if she tried to escape. When she did try to flee, they beat her, court papers said. Charged: Bogacski Thomas, left, and Tavarus Ballard, right, both 24, allegedly held a teenage girl for two weeks, dosing her MDMA while pimping her out to make money for hotel rooms, food and drugs . Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said it was one of the worst cases she's seen. 'She to them was nothing more than a walking machine. No dignity, not a young girl. A cash machine,' CBS Miami quoted her as saying. 'She was forced to engage in sex, up to 24 men, up to 24 men per night,' Ms Fernandez Rundle said. 'That is a man every 30 minutes from 6am to 6pm at night. Only to repeat itself the next day and the next day.' The local television station reported that Thomas faced so many charges he appeared unable to keep up as a judge read them aloud in bond court yesterday. He and Ballard are accused of preying on the girl after she ran away from home, forcing her into prostitution for two weeks in January until she was able to escape. To keep her subdued the pair allegedly provided her with cannabis, as well as spiking her food with 'Mollies' - a slang term for MDMA tablets - and lacing her cigarettes with cocaine. They are said to have forced her to walk the streets of South Miami-Dade looking for Johns who paid just $100 dollars for full sex or $50 for a lesser sex act. Thomas and Ballard also allegedly touted for customers as well, even visiting gas station bathrooms in their search for men who would pay to have sex with the underage girl. 'Thomas told the victim that if she tried to leave they knew where her family lived and they would shoot up her house and hurt or kill her family,' the warrant affidavit said. Nevertheless, the victim made a number of attempts to flee that resulted in her suffering punishment beatings at the hands of both men, investigators said. 'Every time she tried to escape they would beat her up, grab her back,' Ms Fernandez Rundle said. 'In one case they picked her broken body up and took her back up into the motel.' Streetwalking: The intersection of Campbell Drive and Krome Avenue, one of the areas that Thomas and Ballard forced the young girl to walk the streets looking for customers who paid $100 for sex . The girl was finally able to escape when she finished with a customer and realised Thomas was still in the bathroom of the hotel room where she was being kept, according to the warrant affidavit. She is said to have fled on foot and took a bus to another part of town, but was soon spotted by Thomas and Ballard as she walked down a street. Chased by both men, she ran into an abandoned house where they again subjected her to a vicious beating before themselves fleeing, according to the affidavit. Thomas and Ballard are facing a string of charges including human trafficking, lewd or lascivious battery on a child between 12 and 16 and deriving support from the proceeds of prostitution. Both men are being held at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, county records show. If they are found guilty they face life in jail.","Bogacski Thomas and Tavarus Ballard are facing life in prison if convicted .

"The mother of an infant found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child. Samantha Green, 23, of Woodland made her first court appearance Wednesday. Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig announced the charges against Green who was arrested Saturday in the death of her 20-day-old son Justice Rees. Samantha Green (above in court), whose 20-day-old son was found dead near the Sacramento River in Northern California, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and abusing or endangering the health of a child . The charges also include an enhancement for inflicting great bodily injury on a child under age five during the commission of a felony. The boy's body was found with no obvious signs of trauma last week in a swampy area. Sheriff's investigators said he may have died from drowning or hypothermia near the rural town of Knights Landing, about 30 miles west of Sacramento. Green, who had been reported missing with her son on Monday, was found a day earlier looking disheveled and bruised. She told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted, but police have said they do not believe her story. Despite the charges, Green's family said they are standing by her. Police found the body of 20-day-old Justice Rees (right) in swampy land near the Sacramento River after he and Green (left) were reported missing . Green, pictured above at court, told authorities that she and the boy had been abducted. Police have said they do not believe her story . 'Our family is grieving not only for the loss of our grandson Justice, but also the possible loss of our daughter Sami Green,' Green's parents, Randy and Laurie, said in a statement released on Sunday morning and shared by CBS. 'She has never been in trouble with the law. We know in our heart that Sami would never do anything to intentionally harm her newborn son Justice. She loved him very much. 'Her entire family supports her through this most unbelievable time in our lives.' Green was reported missing last Monday after she failed to visit her father, Randy, on Saturday February 21, as planned. Her partner Frank Rees posted on Facebook on Tuesday begging Green to come home with their son. 'If anyone sees my beautiful fiancé [sic] please tell her that EVERYONE is worried sick about her and Justice,' he wrote. 'We love you Samantha. Just come home babe. I miss you and our son sooooo much. Whatever it is you want different we can fix. I love you momma.' Her partner Frank Rees (right), who is also Justice's father, is supporting Green (left; right with Rees) Crews looked through the Ridge Cut Slough for hours before finding Justice's body, which Green said was in the water . Later that day, she called police to say she had been abducted with her son and that the boy was missing. Passerby Ricardo Villaseñor then came upon Green, wet and shouting for help near the Ridge Cut slough, News 10 reported. Villaseñor said although Green seemed disoriented, she explained to him she and the baby had been abducted in town, but that she had no idea how she'd wound up next to the river. 'She was badly bruised,' he said. 'She had no shoes. She was kind of left for dead, it seemed like.' She told him she knew her baby had frozen to death, and though she said she didn't know exactly where he was, she said he was somewhere in the slough. Green was admitted to Woodland Hospital and was later released. She was then arrested and charged with murder. After her arrest, Yolo County Sheriff Ed Prieto said: 'We have come to the conclusion that Mrs. Green was the sole individual responsible for the death of her child.'","Samantha Green, 23, of Woodland made her first court appearance today .

"CCTV footage of a 'brutal' arrest that shows one officer repeatedly kneeing a man in the back and punching his upper body has been uploaded to social media and viewed almost 30,000 times. The footage, from 2013, captures the dramatic arrest of the couple after a night out in Stockton-on-Tees. The incident allegedly left music fan Darran Dunford unconscious and urinating blood for a week while his former partner, Leigh Leach, was left traumatised by her rough treatment at the hands of officers. Scroll down for video . Darran Dunford, pictured, has successfully campaigned to have three police officers investigated over his 'brutal' arrest where one repeatedly kneed him in the back and punched his body in August 2013 . Mr Dunford, was held down by police officers and was knocked unconscious in the course of the arrest . He said he was urinating blood for a week following the incident in Stockton-on-Tees in August 2013 . Three officers at the centre of an investigation into the arrest should face a misconduct hearing, an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has now revealed. While Cleveland Police insisted its officers acted in accordance with protocol during the arrest, the couple involved have now had their complaints upheld by the IPCC. The report says there is a case for disciplinary proceedings against the three officers involved and recommends they face a misconduct hearing over the arrest. It comes despite an initial investigation by the IPCC and North Yorkshire Police which found Cleveland Police had no case to answer over the incident in August, 2013 - a decision Mr Dunford appealed. The incident, captured on CCTV, shows one officer attending to the injured policeman while other officers restrain Mr Dunford and one repeatedly knees him in the back . The 45-year-old contractor from Thornaby said: 'I tried to shrug it off but it really affects me - if I see a police van I think something's going to happen and Leigh was a nervous wreck afterwards. 'It's destroyed my life as it was and the whole violent affair has changed me hugely.' He said the incident had placed a great strain on his relationship with Ms Leach and that the couple have since split. One of the officers admitted punched Mr Dunford in the face and kneeing him nine times during the incident . Mr Dunford called for the officers responsible to be removed from the force, adding: 'The police are not judges or punishers, that's what the courts do and the police can't go around acting like this.' Cleveland Police have already responded to the latest report - which will now be considered by the IPCC before a final decision is made. The couple had been making their way home from a folk festival in Stockton when Mr Dunford was stopped by officers on Stockton High Street responding to reports of a man being drunk and disorderly in a nearby pub. He was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car. However, Cleveland Police said Mr Dunford headbutted the officers, sparking an arrest which Ms Leach went on to describe as 'brutal' and 'thuggish'. The footage shows several officers pinning Mr Dunford to the road before Pc Darren Keeley presses his head to the ground - a manoeuvre he says which left him unconscious. Dunford was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car . Pc Michael Wilson is captured repeatedly kneeing him in the back before delivering a series of blows to his upper body. In a police statement seen by reporters PC Wilson also admitted to punching Mr Dunford in the face. He said: '...to distract him from his attempts to bite and resist I have punched Dunford with my right fist clenched, in the left side of his face. 'I used nine knee strikes during the struggle, which lasted a considerable amount of time.' When the matter was first reported in December 2013, Cleveland Police said the tactics were approved and necessary as Mr Dunford was resisting arrest. However, the IPCC report said: 'From the CCTV footage it does appear that Mr Dunford is at stages non-compliant with the police. 'However, it appears that Pc Wilson continues to deliver knee strikes to Mr Dunford's back even when he has stopped resisting and is laying still. 'Also, Pc Keeley states that he delivered punches to Mr Dunford to stop him from scratching him, however, PC Keeley appears to have moved his leg out of the reach of Mr Dunford when he delivers the strikes. 'In my view, a disciplinary tribunal could take the view that Pc Wilson and Pc Keeley both have used excessive force and have a case to answer for gross misconduct.' The report also recommends a misconduct hearing for a third officer, Pc Gareth Humphrey, in relation to the arrest of Leigh Leach. Footage shows her being approached by Pc Humphrey before being forcibly taken to the ground and arrested for being drunk and disorderly. In an earlier interview, Ms Leach said: 'The level of aggression was awful. When they arrested me, my dress was pulled up showing my underwear. I asked them to pull it down but even the WPC refused to touch me. 'It was humiliating and degrading, I'm a size 8, 45-year-old mother and was no threat.' Pc Humphrey initially said Ms Leach was abusive but, following a court hearing, charges against her were dropped when the Crown Prosecution Service found the CCTV footage contradicted the Pc's evidence. Dunford pleaded guilty to assaulting a male officer, assaulting a female officer, and possession of cannabis following the incident involving the CCTV. A spokeswoman for Cleveland Police said: 'No determination has been made yet and the matter is currently still with the IPCC Commissioner. 'Only when this is complete will we consider what - if any - action needs to be taken by the force.'","Darran Dunford claimed he was urinating blood for a week after his arrest .

"Microsoft's co-founder has used his own submarine to find the wreck of the Japanese Navy's biggest warship - which has lain undiscovered at the bottom of the ocean for the past 70 years. Paul Allen revealed his amazing discovery to the world on Tuesday, by posting a photo to Twitter of the World War II battleship Musashi's rusty bow, which bore the Japanese empire's Chrysanthemum seal. The Musashi - which, along with its sister ship Yamato, was the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleship ever constructed - was sunk by the U.S. Navy in 1944, taking with it more than 1,000 crew members. But despite numerous eyewitness accounts, its exact location had remained a mystery - until now. Scroll down for video . Final resting place: The ship has lain undisturbed at the bottom of the Sibuyan Sea since 1944. Pictured: A wheel on a valve which would have been in one of the engine rooms . Explorer: Allen was able to find the ship using he M/Y Octopus. Pictured: One of the ship's 15 tonne anchors . Biggest: The Musashi was the Japanese Navy's biggest battleship during the Second World War . The discovery brings to an end Allen's eight year search for the Musashi - and is a discovery he hopes will 'bring closure' to those who lost relatives aboard the ship, according to his website. Billionaire Allen said the M/Y Octopus, his luxury yacht and exploration ship, found the long-lost ship on the floor of the Sibuyan Sea - 1.6 miles under the surface. The Octopus' remote operated probe Octo ROV located the Musashi on Monday, according to Allen's website. The Octopus is also outfitted with an exploration submarine. Allen and his research team had used the historical records of four different countries in order to pinpoint the location of the ship. On Tuesday,  Allen posted a photo of a valve from the wreckage, which he described as the 'first confirmation' that it was of Japanese origin. 'RIP (rest in peace) crew of Musashi, approximately 1,023 (lives) lost,' Allen said in another tweet. He said on Twitter he would soon post video of the ship's catapult and valve areas. Found: Paul Allen took to Twitter to reveal he had found the wreck of the Musashi, sunk in 1944 . War: American warplanes sank the Musashi on October 24, 1944, at the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf . Record breaking: The Musashi was the largest armed battleship to ever be made. Pictured: A 'float plane' Submerged: Allen and his team believe this to be an inverted type 89, 12.7 centimeter gun turret . Under fire: It was considered the largest naval encounter of World War II. Pictured: The Musashi being attack . Battle: The Musashi was sunk on the second day of fighting between the two sides . The Sibuyan Sea - at the heart of the Philippines' central Visayas islands - now covers busy shipping lanes and lies on the path of most tropical storms that cross the country from the Pacific Ocean. But in 1944, it was the scene for a battle considered the largest naval encounter of the Second World War - a battle which would be the Musashi's last. The battleship, which weighed 73,000 tons fully loaded, and was armed with nine 45 Caliber Type 94 main guns, was sunk by American warplanes on October 24, 1944, at the height of the Battle of Leyte Gulf - in which US and Australian forces defeated the Japanese. About half the crew died when it went down. Sister ship the Yamato was damaged in the fighting, according to the U.S. Navy, and American warships finally sank it a year later as it attempted to reach Okinawa. Discoveries: The American billionaire (pictured) has also pursued space exploration . For Seattle-born Allen, 62, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, the discovery of the Musashi is a thrilling moment. 'Since my youth, I have been fascinated with World War II history, inspired by my father’s service in the U.S. Army,'  Allen said. 'The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel and, as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction. 'I am honored to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honoring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her.' Allen, the 51st richest person in the world with a net worth of $17.5billion, according to Forbes Magazine, is known for his love of history - and also his generosity with the Octopus to help other exploration missions. In 2012, Allen loaned the same ship that located the Musashi to the British government to locate HMS Hood bell from the bottom of the Denmark Strait. The search was eventually called off due to bad weather. The Octopus has also collaborated on Google Earth’s 'Explore the Ocean' feature, and has helped the Discovery Science Channel capture footage for a documentary to study the effects of nuclear detonation on the marine environment. Director James Cameron has also used it, for a seven-hour solo journey to the earth's deepest point back in 2012. But Allen is not confined to undersea exploration, either.

Glamour: The Octopus also hosted parties in Cannes. Allen pictured here with George Lucas in 2005 . The American is also working on a project called Stratolaunch, which aims to put 'cost-effective' cargo and manned missions into space. He launched SpaceShipOne, the first privately built craft into suborbital space in 2004. Spokespersons for the Philippines' navy and coast guard told AFP they were not informed of the discovery. For four days in October 1944, the seas around the island of Leyte bore witness to what some believe is the biggest battle in naval history. The Battle of Leyte Gulf, formerly known as the Second Battle of the Philippine Sea, began on October 23, pitting the combined force of the U.S. and Australian forces against the Imperial Japanese Navy. Three days earlier, the Americans had launched an attack on Leyte; the Japanese responded with Sho-Go - an operation designed to lure U.S. forces away from the San Bernardino Strait. But the Japanese navy was attacked by U.S. submarines as it moved into position on October 23 - the first of four major encounters over the battle. The Musashi survived this first encounter, but the next day, as it passed through the Sibuyan Sea, came under bombardment from the U.S. warplanes. It was first hit at 10.30am, and then again in a second wave. However, the ship did not finally disappear under the waves until 7.30pm that evening. It had been struck by at least 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes during the battle. By October 26 - the end of the battle - the Japanese lost 26 battleships, but only sank six of the U.S.'s ships. The Japanese had also suffered huge numbers of casualties: more than 10,000 men are believed to have died. The Allied Forces, on the other hand, lost around 1,500. The Battle of Leyte Gulf was the largest loss the Japanese Navy had ever encountered .

"For just under $200 mothers can now get 3-D 'keepsake ultrasounds' of their unborn children but the FDA warns that they should avoid the potentially harmful scans. A Consumer Update revised by the FDA on Tuesday said that the tests should be used for medical reasons only and only be performed by licensed staff. Ultrasounds are used to help doctors determine the health, size, and age of the child and can detect birth defects. Scroll down for video . New trend: While 3-D images of a mother's unborn child may bring her delight it may also harm the baby . While there is no proof that ultrasounds are harmful to the baby, it heats the baby's tissues slightly and can also cause small bubbles in tissue. 'Although there is a lack of evidence of any harm due to ultrasound imaging and heartbeat monitors, prudent use of these devices by trained health care providers is important,' says Shahram Vaezy, Ph.D., an FDA biomedical engineer in the update. 'Ultrasound can heat tissues slightly, and in some cases, it can also produce very small bubbles (cavitation) in some tissues,' she adds. Doctors don't yet know the long term effects of these scans on the child and fear that non-medical imaging centers aimed at giving mothers photos and videos for sentimental reasons do not take the baby's health into consideration. The FDA says that at such places the fetus could be exposed to up to an hour of ultrasound technology which is longer than most doctors spend. Mothers are seeking out the unnecessary medical to get renderings of their child so they can share them on social media or feel an emotional connection to their child. CBS spoke with Donquesha Williams, 26, who had an ultrasound done at Meet Your Baby in the Lakewood Center Mall in Southern California. 'These are going to go in my photo album. I get to actually see him... so I'm excited and everything,' Williams said. 'We use the same machine as the doctor,' owner Michael Horan said. 'Our techs spend a little more time to get a more enjoyable session out of it.' Popular imaging: Evelyn Orozco (pictured) who owns 3-D Imaging Services in New York City said that 3-D ultrasounds are one of her biggest sellers but says she is not a doctor and cannot give medical advice . Mother Felicia said that while she enjoyed seeing a 2-D image of her child during a medical ultrasound, she was overcome with emotion when she saw the 3-D image. 'I felt emotionally connected in the 2-D, but I almost cried here,' she said. Evelyn Orozco who owns 3-D Imaging Services in New York City said that 3-D ultrasounds are one of her biggest sellers. 'All of a sudden, it's not a black and white: you see the features, you see a baby's face and the biggest thing here is the nose,' Orozco said. 'Everybody talks about the nose. ""Whose nose is that? Is it daddy's nose? Is it mommy's nose?""' Orozco says that she requires all the expectant mothers who come to her to be under the care of an OBGYN. 'Again, I'm not a doctor. The biggest thing I tell everybody is just make sure you drink plenty of water‘, she said. She says that while patients ask her advice on images sometimes she is sure not to overstep her boundaries. The state of Connecticut has already banned prenatal ultrasounds for non-medical use.","A Consumer Update revised by the FDA on Tuesday said that ultrasounds should be performed for medical reasons only and by licensed staff .

"Former Scotland football captain Colin Hendry, pictured arriving at Blackpool Magistrates, has admitted drink driving . Ex-Scotland football captain Colin Hendry is preparing to fight a ban from the roads after blaming his drink driving on a 'rare' metabolism. The 49-year old former Rangers and Blackburn Rovers defender was arrested last month after police stopped him near his home in Lytham, Lancashire in the early hours of February 21. Officers had claimed Hendry who was nicknamed 'Braveheart' when he captain of Scotland was almost twice the limit after failing a breathalyser test. But today, widowed father of four Hendry disputed the reading and asked Blackpool Magistrates to have the case adjourned so his metabolism could be tested. The court heard that Hendry admitted drinking before driving his blue Ford Focus, but argued the amount of alcohol he drank over a certain period of time should not have put him over the limit. His lawyer Glyn Lewis - who has previously represented a string of celebrities over his expertise in exploiting motoring legal loopholes - said: 'Usually we go to sentence and it is inevitable he would have to be disqualified because he has entered a guilty plea because he accepts the facts. 'But the instructions I have over the amount of alcohol consumed and the time period, when you do the calculations they don't correlate with the figure he has given. 'There are two possibilities - one is because of the fact that he has got some alcohol in his system he is unaware of and the other is quite rare is we have somebody whose metabolism is such they provide a specimen of breath which does not correlate with the reading of blood. 'We have had a forensic scientist give us an indication that the figures provided by the defendant don't correlate with the figures given by the sample. 'We accept the prosecution's case - the police followed him, he wasn't driving erratically, nothing unusual about that, he accepts that - the question is why is this alcohol reading being given that is being investigated. 'We can establish what he consumed and when it was because there are receipts. 'Mr Hendry might have to be tested for his metabolism in the lab with a reconstruction of the whole evening's events. The ratio between breath and blood is not the same for everyone. 'If our investigations don't have foundation in science we would bring it back to court and have it dealt with. Mr Hendry wants the matter to be dealt with as quickly as possible.' He was stopped by police and arrested near his home in Lytham, Lancashire in the early hours of February 21, and was found to be driving his blue Ford Focus while almost double the legal alcohol limit (stock picture) The court agreed to adjourn for a 'special reasons' hearing  in which Hendry will call evidence from a forensic service scientist and two civilian witnesses who were with him on the night of the incident. Hendry - who arrived for the hearing in sunglasses and a grey suit - had 63 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath- the legal limit is 35mg. Initial forensic tests conducted on behalf of Hendry had shown the figures did not correlate and further investigation was needed, said Mr Lewis. The solicitor added that the later sentencing bench could have the option not to disqualify Hendry from driving but the conviction would stand regardless. Hendry, was granted unconditional bail until April 22 when the case will be heard in full before sentencing. The 49-year old former Rangers and Blackburn Rovers defender has blamed his 'quite rare' metabolism for being over the limit . The ex-Premier League footballer had a long playing career, captaining his country in the 1998 World Cup and appearing for a series of clubs including Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Bolton Wanderers and Glasgow Rangers. Last week police confirmed he had been given a warning amid claims he had pestering former girlfriend Sarah Kinder a beautician he had been dating after the death of his wife Denise in 2009 following botched cosmetic surgery. Miss Kinder, 40, claimed he looked in her window and sent her unwanted texts and social media messages after their four-year relationship ended late last year. It was also claimed the former footballer repeatedly drove past her home. The warning does not count as a criminal record but runs for 12 months to deter an individual from future conduct causing distress. TV pundit Hendry had previously built up debts of £2.2million which led to him being made temporarily bankrupt  by a betting firm in 2010 and losing his mansion home.","Colin Hendry was arrested for drink driving near his Lancashire home .

"They bemoaned the lack of privacy they received during the early part of their first date, but it seems Sarah Milne and William Chalmers did eventually get some alone time. Scottish backpacker Sarah's efforts to woo Mr Chalmers after she spotted him at a beach in Picton - north of Christchurch - went viral after she painted a poster of him and left a note requesting he meet up with her. The poster was a huge hit on the internet and received attention from all over the world, with Mr Chalmers eventually stumbling across it and deciding to do the decent thing and agree to meet up. The pair had such a good night that Miss Milne agreed to stay with Mr Chalmers for an 'amazing' sleepover and cooked him breakfast in the morning. She's even decided to stay with him for the rest of the week. Scroll down for video . As far as first dates go, Sarah Milne (right) cooking breakfast for William Chalmers (left) the next morning would be categorised as pretty damn successful. 'I told her, ""If you want to stay here for a week you can"", and she said ""yes"",' he told stuff.co.nz. after Ms Milne had cooked him eggs on toast . 'She's full of life ... there was no awkwardness at all.' He was impressed to discover Ms Milne was an artist and cartoonist and looked forward to getting to know her over the next week. 'People are asking if we're getting married. I don't think people realise yesterday was the first time we talked,' he said. The Glaswegian artist was relaxing at the beach in Picton - north of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island - when she spotted her mystery man 'shirtless, wearing black shorts with stars tattooed on his torso and running with a curly, bouncy and blonde dog'. She decided she had to see him again, and despite not knowing anything about him apart from how he looked, decided to create a poster which she hung next to the beach in the hope he would see it. The restaurant staff said there had a 'close connection' and were 'cuddly' by the end of the night . Ms Milne (left) and Mr Chalmers (right) are planning on spending the week getting to know each other . Nursing hangovers after a night of 'cheap beers', Mr Chalmers said they are so comfortable with each other that people think they have been together for an eternity not just a day. He works at a local burger joint and the pair met for the first time on Tuesday in front of a small audience who had gathered at beach to witness the meeting. The couple spent the afternoon drinking wine and chatting on a boat on the Picton harbour before going to dinner at DA's Barn Restaurant & Bar where staff said sparks were flying from early on. The bar's co-owner Gina Williams said the couple were 'all cuddly' by the end of the evening when they were in the garden bar. She said staff were discussing which famous actors would play them in the movie of their romantic tale. Other staff members said there was 'magic' and a 'close connection' between the giddy pair. Love at first sight? Sarah Milne, a backpacker from Scotland, meets William Chalmers, after her note brought them together . They were still on the date when they spoke to Daily Mail Australia later that night. Mr Chalmers said the date was going 'fantastically'. 'We had a bottle of sauv blanc and sparkling pinot gris. We had a great night. Now we're grabbing a box of cheap beers... and we're going to have a party,' he said. When asked if there will be a second date, Mr Chalmers joked to Daily Mail Australia: 'I'm not too sure. You might have to ask me tomorrow just in case I've made an ass of myself.' He added that his and Ms Milne's story proved the world was not such a bad place. They finally meet: Mr Chalmers met Ms Milne just after 2pm and asked if she wanted to go somewhere quiet and have a drink . 'There's a lot of s**t in the world but there's a lot of love in the world,' he said. At 10pm local time, the couple sounded like they were still having a good time as Mr Chalmers passed his phone over to Milne who described the whole experience as 'surreal'. 'I had no idea it would go the way it has gone,' she told Daily Mail Australia. '[The date has] been going alright, we've had a few glasses of wine. 'It was overshadowed by every other person in Picton and... [this] very sweet thing it could have been has become this huge public thing. 'It was very embarrassing. I'm not someone who is used to the spotlight. Thankfully he took me away from [the attention at the meeting point].' Milne also played coy when asked if the couple would be seeing each other again. 'We haven't even finished this one because of everyone's attention but maybe,' she said. 'We need to get over this one first. We're really struggling to find our own space.' Milne and Mr Chalmers made headlines when a hand-painted note made by the artist started doing rounds on the internet. In her note, titled 'Is this you?', Milne  - who studied at Glasgow School of Arts before holidaying in New Zealand - invited Mr Chalmers to meet her on the same beach  on Tuesday. She said she had not been expecting the hype surrounding her handwritten note. Love note: The handmade message Milne used to launch a public appeal to find a  man after a brief encounter on Friday . With a bottle of champagne in his hand for their first meeting, Mr Chalmers walked over to where Milne was sitting and said: 'Hello, I'm William, you know you could have just asked for my number. 'Let's go somewhere and have a drink away from everyone,' he told her, as the crowd watching their date clapped and cheered. Mr Chalmers came forward on Sunday morning to reveal himself as the mystery man. On Monday, he told Daily Mail Australia he planned on heading down to the picturesque spot to ask his brunette admirer on a date for the evening. The New Zealander said he first heard of the poster when his housemate came home at 3am on Saturday night and woke him up. 'He was carrying on and telling me about a poster that two German girls had told him about that described me,' Mr Chalmers said. 'He knew it was me because I'm the only guy in Picton who has star tattoos, Johnny-Bravo hair and a labradoodle.' Mr Chalmers said he and his housemate drove down to the shore in the dark to try and find the note, and even when he saw it for himself, he had a hard time believing it was real. Ms Milne was greeted at the picturesque meeting spot with great fanfare after their story had generated huge publicity . The Glasgow artist was greeted as she stepped off her ferry to a sign that said 'Here's to a happy ending'. The poster in question was tied to a pole down at the shore front and was posted on Beachcomber Fun Cruises Facebook page on Saturday. 'I was sitting on the grass on Friday watching the sea... you were playing with your dog. You ran past me and smiled,' it said. 'Would you like to go for a drink/coffee/walk??? I'm in Wellington just now, my ferry arrives back in Picton on Tuesday 3rd. 'I'm in town for 1 night only... But let's see how things go... On the off-chance you are single, remember who I am and would like to meet for a drink/coffee/walk. Mr Chalmers has revealed himself as the mystery man who captured the heart of the mystery woman . He said he was looking forward to Tuesday and meeting his mystery girl . 'I'll be sitting on the grass, watching the sea from 1-1.30pm onwards on Tuesday... Maybe you'll run past again?!?' On Monday, Mr Chalmers said his mother had called him because she had been told of the sign and thought it was such a coincidence that the man described in the sign had star tattoos as well. 'When I told her that it was me, she started freaking out and telling everyone in the office,' he said. 'She's all for me going down. She told me that she didn't raise me to not show up, so that's what I'm going to do. 'It's a bit overwhelming, I've never had something like this happen before. In high school if you passed a note the teacher would just take it off you.' The signs were posted on Beachcomber Fun Cruises Facebook page  and has sparked an online debate . 'Picton is a pretty small town and from the amount of people who have told me they're going to come down and watch what happens it sounds like everyone I know will be there.' Ms Milne may have had some inkling of the stir the note has caused, pleading with the public to not have the sign removed from the premises. 'In the spirit of happy endings, give this sign a chance to be seen by the right eyes,' she penned. 'It may even bring a dozen or so people back on Tuesday, intrigued... who is this girl with the long brown hair and the boy with the star tattoos and the dog and will they meet for a drink? 'I will, on my return to Picton on Tuesday, remove it myself... Whatever the ending may be. Thank you!'","Glasgow artist Sarah Milne met William Chalmers for first time on Tuesday .

"A poker player cheated casinos across the country out of tens of thousands of pounds by making almost invisible dents and bends in cards. Mihai Lacatos, a Romanian national, would sit at casino tables for hours deftly making the marks in the cards and even managed to swindle the Playboy Club in Mayfair, London out of £43,400 in just one week. The unemployed 61-year-old managed to lie his way into casinos across the country  he had been banned from by producing fake ID cards and driving licences and swindled them out of thousands. Scroll down for video . Mihai Lacatos fleeced casinos across the country out of tens of thousands of pounds by making almost invisible dents and marks on playing cards, and is seen making the marks at Playboy Club in Mayfair . Lacatos committed the frauds during a six year spree in which he was living at different locations in the UK. He tried to flee the country after his slight of hand was discovered but was arrested as he got to the departure lounge of Luton Airport on November 20, 2014. He was found with around £3,000. He admitted 14 fraud offences and four further charges of possessing false ID documents which date back to 2008. He is one of the first people to be convicted for a specific cheating technique called ‘card marking.' Lacatos (bottom right corner) was captured on camera making the almost imperceptible marks on cards . The 61-year-old fleeced customers at casinos across the country - including in Leicester, Salford, Nottingham and Birmingham . Lacatos used slight of hand to subtly bend and dent cards at the poker table and was so skilled his cheating went unnoticed for years. The bends and dents helped him identify what other players at the table for three card games were holding. Lacatos marked cards like the one above, so that the dents could identify the cards his opponents held . Lacastos targeted the Playboy Club in Mayfair in London and cheated players out of more than £40,000 . After he was spotted at the Playboy Club, parent company Caesars Entertainment contacted the Metropolitan Police's Gaming Unit who circulated his image to casinos across the UK. He was arrested on 31 March 2014 at the Rubicon Casino on Regent Street, Northampton after staff there recognised him and raised the alarm. Officers seized £1,485 from him, but while on bail he duped at least another three casinos during the six year spree. Phil Ivey failed in his bid to get Crockfords Club in London to pay him £7.7million in winnings . The High Court ruled Crockfords Club would not have to pay Phil Ivey £7.7million in winnings last year because his 'edge sorting' technique amounted to cheating. Mr Ivey had tried to sue the casino for refusing to pay out. Bruce Koloshi admitted cheating at a casino in Louisiana, America, in 2014. He was found using infrared ink to mark cards, which could only be seen using special contact lenses. In 2011 a gang used a similar technique in Cannes to steal £55,000 in two trips to the poker table. The group are believed to have used the scam at casinos across the continent. He was due to return to court in May 2014 but failed to turn up and detectives eventually tracked him down to Luton Airport where he was arrested as he tried to flee. Officers seized £3,000 from him under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Lacatos hoaxed staff at the Rendezvous Casino in Southend-on-Sea, the Genting Palm Beach Casino in Mayfair and Maxim’s Casino also in London and was convicted of fraud at all three premises. He also fleeced customers at the Rank Casinos in Leicester, Stockport, Salford, Swansea, Portsmouth, Nottingham, Sunderland, Birmingham, Walsall and London premises in Victoria and Bayswater. He used fake ID documents at casinos in Leicester, Stockport and Bournemouth. Lacatos will return to Southwark Crown Court on 16 March for sentence.

"Ionut Tudorache (pictured) was caught with 22 stolen mobile phones stuffed down his trousers just days after arriving in Britain . A Romanian pickpocket has been jailed after he admitted stealing 22 mobile phones  just days after arriving in Britain. Ionut Tudorache, 25, was part of an organised gang that targeted music fans at a Kasabian gig, stealing their phones while they were dancing. He wore a pair of tights hidden under his jeans which acted as a net to hold the devices, but claimed he didn't realise what was happening until two Romanians he had befriended starting stuffing the phones down his tights. Immigrant Tudorache had only been in the UK a few days when he committed the crime at the concert at Bournemouth International Centre in Dorset. He was caught when he aroused the suspicions of the BIC's security team, who stopped and searched him then found the phones down the pair of tights. Staff at the venue had been on red alert following similar incidents at the band's previous gigs there, Bournemouth Crown Court heard. Stuart Ellacott, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant drew the attention of the security guards by not making eye contact. 'He was stopped and searched, and the mobile phones were found in a pair of tights he was wearing underneath his trousers.' Despite the fact he committed the crime just days after arriving in Britain, he is unlikely to be deported due to strict laws on removing EU citizens. Without a court recommendation or tougher prison sentence, he can now only be removed at the behest of the Home Secretary. Nicholas Robinson, defending, told the court that Tudorache had not physically taken the phones from their owners at the concert. He claimed Tudorache had been recruited by two Romanians when he had arrived in London and travelled with them to Bournemouth. Mr Robinson said Tudorache, a qualified electromechanical engineer, had not known what he was getting involved until the men he was with started putting the phones down his tights at the gig on November 25 last year. He said: 'My client was not the pickpocket who actually stole the phones. 'He came here hoping for a better life. He had been in London for three or four days and he didn't know anyone. 'He met two Romanian gentlemen and he came down to Bournemouth with them. 'He was told to wear the tights because it would be cold on the south coast.' Tudorache, of no fixed abode, admitted 22 counts of theft of a mobile phone. In jailing him for nine months, Judge John Harrow said: 'You had been in this country a matter of days before you broke the law. You must have known that you were being dishonest.' Tudorache operated as part of a criminal gang targeting concert-goers at the Bournemouth International Centre (pictured) The incident is the latest in a spate of attacks on concert-goers by criminal gangs. Thieves have previously targeted fans at concerts by bands such as Oasis, Kings of Leon, Stereophonics and Sugababes at the BIC. Steve Turner, general manager at Bournemouth International Centre, said: 'This prosecution sends out a clear message that we do not tolerate theft. 'This particular type of crime affects venues across the UK and our team and security services are working closely with the police to crack down on perpetrators. 'We also encourage our visitors to keep an eye on their belongings at all times.'","A Romanian thief was jailed for nine months for pickpocketing at a concert .

"A controversial documentary, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, claims the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. On Monday makers of the film Going Clear: Scientology And The Prison Of Belief sat down for a panel discussion, where they addressed the alleged role the church played in the demise of the Hollywood couple's marriage. Logan Hill moderated the talk, held by The New York Times, between author Lawrence Wright (who wrote the book the film is based on), filmmaker Paul Haggis, director Alex Gibney and former Scientology member Mike Rinder. Scroll down for video... Revelations: A documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival alleges that the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman . In the film Marty Rathbun, formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims he had been appointed to 'facilitate the breakup' because the head of the church, David Miscavige, was suspicious of Cruise's second wife. Monday's panel discussion focused in on Rathbun's claims. 'David Miscavige [leader of the Church of Scientology] was terrified that he was losing control of Tom Cruise, because Tom Cruise is the greatest rainmaker really, for Scientology,' Gibney claimed. Panel discussion: Logan Hill moderated the talk, held by The New York Times , author Lawrence Wright, director Paul Haggis, director Alex Gibney and former Scientology member Mike Rinder on Monday . At odds: Filmmakers say church leaders were fearful of Nicole's influence on Tom, pictured in Los Angeles in 1991 . The director went on to assert that Scientology and psychiatry are opposed, adding that the actress' father 'was a psychologist in Australia.' 'Miscavige was afraid that Nicole Kidman was slowly taking Tom away from the church,' Gibney continued. 'There was a concerted effort to get him back. One of the things they did was... at Tom's behest, Marty Rathbun testifies in the film, that David Miscavige requested Marty to go and tap Nicole Kidman's phone.' Cruise's attorney, however, told E! News regarding the claims of wiretapping: 'Tom Cruise did not hire any private investigator to spy on or investigate Nicole Kidman in any way. Nor did he ask the Church of Scientology to do that. Any statement to the contrary is provably false.' Gibney's film claims that Kidman, who was raised Catholic, convinced Cruise to distance himself from the Church of Scientology between 1992 and 2001. Over: The pair divorced in 2001 and following the split, Cruise became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church's Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004, pictured in 1999 . It also alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actor's wedding. Rathbun suggests, in the film, this is when the aggressive campaign to tear the couple apart began. Urging them: Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Wright publicly pressed John Travolta and Cruise to speak out about claims of abuse within the church . Gibney went on to claim during Monday's panel: 'The other, more pernicious thing that happened was that they tried to turn their two kids against Nicole, which is really the most horrifying thing. 'They succeeded, so much so that we have people who told us that they began to refer to their mother privately as a suppressive person... and then they were told, ""Now listen, the way you deal with suppressive people is, don't let on to them that you know that they're a suppressive person. So, be nice, smile, but be aware that this person is more dangerous and damaging than anything you could possibly believe.""' Rinder, a former high ranking member of the church, went on to offer his own views on the claims: 'The circumstances surrounding that and his description of what happened, rings so true. 'The mind-set of Nicole isn't really with the program so here we go back to disconnection again, except it's got a nicer name, it doesn't exactly get presented that way to Tom Cruise.' 'It's ""Tom, she's not good for you, you better straighten out here and get your life in order and we'll help you,""' he continued. 'That dictatorial control and efforts to control people's lives is really the ebb and flow of the Church of Scientology... There are all sorts of examples like that.' Back in 2012 Maureen Orth wrote a piece making similar claims about Kidman and Cruise's children being turned against the actress. At the time the church denied the claims made by the Vanity Fair piece. Cruise and Kidman share two adopted children together, Isabella, 22, and Conor, 20. Meanwhile, during Monday's panel Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Wright publicly pressed John Travolta and Cruise to speak out about claims of abuse within the church. 'The reason we are calling out Cruise and Travolta is they have the capacity, the power, to change it. There are only two ways that you can address the abuses that are going on in Scientology,' Wright said. Allegations: Marty Rathbun (left), formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims the head of the church David Miscavige (right) was suspicious of Cruise's second wife . Concerns: Kidman (pictured with Cruise in 2001) was listed as a 'Potential Trouble Source' because her father was a psychologist in Australia . 'One is to re-examine the tax exemption. But some of those celebrity megaphones, if they were turned around in the other direction they could make a difference. They should make a difference. I'd like to see Tom Cruise stand up and say it's time for David Miscavige to answer his accusers.' The Church Of Scientology responded belatedly to DailyMail.com's request for comment and denied all allegations made by the film and the filmmakers, including allegations of wiretapping, and claims made about David Miscavige. The church also characterized Marty Rathbun, Mike Rinder, and Alex Gibney as biased and unreliable sources. Before the controversial documentary's first screening, HBO hired 160 lawyers to look through the film. It is expected to air on the channel on March 29. In more than 200 tweets, the church has tried to discredit Gibney and his sources in Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month. It has also issued a statement on the website of Freedom Magazine, its news publication, claiming the documentary is 'propaganda', 'one-sided', full of 'false information' and features 'vengeful' sources. Anger: The film alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's (pictured) phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actor's wedding . Friends: Cruise, left, embraces David Miscavige, the Scienology Church's President of the Rulling Council during the official opening of a new Scientology church in central Madrid in 2004 . And a week before the premiere, it took out full-page ads in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times to offer a counter point of view. In addition, the church released a statement to Us Weekly, stating: 'This is not a film that is any way objective about Scientology. It is propaganda... Freedom of the press is not freedom to lie. The Church of Scientology has long fought against the kind of bigotry and religious hatred that Mr. Gibney and co-producer Lawrence Wright aim to incite. To fit their anti-religious agenda, they scraped the bottom of the barrel to cherry-pick a tiny collection of deadbeats.' Despite the furor surrounding the production, Gibney hopes it will lead to more investigations and reports into Scientology. He told Variety magazine: 'We hope that this film and Larry's book will start the process where more media will say well we don't care anymore. We're going to pursue this no matter what. According to the credits at the end of the film, Cruise and Kidman refused to be interviewed. The pair divorced in 2001 and following the split, Cruise became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church's Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004.","Going Clear, created by Alex Gibney, is an expose of the religion .

"An ironic venue choice has been made by the Liberal National Party's for the International Women's Day event. The annual luncheon event is set to be held at the exclusive men's-only club - the Tattersall's Club in Brisbane on Friday. The oldest and most prestigious membership club in Brisbane boasts that those who wish to sign up will enjoy unlimited possibilities, luxury services and the opportunity to join 'an influential network of like-minded members'. But if you aren't a man, you need to be a relative or friend of a member to be privileged enough to walk through the door and relish in these perks. The exclusive men's-only club - the Tattersall's Club in Brisbane is the ironic venue of choice for the International Women's Day event hosted by the Liberal National Party on Friday . An LNP spokesman said the venue was chosen due to availability, price and flexibility and location. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten asked Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is also the Federal Minister for Women, to comment on the topic during Question Time at Parliament House on Wednesday. Mr Abbott replied that the venue choice should be deemed as a positive move - saying the last sexism barrier had been broken down. 'Admit women! Isn't that fantastic? At last, this bastion of chauvinism has admitted women and they've done it on International Women's Day because of the Liberal National Party, Fairfax reported him as saying. Prime Minister and Minister for Women Tony Abbott looking very smug after saying the venue choice was a sign that his party is 'smashing the glass ceiling yet again' 'Good on the Liberal National Party, smashing the glass ceiling yet again.' 'I say congratulations and thank God that bastion of old-fashioned chauvinism has finally collapsed like the walls of Jericho at the trumpet cry of the Liberal National Party,' he said . Parliamentary Speaker Fiona Simpson, who is the keynote speaker at the luncheon, did not seem bothered by the event being held at a club where women aren't allowed to join. 'I'm less troubled by openly 'male only' clubs or openly 'women only' gyms than I am by areas of society that have a veneer of equality but which hide structural impediments or unconscious bias that block women from opportunities,' she said told the Brisbane Times.

"If your shelves are crammed with books you’ve been meaning to get around to reading but haven’t, you’re not alone. Research found families across Britain are hoarding a staggering eight billion books – but one in five is unread. More than half of the 2,000 people surveyed said they hoard books because they feel emotionally attached to them, with a third keeping books merely because they hate throwing anything away. Damaging: Fifty Shades of Grey was not a book people thought would impress guests, according to the survey . But 16 per cent admitted they keep certain titles on their shelves to make them look more intelligent. Those deemed most likely to impress guests included To Kill a Mockingbird, Moby-Dick and the Bible. However, Katie Price’s autobiography, Fifty Shades of Grey and anything by James Patterson topped the list of books readers thought would damage their reputation. Popular: Classics including To Kill a Mockingbird and Moby Dick were popular books used to impress guests . The survey, commissioned by storage firm Shurgard in advance of World Book Day tomorrow, found the average home contains 158 hardbacks and paperbacks. In total, it said Britain’s book collection could fill Wembley Stadium 16,000 times. The survey found that while sales of e-books are rising, traditional books still remain firm favourites. A third of those asked said they hoard books because they hate throwing anything away and 20 per cent keep their collection to pass on to children. Duncan Bell, Shurgard’s operations director, said: ‘We were surprised to hear the innovative ways people store their books, but holding onto your books doesn’t mean they need to take over your house. ‘A self-storage unit could be a convenient solution for storing those classics for future generations whilst also keeping your hallways clear.’","Families across Britain have 8 billion books but one in five is unread .

"Hugh Jackman and his former classmates are 'sad, angry and disappointed' at the testimony of their former headmaster at the prestigious Sydney high school Knox Grammar at an inquiry into child sex abuse at the school. Dr Ian Paterson, the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, gave evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse on Tuesday and Wednesday, today admitting to impeding a police investigation into allegations of paedophilia from teachers. Jackman was among many who live-streamed Dr Paterson's testimony in New York on Tuesday morning Australian time, exchanging emails with around eight of his former classmates at the exclusive school, according to best friend Grill Team radio presenter Gus Worland. Scroll down for video . Best mates: Hugh Jackman, right, and Gus Worland, left, are among many Knox Grammar School Old Boys who are watching on with interest as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse continues in Sydney . Dr Ian Paterson, pictured here on Tuesday, has provided more than a day-and-a-half of evidence to the Royal Commission, which is examining sex abuse at Knox Grammar School. Dr Paterson was headmaster of the school from 1969 to 1998 . Hugh Jackman (pictured front, second from left) and best friend Gus Worland (second from right) attended Knox Grammar School . 'He's as absolutely gobsmacked as everyone that what we thought (about the school) was very different,' said Worland. 'He and another friend were watching it on the live stream and the rest of us were watching when we can.' 'We wake up this morning to a whole heap of emails from all our mates and it's just sad. 'And the overwhelming feeling and emotion is one of just absolute anger, disappointment, sadness for everyone involved.' Worland and Jackman dealt with Dr Paterson in their roles as a former senior prefect and school captain. The pair attended the Knox Preparatory and Senior Schools from 1978 to 1986. Worland told Daily Mail Australia last week they were keenly anticipating the evidence from Dr Paterson, who they respected and feared at school. Dr Ian Paterson on Wednesday admitted hindering a police investigation into abuse allegations in 1996 . Prestigious: Knox Grammar School, on the city's north shore, raised some of the prominent men in Australian society . Dr Paterson was widely known by the nickname 'The Snake' because of his 'autocratic style' while he was at the school. 'He was the power in the land,' Old Boy Peter FitzSimons told Daily Mail Australia outside the hearing on Tuesday. 'He was the Parliament and the King. ' But Mr FitzSimons said that while Dr Paterson appeared to be 'running a tight ship' to his unaware students, many were unaware of the 'carnage below the decks'. 'There's no excuse for his inaction to help those children and to get those paedophiles out of that school,' Worland said today. 'It makes us old boys extremely angry to think that a man who shaped a lot of our lives the stuff we thought we were basing us on was a lie. 'He put the school's reputation and what people thought of the school ahead of looking after those kids who were being abused. 'There's no excuse for that.'

"When Winston was caught looting the fridge for hot dogs, his owner decided this old dog needed to learn some new tricks. So in what looks like a bizarre tribute to Swiss folk hero William Tell, Scott Cromwell got his canine companion to pose with a shiny red apple on top of his head, among other fruity treats. Then he matched the color of the background to the fruit to create this series of eye-catching photos. Don't shoot! Winston looks worried at the prospect this picture may be a preamble to some amateur archery . Sour grapes: The dog appears less than impressed with this set of headgear he's been asked to balance on his snout by owner Scott Cromwell for this series of quirky photograph . Superfoods for a super dog: Winston looks on inscrutably while balancing a mound of blueberries . Leaves a sour taste: Winston looks a little shocked after being persuaded to grip a lime in his jaws . Not impressed: But the loyal dog doesn't flinch even with a slimy half-eaten banana balanced on his bonce . Anticipation: Winston looks like he better get something a little more meaty to justify all this posing . 'Winston's very eager to please me and will do about anything for a treat. He absolutely loved doing these shots,' Mr Cromwell said. 'He knew when we were about to do a shoot and would beat me to the room where I had it set up and be sitting in the exact spot I wanted before I got there. 'Naturally, he loved the fridge shoot too, being that he got to eat a whole package of hotdogs. 'I kept replenishing the one you see him eating with a new one until we went through a package of them, just to make sure I got a good shot.' Mr Cromwell, a TV repairman-cum-animal photographer from Oklahoma City, spent two months working with Winston to create the quirky shots. He had planned to just take a picture of the banana but after he got such a great reaction from people who saw the shots, he could not resist taking more. Now there's a snack I can sink my teeth into... Winston got to scoff a whole packet of hotdogs for this picture . Mr Cromwell said: 'Winston does stick his nose in nearly every time I go to the fridge and open it and that is what gave me the idea, so luckily I never taught him how to open it to get me a beer or he would be in there a lot. 'The pictures have been very well received and are some of my most popular ones.

"An horrifically burned 12-year-old boy was able to tell police it was his dad who started the fatal house fire that killed him and his nine-year-old brother, an inquest has heard. Salesman Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Paul, 9, and his brother Jack, 12, to the attic with fun-size chocolate bars to play with a new model railway then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside. The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder but died five days later in hospital. Jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died from 50 per cent burns: 'It was my dad that started the fire' and 'My dad did it on purpose.' The fire, which was started deliberately by Mr Sykes (centre), killed himself along with his nine-year-old son Paul (left) and Jack (right), 12 . Jack (right) and Paul Sykes were both killed in the house fire after being lured into the loft by their father who then set the home ablaze. Here the two boys are pictured with their mother Claire Throssell . Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries told the boys' tearful mother Claire Throssell: 'Your loss has deeply affected me.' He said she bore no blame for the tragedy and told her: 'You have nothing to blame yourself about.' The inquest heard Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives'. Investigating officer Detective Sargent Stuart Hall said: 'I believe the children were almost lured into the loft by the newly purchased train track and fun-size chocolate bars which had been left there to maintain their attentions.' The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with CAFCASS - which represents children in family courts two days before the tragedy. He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights. Mr Sykes told his boss Andre Spencer in a phone call just over two hours before the inferno that he thought the CAFCASS visit was a 'waste of time' and 'they wanted to talk about negatives and didn't want to listen to his agenda'. Mr Spencer said: 'He was a dedicated father. His children were his number one priority. He talked about them to the point that he seemed obsessed and boring.' An inquest into the death of Paul (pictured bottom left and far right) and Jack was carried out today, where a coroner ruled their deaths were the result of an unlawful killing . Claire Throssell's son Jack clung to life in intensive care with his mother (pictured) at his bedside, but died five days later . He felt the access arrangements were 'barbaric' and he mistakenly believed Paul only wanted to see him for one hour a week. 'There's no point living,' he told his boss. Mr Spencer said he then went on: 'If anything did happen would I care for his boys.' CAFCASS family adviser Rona Murphy told the inquest in her dealings with the family Paul did want to see his father but only for a three-hour visit on one day a week. Paul had told her about 'issues of abuse' and described meal times as a 'battleground' because his dad 'wanted him to eat more and everything and he didn't want to.' She did not believe Mr Sykes was taking on board what she was telling him. 'He was saying how can I have any less contact than I already have.' Council social worker Julie Keen said four months before the tragedy she had a referral that Paul didn't want to go home from school and have contact with his father. The boys' heartbroken mother Claire Throssell (pictured at her sons' funeral) told the inquest her two children had 'meant the world' to her . 'Paul said his dad was abusive to him and Jack,' she said. 'It was general physical and emotional abuse. On a skiing trip Paul claimed his dad had got him by the throat.' When Mr Sykes was challenged he apologised for his behaviour but was more focused on getting around a table with his then wife. Mr Sykes, lived in Penistone, South Yorkshire, after the split with his wife and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's in nearby Thurlstone. On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account. He spent £600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'. Mr Sykes then bought petrol cans, some petrol and posted letters to family and friends and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home. He picked up his sons on the evening of October 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft, he set the fire. The inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house, he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door, letting himself in and locking it behind him. He took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor, including in the children's bedrooms. Once this was done he then entered the loft, closing the hatch behind him. When the fire crew arrived it appeared Jack had bravely tried to get out of the loft as he was found by the bottom of the ladder. Mourners stand by as the caskets of Jack and Paul are carried from a church during their funeral in October . Mr Sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was 'going to be at peace'. A minute later, neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze. Cord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs. One of his letters to HSBC Bank said: 'I won't be paying the mortgage any more because I won't be alive.' Det Sgt Hall said numerous statements taken by the police showed he was at a 'particularly low point' in his life over visiting rights to his sons and took the view he would have less access. Specialist fire investigator Michael Mason said the carpet and furniture downstairs were well alight when firefighters arrived. 'The door to the stairs had been wedged to stop anyone coming down and there were chairs behind the front door as if to prevent people coming in,' he said. Two bodies were found in the loft - that of Mr Sykes and his son Paul - and Mr Sykes was declared dead on arrival at hospital. Pictured is the home where Paul Skyes killed his two sons after trapping them in the attic and starting a fire . Petrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor. A patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames. Mr Mason said: 'At some point during the fire the loft hatch was closed and then opened during the fire which allowed a plume of smoke with gases to enter the loft. It was a natural reaction to try and get out.' It emerged that it was Jack who opened the hatch and he was rescued conscious by firefighters but died five days later in hospital from his burns. Mr Sykes and Paul died from inhaling noxious fumes. In her statement, the boys' mother said: 'My boys meant the world to me. They were both polite, well mannered and caring, and you can't imagine life without them.' When asked by the coroner if there was anything she would like to add, she replied: 'There is nothing further I can add other than the guilt I that I carry for what has happened to them.' The coroner recorded a verdict on Monday that Mr Sykes committed suicide. Yesterday the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing. Coroner Dorries said: 'This fire was set deliberately indeed the whole event was carefully planned by Mr Sykes to ensure a catastrophic fire while the boys were distracted by model railway equipment and sweets.'","Jack and Paul Sykes died after their father Darren lured them into attic .

"Oscar Pistorius is so paranoid about being poisoned in prison that he is reportedly surviving on tinned food from the tuck shop. The Paralympic star, who was jailed four months ago for killing his girlfriend, has lost so much weight that his prosthetic limbs no longer fit him, according to local media. The 28-year-old South African sprinter is allegedly refusing his daily rations at Kgosi Mampuru prison following death threats by fellow inmates. Jailed: Oscar Pistorius (centre) holds the hand of his uncle Arnold as he is taken down to the holding cells after being sentenced to five years in prison for culpable homicide killing at a court in Pretoria . Behind bars: He is said to be refusing his daily rations at Kgosi Mampuru prison (pictured) - a sprawling correctional facility in Pretoria, which is dominated by a violent gang culture - following death threats . Instead, he is using his monthly allowance of £9 to buy food at the tuck shop, including tins of ‘chakalaka’ - a spicy African vegetable concoction, reported South Africa’sYou magazine. News of the fallen track star’s poisoning fears and dramatic weight loss follows an improvement in his prisoner status, as exclusively revealed by MailOnline last month. Now a category A prisoner, the ‘Blade Runner’ is entitled to the maximum privileges afforded to a convicted inmate, including ‘contact’ visits, the freedom to wear jewellery, pursue a hobby and own a radio. His budget at the tuck shop has also increased, from £6 a month to £9. Pistorius is four months into a five-year sentence for the manslaughter of Reeva Steenkamp, following a lengthy murder trial last year during which his doctor described the pain he suffers as a result of poorly-fitting artificial limbs.

The London 2012 star is being held on the hospital wing of the sprawling correctional facility in Pretoria, which is dominated by a violent gang culture, where he is said to have little contact with other inmates. One of his neighbours is Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir, who is facing a number of charges including murder, with whom he shares a running machine and exercise bike. In October, Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide over the death of 29-year-old Reeva at his home on Valentine's Day in 2013. The double amputee shot the model four times through a locked toilet door after mistaking her for an intruder. He could be released from jail in August and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. However, the state has appealed Pistorius’s acquittal on a charge of murder. The athlete’s own lawyers have challenged the ruling to allow the appeal. The next hearing in the case is next week.","South African sprinter is 'refusing daily rations' at Kgosi Mampuru prison .

"A woodland trust has today been forced to deny it is 'anti-fairy' after it launched a crackdown on the number of doors being nailed to trees as homes for the tiny ethereal beings. Fairy control has had to be brought in at Wayford Woods in Somerset because it has been overwhelmed by hundreds of sprite homes. Families with children flock to the woodland to nail doors to trees and leave notes for the fairies at the beauty spot near Crewkerne - but critics say it has descended into a fairy 'free-for-all'. Wayford Trustee Steven Acreman said: 'We've got little doors everywhere. We're not anti-fairies but it's in danger of getting out of control. Crackdown: A Somerset woodland trust has launched a crackdown on the number of fairy doors being nailed to its trees . Magic: Hundreds of the doors have appeared in Wayford Woods near Crewkerne, where children leave handwritten notes for the magical creatures to read . Fairy explosion: The number peaked a year ago when more than 200 little doors had been screwed, nailed and installed on trees . He added: 'It's a very complex situation and nobody's admitting that they're evicting the fairies. It's just that fairy control is required otherwise we'd be covered in fairy doors'. Originally an extension of nearby Wayford Manor Gardens, the 29 acres of Somerset woodland boasts a stream, meadow and ornamental lake. It was set up as a charitable trust in the 1990s but mysteriously someone nailed a fairy home to a tree. Mr Acreman said:  'It fitted perfectly, it had a little turned handle and inside was a bed. We didn't know who had done it but we left it there. 'But then another door appeared and now it's gathered momentum.' The doors have been installed by local people so children can leave messages for the fairies. The number  peaked a year ago when more than 200 little doors had been screwed, nailed and installed on trees. And with little tokens, fairy toys and notes secreted behind some of the doors, it has rapidly become known as the fairy woods. But some may have to be removed and a ban imposed. Complaints: The beauty spot has become known as Fairy Wood because of its elaborate handmade doors . Mystery: Some believe that Fairies exist, with 400 sightings nationwide in the three months to January, according to a Fairy Investigation Society survey . Mr Acreman said: 'We've had as many as 10 doors put up on a single tree, they surrounded the tree,' he said. 'We had a complete fairy fairground arrive but we rejected that planning proposal.' With elfin construction now including more and more garish plywood doors with lots of tinsel and glitter. Mr Acreman told the BBC they have had to bring in quality control to remove the worst offenders. He said 'We put a lot of time into the conservation of the woods. 'We're trying to keep people to the paths but the fairy doors are making it a free-for-all.' Despite most believing that fairies don't exist, a recent survey has revealed many people do. In January it emerged the Fairy Investigation Society is conducting a national survey and in three months received 400 sightings. Cottingley, a village outside Bradford in Yorkshire, was for many years the world's fairy hotspot. 16-year-old Elsie Wright took a remarkable photograph of her ten-year-old cousin, Frances Griffiths, playing with 'fairies' on the banks of a stream which ran behind the garden of Elsie's house. A few days earlier, in the summer of 1917, Frances had slipped and gone into the stream, later telling her mother she had fallen into the water while she was 'playing with the fairies'. Her mother, unamused, sent her up to the attic bedroom she shared with Elsie where, later that afternoon, the two girls hatched a plan that would make headlines around the world, severely damage the reputations of eminent public figures and generate a controversy that endured for generations. Elsie suggested they should take a photograph of the 'fairies' to prove to Frances' mother that she had been telling the truth. The girls drew some fairies, cut them out and pasted them on to cardboard. With a few long hatpins on which to mount their 'fairies' and a roll of zinc oxide bandage tape. Arthur Wright willingly agreed to lend his daughter his camera and girls set off, blissfully unaware that they were about to create one of the most reproduced photographs in history. They arranged the four fairies - three with wings and one playing a piped instrument - in front of Frances, who put flowers in her hair, cupped her chin in her hand and, curiously, stared intently at the camera rather than the fairies when Elsie took the picture. When Wright developed the exposed plate a darkroom he asked Elsie what they were, and she told him they were the fairies that she and Frances played with by the stream - they took another photo a month later. Polly Wright, Elsie's mother, and her sister, Annie Griffiths, Frances' mother took the  photographs to a meeting of the . Theosophical Society in Harrogate. Knowledge of photography was not . widespread at this time and few understood that the 'spirit' could be . introduced by a simple double exposure on the same photographic plate. As . a result, many Spiritualists were encouraged to believe that the camera . could 'see' what the naked eye could not, a belief which helped . legitimise the Cottingley fairy photographs. Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle also believed this was photographic evidence of the existence of fairies. It was only many decades later did they admit that the photographs were faked and involved cut-out drawings of fairy figures that were fastened to foliage with hatpins. Elsie and Frances stuck doggedly to their story for years. Not until March 1983, when she was 76 years old, did Frances finally confess. 'I'm fed up with all these stories,' she complained. 'I hated those photographs and cringe every time I see them. I thought it was a joke, but everyone else kept it going. It should have died a natural death 60 years ago.' Elsie at first refused to comment, but later confirmed her cousin's story: 'I do not want to die and leave my grandchildren with a loony grandmother to remember.' Frances continued to claim, contrarily, that she had seen fairies and that the fifth photograph - the fairy bower - was authentic. She died in 1986; Elsie died two years later. 'The joke was only meant to last two hours,' said Elsie towards the end of her life. 'It lasted 70 years.'","Wayford Woods in Somerset flooded with fairy doors over the past decade .

Apple is said to have found them online and chose to feature them in the campaign, which aims to promote the photo power of the iPhone 6. Each photograph is accompanied by a caption on the online gallery, which says where it was taken, whether an app was used to improve the shot and a tip about why it is a good photo, which amateurs could use to boost their photographic prowess. For example, an image of a man in a field of sunflowers says: 'Photographing a subject from behind can add wit to a photo. Here, the subject and the flowers are both facing away from the camera' The handset has an 8MP iSight camera with a new sensor with Focus Pixels, improved face detection and exposure control, ‘so you can take the photo and let iPhone 6 do the rest,’ the firm says. Together with improved video capabilities, it was one of the primary selling points for the handset, which got a more rounded look and sharpened screen too. Apple found the striking images online and chose to feature them in the campaign for the iPhone 6. This image by Brendan Ó in Copenhagen, Denmark shows how taking a picture from an unexpected angle can add an interesting twist. 'Here, it creates contours in the lines that convey a sense of movement to the viewer,' Apple said.The photographer used an app called Snapseed to enhance the image . Mobile photography – that taken on phones instead of stand-alone cameras – is slowly becoming more credible. This photograph by Kim G in El Calafate, Argentina, juxtaposes a jagged glacier with trees and mountains so that the image is effectively divided in three . Mobile photography – images taken on phones instead of stand-alone cameras – is slowly becoming more credible. For example, the World Photo Organisation (WPO) recently launched an extra category to the 2015 Sony World Photography Awards to recognise excellent photographs taken on smartphones. ‘Photography now exists in our pockets, and we want to celebrate this,’ it said. The new category ‘allows us to look a little closer at those otherwise ordinary moments and to enjoy the creative freedom that mobile phone photography allows,’ it added. There are more mobile phones on Earth than human beings and the number of devices is growing five times as fast as the population. The iPhone 6 - pictured left alongside the larger iPhone 6 Plus, right,  - has an 8MP iSight camera with a new sensor with Focus Pixels, improved face detection and exposure control, ‘so you can take the photo and let iPhone 6 do the rest,’ the firm says . As well as the wonders of the natural world, many of the chosen photographs capture humans and art. This image of balancing fishermen was shot by Francis O in Inle Lake, Myanmar. 'Finding unexpected whimsy in a scene can make a photo more appealing — like this combination of nets, boats, and fishermen,' Apple says . Shots of people's feet are almost as ubiquitous as coffee cup art on Instagram but this image by Cielo D in Alameda, California is more interesting. 'Shooting your subject in a reflection — like the one on this wet street — can make a simple scene seem surreal and surprising,' Apple says . These two images show how the phone can be used for close-ups as well as landscape shots. Paul O, from Chicago, Illinois, captured a rainbow on his hand (left), while Cory S in Lake Cushman, Washington, shows the size of the trees by including a human in the right-hand image, as well as beautiful shafts of light permeating the leafy scene . The WPO says that mobile entries to the awards have ‘increased steadily year on year. ‘It was time for mobile phone photography to have its own dedicated platform, instead of taking the risk of losing some wonderful photos within the hundreds of thousands of entries we receive to the main awards.’ The competition was open to anyone who shot a photo with a smartphone, which could be printed out and shown at an exhibition. It has just closed to new entries and up to 20 photos are being shortlisted by a panel of judges, before being posted online between March 10 and 17, so the public can vote for the winner. The winning entries will go on show in London at an exhibition from April 14 to May 10. Apple's online gallery offers photography tips in the captions.

"A first edition of Mein Kampf signed by Adolf Hitler is set to fetch at least $35,000 in a controversial online auction. The two-volume set was published from 1925 and inscribed by the far-Right leader to Philipp Bouhler, the 12th member of the Nazi party who oversaw the murders of 70,000 people. It is the third copy of Hitler's racist autobiographical manifesto to be sold by the same Los Angeles auction house in just a month - with the previous two fetching $64,850. First edition: This signed, two-volume copy of Mein Kampf could fetch at least $35,000 in a controversial auction. It is the third copy of Hitler's manifesto to be sold be the same auction house in just one month . Auction house owner Nate Sanders, whose eponymous firm is running the sale, defended the decision to sell racist books saying they were 'part of history'. The sale of Nazi memorabilia is banned in some European countries, including Germany and France, and led to a major French case against Yahoo more than a decade ago. But Mr Sanders, who is Jewish, said most collectors were not neo-Nazis but simply military history aficionados. 'It is a piece of history,' he said last week. 'The same people who collect Adolf Hitler (items) collect George Washington, or World War II, or George Patton. 'You have the whole gamut. There's white supremacist collectors of Hitler, and there's Jewish collectors of Hitler items.' The volumes were signed by the Nazi party leader after his release from prison for high treason in 1924. Inscribed: The books were given to Philipp Bouhler, the 12th member of the Nazi party who oversaw the murders of 70,000 people, for Christmas in 1925 and 1926, each carrying a message from Hitler . Dedication: The second message said: 'To Herr Philipp Bouhler, on the occasion of Christmas inscribed most sincerely as a sign of recognition of your performance of duties, Adolf Hitler, Munich, December 24, 1926' They were published by Franz Eher Nachfolger of Munich and inscribed to Bouhler, one of the leaders of the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 when Hitler attempted to overthrow the Bavarian government by gunpoint. He went on to be a key Nazi leader, and as Chief of the Chancellery for Hitler he led the barbaroc T4 'child euthanasia' programme. Between 1939 and 1941 more than 70,000 sick and disabled children and adults were killed at extermination centres in psychiatric hospitals in Germany and Austria. Anti-Semite: Hitler's manifesto outlined his conspiracy theory that Jews caused Germany's ills . Doctors continued their unethical practices right up until the end of the war, which historians believe may have claimed another 200,000 lives. Mein Kampf was initially published in two volumes, the first in 1925 and the second in 1926. The deeply anti-Semitic book outlined Hitler's political ideas and pushed the theory that Jews were responsible for all of Germany's economic problems. It was dictated to Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess while he was behind bars for his part in the Beer Hall Putsch, and was designed to raise money for his defence. The signed volumes are being sold with a starting price of $35,000, but could fetch far more when the auction ends on March 26. Volumes of Mein Kampf from the 1930s are common because they were wedding gifts in Nazi Germany, but a copy signed by the author is rare. The previous two copies of Mein Kampf held by the California auction house, both signed, had a starting price of $20,000 but sold for $64,850 on Friday. The first volume of the edition now up for sale is signed: 'To Herr Philipp Bouhler, in grateful recognition of your loyal work for our movement on the occasion of Christmas 1925, inscribed most sincerely, Adolf Hitler, Munich, December 24, 1925.' The signature on the second volume reads: 'To Herr Philipp Bouhler, on the occasion of Christmas inscribed most sincerely as a sign of recognition of your performance of duties, Adolf Hitler, Munich, December 24, 1926.' Signed pages: The sale of Nazi memorabilia is banned in come European countries including France . Two copies of Mein Kampf, including this one inscribed to future SS leader Joseph Bauer, were sold by the same auction house on Friday for $65,000. Owner Nate Sanders defended the sales as 'part of history' Sam Heller, of Nate D Sanders auctions, said: 'Volumes of Mein Kampf signed by Hitler are scarce, but these volumes take on extra significance because Hitler inscribed them to Philipp Bouhler. 'He was responsible for the Nazi Aktion program, which murdered over 70,000 disabled adults and children in Germany. 'They are an ominously signed set of books that futilely warned the world of Hitler's intentions.' The books have been rebound in burgundy leather boards with gilt lettering since their publication. The auction house has not revealed their history or the identity of the seller.","Two-volume set was published from 1925 and signed by far-Right leader .

"One of Australia's most popular pain killers has been left with a splitting headache, as the national consumer watchdog gets ready to take it to court. Reckitt Benckiser, the company behind Nurofen in Australia, will square off against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in federal court this month over claims that it has mislead customers. The ACCC will dispute claims made by the company that the Nurofen Specific Pain Range is specially designed to target different types of pain. The consumer watchdog claims that all products contain identical ingredients. Scroll down for video . Australia's consumer watchdog is taking Nurofen to court over its advertising claiming its products target  specific types of pain . The products in question are: Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said cracking down on false advertising surrounding medical products was a targetted priority for the watchdog. 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' Mr Sims said. 'In this case, we allege that consumers have been misled into purchasing Nurofen Specific Pain Products under the belief that each product is specifically designed for and effective in treating a particular type of pain, when this is not the case.' 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' chairman Rod Sims said. It also flagged the 'significantly' higher cost of Nurofen compared to other products as a concern, with the range in question costing up to twice as much as a standard pain killer sold by Nurofen or another comparable brand. A Nurofen spokeswoman denied the allegations in a statement, and said pain-specific products made life easier for customers. 'Nurofen is committed to the quality use of medicines and promoting and protecting the health of Australians,' the statement read. 'Nurofen works closely with all regulatory bodies to ensure high standards compliance to guidelines. 'Nurofen will continue to work with regulators to ensure its packaging continues to be fully aligned with all guidelines and requirements and still offer consumers with clear pain relief options for their pain type.' The ACCC is seeking declarations, injunctions, an order for the publication of corrective notices, penalties and costs. The matter is listed for a case management conference  in the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney on March 31.","Australian Competition and Consumer Commission takes it to federal court .

"Hefty bonus: Antony Jenkins, who receives £5.5m a year, was immediately accused of being ‘out of touch’ over the 'pie in the sky' comments . The boss of Barclays has called for an end to free banking, claiming the controversial move would be a ‘step forward’ for customers. Antony Jenkins, who said he would not make the first move in case it scared off customers, was immediately accused of being ‘out of touch’. His comments came as the High Street giant unveiled another big pay-day for staff. Mr Jenkins’ total package more than tripled from £1.6million in 2013 to £5.5million last year. Asked whether he would approve of free in-credit bank accounts being outlawed and charges introduced across the board, he said: ‘I do think that would be a step forward, yes. ‘It’s difficult to achieve of course because the banks can’t do that. It would probably have to be regulated or legislated.’ He told ITV News it was unlikely that any bank would make the first move in case it lost business. John Mann, a member of the Treasury committee, said last night: ‘He lives in a different world from the rest of us. People on lower incomes would suffer. This shows how out of touch Mr Jenkins is, as so many customers value free bank accounts.’ Mr Jenkins came under fire last year when he argued that closing bank branches would lead to a ‘better customer experience’ as current account holders are increasingly banking online. James Daley of consumer group Fairer Finance said his latest comments were ‘pie in the sky’, adding: ‘To try and scrap the free in-credit banking system we have now would be incredibly unpopular. 'No government would legislate for it – it would be a vote loser because more people benefit from it [free banking] than lose out’. But Mr Jenkins has the support of senior regulators including Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey, who has called free banking a ‘dangerous myth’ – partly due to the confusing array of hefty charges for the millions who go overdrawn. Supporters of packaged accounts – which can cost around £15 a month and typically include ‘perks’ such as travel insurance – also claim banks will be less likely to mis-sell other products. But latest figures from the Financial Ombudsman show complaints from customers who believe they were mis-sold packaged accounts have soared. Royal Bank of Scotland last week revealed it had set aside £150million to compensate customers mis-sold packaged accounts. The comments came as the High Street giant unveiled another big pay-day for staff (file picture) The row came as Mr Jenkins was forced to defend his decision to accept a £1.1million bonus for last year, despite cutting 14,000 jobs. The 53-year-old insisted the decision was ‘appropriate’, saying: ‘You have to look at the very significant progress we’ve made in the two-and-a-half years that I have been chief executive.’ Barclays has set aside almost £1.3billion to pay likely fines for rigging the £3.5trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. This helped drag down profits by 21 per cent to £2.3billion. A spokesman for the Robin Hood tax campaign said: ‘Bonus season has again been dominated by pay controversies, scandals and fines – underlining that too little reform has taken place.’","Mr Jenkins accused of being 'out of touch' over 'pie in the sky' comments .

"A couple have been left devastated after they spent 'every penny' on a dream home which they found covered in animal urine and faeces on the day they moved in. Marie Louise Campbell, 45, was looking forward to moving into the house after viewing it on November 17 last year and putting in a £145,000 offer which was accepted the following day. But when she and her fiance David Alonzi, 46, received the keys and tried to move in last month, they were shocked at what they found. Scroll down for video . Marie Campbell and her fiance David Alonzi pictured with faeces and urine-covered debris in their new home . Animal waste can be seen smeared on the wall (left) while wooden panels (right) are noticeably stained . The carpet was so wet with animal urine it had to soaked through to the joists, Ms Campbell claimed . When they entered the property Ms Campbell said she was hit with a smell so strong it could 'knock you out' She claims she was hit with a foul pong that could 'knock you out' when she picked up the keys and unlocked the front door. Faeces were splattered up the walls and urine covered the floors to the point that the carpets and floorboards needed to be removed. Horrified Ms Campbell and her fiance, David Alonzi, 46, believe the property in Crossgates, Dunfermline, Fife, was used as a dog run in the months following their viewing and accepted offer. Ms Campbell said: 'When we got the brochure and viewed (the house), it looked fantastic, beautifully presented. It ticked all the boxes of what David and I were looking for.' After there were delays finalising some of the contract details - known in Scotland as the missives - she received the keys on January 22, just over 10 weeks after viewing the property. 'When we got the keys we could not believe what was in front of us. We opened the front door and it was cat p*** I could smell. 'I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were yellow marks at the door entrance. I went to have a smell and it nearly knocked me out. 'There are poo and pee stains on the terracotta carpet. It was absolutely saturated wet with pee. We still have all the evidence locked in the garage. 'The carpet was wet. It was soaking. It went through to the underlay which was like a baby's nappy. Ms Campbell and her fiance David Alonzi believe the property in Dunfermline, Fife, was used as a dog run in the weeks before they moved in . Floorboards and carpet had to be pulled up as the couple tried their best to rid themselves of the smell . 'We lifted the carpet up and the actual floorboard itself was wet. We then realised how extreme this was as urine had soaked all the way through to the joists. 'We couldn't understand how bad the hallway smelled until we cut two feet of plaster from the floor up in the hall.' She believes the former owner of the house, a prison officer, was leaving her animals unattended in the property during 12-hours shifts. She spoke to neighbours who said the two dogs - believed to be boxers - and three cats did not get out very often. The former owner allegedly told her that the property was 'a wee bit dodgy' but that she would make it 'immaculate' for them to move in. Richard Peters, a house surveyor working for Allied Surveyors Scotland, said he checked the property on October 21 last year. Ms Campbell points out where animal waste was left smeared against a wall . Marie Campbell and David Alonzi pictured outside the home they purchased - which they are say they cannot even live in . This picture, taken of the home as it was advertised in the estate agents' brochure, show it in perfect living condition prior to the sale . The living room looked modern, clean and tidy, prior to its alleged use as a dog run . The kitchen was also orderly prior to the damage caused by what was suspected to be animal waste . Pictured is the back section of the property, where building materials and animal-waste covered debris now lies . He said: 'It wasn't like that when I saw it. I would say at the time that there was no evidence of squelching underfoot or evidence of these horrible substances in accessible areas when I saw the house.' The couple have spent their life savings and say they cannot afford to live or fix the property properly - which they estimate would cost at least £10,000. The couple have now been forced to rent a flat for £500 each month, as they cannot move into the 'health hazard'. Scottish property law differs to that in the rest of the UK. Once a formal written offer has been accepted in writing, both parties are bound to the transaction by contract. Failure by one party to adhere to this written agreement, known as the 'missives' procedure, can mean they must pay the other party a hefty compensation fee. A sale contract is commonly known as 'concluded missives' - with the missives being the correspondence which completes the transaction. Across the rest of the UK, either party can withdraw from the transaction up until the point when a contract is officially signed. Ms Campbell said: 'I feel helpless because I can't do a thing. 'I just can't see myself ever settling in there after everything we've gone through with all the deception and lies we've been told. 'We are really struggling to do anything about this. We are currently renting a flat costing us £500 a month. 'We cannot move into this house in that condition, it's an absolute health hazard. 'Even after scrubbing the house for two weeks with enzyme cleaner and bleach, we couldn't get rid of the terrible smell.' Adrian King, of selling agent Remax, Dunfermline branch, added: 'The house was marketed by office and viewed and inspected by the purchaser who then preceded to purchase the property. 'Any deterioration in the property which may have occurred in the intervening period between the inspection and purchase, is a matter to be resolved between the respective purchasers, vendors and solicitors.' Kate McQuillan, understood to be the former owner, was not available for comment. Her solicitors sent a letter to the solicitors of Marie Louise Campbell and David Alonzi, which states: . ‘With regards to the carpets and floorboard, [Ms Quillian] is very upset at the allegation the dogs had been urinating through the whole house. ‘She offered to touch bits up in the kitchen where the dogs slept and your client told her not to bother. ‘Our client will not be meeting the cost of replacement floorboards. The caveat emptor applies.’","Couple devastated after their new home was left covered in animal waste .

"The US government is still unable to explain around five per cent of UFO sightings in its archives. Now one team of ‘alien hunters’ has dug up some of the best images to see if the public can shed light on the eerie glows, mysterious orbs and flying objects from the last few decades. Among them is a remarkable 1957 photo taken by a test pilot near Edwards Air Force Base in California, allegedly showing a UFO following a B-47 jet. Scroll down for video . In 1957 this picture was taken by a test pilot near Edwards Air Force Base in California. It shows a UFO allegedly following a B-47 jet . Another, released by the  Aerial Phenomena Group, shows three mysterious lights over the Manhattan skyline taken in 1984. It was taken by Philipe Orego from New Jersey, and researchers could find no sign of a hoax at the time. ‘A UFO picture tells a thousand lies,’ Nigel Watson author of the UFO Investigations Manual told DailyMail.com . ‘The basic problem is that if a UFO photograph is taken in daylight and looks close, clear and sharp, you suspect it is a fake. ‘If it is out-of-focus, distant and hard to define, then it can be a picture of anything in the sky - from an insect, bird to a balloon or drone. ‘The pictures here don’t seem to be faked but each has its own story to tell. With old pictures, blobs or spots can appear due to the way the film is developed or mishandled in the processing stage. ‘ . On the right is an image taken by Felippe Orego showing three lights over the Manhattan skyline, New York, on May 9, 1984. The left image, allegedly showing a UFO, was taken in Ward, Colorado in 1929 . Searchlights focus on an unidentified object over Los Angeles on February 25, 1942. The bright dots around the flashes are anti-aircraft shells exploding . The picture on the left was taken on New Year's Day in 1939 with unidentified object appearing in the top left. The right image shows a picture of a UFO taken somewhere in the US on June 10, 1964, and was discovered in an attic a number of years later . Watson said that a good case to illustrate this point is the image of the UFO over Los Angeles. In February 1942, fears of a Japanese air raid and invasion struck LA. On 23 February, a Japanese submarine allegedly shelled the Elwood Oil Field near Goleto, north of Los Angeles. In the early hours of 25 February, a fleet of mystery aircraft were seen heading for the city. Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall reported in a memorandum to President Roosevelt dated 26 February 1942 that as many as 15 airplanes may have been involved. Although 1430 rounds were expended by the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade’s anti-aircraft guns no aircraft was hit or shot down and no bombs were dropped by the aircraft. The only conclusion was that commercial aircraft were used by enemy agents to determine the location of anti-aircraft guns and to spread alarm. ‘This invasion scare became the subject of Steven Spielberg’s high-rolling comedy movie ‘1941’ (1979) that shows how fear ensnares people in a web of obsession and conflict fuelled by rumours and the media,’ said Watson. ‘The lasting evidence of the craft was a photograph of a ‘wigwam’ of searchlights converging on an unidentified aircraft over Culver City.’ An analysis by UFO expert Dr Bruce Maccabee suggests that the object caught by the searchlight beams was 100 feet wide. In the summer of 1966, a flight official photographed two red spheres over the Swiss airport Zurich-Kloten. The photo was later released by Swiss Air pilot Ferdinand Schmid . On the left, Jack LeMonde, who served with the US Marine Corp, was photographed on horseback near the Pickwick Riding stables in Burbank, California on a June morning in 1945. A UFO can be see in the image to the right of the horse's ear. On the right a passenger on a plane from Hong Kong to southwest China claimed to have seen a 'UFO like flying object' outside the window of the plane in 2012 . Four brightly glowing, unidentified objects appeared in the sky at 9:35 am.on July 15, 1952 over a parking lot in Salem, Massachusetts . The US Condon Committee examined many UFO photographs, and concluded that such cases should be selected and analysed according to the following criteria: . How clear is the photograph? Does it present evidence of something unusual after astronomical, meteorological, photographic and optical effects are ruled out? Could it be to misinterpretation? Are light and shadows in the photograph consistent? If a film camera is used, has the negative been tampered with? Is the sharpness and focus of the picture in agreement with the visual observations? Are the time intervals of a set of photographs consistent with the witness testimony? Does the focus and contrast agree with the given distance of the object? Can the size and distance of the UFO be discerned with reference to objects either in front of, or behind the UFO? Steven Lacey, another UFO believer, using Photoshop cleared up the image to reveal an image of a classic flying saucer. This made him conclude that this image is ‘a very convincing argument for the presence of alien craft in our skies.’ ‘In contrast, aviation historian Brett Holman puts forward a convincing case that the searchlights are converging on a small cloud rather than a UFO or extra-terrestrial battlecruiser,’ said Watson. ‘And, he has found other examples of antiaircraft searchlights illuminating clouds that look like flying saucers. ‘A UFO picture certainly says more than a thousand words, but it still depends on our prejudices and expectations to decide whether it depicts something extraordinary or mundane.’ A number of 'closed' cases were also recently revealed by the US government who opened its files into 12,000 encounters with UFOs spanning between 1947-1969. Microfilms of these cases, collectively known as Project Blue Book, have become available for anyone to view online. One of the most famous is the Lubbock Lights incident, which was reported on August 30, 1951 in Texas by three professors. The witnesses were sitting in the backyard of one of the professor's homes when they saw 20 to 30 'lights' fly overhead. One of the professors said the objects 'appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate and they were greenish-blue, slightly fluorescent in colour. 'They were smaller than the full moon at the horizon. There were about a dozen to fifteen of these lights...they were absolutely circular...it gave all of us...an extremely eerie feeling.' The USAF concluded that these lights were most likely caused by birds named plovers, which have white breasts that can reflect lights from cities below. Another image, titled simply 'Winter 1951', shows what the photographer believed to be a flying saucer. However, scientists discovered that the eerie shape was a lenticular cloud which are created by moist air that has condensed at a high altitude.

"The man accused of driving a souped-up Mustang that killed two men during an illegal street race in California was charged with murder - but an Instagram video may prove he wasn't at the wheel. Henry Gevorgyan was charged with two counts of murder today in connection with an illegal car race that was held on February 25 in Los Angeles. Gevorgyan, 21, turned himself in to authorities on Saturday and is being held on $2million bail. Scroll down for video . Henry Gevorgyan was charged with two counts of murder today after turning himself in over the weekend . Police say his souped-up gray Ford Mustang killed Eric Siguenza, 26, and 50-year-old Wilson Wong . Siguenza (pictured left) was killed when the Mustang (right) crashed during the race in LA on February 25 . The suspect is accused of killing Eric Siguenza, 26, and Wilson  Wong, 50, when his gray Ford Mustang went out of control during the race in the Chatsworth section of the San Fernando Valley. A third man who has not been identified was seriously injured. Gevorgyan and another driver fled the scene after the crash, according to police. When Gevorgyan surrendered over the weekend at the Los Angeles Police Department's Central Division station, his lawyer Kate Hardie was with him, the LA Times reported. Hardie said: 'He's terrified. 'He wants to do the right thing and come forward.' She called her client a 'very nice kid' and said he is blameless for what happened because he was not behind the wheel of the Mustang when the crash occurred. A video posted on Instagram by Valley Racing may back up her claim. According to Hardie, a video of the race shows Gevorgyan standing between the two cars at the starting line and then flagging the start of the race with a flashlight. A video of appears to show a man who could be Gevorgyan standing between the two cars at the race . After he is seen at the starting line, the man flags the drivers to start the race using a flashlight in one hand . The video has been shared on social media. Some have been using the hashtag #FreeHendo with photos of Gevorgyan's face. Gevorgyan has never been arrested before. Before the charges were filed, LAPD officers  said they were aware of the video. If Gevorgyan is convicted, he could face 33 years to life in prison. The other alleged driver has not been located. Before charges were filed, officers with the LAPD's Valley Traffic Division said they were aware of the video . Though it's in a commercial area, the crash's location has been used for illegal races for quite some time . The street where the crash happened is mainly deserted after dark and has long been used for illegal nighttime street races. Capt. John McMahon, commanding officer of the LAPD's Valley Traffic Division, told CNN that people should be aware that street racing is a dangerous activity. He said: 'Many view this as an entertainment, glamorous activity. 'I think it's important for the public to know that this is illegal, dangerous and an all too deadly activity.'","Henry Gevorgyan, 21,  was charged with two counts of murder today .

"Robin Thicke’s monster hit Blurred Lines has made a profit of more than $16 million since it became the biggest song of 2013, an L.A. court heard on Tuesday. The song, also created to Pharrell Williams and T.I., is currently at the center of a legal battle over copyright infringement and the song’s alleged similarity to Marvin Gaye’s 1977 funk/disco classic Got To Give It Up. The financial profitability of a song is typically a highly guarded secret and tends only to be revealed when the track is at the center of a $40 million lawsuit. Scroll down for video . We're in the money: Robin Thicke’s monster hit Blurred Lines, which also featured Pharrell Williams and T.I. has made a profit of $16,675,690 since it became the biggest song of 2013, an L.A. court heard on Tuesday . According to  the federal copyright trial, the two sides have agreed on an exact figure of $16,675,690. That was divided with $5,658,214 going to Thicke, $5,153,457 to Williams, $704,774 to rapper T.I. and record companies pocketing the remainder. During opening arguments in the case, Richard Busch, the attorney representing Marvin Gaye's children Frankie and Nona Gaye had tallied the alleged damages at approximately $40 million. Besides seeking profits — including a claimed $4 million from 50 percent of the publishing earnings of Blurred Lines — the Gayes are seeking damages for a reduction of the fair market value of the worth of licensing Got to Give It Up, reports The Hollywood Reporter. The singer’s children Frankie and Nona Gaye are also targeting touring money too, with about $11 million attributable to the song's success. Strangely, the Gayes filed the claim to counter a suit filed in August 2013 by Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell in which they asked a judge to declare that the song did not infringe on Gaye's copy written work. Changing story: Robin claims now he only said that he was inspired by Marvin Gaye's song to make it sound like he was involved in writing his hit, when in fact Pharrell did (seen here with model Emily Ratajkowski) Thicke is arguing that he didn't rip off Marvin Gaye's 1977 song Gotta Give It Up for mega hit Blurred Lines. Marvin is pictured here in 1983 - one year before his shooting death . The Gayes also claim that Thicke and his estranged wife Paula Patton's co-written track Love After War stole its sound from their father's song After the Dance. That song, according to more testimony brought home $895,374 in profits. Earlier in the trail, Thicke had entertained the court when he danced and played keyboard from the witness stand to show that a number of pop songs have the same chord progression including U2's With Or Without You,‎ Michael Jackson's Man In The Mirror and The Beatles' Let It Be. According to court papers filed last year, Thicke said he was high on painkillers and alcohol when Blurred Lines became a hit, and he exaggerated his contribution to writing the song. Thicke, 37, said in a deposition in April that he had been largely absent during the composition of Blurred Lines, due to being under the influence of opioid painkiller Vicodin mixed with alcohol. 'I had a drug and alcohol problem for the year and I didn't do a sober interview. So I don't recall many things that I said,' Thicke said in the deposition. He added that he was no longer taking Vicodin. The song was created by R&B artist and producer Pharrell Williams, who said in deposition two days before Thicke's that he had composed the melody and written the lyrics for the hit, and that Thicke had 'embellished' the origins of the song. The previously sealed depositions were filed in Los Angeles federal court in May in connection with a lawsuit by the estate of late soul singer Marvin Gaye against Thicke and Williams, accusing them of stealing from the Motown legend's 1977 song Got to Give it Up.","The 2013 monster hit Blurred Lines has made a profit of $16,675,690 since it was released .

There were lots of cars swamping the village and blocking the roads. 'It was quite a spectacle to see the culture of their community with so many people and the way they did things and the use of the horses. It was well worth seeing.

"The police officer at the centre of the notorious Downing Street 'Plebgate' incident has accepted £80,000 damages in settlement of his libel action against former chief whip Andrew Mitchell. The conclusion of Pc Toby Rowland's defamation case against the MP was announced at the High Court in London today. Last November Mr Mitchell, who vehemently denied using the word 'pleb', lost a high-profile action against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the Sun. Scroll down for video . Former government chief whip Andrew Mitchell, left, has agreed to pay Pc Toby Rowland, right, £80,000 in damages after the Conservative MP accused the police officer of lying in connection with Plebgate . Mr Mitchell wanted to be allowed to use the main vehicle gates at Downing Street with his bicycle . Mr Mitchell denied using the word 'pleb' but a High Court judge later accepted that he probably did . A judge then declared he had reached the 'firm conclusion' that Mr Mitchell had used the 'politically-toxic' word in September 2012 when he was not allowed to cycle through the main Downing Street vehicle gates. Pc Rowland's lawyer, Jeremy Clarke-Williams, told Mr Justice Warby that since that judgment Mr Mitchell 'has abandoned the other defences he had raised to my client's claim and consequently terms of settlement have been agreed'. The solicitor added: 'The payment of £80,000 damages by Mr Mitchell sets the seal on Pc Rowland's vindication, as well as providing compensation for the injury to his reputation and the distress caused to him and his family over many months.' Neither Mr Mitchell nor Pc Rowland was in court. Mr Clarke-Williams told the judge: 'Pc Rowland never felt that the events in Downing Street were anything more than a minor incident. 'He was not responsible for the publicity which followed and would have much preferred that the whole matter had never entered the public domain. 'He now simply wishes to be left in peace to continue his police career.' Andrew Mitchell, pictured, wanted to be routinely allowed through the main vehicle gate at Downing Street . Mr Clarke-Williams said Pc Rowland, a Metropolitan Police officer of 'long standing', is a member of the Diplomatic Protection Group whose duties include the security of Downing Street. Giving the background to the case, he said: 'The events which gave rise to this litigation have received so much publicity that I need say relatively little about them.' Pc Rowland 'was the officer who let Andrew Mitchell MP, together with his bicycle, out of the pedestrian gate from Downing Street into Whitehall' on the evening of September 19 2012. 'What exactly Mr Mitchell said to Pc Rowland as he left Downing Street became the crux of the so-called 'Plebgate' controversy,' the lawyer said. Two days after the incident 'Mr Mitchell phoned Pc Rowland and apologised to him for his behaviour at the gates'. Mr Clarke-Williams added: 'Pc Rowland accepted that apology and wishes that had been the end of the matter. 'However, unfortunately the conduct of other officers which Pc Rowland regarded as totally unacceptable led to an intensive police investigation, known as Operation Alice, within which all the relevant CCTV footage of the incident in Downing Street was examined, and PC Rowland was twice interviewed at some length.' On Saturday December 22 2012 Pc Rowland was 'identified by name and photograph in the Mail Online website, and then in the Mail on Sunday newspaper the next day, as the police officer who had dealt with Mr Mitchell at the gates of Downing Street' on September 19. 'Consequently, all the accusations made after that date by Mr Mitchell about the police officer who dealt with him were understood to refer to Pc Rowland.' The solicitor continued: 'My client had hoped that Operation Alice would serve to vindicate him and so stayed his hand on any action against Mr Mitchell until the announcement of the result by the DPP, Ms Alison Saunders, on November 26 2013. 'Her statement said that whilst a number of officers were to face - and were subsequently convicted of - criminal and disciplinary charges, the position of Pc Rowland was quite different. 'The DPP stated that there was no evidence to justify proceedings against him.' Mr Clarke-Williams added: 'However, on the very same day as the DPP's announcement, Mr Mitchell held a televised press conference accusing Pc Rowland of having lied in his account of what Mr Mitchell had said at the gates of Downing Street and implying he should have been prosecuted. 'These allegations comprehensively undermined the vindication of Pc Rowland by Operation Alice. 'It left Pc Rowland with no option but to bring these defamation proceedings.' The trial in November took place before Mr Justice Mitting to 'establish precisely what had been said at the Downing Street gates in the exchange between Pc Rowland and Mr Mitchell'. Mr Clarke-Williams told Mr Justice Warby that Mr Justice Mitting had reached the 'firm conclusion' that Mr Mitchell had spoken the words alleged 'or something so close to them as to amount to the same', including the politically-toxic word pleb. The lawyer said: 'This judgment put the true position beyond argument.' It is understood that the issue of legal costs has yet to be determined. Mr Mitchell has already paid the £80,000 damages to Mr Rowland. He has also been ordered to pay £325,000 in legal costs prior to a full hearing on the issue. It is understood that Mr Mitchell's legal team will enter negotiations with the lawyers representing Pc Rowland and The Sun before a court ruling on costs which could exceed £1million.

"Vladimir Putin today demanded an end to 'shameful' political assassinations in the wake of the shooting of a Kremlin critic last week. Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, was gunned down as he walked with his Ukrainian girlfriend on Friday night near Red Square. He was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in Russia during Putin's 15-year rule. The Kremlin has denied any involvement, saying that the killing was a 'provocation' designed to discredit Putin and strengthen his opponents. Scroll down for video . Russian President Vladimir Putin attends an Interior Ministry board meeting in Moscow, where he called for an end to the 'shame' of political killings which have plagued the Kremlic in recent years . Gunned down: Nemtsov (left) and his 23-year-old model girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya (right) were walking through Moscow after having dinner on Friday night when he was shot four times in the back . But Nemtsov's friends say the Kremlin is to blame for fomenting an atmosphere of hatred towards its opponents. In a speech during a meeting with officials from the interior ministry, Putin said: 'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext. 'Russia should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen. 'I mean the murder, the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital.' Law enforcement officials have said one lead they were exploring was that the killing was linked to Nemtsov's personal life or business dealings. Putin's comments indicated that version is now being discarded. Authorities have not made any arrests. Honoured: People  applaud as workers carry the coffin of Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov during a ceremony at the Sakharov centre in Moscow, where his body was laid in state after he was shot dead on Friday . Goodbye: Nemtsov's mother Dina Eidman, his secretary Inna Krolyova and daughter Dina (from left to right) pay their last respects at the mourning ceremony . Earlier on Wednesday, the director of Russia's Federal Security Service said that an investigation had identified several suspects, without giving details. Russian news agencies reported that investigators were seeking a car in connection to the killing that may be connected to the finance ministry. The ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters that the car, a Ford, does not belong to the ministry itself but was owned by a state enterprise which provides security to government institutions, including the finance ministry. The vehicle drove past the spot where Nemtsov was shot after the killing and when police patrol cars had already arrived at the scene, the statement said. Thousands of Russians yesterday paid their final respects to Nemtsov  when he was laid to rest in the capital. The politician's mother Dina, 87, and four children laid him to rest, with ex-UK prime minister Sir John Major leading Western mourners attending his funeral.","PM says Russia 'should be devoid of tragedies with a political subtext'

"Those hoping to live out their 90s fantasies and become a modern-day Fresh Prince of Bel Air can now do just that in this stunning mansion - as long as they've got $22million to spare. The 32-room house is certainly not to be sniffed at, with 10 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms - not to mention a waterslide which takes you from inside the house straight into one of the two pools. But that's not all you get for the eye-watering asking price - which equates to £14,212,800. Scroll down for video . Eye-watering: Those with a spare $22million can purchase this two-storey, 32-room home . Lavish: The mansion was built in 2009, and has enough gold leaf and chandeliers to put Versailles to shame . Opulent: Guests can be entertained in splendor in one of the many rooms of the home . Water feature: This slide begins indoors - so the new owner can get to the pool without going outside first . Indeed, this glamorous mansion actually puts the one featured in hit comedy The Fresh Prince to shame. For a start, that house only has five bedrooms and just one pool and is only worth an estimated $8,391,854. What's more, it isn't even in Bel Air, but in the similarly affluent neighboring Brentwood - once home to the likes of Anna Nicole Smith and Arnold Schwarzenegger. In contrast, Bel Air was once the home of Elizabeth Taylor. Built just six years ago in 2009, the mansion's décor echoes the Palace of Versailles with huge chandeliers, mirrors and gold leaf from ceiling to floor. What's more, just like the Banks family home in the 90s sitcom, the house is covered in marble and has its own gym. And for those who don't fancy climbing the sweeping staircase to the home's second floor to one of the four main bedrooms, there is a lift. Tired: The sweeping staircase leads to the four main bedrooms in the house - although there is a lift as well . Choices: There are two 'lagoon-style' pools to chose from in this 6,767 square metre property . Top of the range: The kitchen - which is suitably sumptuous - is fitted out with Meile appliances . Space: The new owner will be able to relax in style with rooms looking out over the garden . Stunning: The house also boasts views out across the exapnse of Los Angeles . Secluded: The home is behind electric gates, which means the owner can relax easily . Each of the four main bedrooms comes with its own individually designed bathroom, while the kitchen is filled with top-of-the-range Miele appliances. It also boasts a 'grotto-style' spa and a racquetball court, and a five bedroom pool house so guests can enjoy their own taste of luxury in the comfort of their own space. However, it does have one definite downside: the listing bizarrely boasts that it also comes with a 'mother-in-law'. Exclusive: The house is in one of Los Angeles' most expensive areas  - an area once home to Elizabeth Taylor . Platial: The architect and designer have used gold leaf and copious amounts of marble throughout . Empty: The mansion's wine cellar is ready and waiting to be filled with the finest vintages . Room: The pool house alone boasts five bedrooms - which means there is plenty of space for guests . Exercise: If the pools and racquet courts are not to your fancy, you can try out the home's private gym . Individual: Each of the four bedrooms gets its own uniquely designed bathroom, like this one . A spokesperson for LuxuryEstate.com, which is selling the property, said: 'This house is fit for royalty. The master suite boasts large closets, a spa-styled tub and gorgeous views of the backyard. 'It's ideal for large scale entertaining and has panoramic city to ocean views as well as manicured lawns. 'The house provides an unmatched feeling of luxury and perfection.'

"Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush already has so much capaign cash in a super PAC that supports him has reportedly asked his biggest donors to limit themselves to giving $1 million each. At least during the current fundraising quarter that ends March 31. Insiders told The Washington Post that Bush is telling his super-wealthy supporters to put a cap for the moment on the high-dollar checks they write to his Right to Rise super PAC. Super PACs can collect unlimited money from individuals and corporations, and spend it to support candidates, as long as there's no 'coordination' with their campaigns when the spending happens. Bush reportedly met with a group of powerful financiers in New York in the final days before he decided to launch the PAC. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . SLOW DOWN: Jeb Bush's inner circle is reportedly telling high-dollar donors to set a $1 million cap on their donations during the first 2015 fundraising quarter . RETAIL CAMPAIGNING: Bush is trying to do his share of meet-and-greet events with ordinary people, like this group he addressed Monday in Las Vegas, so Americans don't think of him as another Mitt Romney . Bush advisers, the Post reported, are becoing concerned that the former Florida governor mgiht get a reputation as a tool of big business and the rich, and want instead to stress his independence and ties to far more small-dollar contributors. The perception that 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was a detached, wealthy candidate who identified most with America's '1 per cent' was among the factors leading to his defeat. The PAC's first campaign finance report is due to the Federal Election Commission on April 15, and the story it tells may determine whether Bush's expected candidacy is plagued with similar accusations. Bush is expected to turn in a report showing tens of millions of dollars collected. Almost no one else in the potential Republican field is thought to have the capacity to match his fundraising juggernaut. New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump is one exception. His own wealth could fund a super PAC independently, but a Trump aide has told Daily Mail Online that he would embrace a retail campaigning strategy as well. 'This campaign is about much more than money,” GOP fundraiser Howard Leach told the Post. 'They need substantial funds, but they don’t want the focus to be on money.' Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and declined to offer a statement to the Post. The Post noted that some of the $1 million donors are likely to becoe repeat contributors once Bush's campaign is formally launched. Big names Bush has visited on fundraising swings include Las Vegas casino legend Steve Wynn. He's in the middle of an aggressive national criss-cross designed to bulk up his campaign cofferd in what his aides have described as a 'shock and awe' campaign. Its success could discourage others with less access to big money from running against him. MONEY TROUBLE: FOrmer House Speaker Newt Gingrich, seen las tmonth at the COnservative Political Action Conference, was criticized in 2012 for taking $15 million for his super PAC from a casino magnate . SUPER PAC: Bush's political action committee can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals and corporations . Romney's super PAC raised $12 million in the first fundraising period after it was launched during the last election cycle. Bush's effort could dwarf that. But casino money has gotten at least one Republican presidential candidate in trouble before. In 2012 former House Speaker Newt Gingrich got a public black eye because of a $15 million cash infusion from gambling titan Sheldon Adelson. In that same year, the Post notes, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum benefited from large donations made by investor Foster Friess. Santorum is expected to run again in 2016. The Bush circle's caution to their richest contacts 'shows they are disciplined and appreciate that the dominance of a few key people early on is not a productive thing for the campaign or for Jeb Bush,' Republcian fundraiser Rick Hohlt told the Post.","The Washington Post reports insiders say Bush doesn't want to give Americans the impression that he'll be beholden to the super-rich .
He hasn't yet announced his candidacy but launched a super PAC that will support him if and when he runs for president .

According to Ms Parrott, the couple, who has been engaged for two years, made the best out of the situation. '[They] did not lose the romance of it,' she told Daily Mail Online in an email. 'He braided her hair while sitting on a wool blanket laid on the floor of the waiting room next to the bathroom.' She added: 'The tram had no real emergency plan and [we] were worried we would be there all night.'

But Mr Edelhoff, who didn't get off the mountain until 10:30pm, said the tram needs a better emergency plan in place. 'There was a pregnant woman up there. There were children that were getting cold and hungry,' he said. 'They need to be more accommodating.'

Although Sandia Peak tramway's website does warn that 'weather conditions can change quickly in the mountains and that certain conditions may cause the tramway to close without notice', Ms Parrot agreed that the tram should be better prepared. 'One of the employees told us as we were going down that they were about to run out of water up there for the toilets and drinking water supply,' she said in her email.

"With their intoxicating spices and complex flavours, Indian curries are enjoyed the world over. Now, in a study of more than 2,000 recipes, scientists have discovered the secret behind curry's popularity on a molecular level. They claim that unlike Western dishes that tend to pair similar flavours together - such as beer and beef - Indian dishes use at least seven ingredients that do not contain overlapping flavours. Scroll down for video . With their intoxicating spices and complex flavours, Indian curries are enjoyed the world over. Now, in an analysis of more than 2,000 popular recipes, scientists have discovered the secret behind curry's popularity on a molecular level . Researchers at the Indian Institute for Technology in Delhi looked at how often overlapping flavour compounds were used in a dish's ingredients. They reviewed of recipes on TarlaDalal.com, studying the subtle molecular-level differences that distinguish the cuisine, according to a report in the Washington Post. 'We found that average flavour sharing in Indian cuisine was significantly lesser than expected,' researchers wrote. The study found that ingredients such as garam masala and bell peppers are usually teamed up with other ingredients that have no chemical similarity. Out of the 381 cooking ingredients in the world, the research team from that Indian food used 200 in their cuisine. 'Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients,' the researchers said . This is in contrast to Western dishes that share like flavours. Chefs, for instance claim that seemingly incongruous ingredients, such as chocolate and blue cheese, can taste good together because they share similar compounds. A spice commonly used in curry could help erase bad memories, according to a study. Curcumin, a bright-yellow compound found in the root of the Indian spice turmeric, prevented new fear memories being stored in the brain, and also removed pre-existing fear memories, researchers found. It is hoped that the findings will help develop treatments for people suffering with psychological disorders. Psychologists from The City University of New York trained rats to become scared when they heard a particular sound. Scientists assumed the creatures were frightened when they froze. Hours later, when the same sound was played to the rats, those who had been given ordinary food froze. Yet the rats fed the curcumin-rich diet didn't freeze, suggesting their fearful memories had been erased. An example is acetal, which can be found in whiskey, apple juice, orange juice and raw beets. Strawberries, meanwhile, have flavour compounds that match white wine. In Indian dishes, the more overlap two ingredients have in flavour, the less likely they are to appear in the same Indian dish, the scientists said. Researchers believe this makes the dish more tasty as the ingredients each bring their own unique flavour to the dish, rather than simply blending in. Out of the 381 cooking ingredients in the world, the research team from that Indian food uses 200 in their cuisine. 'Each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavour sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients,' the researchers said. Previous research has found curry could actually be good for you, easing arthritis and even protecting people from Alzheimer's. Most curries contain turmeric, cumin, allspice, cardamon, ginger, garlic and capsicum - spices with strong anti-bacterial properties. This is largely why they're found in dishes from hot countries, where meat needs to be preserved. Separate studies have found that garlic, cinnamon and cumin can destroy up to 80 per cent of meat-borne bacteria, while ginger can slow bacterial growth by 25 per cent.","Scientists studied the chemical compounds in 2,000 Indian dishes .

"He is passionate about conservation and was in China's Yunnan Province to highlight the plight of the region's wild elephants and to call for an end to the ivory trade. But as Prince William was feeding treats to rescue elephant Ran Ran, just a few miles away, other animals were living in conditions that campaigners describe as 'dingy' and with their legs encased in chains. Filmed having their trunks sat upon by visitors by a Sky News camera crew, the elephants are displayed in twice-daily shows at the the Xishuangbanna Wild Elephant Valley park. Scroll down for video . Conservation: William met Ran Ran the rescue elephant during a visit to China's Yunnan Province . However, when the prince was asked about the 'cruel' performances taking place just down the road, he turned away, saying nothing. Later, he did speak about the plight of China's elephants, although he once again steered clear of discussing the circus, which is on the same site as the sanctuary he was visiting. 'It is appalling that elephants and many others may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes, and we seem to be hurtling towards the tragic outcome,' he said. 'The extinction of animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins would be an immeasurable loss to the whole of humanity.' But his efforts risk being overshadowed by the controversy over the visit, with Kensington Palace saying they were aware of the existence of the circus beforehand. Performance: The elephants were filmed being made to perform circus tricks for crowds of tourists . Chained: Campaigners say the elephants live in dingy pens between performances . There, say campaigners, the wretched performing elephants, many of which have had their tusks filed down, are trained to give rides and kick footballs around an arena. Some are even trained to dance to disco music and form a pyramid during shows that take place four times a day. Between their ‘performances’ they are chained by their legs in dingy pens. Kensington Palace, however, said that while it was aware of the issues, the focus of the visit was for Prince William to learn more about the region’s conservation efforts and engage with the positive work being done. The nature reserve says its elephants are from Thailand and not from the local wild population. Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of the Tusk Trust of which William is patron, defended the prince's decision to visit the park. 'Different cultures have different ways of doing things, of course it's not the way we do things,' he said. 'But you know I think today was very much about highlighting the illegal wildlife trade - this trip for him in terms of conservation has been about watching, listening, learning about the challenges faced by conservationists here in China.' Dressed up: The animals are also made to wear bizarre versions of human clothing such as glasses . Exposed: The performance was filmed by a camera crew from Sky News . Aware: Kensington Palace said they knew of the circus before the visit took place . The prince, who began the day at the Xishuangbanna Natural Nature Reserve, had been hopeful of seeing some of the animals in their natural habit - the last tropical rainforest in China which hosts some 250 wild Asian elephants - 90 per cent of its wild elephant population. Apparently unbothered by the 33C heat, the prince climbed 200 or steps up to a wooden viewing platform. Sadly for William, there were none to be seen, although it was a different story when he arrived at the sanctuary to meet Ran Ran. 'You're going to get indigestion', smiled the prince as he fed the elephant handful after handful of carrots - much to both her and his delight. The visit was designed to highlight the prince's conservation work - and raise awareness of the need to end the illegal trade in ivory. A royal source has said that during William's talks with China's President Xi Jinping earlier this week wildlife protection and the illegal trade in ivory were raised and that he was pleased by Chinese leader’s pledges to clamp down on the industry. Criticism: His visit was overshadowed by controversy about a nearby elephant circus . Saved: Ran Ran was discovered in a river in 2005 with terrible injuries caused by a poacher's trap . Performing: According to campaigners, other elephants nearby live in chains and are made to perform tricks . In a speech before he flew back to Britain, William described the greatest threat to elephants worldwide today as the ‘ruthless and organised poaching and trafficking’ industry. He said: 'It is appalling that elephants – and many others – may be extinct in the wild in our lifetimes, and that we seem to be hurtling towards that tragic outcome. 'The illegal wildlife trade is therefore our common enemy. It is a vicious form of criminality: plundering the natural resources of poorer countries, taking lives, hindering development and spreading corruption. It erodes the rule of law, fuels conflict, and may even fund terrorism. 'Traffickers think nothing of violating laws and sovereignty anywhere they can to exploit a loophole or turn a profit. And international cooperation is our strongest defence against them.' 'I think what we've just heard is a really powerful speech appealing to the Chinese people following on from a very constructive meeting that I gather he had with the president on this issue,' added Mr Mayhew afterwards. 'Just think about it, in the last four months he has raised this issue not only with the president of China but the president of United States - I don't know anybody else who has managed to do that in years.' Aware: Kensington Palace said they were aware of the proximity of the circus before the trip . Not talking: The prince did not take questions on the circus but later emphasised the need for conservation . Ivory: China's elephants have been decimated by the ivory trade - something William hopes to change . Getting the locals on side: He also met local villagers, who sometimes come into conflict with elephants .","The prince was visiting an elephant sanctuary and met Ran Ran .

"It is the favourite winter holiday of the middle and upper classes - a week in a European ski resort, with days spent exploring the mountain slopes and evening tucking in to local food. But for some, the time spent at some of the highest spots in Europe is focused more on drinking, sex and partying into the small hours. Welcome to the Andorran resort of Pas De La Casa, where it seems holidays are all about boarding, bargain booze and budget holidays. Scroll down for video . Pas De La Casa is all about boarding, bargain booze and budget holidays . Channel 5 documentary Brits on the Piste has looked in to the antics of the workers who spend the winter season in the mountains and the holidaymakers who visit. And the series, currently airing, has proved so popular that viewing figures doubled over the first two episodes. With Pas De La Casa having the reputation as having the one of the best nightlife scenes of any ski resort, it's certainly an eye-opening experience. The four main bars, that are packed out during ski season, are The Milwaukee, Underground, Paddy's Bar and The Shamrocks. From downing shots in the bars, to having an early morning skiing lesson with 'Dreadlock Dave' and partying with DJ Craig, the 'Pete Tong of Pas', all things are covered. And it's not just the visitors behaving badly. The 30 or so British workers at the resort will often drink and part as much as the tourists, with one worker admitting she will have about '20 shots' while working behind the bar. Fellow barman Danny admits that in the previous season he slept with 15 girls, but says he is aiming for 22-25 this season. Despite the cold weather, there's always time to take to the Jacuzzi, and these tourists from Wales take the plunge . Following a night on the tiles, it wouldn't be wise to miss your early morning ski lesson with 'Dreadlock Dave,' pictured here with bar worker Beth . It seems skiing is not particularly high on the agenda for visitors, despite the high costs of booking winter holidays. Two lively party girls from Ireland find themselves on holiday for five days longer than they planned in episode three, while competitive Craig organises an alcohol-fuelled snowman-building competition, and three hungover resort workers go heli-skiing. 'We were meant to book it for five days,' say the two Irish visitors. 'But we hit the wrong button on Ryanair and we're here for ten.' 'Everyone keeps saying to us 'you're total p*******s and you're not going to make the slopes,' but realistically probably all we'll make is one day on the slopes.' Group trips are particularly popular at the bargain resort. Fierce drinking battles between Team Essex and Team Bournemouth - a groups of friends who had swapped sand for snow to party hard - take place in the resort's bars. Both sides of life at the ski resort are show here, from necking beers and shots on a wild night out, to a moment of romance as Joe proposes to his girlfriend Michelle on the slopes . A group of party animals from Yorkshire get into the spirit to celebrate one of their birthdays . Meanwhile three brothers from Kidderminster, who are travelling to the resort for the first time without their parents, are under no illusions what they're there for. Engineer Scott, 19, says: 'This year we're allowed to go mental, completely mental. Just go out there and get smashed, every night, just drink hard and ski harder.' Twenty bottles of Jägermeister and a further 20 of vodka are sold every night in the resort's bars, so it's little wonder party animals flood the venue. The resort is very male-dominant, with 95 per cent of those who stay there being men. And where alcohol and pride is concerned, this can lead to a tense atmosphere at time. Episode four shows how things can take a turn for the worst as skiing takes a back seat for most of the holidaymakers, replaced with drinking, vomiting and fighting. A group of lads from Leeds talk through how the drinking games fit into skiing. This pair from Essex are forced to show their drinking prowess when they come up with some rival holiday-goers from Bournemouth . 'If you fall over it's a shot, if you fall over coming off a ski-lift that's two shots, if you mack (take) somebody out that's a pint,' says Byron. 'If you're sick that's five shots,' adds his friend Johnny. 'It's just a vicious circle basically.' The show also explores those much-discussed resort relationships, from bar workers Danny from Paddy's and Milwaukee's Beth. Despite being on, off and then on again, the pair work out how they are going to surprise each other for Valentine's Day. And in the latest offering, the other side of life at the ski resort is revealed when Joe from Stevenage pops the question to his girlfriend Michelle, complete on bended knee in the snow. Brits on the Piste is shown on 5* and the next episode is Sunday, March 8 at 11pm.","Documentary claims resort is about bargain booze and budget holidays .

"A famous Thai temple has apologised after finding itself at the centre of an international row for reportedly banning Chinese tourists from its new toilet. The tourists were said to have disgusted other visitors to Wat Rong Khun – The White Temple – by urinating on walls and defecating on the floor. The complaints were believed to have prompted a decision by the temple’s owner that new toilet facilities due to open would be made unavailable for Chinese tourists, according to People’s Daily. But, responding to online criticism, owner Chalermchai Kositpipat – who stressed he is ‘three quarters Chinese but cannot speak the language’ – said everyone would be allowed to use the new facilities. The White Temple's beautiful setting is kept pristine for the thousands who visit all year round . The temple is actually a privately-owned art exhibit designed to resemble a Buddhist temple . Wat Rong Khun, one of the most popular tourist spots for Chinese tourists in Thailand, is situated in Chiang Rai. It is better known as The White Temple due to its stunning all-white exteriors. And, keen to remain whiter-than-white, the temple had become concerned with reports that foul messes left behind by a minority of guests had made it difficult for others to use the toilets. Chalermchai Kositpipat said the temple originally had two bathrooms and had recently built a third one about 200 metres away from its popular 'golden toilet', reported China Daily. All tourists are now free to use any of the bathrooms, continued the report. Embarrassed Chalermchai Kositpipat attempted to deflect criticism by pointing out he has three-quarters Chinese blood. His father originally comes from Guangdong and his mother is Thai-Chinese. Although he can’t speak Chinese, he remembers the Chinese name his father has given him, which reads Qi Longcai. 'I don’t have any intention to look down upon Chinese,' said the owner. ‘As Chinese, I hope we can all strive to ensure that we travel with manners.' The temple's owner has invested huge sums of his money into renovations but does not charge entry fees . The temple was nearly demolished when it was affected by an earthquake in May 2014 . Chalermchai Kositpipat designs the temple himself - and the state-of-the-art bathrooms are a tourist attraction in their own right. While the temple closed its bathrooms temporarily to Chinese tourists on February 3, it has been opened since. The ‘White Temple incident’, as it was dubbed by Chinese media, caught the attention of government officials as well as the press in both China and Thailand. Governmental functions such as The Ministry of Tourism and Sports have stressed repetitively that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists. Chinese-language pamphlets and guidebooks are available in many tourist attractions, such as The Grand Palace. The news also sparked debate within Thailand. According to People’s Daily, some Thai netizens expressed anger towards the rude behaviour of Chinese tourists, while others thought they should keep a tolerant mind. Li Liangcheng, the Minister of Thailand-China Tourism Association, said the arrival of Chinese tourists has brought considerable income and that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists. Mr Li also encouraged Chinese tourists to understand the local customs and laws.","Chinese tourists accused of urinating on walls and defecating on floors .

"Children born in the summer should be allowed to start school later in the year if they struggle with lessons, an education minister has admitted. Nick Gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom, telling councils and headteachers to do 'what's in the best interests of the child'. It follows warnings from campaigners that some local authorities made it difficult for families who want to put off joining reception classes, raising the prospect of 250,000 children having to start in Year 1. Education minister Nick Gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom, telling councils and headteachers to do 'what's in the best interests of the child' The Department for Education issued guidance to schools and councils in July 2013 and last December making it clear that there is no rule stating that a child has to be in the right school cohort for their age group. Summer-born children can wait until the September after their fifth birthday if their parents feel they need more time to develop. And it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be 'no barrier' to the child then starting in reception class. The rule was introduced after research showed they were more likely to struggle at school, do worse in exams and have less chance of getting into university. But some councils are still sending youngsters straight into Year 1 if their parents hold them back unless they can prove there were 'exceptional' circumstances. In one high profile case, mother Rosie Dutton is fighting for her daughter to be allowed into reception class at school a year later after she decided to delay her education because she only turned four a few weeks before school started. Battle: Rosie Dutton, 30, is demanding her daughter Olivia is allowed into reception class after she chose to exercise her right to hold her back a year because she would have started just after turning four . Department for Education guidance allows parents to delay their child's schooling until the September after their fifth birthday. This policy, updated last spring, is designed to help children with birthdays between April 1 and August 31. This is because because experts believe they are more likely to struggle academically if they start school after just turning four. The Department for Education guidance says: ‘An increasing number of cases have come to the attention of the department and ministers in which parents, local authorities and admissions authorities have struggled to agree on the year group in which it is most appropriate for a summer-born child to start school. 'There are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class'. But some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into Year 1 to ease pressure on places in reception. Bracknell Forest Council says: ‘If you choose for your child not to start until their statutory school age... starting in a Reception class following a child’s fifth birthday is only possible in exceptional circumstances.’ Reading Borough Council warns: ‘You will need to apply for a place in Year 1. ‘However, the school may then be full because the places have been allocated to children in the previous school year.’ Olivia Dutton, from Staffordshire, was due to start primary school last September, weeks after her fourth birthday, but her parents decided to exercise their right to delay the start of her school life by 12 months. Mrs Dutton believes her daughter was 'not ready for school', and is furious her local council is now considering sending her straight into Year 1 because she was held back. Now she is fighting to allow Olivia to start in the reception class, and will hear if she has been successful in April. Mr Gibb told MPs that there had to be 'flexibility' from schools and councils when agreeing the start date for children who turn four just weeks before the start of the school year. Giving evidence to the education select committee, he said: 'The key thing is flexibility, and I think that admissions authorities and headteachers do need to do what's in the best interests of the child.' He added: 'If a child is very immature for their age and they are born in those summer months, and it's the very strongly held view of the parents that the child should start school in the following September, which is when the law says they should start, I think admissions authorities should be flexible and should do what's in the best interests of the child.' He stressed that councils mist include parents in discussions about when their children start school. But Michelle Melson, of the Summer Born Campaign, claimed that problems in arranging different school start times have worsened . She told the committee: 'We do have a compulsory school age in England, so children should be able to start at compulsory school age.' She added that summer-born babies who do start school after they are five are starting at compulsory starting age and should not miss out on reception by being placed straight into Year 1. 'Parents are being forced to enrol their child in school early, prior to compulsory school age, in order to have a reasonable chance of getting a place in their preferred schools.'","Nick Gibb says schools and councils must do the right thing for children .

"As many as 1,000 greyhounds a year are being exported from Australia to Asia and South America where they are injected with arsenic, cocaine, Viagra and methamphetamines to increase their aggression ahead of fight-to-the-death races. Just weeks after the live-baiting scandal rocked the dog racing industry - when the use of live pigs, possums and rabbits to train greyhounds and boost their aggression was exposed - a horrific and often unsanctioned international trade can also be revealed by Daily Mail Australia. The dogs, both young animals and those at the end of their racing lives, are shipped mostly to Macau, Hong Kong, Argentina and Chile where they are housed in appalling conditions. Scroll down for videos . Australian greyhounds in South America and Asia are fed a cocktail of drugs before being 'run to their death' according to animal welfare groups. This one-time Australian competitor died immediately after a race . Bloodsport. The horrid outcome of a match race in Argentina after two dogs pursue the lure to the end. Animal rights groups in South America say they often descend into a fight to the death . The Canidrome in Macau where many Australian dogs compete. Animals Australia says 'Macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and ... every dog imported to the country from Australia is dead within around three years' Although there are legal, strictly policed races, at the end of unofficial events the blood-thirsty animals often maul each other to death. If an animal finishes outside the top three in five consecutive races they are euthanised or dumped by the side of the road, where they starve to death. Argentina-based animal rights group Proyecto Galgo says that Australia and American dogs are particularly sought after in South America because of their superior pedigree. Animal protection groups have called for immediate government intervention, fearing that the crackdown on local trainers after the live-baiting scandal was exposed will lead to an increase in the black market trade to these gambling-loving countries. Australian dogs, along with those from the US and Ireland, are considered among the best in the world for both racing and breeding purposes, and are exported to countries which struggle to produce quality runners. In something akin to the barbaric scenes at cock-fighting rings or dog fights, activists say that at some tracks the greyhounds race in pairs down a straight, with frenzied punters packed either side, and the animals often maul each other at the end of a sprint. Animal protection groups in Argentina have joined the call for Australia's Federal Government to intervene, fearing that the crackdown on local trainers because of the live-baiting scandal, will lead to the 'black market' trade of Australian greyhounds gathering even more pace . Killing fields. These stomach churning images are published by animal protection groups as proof of the horrific lack of control over the fate of greyhounds in Asia . Freedom of Information documents obtained by Animals Australia from the Department of Agriculture and seen by Daily Mail Australia show only 20 dogs were officially registered as arriving from Australia in Argentina in the past two years. It's widely suspected that hundreds more have been exported through back channels. There is no information about the fates of these animals. 'Greyhounds here, including those from Australia, suffer a terrible fate,' claims an activist from Proyecto Galgos, who gave her name only as Ines. 'Here the situation is this; they use the galgos (greyhounds) in an exhaustive way. In one day, they can race in many places sometimes (and) are drugged with arsenic, cocaine, Viagra and methamphetamines. 'Sometimes they give them the drugs directly in their chest in the racing facilities. 'Many times they die in the racing facility. A racing galgo doesn't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs.' Some, she said, are saved for breeding but even then they are plied with reproductive drugs. 'That is the best scenario, but if they are no good at running, they are discharged on roads or left to die of starvation and in some cases they are killed.' 'Many times they die in the racing facility. A racing galgo doesn't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs' say animal rights groups in Argentina, who provided this image to show the level of neglect for a one-time racing dog . If they are no good at running, they are discharged on roads, or left to die of starvation, and in some cases they are killed' according to Proyecto Galgos from Argentina . With punting, legal and otherwise, a major past-time in parts of Argentina and Chile, exposing those who trade in the barbarism comes at a cost for groups like Proyecto Galgos, with members subjected to death threats on a regular basis. 'Here (in South America) they are used as merchandise, they are objects and when they aren't useful anymore they get rid of them,' Ines said. 'Sometimes they are sold and other times they change them for a chair or a television or anything.' Races are prohibited in two Argentinian regions, including the capital Buenos Aires and in Santa Fe. Cordoba is debating whether to shut down the industry too. While it is clear that many have previously been sent using official channels, through the control of authorities via a 'greyhound passport', there has been a crackdown on that process by governing bodies like Greyhounds Australasia. The exports, however, continue unabated. Lobbyists say just how so many end up in countries like Argentina and Korea (which is not on the official list) remains a mystery. Greyhounds Australasia CEO Scott Parker admitted that GA has no control of the greyhound export industry. ‘We have absolutely no idea of what dogs had gone where in the past six months because we are totally out of the loop,' he said. ‘It’s because of the lack of regulations, something we have stressed to the (Agriculture) Minister and hoped we’d get a meeting with him to discuss it but that hasn't eventuated as yet but we are still trying. Greyhound data shows some of Australia's best known runners have been sent through the correct channels over the years to spend their time in the breeding kennels in places like South America. Animal activists want tighter controls on exports by the Federal Government to ensure the future of all greyhounds . Lobbyists say not all dogs face the same fate, however, pointing to several examples over the years of top Australian greyhounds like this one being cared for in the correct manner by respected Argentinian studs . ‘The passport has no government regulatory standing but at least that enabled us to make sure they (greyhound owners) were doing the right thing . ‘Exporting Australian greyhounds without a GA issued passport is against the rules but some might take the risk knowing that government allows their export as long as the dogs are fit and well. ‘They enter into private arrangements and when someone says 100 have gone over in the past month, it’s out of our hands – a member of the public with no connection to the governing body can send them to anywhere in the world, if they want.’ He's also called on the Federal Government to put strong legislation behind 'the rules' of greyhound exports. There are examples of successful transitions; including star performers Bogie Ace and The Chief, who had top careers on the track in Australia and went on to have rewarding stud lives and were treated humanely. They, however, are rare examples. Up until now, authorities have been scrambling to keep on top of the shipping of Australian greyhounds to Asia, particularly Macau, for competition at the Yat Yuen Canidrome, but now revelations they are appearing with greater frequency in South America, has activists concerned. 'I think what’s clear is that the welfare of greyhounds is not a priority, these dogs come a distant second to profits on offer in this industry,' Lisa Chalk from Animals Australia said. 'In Australia, thousands of healthy dogs are killed simply because they don’t run fast enough and hundreds are exported overseas each year to countries that have no laws to protect them from cruelty. 'The country of greatest concern currently is Macau where dogs are raced at a facility called the Canidrome. 'They are kept in small cages when not racing and are killed if they fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races. 'Dogs sent to Macau from Australia are dead within three years. Greyhound racing in Macau is built around the supply of dogs from Australia which makes the situation all the more outrageous.' Advocates also warn that, many of the export countries (in Asia), are known for their huge illegal trade in dog meat for human consumption. 'Macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and the head of the Macau government’s animal control department has stated that every dog imported to the country from Australia is dead within around three years,' Ms Chalk added. 'Greyhounds Australasia has stopped issuing passports to allow greyhounds to be sent for racing but that hasn't stopped the export. 'It's time for the Australian Government to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether.' Animal advocates have called on the Australian Government 'to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether' to provide more protection for the animals. This is an example of a neglected pup in Argentina . The live-baiting scandal has led to more than 70 Australian trainers being implicated. Five Queensland greyhound trainers have already been banned for life . Animals Australia claim that 'greyhounds from Australia were killed at the Canidrome at a rate of more than one every day'. 'Nearly all of these dogs were healthy and not even five years old. All they had done wrong is fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races,' Ms Chalk said. 'With an ongoing supply of dogs from Australia, this unethical practice can continue, and is even threatening to expand.' Macau is the only place in China where greyhound racing is currently legal but that could soon be expanded. Her South American colleagues agree: 'The shortage of quality animals (in South America) means the exporting to places such as Argentina from Australia can be a profitable business.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Minister for Agriculture's office for comment.

"Cola-Cola has gotten rid of a Fanta advertisement that referred to the 1940s, the time period in which the drink was first produced in Germany, as 'the good old times.' The advertisement, which was broadcast in German, was in honor of Fanta's 75th anniversary and promoted a new drink recipe. The clip detailed how Fanta was created by the soda company's employees, because there were limited supplies available to produce Coke. Scroll down for video . Creation: Fanta was first created in Germany, when there were limited supplies available for producing Coke . The advertisement's voice-over narration said in German '75 years ago, resources for our beloved Coke in Germany were scarce. 'Employees at Coca-Cola - rather clever brainiacs - had to think of something and came up with a brilliant idea. 'From the scarcely available ingredients, such as whey and apple fibers, they simply developed a new drink.' Later on in the clip, the narrator said 'This German soda turns 75 years old.' 'And to celebrate this, we are bringing back the feeling of the ""Good Old Times"" with the new Fanta Classic.' The advertisement does not say that the drink was produced in Nazi Germany during WWII, the Express pointed out, when there were trade embargoes against the country. According to the newspaper, the advertisement enraged online commenters, one of whom reportedly said they were 'Speechless.' A Coca-Cola spokeswoman issued a statement to Daily Mail Online, which read 'We apologize for any offense caused by a video promoting our new Fanta Classic product in Germany. 'The new product is based on the original Fanta formula and the video was intended to evoke positive memories of many consumers over more than seven decades of Fanta brand history. 'Fanta was invented in Germany during the Second World War but the 75-year-old brand had no association with Hitler or the Nazi Party.'

"A Tory MP is refusing to repay hundreds of pounds in expenses for over-claiming his mileage - after the Commons watchdog checked his journeys on Google Maps. Backbencher Bob Blackman was found to have filed more than 700 claims for travel around his constituency that were either ‘inaccurate’ or not allowed under the rules. Some were said to be for up to five times the real distance after they were checked. But the Harrow East MP has refused to accept the conclusions, insisting he will hand back only £237 - despite being asked to repay more than £1,000. Backbencher Bob Blackman was found to have filed more than 700 claims for travel around his constituency that were either ‘inaccurate’ or not allowed under the rules . An appeal from the MP has now been rejected by Ipsa compliance officer Peter Davis on the basis that it ‘largely reiterated the points made by him in his original representations’. If Mr Blackman refuses to repay the £1,006.20 by next week, he could be hit with a £1,000 fine and legal action to retrieve the money from his salary. Mr Davis is also understood to be considering new evidence and has already warned he could extend his inquiry back further than January 2013 - potentially opening Mr Blackman up to a fresh bill. In his appeal, Mr Blackman condemned the findings as ‘arbitrary and draconian’ and designed to generate a ‘good headline for Ipsa’. He stressed he had apologised for £82.80 of travel to party political events, and was ‘extremely reluctantly’ ready to repay £97.65 for party political journeys even though Mr Davis had not ‘properly evaluated’ the situation. He said he would return another £56.70 for home to office travel because he could not produce ‘detailed evidence’ to support it. Parliament's reputation is till being dragged through the mud by controversial expense claims made by MPs . But Mr Blackman made clear he did not accept criticism of the distances he had claimed for. ‘I absolutely maintain that these routes are the most cost effective possible based on local traffic conditions and the need to ensure that journeys are of a predictable duration to arrive at the appointed time,’ he said. ‘My claims are provably compliant with the scheme so therefore you should withdraw your damaging and entirely unwarranted allegations at this juncture. ‘I understand that, having embarked on and publicly announced this investigation, it is in your personal interest to back up this decision with findings of wrongdoing that will generate a good headline for Ipsa. ‘Therefore I am sorry to report that I will absolutely be maintaining my innocence in this matter to my constituents, to the (Commons) Commission and on the floor of the House if necessary.’ Last month's provisional report from Mr Davis revealed that Ipsa officials wrote to Mr Blackman in October 2011 voicing concern that he was putting in for ‘around twice the average for constituency mileage across the UK and some six times higher than other suburban London area constituencies where mileage is claimed’. Commons officials checked Mr Blackman's claims on Google maps . The watchdog triggered an initial investigation by its compliance officer in December 2012, with Mr Blackman being told: ‘A comparison of your claims against the distances quoted by Google Maps would suggest a pattern of over-claiming. On average, your claims are almost twice the distance shown on Google Maps and in some cases significantly more.’ A two-mile journey from his home to Harrow Weald had been claimed as 10 miles, while a five-mile return trip to Stanmore was filed as 15 miles. After a discussion with Mr Blackman, Mr Davis declined to launch a full-blown investigation, instead deciding the issue could be dealt with through ‘support and advice from Ipsa to ensure the MP improved his record-keeping’. However, an audit in 2013-14 found that Mr Blackman had again racked up the highest mileage of any MP. He claimed more than 400 miles per square mile of his constituency, almost double the average for the next 10 highest-claiming MPs. A 33-mile return journey to the new Tottenham Hotspur training ground in Enfield was claimed as 54 miles - although the MP later admitted this was a mistake and the figure should have been 39 miles. The compliance officer this time launched a formal probe - but only looked at claims made after his meeting with the MP in January 2013. He found that Mr Blackman had merely reduced standard claims for regular journeys by a single mile - for example, saying he drove 14 miles to Stanmore rather than 15. During the investigation, Mr Blackman attempted to explain apparently standard claims for journeys to areas of his constituency by arguing that he was using ‘average’ distances. But Mr Davis said that ‘conflicted with other statements that journeys were dependent on the traffic conditions pertaining at the time of travel’. He also rejected a suggestion from Mr Blackman that he was using local knowledge to avoid traffic and find the quickest rather than shortest routes - ‘if this were the case then journeys would show distinct variations’. Mr Davis examined Mr Blackman's diaries and used Google Maps to establish the actual distances. In 165 out of 169, the claim was greater than that given by the mapping tool.","Bob Blackman made 700 travel claims   that were 'inaccurate' or not allowed .

"International criminals are using British property as their preferred ‘safe haven’ to stash their corrupt money, a startling report claims. Transparency International UK said 36,000 London properties are owned by hidden companies registered in offshore havens. They fear many of these are being used by corrupt overseas politicians from the world’s poorest countries who want to hide their criminal cash. A new report has revealed that thousands of homes in London are being bought anonymously by offshore companies so they can hide corrupt money (file picture) The charity said more than £180million worth of property in the UK has been investigated by police as suspected proceeds of ‘grand corruption’ since 2004. The organisation defined ‘grand corruption’ as the theft and laundering of assets by foreign politicians, public officials and their associates from the developing world. More than three-quarters of these cases investigated by the Metropolitan Police involved ‘hidden’ offshore companies, which makes it hard to identify the owner, the charity said. Astonishingly, almost one in 10 properties in the City of Westminster and one in 14 in Kensington and Chelsea are owned by companies registered in offshore accounts. More than a third of foreign companies holding London property are incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, followed by Jersey, the Isle of Man and Guernsey. While many register their properties in offshore havens to avoid their tax obligations in Britain, campaigners say others do so to hide stolen assets. More than a third of foreign companies holding London property are incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, pictured, followed by Jersey, the Isle of Man and Guernsey . The charity has now called for the Government to act quickly to ensure the UK does not become ‘the destination of choice for global corruption’. They said analysis of documents from the Land Registry and the Metropolitan Police Proceeds of Corruption Unit showed this problem was on the rise. Robert Barrington, of Transparency International, said: ‘There is growing evidence that the UK property market has become a safe haven for corrupt capital stolen from around the world, facilitated by the laws which allow UK property to be owned by secret offshore companies. ‘This has a devastating effect on the countries from which the money has been stolen, and it’s hard to see how welcoming in the world’s corrupt elite is beneficial to communities in the UK. ‘It is astonishing that the UK has sleepwalked into this situation, and the Government needs to act quickly to make sure that the UK does not become the destination of choice for global corruption.’ They called for a new law requiring that the owners of companies which hold UK properties are named in Land Registry documents. The Metropolitan Police admitted that the current system meant ‘it can take years to unpick the layers of corruption and secrecy which ultimately result in the purchase of UK properties’. More than three quarters of cases investigated by the Metropolitan Police involved ‘hidden’ offshore companies . A spokesman said: ‘Such properties are often owned by companies registered in foreign jurisdictions and while secrecy jurisdictions have been co-operative with our investigations, obtaining evidence can take years.’ DCI Jon Benton, of Scotland Yard’s Proceeds of Corruption Unit, said the UK property market was attractive to criminal investors. He said: ‘The London property market is attractive for many reasons, not least because of the safety of the investment and that it provides a home in this great capital. In nearly all the grand corruption cases we investigate, we find – what we suspect is – proceeds of corruption being used to purchase high-value properties. ‘Properties that are purchased with illicit money, which is often stolen from some of the poorest people in the world, are nearly always layered through off-shore structures.’ He said that while the percentage of properties purchased with illicit money was tiny compared to the numbers of homes sold legitimately, the values of such houses were often huge. The average price of a UK property under investigation for proceeds of corruption is £1.5million – more than five times more than the typical UK house price.","Around 36,000 London properties are thought to be owned by hidden firms .

"With a kennel this fancy, dogs may deliberately misbehave in order to be in the doghouse. Samsung has unveiled a futuristic kennel with luxuries including an entertainment wall, paw operated snack dispenser, ‘woofing’ tannoy system and hot-tub. The 'Dream Doghouse' was designed by a team of 12 architects and fabricators and took six weeks to make, costing a staggering £20,000. Scroll down for video . Bark to the future: Samsung has unveiled a futuristic kennel with luxuries including an entertainment wall (in the back room), paw operated snack dispenser (next to Gracie the dog), ‘woofing’ tannoy system and hot-tub (shown right) It was commissioned to mark Samsung’s sponsorship of Crufts 2015, which is the world’s largest dog show and will go on show at the event from March 5 at the NEC in Birmingham. The prototype kennel is divided into two areas – one for rest and relaxation and the other for dining. There is also an outside astro-turfed leisure area for some exercise. To work out the most desirable features for the kennel, Samsung surveyed 1,500 people. It found 64 per cent of dog owners think their pets would benefit from more technology and gadgets, with a quarter admitting they would like their dog to have treadmill, and a similar number a TV or tablet. Barking mad? The kennel (illustarted) was commissioned to mark Samsung’s sponsorship of Crufts 2015, which is the world’s largest dog show and will go on show at the event from March 5 at the NEC in Birmingham . Paw at the ready: The Kennel features a dog operated snack dispenser (pictured), which means pampered pooches can help themselves to treats . £20,000 kennel has two main rooms. One contains a padded sleeping area with silver fabric, 'dog-proof' leather buttons and bone-design pillows. In the sleeping quarters, there's a wall-mounted Tab S so dogs can watch TV. The tablet can aslo be used for two-way communication with owners. A 'push-to-woof' call bell acts as a tannoy and lets dogs summon their owners. A dog operated snack dispenser means that dogs can treat themselves. There's a treadmill outside so they can work off the treats and take a bath afterwards in the 'hot-tub'. Finishing touches include a large window, fire retardant carpet, paw and bone print wallpaper and skylight. Almost one in five said that they would like their dog to have a hot-tub or spa while 22 per cent found the idea of a dog operated feeder the most appealing. The back area of the Dream Doghouse features a padded sleeping area with ‘dog-proof’ leather buttons and luxurious bone pillows. A wall-mounted Samsung Galaxy Tab S allows dogs to watch TV from their bed and owners to contact them via an interactive video link. Dogs can even summon the attention of their owner using a ‘push to woof’ call button. In the front kennel, dogs can stare out at a garden through a large polycarbonate window, or take in the ‘designer’ paw and dog print wallpaper, upon which frame portraits of Crufts winners hang. A skylight doubles up as ceiling access for ‘athletic types’ and a dog operated snack dispenser means pampered pooches can help themselves to treats, instead of begging. Outside, there’s a treadmill to keep canines trim – and work off all the slef-given snacks – as well as a hot-tub for sprucing up after a muddy walk. While the hi-tech kennel may just be a bit of fun, pets are becoming more high tech, with trackers and other gadgets becoming more common. Walkies when they want: Outside, there’s a treadmill (pictured) to keep canines trim – and work off all the snacks – as well as a hot-tub for sprucing up after a muddy walk . Cleaning up: Almost one in five of dog owners surveyed by Samsung said that they would like their dog to have a hot-tub (pictured) or spa while 22 per cent found the idea of a dog operated feeder the most appealing . A quarter of owners surveyed said they have made a social media profile for their dog and half regularly post pet pictures online. Around four in ten owners have left the TV on while they are out of the house to keep their dog company, while a quarter use the TV to block out scary noises such as fireworks. Some owners even go so far as to video call their dogs when they’re away, with 14 per cent admitting to having done this. Perhaps people are so keen to splash the cash on doggie gadgets because 85 per cent of Britons consider their pets fully-fledged members of their family, according to the study. Over half say their animal has influenced where they live and what job they do and just over 40 per cent eat at the same time as their dog in the evening. TV time: A wall-mounted Samsung Galaxy Tab S (pictured) allows dogs to watch TV from their bed and owners to contact them via an interactive video link. Dogs can even summon the attention of their owner using a ‘push to woof’ call button . ‘With the Samsung Dream Doghouse, we wanted to reflect the nation’s growing trend for using technology,’ said Andy Griffiths, President, Samsung Electronics UK and Ireland. ‘From dogs who have social media profiles to owners who use video calling to check on their pet while away, technology is fast becoming an integral part of everyday life… . ‘The Samsung Dream Doghouse looks sleek and modern, featuring the kind of tech the discerning dog of the future will need.’ Gadgets for Gromit: To work out the most desirable features for the kennel, Samsung surveyed 1,500 people.

"A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .","Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, was convicted a year ago of killing his ex-girlfriend's family in a fiery attack on the family home in 2007 .

"An airline has paid an undisclosed amount to more than 70 injured survivors of plane crash in San Francisco two years ago, court papers have revealed. The beneficiaries are all survivors of Asiana Flight 214, which slammed into a seawall at the city's airport in March 2013, leaving three dead and nearly 200 injured. The settlement with 72 passengers who filed personal injury claims also includes Boeing, which made the airplane, and Air Cruisers Co., the New Jersey company that made its evacuation slides. Liabilities: The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214 after it crashed at the San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco. More than 70 passengers have reached a settlement in their lawsuits against the airline . Disaster: An aerial view of the destroyed aircraft, which was consumed by fire after crash landing . The court filing published yesterday did not include the settlement's financial terms, details which plaintiffs' attorney Frank Pitre said are confidential. 'This is the first positive step for these passengers to be able to get closure on a tragic, catastrophic crash and hopefully try to get their lives back together,' Mr Pitre said. 'We're pleased we've been able to get this first phase resolved.' Dozens more cases involving other passengers are still pending in federal court in Northern California. Boeing spokesman Miles Kotay said the aerospace firm does not comment on pending litigation. Calls to attorneys for Asiana and Air Cruisers Co. were not immediately returned, the Associated Press reported. On July 6 2013 three Chinese teenagers were killed and nearly 200 others hurt when the Boeing 777 from South Korea slammed into a seawall at the end of a runway during final approach to to San Francisco International Airport. The impact ripped off the back of the plane, tossed out three flight attendants and their seats, and scattered pieces of the jet across the runway as it spun and skidded to a stop. Victims: Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, pose for photos with other classmates in the classroom in Jiangshan city in eastern China's Zhejiang province. Both died in the Asiana jet crash in 2013 . Grief: An unidentified relative of one of the crash victims cries at the Asiana Airlines' counter as she and other family members check in for a flight to San Francisco at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai . U.S. safety investigators blamed the pilots, saying they bungled the landing approach by inadvertently deactivating the plane's key control for airspeed, among other errors. But the National Transportation Safety Board also said the complexity of the Boeing 777's auto-throttle and auto flight director — two of the plane's key systems for controlling flight — contributed to the accident. The NTSB also faulted materials provided to airlines by Chicago-based Boeing, saying they fail to make clear the conditions in which the auto-throttle doesn't automatically maintain speed. Investigators said captain Lee Kang-Kuk, a seasoned Airbus A320 pilot transitioning to the bigger Boeing 777, cut the autopilot on final approach into San Francisco, where the instrument landing system was out of service. Doing so put the auto-throttle on hold, meaning it would no longer automatically control airspeed, explained investigator-in-chief Bill English. When the jet dipped below the correct glide path, Captain Lee reacted by pulling the nose up - but the auto-throttle, still on hold, failed to deliver an expected burst of engine power that would have enabled the airliner to make the runway. Mr Pitre said the passengers who settled had injuries that were less serious and have stabilized. At least 14 of the people with whom settlements were reached are minors, requiring the court to approve the agreements, according to Tuesday's filing.","Financial details of the settlements remain confidential, says lawyer .
The lawsuit included those passengers with the least serious injuries .
Dozens more cases are still pending in Northern California federal courts ."
"The widow of one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects is under investigation for allegedly assisting in buying the pressure cookers that were used to create the explosives used in the terror attack, it has emerged. Katherine Russell, 25, the widow of bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is suspected of accompanying her late husband to a Macy's store in Boston two months before the April 2013 attack, where Tsarnaev purchased five pressure cookers, according to ABC News, citing law enforcement sources. Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzhokhar, then planted two of the pressure cookers at the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring 260, police say. The FBI and the US Attorneys office have not commented on an investigation involving Russell, who now lives in New Jersey with her and Tsarnaev's three-year-old daughter, Zahara. Under investigation: Katherine Russell, 25, the widow of bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev - pictured here in New Jersey in October 2014 - is suspected of accompanying her late husband to a Macy's store in Boston two months before the April 2013 attack, where Tsarnaev purchased five pressure cookers . Former life: Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right-pictured left in 2010) married Katherine Russell (pictured in her yearbook) in 2010. Russell grew up in a Christian home and later converted to Islam . However ABC has reported that a search of Tsarnaev’s home after the bombings was focused on finding clothing consistent with what was shown on a security video from the Macy's store where the cookers were bought. Russell could face charges of misprision of a felony, or failing to notify authorities of a crime about to happen. Tamerlan Tsarnaev also bought $200 worth of fireworks from a store in New Hampshire, including 48 mortar shells, some of which were used in the bombs. He was killed in a police shootout three days after the attack. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, his brother and Russell's brother-in-law, is currently awaiting federal trial for the unthinkable attack. The two-month process to select a jury for the trial was completed Tuesday, authorities said, a day before opening statements in the long-awaited case are to begin. On trial: Opening statements in the long-awaited trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are to begin Wednesday . Unthinkable: Tsarnaev, 21, faces the death penalty if convicted of the April 15, 2013 bombings near the finish line at the Boston Marathon which left three people dead and 264 injured in the northeastern US city . Following the bombings, an attorney for Russell released a statement saying she was cooperating with the investigation. 'As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims, students, law enforcement officers, families and our community,' the attorney, Miriam Weizenbaum, said in the statement. Last year it was reported that Russell had remarried. In October Russell was pictured out in North Bergen, where she and three-year-old daughter, Zahara, are said to be living with her husband's sisters. Zahara was just a baby when her father caused unthinkable tragedy on April 15, 2013. As the images show, Russell, 25, continues to wear a hijab, proving that she is still living a strict Muslim life despite rumors that her family had been pushing her to embrace Christianity after the attacks. Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor. Possible suspect: Katherine Russell could face charges of misprision of a felony, or failing to notify authorities of a crime about to happen . Out and about: Russell, from Rhose Island, converted to Islam after meeting Tsarnaev in a nightclub. She is seen here in North Bergen, New Jersey, in October . At home: She reportedly now lives with her husband's two sisters at the home in North Bergen . Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor. In 2010, the promising young artist and good student dropped out of college, converted to Islam and married Tamerlan, whom she had met at a nightclub. The couple had a daughter. The young family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they settled in a cramped apartment and attended prayers in a Boston Islamic center. After her husband's death, Russell went to live with her parents in Rhode Island. They reportedly tried to convince her to stop being so strict about her faith. Russell's attorney Amato DeLuca claimed his client first learned that her husband was suspected of being a terrorist from news reports on TV. DeLuca said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband of anything and was focused on supporting her family, working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home health care aide. Russell has never spoken publicly about the bombings and she was never charged in relation to the plot, although a grand jury looking into the bombings spoke with her family members. Attack: The brothers planted two bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260, police said. Tamerlan was later killed in a shootout with police .","Katherine Russell, 25, suspected of accompanying husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev to a Macy's in Boston two months before the bombings .

"A young father who went missing with his baby son taunted police on Facebook yesterday - telling them to 'go look for some killers', as officers continue their search for the pair. Kieran Carroll, 22, of Luton, Bedfordshire, was reported missing at around midday on Tuesday along with his eight-month-old son Louis. Yesterday afternoon, police searching for Mr Carroll released CCTV footage showing him pushing a pram as he left a hotel in the town at about 2pm. He has not been seen since. Missing: CCTV footage released today by Bedfordshire Police (left) shows the last sighting of Kieran Carroll, 22, from Luton, who has gone missing with his eight-month-old son Louis (right, together) Taunt: This comment, posted in response to a police appeal, is believed to have come from one of three accounts belonging to Mr Carroll. Police said they are now trying to verify the message . In response: Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post this afternoon (as seen above) When the image was shared on Facebook by Bedfordshire Police yesterday afternoon, a profile understood to belong to Mr Carroll posted: 'I’m fine, so is my child - go look for some killers'. The force also published a photo of Louis on Facebook, along with new details on the search. The taunting response came from one of three accounts believed to belong to Mr Carroll, police said. Later last night, the same 'Kieran Carroll' profile commented again, saying, 'If any one is commenting and don't no me or what's really going on... stay out of my life you don't no me.' It is understood that Mr Carroll attended Bedford College, Bedfordshire, and lives with his girlfriend, Louis' mother, at a home in Luton. The 20-year-old woman is believed to have a three-year-old son from a previous relationship. Concerns: Bedfordshire Police also released this photograph of baby Louis, whom they are trying to trace . Police are now trying to verify the Facebook comments believed to have been posted by Mr Carroll. A spokesman added that police still want to see the baby and father in person to check they are safe. She said: 'We are looking into the message and we are urging him to get in touch with us directly and not just through Facebook. The baby's great-grandmother today appealed for Mr Carroll to bring Louis back home safely. Vivien Jakob-Grant, 65, told ITV Anglia: 'I would rather Louis be back home where he should be. I want him to be back home in one piece. 'I don't think his father would have hurt him because he doesn't look the kind of person who would do that - but I want him to be back home. 'I would just like him to take Louis back home where he should be.' 'We need to see him and more importantly we need to see the baby to know that they are both okay.' Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post this afternoon, saying: 'Kieran – Thank you for posting on our Facebook page. ‘We are pleased to hear that you and Louis are safe. It is not the role of the police to decide on child custody matters. ‘All we need to do is see you and Louis in person to check you are safe and well. Please call us on 101 so we can arrange to meet you. We cannot close this case until we see you.' Another commenter on the Facebook page, Chantelle Louise White, said: ‘You lot make out that he ant fine I know him for years and he won't do nuttin to he's son… He's looked after my son when he was the sane age! [sic]’ And Mr Carroll's sister, Alix Carroll, 24, said: 'My brother is an amazing father - he has his boy more than the mother does. 'He's scared he's going to lose him - it's no different to if it was the other way round. 'Never in a million years would he harm a hair on his body. He will be safe - I bet my life on it.' Search: Fears are growing because police say the disappearance of Mr Carroll (above) is ‘completely out of character’, and because they believe he does not have any supplies for the baby . Posting on Facebook, she added that she didn't know where her brother was, but that 'Louie is safe and there both okay [sic].' Earlier, police described the father’s disappearance as ‘completely out of character’ and said there are concerns because they believe Mr Carroll does not have any supplies for the baby. A close friend of Mr Carroll tonight claimed the father and Louis were ‘safe’. She said he was not planning to contact police 'yet' because he does not want to lose contact with Louis. The woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I just spoke to him on the phone and I heard his child giggling in the background. 'He is just trying to do the right thing but he has done it the wrong way. I have told him that. He is trying to take back his child from his mother. 'Kieran is doing the right thing by taking the child out of this situation and he is not going to the police just yet. I am trying to convince him but I can't force him to do it. 'He can't bear the fact that tomorrow he won't be able to see his child again because social services will get involved.’ Mr Quinn said: 'This type of disappearance is very out of character for Kieran and we are becoming increasingly concerned. 'We just want Kieran to contact us to let us know that him and Louis are safe. 'If you have seen Kieran, or have any information about where he and Louis may be, please contact us immediately.' Mr Carroll is described as a white man of medium build, with short brown hair. He is believed to be wearing black trousers, and a grey hooded top, a bobble hat, as seen in the CCTV image. He also has tattoos on his arms. The security image shows Mr Carroll pushing a pram, but police said he later disposed of the pram at a friend's house and left carrying his son in his arms. The baby boy is believed to be wearing a blue cardigan with a picture of a ship on it. Searches for the young father are concentrating on the local area around his home of Luton. Anyone who may have seen Mr Carroll and his son, or has any information on their whereabouts, is urged to contact Mr Quinn on 101.","Kieran Carroll, 22, was reported missing along with his baby son Louis .

"France has issued arrest warrants for three alleged terrorists said to have launched a murderous attack on a Jewish restaurant in Paris – 33 years ago. All are said to be responsible for killing six people, and wounding 22 others, at Jo Goldenberg’s in the historic Rue des Rosiers. It is in the centre of the Marais – which remains one of the most famous Jewish districts of the French capital. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: The facade of  Jo Goldenberg after it was devastated by an attack . Shocking: The interior of the restaurant after the attack that killed six and wounded 22 others . Five men from the Abu Nidal Organisation, a terrorist group committed to the liberation of Palestine, ran in to the restaurant, unleashing grenades and firing indiscriminately with automatic weapons. Alain Jakubowicz, of the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA, as it is known in France) confirmed a report on RTL radio about the warrants. ‘It gives meaning to justice,’ said Mr Jakubowicz. ‘No criminal, no terrorist can hide. Wherever he is, he is likely to be chased until the end of his life.’ France’s judicial authorities have not issued the names of the suspects, but all are said to be married with children and living in the Middle East and Scandinavia. One, aged 60, is said to be in Ramallah, in Palestine’s Occupied Territories, while another, aged 63, is in Jordan. The third is now 56, and living in Norway, with his wife and four children. Firefighters evacuating victims of the anti-Semite attack carried out by the Palestinian group Abu Nidal . Police and firemen surrounding the restaurant on Rue des Rosiers in Paris . It is claimed that their part in the Jo Goldenberg attack has been established through a detailed investigation, which included interviews with survivors. Two Americans were among those killed in the terrorist outrage, which caused the worst loss of Jewish life in Paris since the Second World War Holocaust. The Rue de Rosiers currently remains under Army guard following an attack on a Kosher supermarket in January, in which four Jews died. Amedy Coulibaly, a Paris terrorist linked to Islamic State, was himself gunned down by police commandoes following the attack. Like the 1980s terrorists, Coulibaly said he was targeting Jews because of Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians. Jo Goldenberg, the owner of the Jewish restaurant – which is still in business – died last year aged 91. His family founded it before the wartime Occupation of Paris, when thousands of French Jews were entrained to concentration camps in Germany.","All are said to be responsible for attack on Jo Goldenberg restaurant .

"It was once a symbol of U.S. supremacy before becoming a prison cell for 52 Americans for 444 days. Now, the former embassy in Tehran is a chilling museum complete with a skeletal Statue of Liberty and ghostly waxworks. Every year, Iran commemorates the  anniversary of the 1979 Iranian revolution with its Ten Days of Dawn celebrations. On the final day, mass rallies and anti-western protests take place and the country's president addresses his people in Tehran's Freedom Square. The embassy garnered worldwide attention in November 1979 when revolutionary students stormed in and took dozens of U.S. staff hostage - the story which inspired the film Argo, starring Ben Affleck. Australian photographer Brook Mitchell, 36, who lives in Bali, embarked on a trip to Iran and captured these incredible pictures of the celebrations and the macabre museum. Ghoulish: A mural of the Statue of Liberty on the wall of the former U.S. embassy in Tehran, where 52 hostages were held for 444 days . Bizarre: Wax figures supposedly represent former U.S. embassy staff inside the so called 'Glassy Room for Secret Negotiations' in Tehran .

The rooms where secret state missions were planned have been covered in graffiti. But apart from the most minor of cosmetic changes, the building that caused a global diplomatic crisis is frozen in time - and looks almost identical to its portrayal in the Oscar-winning Ben Affleck movie Argo. In 1979, thousands of  protesters pressed around the compound, responding to a call by the country's new leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, to attack U.S. and Israeli interests. Of the 90 people in the compound, six Americans managed to escape the building and flee to other embassies. Other non-U.S. citizens captured when the embassy was seized were released, but 66 were captured, including three at the Foreign Ministry, and held hostage for 444 days.

In 1979, thousands of protesters pressed around the compound, responding to a call by the country's new leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, to attack U.S. and Israeli interests . Dramatic: Iranian students climb over the wall of the U.S. embassy in Tehran just before the hostage crisis, in which 52 Americans were held hostages for 444 days in 1979 . The students paraded the blindfolded hostages for the cameras to humiliate the ‘Great Satan’ that Washington had become in the eyes of the Iranian revolutionary leaders. They demanded that the Shah of Iran be expelled from the U.S., where he had been taken for cancer treatment after he was overthrown. Freeing the hostages became a priority for the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter - but nothing could be done apart from enforcing ineffective economic sanctions. Mr Carter pledged to preserve the lives of the hostages and conducted intense diplomacy to secure their release. But his failure ultimately contributed to his losing the presidency to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Paraded: One of the hostages, blindfolded and with his hands bound, is displayed to crowds outside the US Embassy in 1979. On the day of President Ronald Reagan's inauguration, January 20 1981, the hostages were set free .

The embassy garnered worldwide attention in November 1979 when revolutionary students stormed in and took dozens of U.S. staff hostage - the story which inspired the film Argo, starring Ben Affleck . Two weeks into the crisis, Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the release of 13 female and black hostages, mostly clerical staff and members of the marine guard who guard US embassies around the world. Another hostage, vice consul Richard Queen, was released in July 1980 after falling ill with multiple sclerosis. But the remaining 52 were deprived of their freedom for 444 days. In February 1980, Iran issued a new set of demands for the hostages' freedom. It called for the Shah to be handed over to face trial in Tehran, as well as other diplomatic gestures, such as a U.S. apology for its actions. The hostages were finally set free on January 20 1981.

A crowd gathers as this strongman theatrically struggles to break free of chains in Minab, Southern Iran . Yet Mr Mitchell, who embarked on an enlightening trip, said: 'After visiting some of the most remote and supposedly conservative parts of the country, areas that very few outsiders see, I cannot equate the term 'axis of evil' with my experiences, at least when it comes to the people I met. 'Travelling through Iran as an outsider was an unforgettable, immersive experience. 'Open, curious hospitality was the norm. Despite being proud of their country and history, the people were largely ashamed of their government. 'There's rebellion going on all the time; it's just for the most part it's happening behind closed doors. 'My favourite image is probably one of the lady in the striking red mask staring down the camera. After having some breakfast together she was happy for me to take her picture, and she had a really lovely way about her. 'It was the second morning of the trip and I was kind of reassured that it was all going to work out after that.' Hormuz island, Persian Gulf. 'Travelling through Iran as an outsider was an unforgettable, immersive experience,' Mitchell explained . The Iranian flag flies in the  town centre of the city of Yazd. Officials estimated around 20,000 people attended the celebrations . He added that in many areas there was a  sense of desperation at the current state of the economy, with many young adults unsure of their future. 'I was frequently asked about the current migration laws back in Australia, and what I thought of the government. This was usually followed up with an invitation to share some tea,' he said. 'Even at mass anti-Western rallies I was welcomed with smiles and curiosity, which was a surreal experience in itself.' The photographer travelled along the ethnically diverse Persian Gulf coast region, which is rarely visited by outsiders, and spent time on Qeshm and Hormuz islands, the former the site of recent military exercises from where missiles were fired from the coast to destroy a mock U.S. carrier. Mitchell says a highlight for him was a visit to the Panjshambe Bazaar, a weekly market in the desert town of Minab, which draws some of the most remote and ethnically diverse groups in Iran to sell their wares.

'In the Gulf region many Bandari - literally meaning 'people of the port' in Persian, women wear distinctive masks made of metal which are covered with fabric, the colour and style depending on the woman's ethnic group and town,' Mr Mitchell added. 'This is a stark contrast to the black tent like outfits seen in the rest of the country. 'There was little in the way of tourist infrastructure for outsiders for much of the trip, which made daily organisation pretty challenging.' During the trip Mitchell visited the Persian Gulf Coast and Islands: Bandar Abbas, Hormuz, Qeshm and Minab and travelled to the desert cities of Yazd and Shiraz, Tehran, including  the ancient Zoroastrian centre of Chak Chak, Ruins at Persepolis and the city of Isfahan.

A debt free Mr Skarbek believes he now has a second chance at life. 'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow out on medical bills with my six month cancer treatment… Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said. A spokeswoman for the quiz show said $75,000 is now guaranteed as a safety jackpot so Andrew has decided to play on for the next step to the magical million dollar jackpot. 'In the week I finally beat cancer and was medically given the all clear, I was called up to go on Million Dollar Minute. I feel like this is all happening for a reason,'  Mr Skarbek said. 'My illness happened for a reason and it has made me a stronger person. 'I haven't come into this aiming for the million, but if everything works perfectly, in a perfect world, I might have a shot to get far enough to at least put myself if in that position. 'If I win the million we will completely change our lives.' Mr Skarbek says he will share any surplus cash leftover from his medical expenses with his wife, Jenny, and his 78-year-old mother, Sophie.

"A newlywed couple were so determined to have the ultimate set of wedding photographs they travelled to Antarctica - so they could pose up with penguins in their natural habitat. And the bride even wore her strapless dress in the sub-zero temperatures, while her groom wore – what else? – a penguin suit! But the Chinese couple’s antics have brought anything but best wishes back in their homeland, where their behaviour has been deemed an embarrassment, according to the People’s Daily. White wedding: There were no cold feet for this  couple - who posed up after their ceremony in Antarctica . Walking down the icicle: While  friends and family went for padded jackets, the bride wore a strapless dress . Snow regrets: The couple had the time of their lives - but these photos prompted frustration back home . The nation is acutely aware of its reputation for tourists behaving badly abroad and anything that can be seen to reinforce the stereotype is often widely condemned. With a rapidly-growing wealthy elite, China already sends more tourists to Antarctica than any country in the world apart from the U.S. and Australia. According to International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, 37 Chinese tourists visited the continent between 2003 and 2004. Ten years later that number had exploded to 3,328. This group was spotted by a Chinese photographer who traveled to the untouched wilderness on assignment - and he found them chasing penguins and jumping into groups of the birds. Irresponsible? Chinese citizens are keen to avoid anything that paints them as reckless eco-tourists . Souvenir: Photographers claim to have witnessed tourists getting so close to penguins, they scare them off . Joking around: These men brave the cold as they visit Antarctica's Paradise Bay in the middle of 'summer' Internet users in China reacted angrily, with some suggesting the next stop would be taking inappropriate pictures on Mars. A photographer from Chinanews.com took pictures of some Chinese tourists exhibiting what he described as 'pitiful behaviour'. The photographer claimed that the 'uncivilised phenomenon happened constantly'. 'Some Chinese tourists seem to enjoy themselves too much so that they chase penguins and run into crowds of the animal for pictures,' the photographer added. 'There were even tourists who ignore rules and took pictures of penguins very closely.' Holiday to remember: Chinese tourists shopping at the British base of Port Lockroy . China sent 3,328 tourists in 2013-14, up from  37 a decade earlier and less only than the U.S. or Australia .","Bride wore strapless dress in sub-zero conditions for extreme photo op .

"'Poor': Sergei Pugachev, who was once branded 'Putin's banker', said the order has made it difficult for he and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy, pictured together, to support their home . A Russian tycoon exiled in London who is fighting a freeze on his £1.3billion in assets by the High Court has claimed he is now a 'poor man' who cannot afford to support his family. Sergei Pugachev, who was once branded 'Putin's banker', said the order has made it difficult for him and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy, to support their home. Last year it was reported the couple, who have three children and own a £12million house, employ two housekeepers, three nannies, two drivers and a live-in doctor. And Ms Tolstoy, 41, said it was hard to live on the £10,000-a-week allowed by the court. Mr Pugachev, the former billionaire business partner of the Queen's nephew Viscount Linley is accused in Moscow of siphoning more than £655million in funds from Mezhprombank, which filed for insolvency in 2010, including $700 million in Russian Central Bank bailout money. The 52-year-old former tycoon, who denies any wrongdoing, complained the freeze has left him unable to support Tolstoy who said last year it was hard to live on the £10,000 a week allowed by the court. 'I can be called a poor man. I do not have money to support my family and my property, and this is more important than paying the lawyers,' he told Vedomosti newspaper in Moscow, blaming the arrest of his bank accounts and assets. He said he has borrowed $5 million towards his $10 million legal bill, but was now unable to take more loans because his assets were frozen. As a result, he has dispensed with his lawyers. Last year, his  socialite partner - a distant relative of Leo Tolstoy - said 'we are just surviving' on the £10,000 a week allowance. The Deposit Insurance Agency in Moscow, which is taking the legal action, claim the 'statements of his partner Alexandra Tolstoy' about their lifestyle belie 'his declarations about financial difficulties'. A source claimed his move to dispense with his British lawyers 'looks like a tactical trick and is aimed at making obstacles for English justice'. Last week a London Court of Appeal judge ruled that Pugachev, also previously nicknamed 'cashier to the Kremlin', must disclose further information about trusts he uses to bolster his income. Lavish: Last year it was reported the couple, pictured together, who have three children and own a £12million house, employ two housekeepers, three nannies, two drivers and a live-in doctor . 'Sophisticated and wily operators should not be able to make themselves immune to the courts' orders,' said the judge. Pugachev claims he is the victim of a 'politically motivated' asset grab by figures in the Russan elite of which he was a member before fleeing to London. His property was 'expropriated by the state and by private persons', and sold at rock bottom prices, he claimed. He also alleged in court that a senior Deposit Insurance Agency official earlier made 'a brazen attempt to extort money' from him, and threatened that 'he or his family could be physically harmed'. In November, Interpol put Pugachev on its wanted list at Russia's request, with Putin's spokesman alleging: 'He built up huge amounts of debts and then ran away.' Struggle: Ms Tolstoy, pictured, said 'she and her husband are just surviving' on the £10,000 a week allowance . Faced by the legal moves in Moscow, Pugachev in October blasted Putin, claiming all Russian businessmen are now 'serfs' under his total control. 'Today in Russia there is no private property. There are only serfs who belong to Putin,' he told the Financial Times, in a blunt warning over the collapse of regulated capitalism in his homeland. 'Now there is Putin and there are his lieutenants who carry out his orders - and all cash generated is put on the balance of Putin,' he alleged. 'The country is in a state of war. And therefore big business cannot live as before. It has to live under military rules.' He alleged: 'If Putin says he wants to buy something, you cannot say that you do not want to sell. 'If he says 'I want to buy something' then you say, 'Thanks for saying you want to buy it, and not just taking it.'","Sergei Pugachev, 52, had his £1.3billion assets frozen by the High Court over Russian probe .

"An investigation into the 1959 plane crash that killed Buddy Holly and three others could now be reopened after a respected pilot brought forward new factors as to how the aircraft may have gone down. At the time of the crash, the Civil Aeronautics Board ruled the probable cause of the crash was error by the pilot, Roger Peterson, who took off from Mason City to Moorhead, Minnesota, in inclement weather, even though he was qualified. The chartered plane crashed in Iowa not long after takeoff, killing Holly, Peterson, and musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. Richardson. Now L.J. Coon, an experienced pilot from New England, says a variety of other factors - such as weight and balance calculations, the rate of the plane's climb and descent, fuel gauge readings and the passenger-side rudder - should have been considered, according to The Globe Gazette. Wreck: On February 3, 1959, a light aircraft chartered by Buddy Holly crashed in Clear Lake, Iowa, killing the singer and three others aboard. An investigation into the reasons for the crash - ruled at the time to be pilot - could now be reopened, after a pilot petitioned for other factors to be considered . Fiery: The accident, known as 'The Day the Music Died', that occurred on February 3, 1959, killed rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J. P. 'The Big Bopper' Richardson, as well as the pilot, Roger Peterson . Too young: Buddy Holly was only 22 when he died, with his career only lasting 18 months. He is still considered one of the best musicians of all time . Tragic: The body of one of the three famous rock 'n' roll singers killed in the crash of a single engine bonanza  lies a few feet from the wreckage of the plane on February 3, 1959, in Clear Lake, Iowa . The National Transportation Safety Board has agreed to consider reopening the investigation. Coon's motivation was to 'the heroic effort that took place in those 4.9 miles' by the pilot, Peterson, before the plane crashed. The plane had been in the air less than four minutes. Coon received a letter from the NTSB saying they had received his call for a reinvestigation. 'You have gotten our attention. Let us do our due diligence in order to give you a proper answer,' the letter stated. The NTSB will now determine whether or not the submission meets the requirements of a Petition for Reconsideration. History and many other people believe that Peterson was the direct cause of the February 3, 1959 crash. Killed: Buffy Holly, who was one of the most popular entertainers of the 1950's, died in a plane crash in 1959 . In memoriam: A giant pair of glasses marks the place where Buddy Holly died in Clear Lake, Iowa . Gary W. Moore, author of Hey Buddy, a book about Holly's life, told the Globe Gazaette that the Aeronautics Board got it right 56 years ago. 'I think that what (a new investigation) is going to find it is its pretty simple,' Moore said. 'The pilot was unqualified to fly in those conditions and he lost control of the airplane.' Holly, a rockabilly pioneer, was only 22-years-old when he died, with a career lasting 18 months. Despite such a short time, Rolling Stone in 2004 ranked Holly as number 13 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.","Buddy Holly, 22, killed in the crash on February 3, 1959, in Clear Lake, Iowa .

"Pictures of a terrified teenager being forced to strip naked before being punched and kicked by her classmates have shocked China. The 16-year-old girl can be seen cowering naked in the corner as the group - which is said to have included some of her supposed friends - carry out the vicious onslaught. It is thought she started off wearing a green T-shirt, but as the gang became more frenzied they ripped her clothes from her body in the dormitory of Bancang Middle School, in Bancang township in Funing county in south-western China's Yunnan province. Aggressive: The six-strong group beat the girl after tearing off her clothes in the school dormitory . Clothed: It appears the girl was fully dressed in jeans and a green T-shirt when the attack began . The six-strong group of girls then punch and kick the teenager, before covering her with toothpaste and hacking off her hair, the People's Daily reported. As a final insult, the group then appears to pose with the traumatised teen, who covers her face. And it seems the girls were so proud of their disgusting actions, that they posted the images to China's second biggest social networking site QQ to boast. The apparent ringleader posted the photographs boasting about how she and her pals who are not students at the school had 'Ripped the s**t out of this slut'. Police have identified her as Lu Tung, 16, who went on the run after outraged web users came across the horrifying pictures. Sickening: Later, they posed with the devastated teenager - and then posted the pictures on social media . Torture: The gang - who are now thought to be on the run - also chopped off the girl's hair . Proud: Alleged ringleader Lu Tung boasted on social media they had 'ripped the s***' out of the girl . Lu Tung is now thought to have fled along with the other girls to the crowded city of Guangzhou, in southern China's Guangdong province, which is 850 miles away. A police spokesman said: 'This was a particularly nasty and vicious assault and we have yet to establish the motive behind it. 'We are now searching for the girls and for Lu Tang who appears to have been the ring leader.' A school spokesman said: 'This is absolutely abhorrent and we will get to the bottom of it and demand punishment for the girls involved.' The victim is now being looked after by her parents and receiving counselling.","Girl, 16, is beaten and covered in toothpaste in school dormitory .

Dragana Haines' husband aid worker David Haines, 44, was the first British hostage to be killed on screen by Jihadi John in an ISIS propaganda video released last September. Mrs Haines said she believes the British Government should have put up a bounty at the time of her husband's death. Last week Jihadi John was named as Mohammed Emwazi, a 26-year-old university graduate from London who was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 watchlist. Dragana Haines (pictured with David Haines and their daughter) said she would like to see the British Government stump up a bounty for information about Jihadi John, who brutally executed her husband . After footage of the first of the brutal killings emerged last year the US Senate approved a $10million reward for information leading to his arrest. Now Mrs Haines, who lives with her four-year-old daughter in Athea, is calling for the British government to follow suit. She told Benedict Moore-Bridger at the Evening Standard: 'I am sure some of his mates would sell him. I know they are dedicated to some cause but also not all are so honourable, whatever that may mean for them, and they should go for that 'carrot.'' Scottish aid worker Mr Haines, 44, was brutally executed by Emwazi in September after being seized in Syria in 2013. Mrs Haines has previously said she would like to see Jihadi John captured alive so he can face justice. She said she would also like to try and find out why he carried out the brutal killings of her husband and other hostages. She added: 'A British bounty should have been put on his head at the time.' Scottish aid worker Mr Haines, 44, was executed by Emwazi in September after being seized in Syria in 2013 . The widow said she felt David Cameron should have acted to put up a reward for information before more people were murdered. She also said she had a 'mess of feelings' for Emwazi's family who she said must have had 'high hopes' for their son, but she was baffled as to if they could ever be able to forgive him. Mr Haines' other daughter, Bethany, 17, has previously said she would like to see her father's murderer killed. She said: 'I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there's a bullet between his eyes.' Emwazi was unmasked as the brutal ISIS executioner last week. Victim: David Haines (left) was killed by 'Jihadi John' last September. His daughter Bethany (right) said families would only feel closure once 'there was a bullet his eyes' The 26-year-old, who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, is said to have travelled to the Middle East three years ago and later joined ISIS. After graduating from university in May 2009, Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain. En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab. Mohammed Emwazi: Jihadi John (pictured left and right) and his asylum-seeking family have milked the British benefits system for 20 years, with Westminster City Council still paying rent on their £600,000 home . He claimed he was harassed by the security services, and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Emwazi is also said to have featured as Jihadi John in the execution videos of British aid worker Alan Henning, as well as U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers. Since his identity was uncovered it has emerged that his father, Jasem, disowned him when he learned he was going to fight in Syria. Emwazi's family claimed asylum in the UK and won refugee status in 1996 and have claimed thousands in benefits. Housing the Islamic State executioner and his relatives in affluent parts of London has cost taxpayers up to £400,000.","Jihadi John unmasked as computing graduate from Queen's Park, London .

"A bright red miniature statue of Karl Marx given to a British city to commemorate his 195th birthday has been relegated to a back garden because a Tory-run council doesn't want it on display. The four-foot tall, plastic sculpture of the communist revolutionary, was presented to Gloucester council by dignitaries from his birthplace of Trier, Germany - which is twinned with the city. Trier made 500 of the statues which were placed across the city, and one was donated to Gloucester in order to symbolise Marx's journey across Europe, because the cities are twinned. Scroll down for video . A bright red miniature statue of Karl Marx given to a British city to commemorate his 195th birthday has been relegated to a back garden - because a Tory-run council doesn't want it on display . But the Conservative council said it 'would not be appropriate' to display the gift anywhere prominent. Charles Yates, a member of GlosLinks, which maintains the link between Gloucester and twinned Trier, has instead given the statue a home in his back garden. He said: 'It needed a home and my wife and I were quite happy to have it here. He is stood in the garden quite happily. 'It is the sort of statue that guests will always make a comment about. It deserves to be put somewhere in the city. It deserves a home somewhere in Gloucester. 'This whole thing started because the German people asked us what we had done with it. 'It is all very well everyone making decisions about the statue but they haven't actually seen it yet. Charles Yates, a member of GlosLinks, which maintains the link between Gloucester and twinned Trier, has instead given the statue a home in his back garden . The four-foot tall, plastic sculpture of the communist revolutionary, was presented to Gloucester council by dignitaries from his birthplace of Trier, Germany - which is twinned with the city. Trier made 500 of the statues and one was donated to Gloucester in order to symbolise Marx's journey across Europe . 'I am just amazed that nobody has come to see the statue.' The statue of the revolutionary Trier-born socialist, who wrote The Communist Manifesto, was donated to Gloucester last May. Transported to Britain on the Eurostar, the journey was meant to mimic the way Marx drifted across Europe. Born in Trier in 1818, Marx moved to Berlin to study law before travelling to Paris, where he became a revolutionary communist. Expelled from France, Marx spent two years in Brussels before moving to London, where he was to spend the remainder of his life. Despite Marx's significance and political standing, the Conservative leader of the council does not believe it should be placed anywhere important. Leader of Gloucester City Council Paul James said: 'We value our twinning links so I'm pleased we've been able to find somewhere to put Trier's kind gift. 'I don't think it would be appropriate to put it anywhere more prominent unless, perhaps, to warn people of the dangers of voting for Ed Miliband.' The comment and political stance of the council has sparked fury with local councillors who says it should not be used as a political weapon, whether you agree with his politics or not. Labour councillor Chris Chatterton said: 'I appreciated it's election time and silly season but you shouldn't say that. 'Whether you agree or disagree with Marx and Engels is up to you. Their theories changed the world. To make that kind of comment is misplaced. 'The statue shouldn't be bandied about as a political part. 'I think you take it on its merits. Just as a point of courtesy when any of us are given a gift you treat it with respect. 'Through time we have been given some very weird gifts and you may not want to put them on display but you treat it with courtesy. 'How many times have we gotten something at Christmas that we don't want but you don't just throw it away. You treat it with respect.' Born in Trier in 1818, Marx moved to Berlin to study law before travelling to Paris, where he became a revolutionary communist and befriended his life long collaborator, Friedrich Engels. The pair co-authored the pamphlet 'The Communist Manifesto' which was published in 1848. It theorised that all human history had been based on class struggles. Expelled from France, Marx spent two years in Brussels before moving to London, where he was to spend the remainder of his life. He lived, for a number of years, in poverty supported by the wealthier Engels, before he produced his most important body of work, 'Das Kapital'. The first volume of this 'bible of the working class' was published in his lifetime, while the remaining volumes were edited by Engels after his friend's death. He died on 14 March 1883 and was buried at Highgate Cemetery in London. Video courtesy of Heiko Zimmerman .","Statue given to Gloucester council by Marx's birthplace of Trier, Germany .

"A cat is showing signs of improvement after undergoing urgent surgery for having an arrow shot in her eye which went through her skull. She was brought into an Auckland vet clinic late last night with a metal arrow 'quite deeply imbedded' in her right eye, veterinarian Dr Jess Beer told 3 News. Dr Beers believes this was an intended attack and the incident is being investigated by animal welfare. A cat is surprisingly recovering well after having an arrow shot in her eye which went through her skull . The young female cat was taken to the Maunkau After Hours Veterinary Clinic . She was brought into an Auckland vet clinic late last night with a metal arrow 'quite deeply imbedded' in her right eye, veterinarian Dr Jess Beer said . The young female cat was rushed to the Maunkau After Hours Veterinary Clinic when her owners discovered her with a metal arrow in her eye when she came back to their Howick home, east of Auckland. 'The bolt came out with no major complications and fingers crossed, we are actually hoping that eye will be saved,' Dr Beer told 3 News. 'It was directly in her eye, someone was aiming for her head, so I can't imagine this being an accident. 'Unfortunately, there are some people who consider cats a nuisance and I would hate to think this is the outcome of those sorts of attitudes.' Dr Beers believes this was a deliberate attack and the incident is being investigated by animal welfare . Dr Beer says she will find a new home for the cat once she makes a recovery from surgery . Dr Beer says she will be monitoring the cat for 10 days before making a decision on whether the injured pet can undergo a second surgery to take out its wounded eye. The attack is being investigated by Auckland SPCA, who are appealing for information into the incident. Chief executive Chris Kalin told 3 News there has been two other similar cases in the area in recent years. The clinic had to perform the surgery for free as the cat's owners could not afford to pay the medical bills. Dr Beer says she will find a new home for the cat once she makes a recovery from surgery.","A cat is recovering after undergoing urgent surgery on Tuesday night .

"Wildfires raged along Cape Town's famous mountains for a fourth day, destroying homes, a hotel and scorching thousands of hectares of spectacular scenery. Firefighting teams and water-bombing aircraft were still desperately trying to curb the spread of the flames sweeping down Cape Town's southern peninsula, a mountainous spine of land running from the city to Cape Point, Africa's most southwestern tip. It is believed the fire has already ravaged some 4,000 hectares of land - burning the flowering, shrub-like vegetation known as fynbos, part of the unique Cape floral kingdom. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: Geofrey Collings helps his 82-year-old wife Fran through the wreckage of their home, which was destroyed by the fire . Raging: Fires caught on both sides of the famous peninsula, closing the famous Chapman's Peak Drive as it burned above Hout Bay (pictured) Lucky: So far, there have been no reported fatalities or serious injuries due to the fire - although people have been treated for smoke inhallation . It has also destroyed or damaged at least 13 homes so far, as well as the five-star Tintswalo Atlantic Lodge, which is perched on the edge of the ocean near the fishing port and commuter village of Hout Bay. Luckily, no one is thought to have been killed or seriously injured, but dozens of people have been treated for smoke inhalation. Schools were closed and traffic snarled as residents awoke to a rain of ash and smoke drifting across an armageddon-like red ball of sun. The fires started as temperatures soared to their highest for the last 100 years of more than 40 degrees Celsius. As the blazes ripped along the mountainside on both sides of the famous pennisula, hundreds of residents living in the upmarket villages dotted along the Atlantic and False Bay coasts grabbed pets and valuables as they were evacuated overnight ahead of flames fanned by strong winds and record high temperatures. Appeals for food and cash to help victims, evacuees and volunteer firefighters have had an overwhelming response, officials said. Hard work: Firemen hose down smoldering logs in the Tokai Forest, near to the upmarket suburb of Constantia . Battle: Planes collect water from the sea and reservoirs nearby to dump on the forests in an attempt to stop the fire spreading . The mountains are home to fynbos, a type of shrub-like flora which is unique to the Western Cape . A 'RadioFirethon' on local station Cape Talk had raised more than R3million (about £166,000) by 5pm UK time. A German tourist staying in a rented house in the same area told eNCA television that he had a lucky escape in the early hours of Wednesday. 'I never experienced anything like this,' said the man, who gave his name only as Karl. 'When I saw (the flames) coming... I put my wife out of bed and we took what we could grab and went to the beach parking.' The couple were then escorted to a rescue centre. The fires have now moved along the coast, and are threatening homes near Fish Hoek, on the False Bay side of the peninsula, said Onele Ndesi, spokesman for Cape Town Disaster Risk Management. Just along the same stretch of coast, another fishing village had already come under threat: a sudden wind change overnight brought flames bearing down on Kalk Bay, a fishing village known for its seafood restaurants and antique shops. Devastating: Strong winds and high temperatures have made it difficult for firefighters to contain the blaze . Distraught: Geofrey Collings' home near the Tokai Forest home was one of 13 which have been either entirely or partly destroyed . Armageddon-like: The fires have transformed the usually stunning scenery into rivers of flames . Help: A resident covers face with a cloth as she walks in smoke to help fight fires threatening homes in Clovelly, near Fish Hoek . However, officials were hopeful a change in the weather -including some rain - might bring some relief. The fynbos-covered mountains and spectacular coastline are the backdrop to the annual Cape Town Cycle Tour, a 109 kilometre race around the peninsula, which is due to be held on Sunday. The race is described as the 'largest timed cycling event in the world', and has drawn 35,000 entrants from South Africa and around the world this year. Organisers were expected to announce this week whether the fires will force a change in the route. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said she was confident the fire would be out in time for the race to take place. 'It is known as the most scenic cycle tour in the world but now it will tour through some of the greatest devastation that the peninsula has ever seen, which will be heart-wrenching,' she said.","Cape Town's spectacular scenery has been ravaged by four days of fires - destroying or damaging 13 homes .

"Soloman Bygraves (pictured) had followed Stanley Evans into his block of flats in Soho, central London, and pushed him over as he lunged for his wallet . A homeless man has  admitted knocking a frail 92-year-old widower to the floor to steal just five pounds. Stanley Evans, who lives on his own, was left lying on the ground for ten minutes after being attacked as he returned from a shopping trip in London. Soloman Bygraves had followed the pensioner, now 93, into his block of flats in Soho, central London, and pushed him over as he lunged for his wallet. The assault, which has been branded by police as 'totally unprovoked, callous and sickening', came just months after the elderly man had given his attacker £10. Bygraves, 29, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty at London's Southwark Crown Court via video-link from Wandsworth Prison. Wearing a grey tracksuit, he spoke only to confirm his name and plead guilty. Mr Evans, who suffered an shoulder injury, eventually managed to get to his feet and take the lift to his flat to call 999. He did not require hospital treatment. The retired cameraman who worked on films including the 1947 classic Brighton Rock with Richard Attenborough - said he had been left 'flailing like a seal' after the attack. Speaking before the arrest, Mr Evans described the attack: 'I've gone past anger, I'm frustrated. If I ever came across that one again I was a boxer and aggressive, if someone punches me I punch them back.' 'I was coming up to my flat from the supermarket with a trolley when I saw a large black man sitting on the wall, I vaguely recognised him as someone I had gave £10 to last year. I'm quite friendly with people in the area. 'He was even helpful with the trolley. I left him sitting on the wall and started fiddling with my key. Then he was behind me. He told me he had come to visit someone on the second floor. Scroll down for video . Victim Stanley Evans (pictured) said he was left 'flailing like a seal' on the ground for 10 minutes after the attack . These shocking CCTV images show the moment Mr Evans, then aged 92, was attacked as he waited for a lift in his flat block . 'I let him in behind me and I called the lift. My wallet was in the front pocket of my trousers. Then suddenly whoosh, he came straight at me. He grabbed my wallet, pushed me over and I fell on my side and he ran out. 'When you fall over at my age every bit of your body hits the ground, I was flailing like a seal. It's almost impossible to pick yourself up. 'I waited 10 minutes for someone to come but nobody did. Then I managed to struggle to my feet and go up to my flat and call the police.' The assault and robbery took place at Ingestre Court, central London at around 8pm on Saturday, 31 January. Bygraves is seen shoving the pensioner to the ground as he steals his wallet- which contained just £5 . The callous robber then casually walked from the scene, leaving Mr Evans stricken on the floor . Helen Thomas, prosecuting, said: 'This case involves the robbery of a 92-year-old man who was returning to his home address after a shopping trip and was set upon by the defendant in the lobby area of his block of flats. 'There are fairly lengthy antecedents. There is also CCTV footage covering the incident. It is my view your lordship would wish to see this prior to sentencing.' John Causer, defending, said Bygraves had a lengthy criminal record, including three convictions for robbery. He said: 'The court will wish to consider the issue of dangerousness. 'There is a background of mental health issues and drug issues.' Mr Evans said he is determined not to let the mugging scare him out of leaving his flat and enjoying Soho where he has lived and worked in for so many years . The assault happened as the pensioner was waiting for a lift to his flat in Ingestre Court in central London . Mr Evans said Bygraves had waited by the entrance to his block of flats and claimed he was going to visit someone but as soon as the pensioner let him in, he mugged him . Judge Alistair McCreath remanded Bygraves in custody to be sentenced on April 13. He also ordered pre-sentence reports. Mr Evans, originally from Cardigan in Wales, once worked as an assistant cameraman at Welwyn Studio, where his first feature was John Boulting's 1947 adaptation of Brighton Rock, starring Richard Attenborough, before moving to MGM Studios in Borehamwood. After the film studio closed down in the 1970s he set up as a freelance photographer in a studio in Marshall Street in Soho, where he captured celebrities including Michael Crawford. He is determined not to let the mugging scare him out of leaving his flat and enjoying Soho where he has lived and worked in for so many years. He said: 'It doesn't scare me though. I'm not going to hide away in my flat because of him. I'm glad I live in Soho despite men like him.'

Mr Evans (pictured aged 17, right, and today at home, left) later set up as a freelance photographer in a studio in Marshall Street in Soho, where he captured celebrities including Michael Crawford . The CCTV footage showed Mr Evans being followed by Bygraves as he returns from the shops into the block of flats where he lives. Pushing a small shopping trolley, the frail victim is seen waiting in a communal entrance for the lift to his flat as the robber approached him. The attacker then grabs his pocket and pushes him to the floor and footage shows the shocked pensioner collapsed in the communal area as he waits for help to come. As a result of the assault the pensioner suffered a shoulder injury, which was treated by an ambulance crew. Detective Sergeant Gemma Alger of the Westminster Serious Crime Unit said: 'This is a totally unprovoked, callous and sickening assault on a defenceless pensioner. 'The victim is fiercely independent and has lived in London all his life. His confidence has been eroded as a result of the actions of this individual and now he is fearful about going out.' The court heard that Bygraves had a lengthy criminal record, including three convictions for robbery . The 29-year-old of no fixed abode also had a background of mental health issues and drug issues . Bygraves entered his guilty plea has been remanded in custody until his sentencing hearing next month .","Pensioner Stanley Evans, 92, had returned from a shopping trip in London .

"Labour is considering a new crackdown on so-called ‘non-doms’ – wealthy foreigners who live in Britain but avoid paying tax on their overseas income. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he was ‘absolutely looking at that for the future’ when asked whether a future Labour government would turn its attention to non-doms. There are an estimated 116,000 non-doms living in the UK who only have to pay UK taxes on money they bring into the country. Income from overseas investments does not have to be declared. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls is considering a new crackdown on so-called ‘non-doms’ – wealthy foreigners who live in Britain but avoid paying tax on their overseas income . In 2008 Labour announced plans to charge non-doms £30,000 a year if they had been resident in the UK for seven of the previous ten years. Last year George Osborne announced this charge would be increased to up to £90,000 for those who have lived here for 17 out of the past 20 years. Mr Balls told the Daily Mail: ‘One of the challenges that you’ve always got to do if you’re going to be a good chancellor is always be asking the question are the tax rules set in previous eras still the right rules for today? ‘And we know we’ve got some real challenges around international tax rules, when companies like Google or Starbucks can move their operations around the world.' He added: ‘And I think some of those issues…going back 200 years is right that we modernise the rules and that we’re tougher to make sure that people who are living in our city and working in our country, pay taxes in our country. ‘I think people expect Government to do that and that’s what we’ve all got to do. He added: ‘I think we need to make sure that people living in our country are paying their fair share of tax. We can do that through the mansion tax, which we are proposing. But we toughened up the rules on non-doms. George Osborne has done a bit more on that and I’m absolutely looking at that for the future.’ In an editorial on Monday, the influential newspaper the Financial Times called for non-dom rules to be abolished, pointing out they dated back to 1799 to allow those with foreign property to shelter it from new war taxes. Last year George Osborne announced the charge paid by non-doms who have lived in the UK for 17 out of the past 20 years would be increased to  £90,000 a year . Describing non-dom rules as an ‘archaism’ and an ‘anomaly’ it said that the government should ‘end the egregious situation where the wealthiest enjoy the privileges of UK residency without paying their fair dues to the exchequer.’ Under Labour, in 2008 non-doms were hit with a £30,000 charge if they had been resident in the UK for seven of the previous 10 years but chose to pay tax somewhere else. In its first year of operation this raised some £130million. Last year Mr Osborne announced that the annual levy charged on non-doms would be increased for those living here longer. Anyone resident here for seven of the last nine years keeps paying £30,000 a year, but the fee for those who have been here for 12 out of 14 years will rise to £60,000. For those who have been in Britain for 17 out of 20 years it will cost £90,000.","Shadow chancellor Ed Balls says he is 'absolutely looking' at non doms .

"Marine biologist: Diane Cowan has worked with lobster breeding since 1996 off the coast of New England . Sick of the snow, the ice and the brutal cold weather? Then spare a thought for Diane Cowan who has been stranded on a island off Maine for more than a month thanks to heavy ice. With no helicopter available to pull her out and crossing the mile stretch to the mainland on foot or in a vehicle too dangerous, marine biologist Cowan has been running low on supplies. Iced-in on Friendship Long Island for the past 32 days, Cowan was delivered from hunger pangs by friends who chartered a plane to drop food and supplies for her and her dog, as the winter shows no signs of ending anytime soon. Having spent the past 15-years on the island where her nonprofit Lobster Conservancy has a six-acre lobster pond, Cowan, 54, has said this winter is by far the worst she has known. 'I've been iced in for 32 days,' said Cowan to USA Today. 'The longest I've been trapped on the island before was two weeks.' 'I still don't know how much longer I'll be stuck here,' she said. Boats have been unable to leave Friendship Harbor for three weeks after this years painful winter that has seen temperatures rarely rise above freezing. While Cowan doesn't have running water she does have her dog, phone, a stove, electricity and the Internet. However, her friends began to worry about her and organized a care package which they dropped in by plane. All alone: Diane Cowan is seen here from the plane hired by her friends to air drop supplies to Friendship Long Island over the weekend . Relief is on the way: Friends of Diane Cowan load up their plane with coffee and fresh meat and dog food . Friends to the rescue: Bob Lary - shoving the first box out the window  while the temperatures stood at minus 10 degrees . Remote: Diane Cowan is currently working on Friendship Long Island - which is visible in this picture as the furthest speck on the archipelago . They loaded three boxes with food and hired a pilot to fly over the two mile long and half-mile wide island so they could get low enough to drop the boxes safely. The temperature was a chilly minus 12 degrees when they made the drop. 'The pilot was awesome,' said Bob Lary to USA Today. 'He did a couple of flyovers and got his bearings, (then) opened the window and said, 'Chuck it.' And I did, twice.' While the first box hit the roof of one of the buildings on the island, the second one made a perfect landing. 'I was thrilled, absolutely thrilled,' said Cowan to the Bangor Daily News. 'And I also like the idea this could be done because it gives a whole new dimension to getting stuff out here longer term.' Diane usually stocks up with two months of food to be on the safe side when she departs for the winter and keeps herself warm with a wood fire and solar panels for electricity. But next year she says she is going to bring along a small box of treats which she will label, 'Don't open until February', just to be on the safe side.

"UKIP supporters have been labelled 'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists' and one fan of Nigel Farage is doing little to dispel the idea. Jill, 59, a former nurse from Poole in Dorset, has told a Channel 5 documentary that she believes in angels and thinks the European Union plans to kill people with guillotines. She believes UKIP leader Farage, 50, is our only hope. Scroll down for video . Jill, pictured left at her home in Poole, believes UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured right at his party's spring conference in Margate last week, has been sent from god to save us from a foreign invasion .

'God says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood, I'll send someone to give you some protection. 'I think Nigel Farage is sent to protect us against the EU, he wants to bring England back to the English people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders.' Offering her thoughts on why the EU is such a threat, Jill said: 'What Nigel Farage will do by getting us out of the EU is to stop their plans to microchip our people. Jill told a Channel 5 documentary that she thinks the EU have 'death vans' and they will cut people's heads off with guillotines if they refuse to have microchips fitted . 'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.' Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies. She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M. The former nurse is a fan of bondage and says many UKIP supporters share her passion for S&M . Jill is pictured demonstrating her hobby and is grateful Brits can now be more open about their sex lives . She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage.

I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage. 'I do think that Nigel Farage has bought a new era and openess to England where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked.' The bondage enthusiast also believes UKIP can enhance the NHS by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it, like herself. 'I have been a nurse most of my life, I have my views about the NHS. I think people who need big breasts, who need their nose done, should receive help from the state,' Jill said. 'I think Nigel should look into this. I want big breasts. I have seen my surgeon and I am going to have implants. 'I think I should get them on the NHS.

"Many consumers buy 'green' or organic household products in the belief they are safer and kinder to the environment. But many of these products also contain cancer-causing chemicals, a new study has warned. Australian researchers found that common products marketed as ‘green’, ‘all-natural’, ‘non-toxic’ and ‘organic’ emit compounds that could harm health and air quality. At this time, consumer products sold in Australia, the US and around the world are not required to list all ingredients, or any ingredients in a chemical mixture called 'fragrance'. This means consumers cannot check what the item contains and whether it is potentially dangerous. Household items marketed as 'green', 'organic', 'all-natural’ and ‘non-toxic’ could still emit compounds that damage health, a study has warned . The researchers analysed 37 different products, such as air fresheners, cleaning products, laundry supplies and personal care products found all over the world, including those that claimed to be ‘green’ or ‘organic’. Then, they investigated the number of volatile organic compounds (VOC) the products emitted. VOCs are a large group of carbon-based chemicals that easily evaporate and get into the air at room temperature. They can cause short term health effects including irritating the throat and mouth, causing dizziness and can make conditions like asthma worse. In the long term, exposure to these compounds has been linked with an increased risk of cancer, liver damage, kidney damage and damage to the nervous system. The reseachers found 156 different VOCs emitted from the products, with an average of 15 VOCs per product. Of these 156 VOCs, 42 are classified as toxic or hazardous under US federal laws, and each product emitted at least one of these chemicals. They found the cancer-causing pollutants were found in many of the fragranced ‘green’ products . And they were just as damaging as those from regular chemical products that aren't marketed as organic, researchers said. The most common chemicals in fragranced products were terpenes, which were not in fragrance-free versions. Researchers analysed 37 household products and found they all emitted volatile organic compounds (pictured). These are chemicals that get into the air easily and have been linked with cancer and liver damage . Terpenes react very quickly with ozone (a pale blue gas found in the air) to generate pollutants such as formaldehyde and ultrafine particles, the researchers said. The researchers also warned that fewer than three per cent were disclosed product labels or product information. Lead author Professor Anne Steinman, of Melbourne School of Engineering, said this means the public is unable to check which chemicals their household products contain. She said: 'The paradox is that most of our exposure to air pollutants occurs indoors and a primary source is consumer products. ‘But the public lacks full and accurate information on the ingredients in these products. ‘Our indoor air environments are essentially unregulated and unmonitored. ‘Given the lack of information, consumers may choose products with claims such as green, natural, or organic, but those claims are largely untested.’","Experts analysed 37 household products including those billed as 'green'

"Lawsuit: The family of 13-year-old Jahi McMath (pictured) are suing the hospital where she went brain dead after a routine surgery in December 2013 . The family of a 13-year-old girl who was declared brain-dead after her sleep apnea operation went awry filed a medical malpractice lawsuit on Tuesday detailing the emotional, chaotic hospital drama that included a court battle over ending life support. Jahi McMath's family is seeking unspecified damages from UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland in the case filed in Alameda County Superior Court. They claim the hospital botched Jahi's operation on December 9, 2013; didn't respond properly and promptly to dramatic signs of post-operative distress; and badgered the family to end life support and donate Jahi's organs, even though her heart kept beating. Jahi was declared brain-dead on December 12, 2013, after three different medical experts agreed the teen showed no brain activity. During a court fight, the hospital kept Jahi on life support long enough for the family to move her to an undisclosed facility in New Jersey, which allows families to reject a declaration of brain death on religious grounds and lets patients remain connected to ventilators. She remains at the facility. The hospital declined to comment on the lawsuit. 'Our hearts go out to the McMath family,' hospital spokeswoman Melinda Krigel said. 'It is our policy not to comment on pending litigation.' The lawsuit alleges that the hospital's first misstep was recommending a 'complex and risky' operation to cure Jahi's sleep apnea rather than first trying a safer treatment. Then, during the surgery, a doctor noted that Jahi had a condition that could result in post-operative bleeding but failed to notify nurses and others responsible for her care after surgery, the suit states. Jahi's parents say they were given conflicting advice shortly after surgery when they reported their daughter was coughing up blood. Left behind: McMath's family is suing the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland for unspecified damages. Pictured above, Marvin and McMath's mother Nailah Winkfield outside the hospital on January 1, 2014 . Complaint: During a court fight, the hospital (seen above on January 2, 2014) kept Jahi on life support long enough for the family to move her to an undisclosed facility in New Jersey, which allows families to reject a declaration of brain death on religious grounds and lets patients remain connected to ventilators. She remains at the facility. One nurse gave them a suction device to clear blood from Jahi's mouth, and another nurse told the parents not to suction the blood, according to the lawsuit. Nurses and doctors are accused of failing to react quickly enough to the bleeding, which the lawsuit says led to Jahi going into cardiac arrest and suffering brain death. The family alleges that hospital administrators failed to explain what happened to Jahi, and that that Dr. David Duran, the hospital's pediatric chief, slammed his fist on a table and said, ''what is it that you don't understand? She is dead, dead, dead, dead.''","Jahi McMath was declared brain-dead after a surgery to fix her sleep apneat a the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man  to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay. Stomach-churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group's de facto capital Raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim. With the baying crowd clambering on to rooftops to get a better view of the savage scene, the blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death. Barbarians: Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay . Horror: The blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death . Sick: The stomach-churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group's de facto capital Raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim . The images were released by local activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the ISIS stronghold to expose the terror group's atrocities. The photographs carry the distinctive yellow logo of ISIS' propaganda wing Al Hayat Media Centre, suggesting they come from an as-yet unreleased video of the savage murder. The photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run-down building in the west of the city, which ISIS captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the Syrian Civil War. So many people are seen in the streets to watch the man being thrown to his death that vehicles are unable to pass, although it appears the militants have erected metal railings to keep the crowds in line, giving a chilling sense of order to the savagery. The blindfolded victim - who is understood to be in his 20s - is seen being dragged to the top of the building by three black-masked militants while two armed but undisguised fighters stand at their side using mobile phones to film the gruesome murder. The next image shows the man plunging to his death, falling face first from behind a white metal railing towards the ground several stories below.

Bloodthirsty: The photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run-down building in the west of the city, which ISIS captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the Syrian Civil War . The horrific murder is just the latest example of ISIS throwing men accused of being gay to their death. In December ISIS released their first images of the shocking punishment as part of a release that also showed men accused of rape being crucified and left for dead in the centre of Raqqa. Similar images emerged in January and early February of men being thrown from 'the highest point in the city' following accusations of homosexuality. In a horrific twist, both of these men somehow survived the fall but were then stoned to death by the crowds gathered below. And just last week another young man was thrown off a roof and stoned to death after being accused of homosexuality. Following a trial in an Islamic State court, the man was taken to the roof of the building and thrown to his death in front a large crowd below. The man was described as a 'child of Lot' and accused of committing acts of sodomy. Lot is referred to in the Bible and the Qur'an, where it is claimed the people of Sodom and Gomorrah carried out sinful acts and were severely punished by God. The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme. He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.","Young man was thrown from  a building in the terror group's 'capital city'

"A Fort Worth, Texas elementary school has come under fire from parents who claim certain teachers and administrators have cultivated a 'toxic' environment for their children. At a Monday board meeting, parents turned out to support Kourtney Glaser, the former vice principal at Comanche Springs Elementary School in the Eagle Mountain-Saginaw Independent School District, who was placed on administrative leave after she experienced heavy vaginal bleeding that the school claims was caused by 'severe anxiety.' Glaser, 31, and her doctors, have firmly stated the bleeding, which occurred during a district training session and required Glaser to seek immediate medical attention, was the result of an intrauterine device being lodged in her uterine wall. This was just the beginning of the parents complaints as well, as they also voiced their concern over 'staff drinking,' the 'use of disparaging nicknames for teachers, parents and even children,' and a principal who has been reassigned after her 'bullying tactics.' Scroll down for video . Kourtney Glaser (above), the vice principal at Comanche Springs Elementary School in Fort Worth, Texas was placed on leave because she had vaginal bleeding . Once parents got wind of this news, many rallied behind Glasser, and seemed to place most of the blame on the principal, Katy Maurer (above in leopard print top) According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Glaser was forced to go to the emergency room on January 28 when she began suddenly bleeding, and two days later had her device removed to stop the trauma. She was not allowed to return to work however, and instead placed on leave after receiving a letter shortly after that said her bleeding had occurred on multiple occasions and was the result of 'severe anxiety.' On top of this, she was told she would need to see two doctors and sign a waiver releasing her medical records before she would be allowed to return to work. The letter also claimed she had trouble speaking in front of large groups, something Glasser denied in an interview with ABC 8. At this point, some parents at the school became aware of the situation, and seemed to place the blame on Katy Maurer, the principal of the school. The situation then became even further complicated when just last week Maurer filed a police report claiming she was being harassed by an employee at the school and her husband. The name of the employee was not released, but it was revealed to be someone who was on leave. In her report, Maurer claimed this employee had posted 'very hateful things' about her on social media, and that these posts had led to national attention. The employee also reportedly referred to Maurer as an 'idiot,' while the employee's husband is accused in the report of stalking Maurer, coming to the school unannounced, following her to restaurants, and showing up at her home. Maurer, 34,said this has been going on for close to five weeks. The district said it is examining the claims, while a lawyer for Glaser, Brittany Lannen, all but admitted she was the woman named in the report, saying; '“Once the aggressor is caught, they attempt to play the victim. Thankfully with today’s technology and social media, Ms. Maurer’s false accusations can easily be dismissed with a quick view of Mrs. Glaser’s social media.' She also added that Glaser's husband was not ever told he could not be on school grounds. Maurer, meanwhile, has been reassigned to another school in the district. 'It was a very sad situation,' said retired teacher Carol Smith. “ . Smith then said of Maurer; 'She was hired against the recommendation of the committee, and I felt like I was working with a person in the seventh grade.' Parents brought up Glaser's situation at a meeting Monday (above), along with staff drinking on campus and the use of disparaging nicknames for students . The district said it is investigating the leadership and these incidents at the school (above) PTA member Jennifer Jordan said that Maurer tries to exercise too much control over how decisions are made at the school, claiming she 'has tried to remove PTA leaders, and has said she only wants people she likes on the board.' There were also claims at Monday's meeting that Maurer had 'misused PTA travel funds for personal entertainment.' 'My daughter is stuck in a horrible situation at Comanche Springs,' said Chad Ferguson. 'I want my kids to grow up and feel like when something is not right, they have an obligation to try and make it right without fear of retribution.' In a statement released last Friday, the district said; 'The administration of Eagle Mountain-Saginaw ISD is very aware of the concerns surrounding the leadership team at Comanche Springs Elementary, and is actively working toward a resolution.'","Kourtney Glaser, a vice principal at Comanche Springs Elementary School in Fort Worth, Texas was placed on leave because she had vaginal bleeding .

"The Japanese invented one of the world's favourite foods, sushi, and are mad on their iPhones. Combine the two, thought one mad-cap Japanese designer and businessman, and we'll have the perfect item - the sushi phone. By crafting perfect imitations of Japanese food to adorn iPhone covers Masatatsu Kajikawa says he is helping iPhone fans watch videos on their handsets with ease as the sushi doubles as a stand, while making a style statement. The fake sushi looks incredibly realistic, such as this giant piece clasped to a fan's ear (left) and a fried shrimp sushi model on in iPhone cover (right) This piece of sushi roll looks almost good enough to eat - but it's actually made by fake food artisans . You can certainly believe creator Masatatsu Kajikawa when he says: 'I love sushi so very, very much' The food items such as chunky maguro tuna sushi help the iPhone to stand upright and facilitate the phones use of as a mini monitor says Kajikawa, who also runs a kerosene heater factory near Osaka when he's not creating new start-ups. Crafted in the fashion of customised mobile cases - a style Japanese call decoden - the 33-year- old designer wanted to celebrate 16 years since the birth of the mobile internet revolution in Japan and his love of sushi. 'I love sushi so very, very much, so my passion for raw fish made me want to create these cases, for sushi lovers all over the world. 'I think everyone can have a laugh just looking at these funny crazy cases,' he said. Mr Kajikawa's case covers are made by the same fake food artisans who create the realistic displays of food outside some restaurants in Japan to entice customers inside. Such displays are also a gift to non-Japanese speaking visitors who would otherwise be clueless about the diner's menu. So realistic and appealing are some of the items that a tourist trade has sprung up around collectors who want to take the plastic food home with them. Once made from wax, now high quality plastic resin is used instead and carefully sculpted to look like the actual dishes. You can really stand out from the crowd with these accessories, like this copy of amaebi, or sweet shrimp . Customisation of phones, known as decoden, is big business in Japan - though sushi isn't always involved . 'Each iPhone case is handmade so I won't be producing a lot of them,' says Mr. Kajikawa. 'But I hope to have them on the market next month through Amazon; selling a few thousand every month.' He has so far come up with a few sushi favourites as well as other Japanese standards such as deep fried prawns and hamburger steaks. Personalised customisation of phones, known as decoden, is big business in Japan. It took off at about the same time as the launch of the world's first commercial mobile internet service by Docomo, called i-mode, 16 years ago this month. Years ahead of its time with mobiles that made foreign competition look like toddler's toys, Docomo's imode and its phones were the forerunners of today's apps and app-ecosystems. Worth in the region of 10 billion yen a year decoden, a portmanteau of 'decoration' and the Japanese word for phone 'denwa, is crossing Japan's borders into Asia and inspiring smart phone personalisation elsewhere. 3-D printing has added new opportunities to the personalisation of phones, tablets and other electronics, enabling designers to make perfect renditions of their work at a fraction of the cost of hand crafting. High quality plastic resin is carefully sculpted to look like actual sushi, then attached to the phones . 'When you're living in Tokyo surrounded by 30 million familiar faces, you value things which help you stand out' So those Japanese with more dash than cash are learning how to achieve a blinged-out look DIY-style, while demanding more from their pocket rockets – in Japan it's a wallet, a TV, a teacher, opens doors, as well as a style statement. 'Japan has a culture of charms and trinkets ('omamori' etc) which mobile phones bring into the 21st century. Add to that, Japanese (especially young Japanese) put more effort into display. 'When you're living in Tokyo surrounded by 30 million familiar faces, you value things which help you stand out, even if it's a small and innocuous trinket,' says Graham Brown of the consultancy Total Youth Research. Some are given to lavishly decorating their phones with Swarovski gems or a $70 Chanel-designed strap for their beloved phones. Others look to brands like cute food-like-accessories maker Q-pot that sells thousands of its melted chocolate-themed covers at $50 a go. Commuters often yank out their cell phones to reveal sweet-like mascots hanging from the antennae, heart-shaped decoils, even hand painted butterflies. They also sport personalised screen savers, ringtones and dabbled with changeable faceplates. Japan has a culture of charms and trinkets, known as omamori', which phones bring into the 21st century . You can even get sushi-shaped earrings and a key-ring - all part of the bizarre Japanese craze . Japan has become so mad about its mobiles they have even slowed the national walking pace as the nation peers into their hand-helds to check their emails and surf the net. The country practically invented the smartphone and the mobile internet 16 years ago this month - long before the iPhone and even Wikipedia existed. Leaving the market for Japanese mobile phone technology in the doldrums Docomo was good at pulling it all together in Japan but when the operators and manufacturers exported their ideas they stumbled because they weren't very good at building relationships with foreign carriers,' says Mr Brown on why Japan was unable to capitalise on its its head start with smartphones and mobile internet. But Japan remains queen of the decodenas, as its mobiles receive makeovers that would make Laurence Llewellyn Bowen blush. 'It's all about love' says the manager of Japan's biggest mobile accessory outfit – and it might be coming to a deserving smartphone near you soon.","Perfect imitations of Japanese food adorn iPhone covers in bizarre craze .

"A British flight attendant has been questioned by police in Dubai after his apartment was identified as the source of a fire which ripped through more than 100 homes. Residents fled in their pyjamas and some were barefoot as they navigated burning debris falling from the Marina Torch tower - one of the world's tallest residential buildings - in the early hours of February 21. Police have pinpointed the source of the blaze to an apartment belonging to a British national who works as cabin crew for an airline, local news websites have reported. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: The fire broke out at about 2am local time on February 21 on the north-east end of the densely populated district . Devastation: Westleigh Flynn's apartment has been deemed uninhabitable following the fire on February 21 . Blaze: Residents fled in their pyjamas and some were barefoot as they navigated burning debris falling from the Marina Torch tower . General Khalil Ibrahim Al Mansouri, head of the Criminal Investigation Department, told 7DAYS the man had been questioned but not arrested, but did not give a cause of the fire. He said: 'The fire started in his flat and it’s routine procedure to question him and his family, who were inside the flat.' The man was with his wife  on the 51st floor at the time but no criminal activity is suspected,The National reports. More than 100 apartments in the 86-storey, 330-metre-tall skyscraper - a new tower in the expat-heavy Marina district of the city - have been condemned and many stricken residents are still homeless. Some are staying with friends and kind strangers while others have checked into hotels. Westleigh Flynn, 37, is still living out of a suitcase after his $1.4million (£900,000) duplex property on the 79th floor was damaged in the fire. Mr Flynn, who is originally from Dublin, Ireland and works as a hospitality investment consultant, was in London when the fire broke out but returned to Dubai to find devastation. His home, which he rents with his boss, is one of the 101 apartments to be condemned. He said: 'I was very lucky. A friend put me up for a couple of nights before I went to another friend. 'It's mostly water and smoke damage.' Luxury: This $1.4million (£900,000) duplex property on the 79th floor of the tower was damaged in the fire .

Debris: Mr Flynn tweeted this picture from inside his apartment, which is  uninhabitable following the blaze . Another Torch tower resident, who lived on the 81st floor with her sister, told MailOnline: 'We went back last week on Tuesday or Wednesday to check if the apartment was ok. 'Luckily, the water system did not go off and nothing was damaged. 'Sadly, we were there not to settle back in, but to take the basics of what we needed, turned off all non-necessary functioning electronics, emptied out the fridge and freezer and left for Abu Dhabi to stay with family. 'They did not feel that my sister and I were safe at the tower and want to know, as much as everyone else, what caused the fire. 'When we feel it is safe enough to go back, we will. 'Our neighbours apartment was badly burnt on the opposite side, where the fire climbed up. It's sad because they're a big family and now have to move else where.' Firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze in several hours after the fire alarm went off at around 2am local time. Residents of at least one neighbouring tower were told to evacuate as a precaution, but they were later allowed back inside. Disaster: The fire broke out in the Marina Torch tower on the northeastern end of the expat-heavy Marina district . Safety risk: Police blocked off areas around the Torch and debris from the fire cluttered nearby streets after the blaze was extinguished . Emergency services: Firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze in the 86-storey, 330 metre-tall skyscraper - a new tower in the expat-heavy Marina district of the city - in several hours after the fire alarm went off at around 2am local time . Video footage shows the blaze spreading through at least 15 floors as high winds whipped through the area, on the northeastern end of the densely populated Marina district. Debris from the fire cluttered nearby streets after the blaze was extinguished. Businesses and people living in nearby buildings came to the aid of the residents and the Italian embassy even sent chefs with pizza to raise their spirits. An evacuation centre was set up in a conference space in the nearby Princess Tower and as daylight broke, bystanders and residents could see that external cladding on the corners of the building were charred black and mangled for dozens of floors. Clean-up crews dressed in orange uniforms swept up pieces of shattered glass and other debris covering the street outside the building. Jannah Hotels & Resorts has since offered homeless residents free 20-day stays in luxury apartments. Chief executive Nehme Imad Darwiche told The National: 'Ten studios is what we can do, I wish we could do more. 'We owe it to each other to take care of our fellow citizens and I hope that others will follow our path.'

"Authorities have arrested a gunman suspected of randomly opening fire on five public places in Maryland over the past week, in attacks that left two  injured. What appears to be the same blue car had been linked to the attacks in which a gunman opened fire on a driver at a mall, a Walmart, a movie theater, a truck on a highway and headquarters of the NSA over the last seven days. If the same gunman is behind all the attacks, it would be a case with chilling similarities to the DC Sniper attacks of 2002 when John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed ten people with gunfire from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue Chevrolet sedan. Early morning reports on Wednesday revealed that a suspect was in custody who was believed to be involved in the shootings that occurred since last Tuesday in the Baltimore-Washington metro area, according to the Washington Post. Lt. Kevin Ayd, a spokesman for the Maryland Transportation Authority Police told the Baltimore Sun of the five shootings: 'They're looking into whether these are linked together.' So far, only two dump truck workers have been hurt in the attacks - they suffered only minor injuries when the gunfire shattered the windshield of their vehicle and by a bullet fragment. Scroll down for video . Five recent Maryland shootings that took place in public spaces may be connected to the same shooter, according to authorities briefed on the investigation. Police are searching for the same gray or blue Lincoln Town car that has been spotted near some of the crime scenes (the Lincoln Town car pictured above) If the same gunman is behind all the attacks, it would be a case with chilling similarities to the DC Sniper attacks of 2002 when John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed ten people with gunfire from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue Chevrolet sedan . Investigators are looking into whether one gunman is tied to the five incidents spread across three different Maryland counties: Anne Arundel, Prince George's and Howard (above map of where the shootings took place) The first shooting attack involved a 61-year-old man whose windows on his car were shot out as he was driving through the Arundel Mills shopping complex on February 24 around 7.30am.

The following Saturday, the footage of the Lincoln Town car was released, according to the Baltimore Sun. The surveillance video has captured the car but a license plate has not been determined nor has a clear identity of the shooter. Police were notified of a shooting at a Walmart in Laurel in the second reported shooting on Monday, March 2. That same day, a cleaning crew staff member reportedly heard gunshots around 5.10am at the AMC Theater at The Mall in Columbia. On Tuesday, a dump truck carrying the two Nelson Tree Specialist workers was traveling eastbound on the Intercounty Connector, also known as Route 200, when it was struck by gunshots coming from a nearby wooded area just before 3pm - in the fourth shooting. The attack left both passengers with non-life-threatening injuries leaving one injured from shattered glass and one bruised from a bullet fragment blocked by his clothing, according to the Washington Post. The surveillance video has captured the car (above) but a license plate has not been determined nor has a clear identity of the shooter . Only 12 miles away from the shooting on the ICC, an attack involving the National Security Agency in Fort Meade (above) occurred where several gunshots struck one of its office buildings around 5pm. No injuries to NSA personnel were reported, a spokesperson for the NSA told Daily Mail Online . Only 12 miles away, the most recent shooting occurred involving the National Security Agency in Fort Meade where several gunshots struck one of its office buildings around 5pm. No injuries to NSA personnel were reported, a spokesperson for the NSA told Daily Mail Online. Police spokeswoman Sgt. Lelani Woods said that the NSA reported damage to one of its buildings close to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on Tuesday. At the time, she said it is too early to determine whether the damage is related to the report of gunfire nearby. Investigators are looking into whether one gunman is tied to the five incidents spread across three different Maryland counties: Anne Arundel, Prince George's and Howard. Ballistic evidence has also suggested a possible link between the shootings, two anonymous sources told the Baltimore Sun. The FBI is coordinating the multi-jurisdiction investigation as it continues. The back-to-back shootings in Maryland on Tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002, when a sniper, John Allen Muhammad (left) and his 17-year-old accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo (right) terrorized the Washington, DC area in a series of seemingly random shootings . Back-to-back shootings in Maryland on Tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002, when a sniper terrorized the Washington, DC area in a series of seemingly random shootings. Ten people were killed and three injured in the 14 October shootings which authorities eventually connected to two perpetrators working in tandem. Shooter John Allen Muhammad and his 17-year-old accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo started their spree in February 2002, with murders in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas and Washington State. That cross-country spree resulted in the deaths of seven people and left seven injured. It was only in October though that the murders became more targeted on the Virginia and Maryland areas immediately surrounding DC - earning the name the Beltway sniper attacks. The attacks left DC residents afraid to leave their homes for weeks, since the nature of the shootings were random, and the shooter fired from a distance and never confronted his victims face to face. But Muhammad apparently grew tired of the anonymity and started leaving behind objects at the crimes scenes including a Tarot card inscribed with the phrase 'Call me God'. Muhammad and Malvo's reign of terror was finally brought to an end on October 24 when they were found sleeping in a car in Myersville, Maryland and taken into custody. The following September, Muhammad went on trial for his crimes and was sentenced to death. His accomplice Malvo testified at his trial saying the two planned to shoot six people a day for 30 days - though that plan failed. When Malvo went on trial, his attorneys painted him as being under the influence of Muhammad and therefore not as equal a partner in their crimes, which is perhaps the reason he received a lesser sentence of life in prison without parole. Muhammad was executed by lethal injection on November 10, 2009.","Police searching for gray or blue Lincoln Town car that could be linked to five shootings .

"She was a young woman who had her dreams of being a model ruined when she became the victim of an acid attack instigated by her ex-boyfriend in 2008. But fast-forward seven years and Katie Piper has achieved her wildest dreams - and more. She's penned an autobiography, presents the successful Channel 4 show, Bodyshockers, launched an inspirational charitable organisation and took to the runway in Naomi Campbell's recent fashion week show. And now, Katie, 31, is using her success story to help others by creating the first UK fashion catwalk that will include models with visible differences. Scroll down for video . Katie Piper is launching the UK's first catwalk featuring models with visible differences. The event, taking place at The Ideal Home Show, will call on people from her charity foundation as well as members of the public . Launching at the Ideal Home Show this month, Katie is challenging the conventional catwalk with the launch of 'Confidence - The Secret.' Speaking to FEMAIL about the initiative, she said: 'I am working with The Ideal Home Show as a fashion and beauty ambassador to launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from my foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity. It's all incredibly exciting.' The shows, which take place on  March 20, 21 and  April 3, have a twist. Those appearing on the catwalk will be bravely admitting what their true insecurities are, which aren’t always the obvious anxiety that people assume. Whether it be their height, their weight or colour of their hair, the representatives will be emphasising that what others assume to be their insecurity isn’t always the case. In her role as a fashion and beauty ambassador, Katie (pictured at one of her charity events) will launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from her foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity . Katie, who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008 when her ex-boyfriend employed an accomplice to throw a cup of industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face, is keen to reveal hers. 'You might look at me and think that's what I would be insecure about it, but it isn't,' she revealed. 'In fact, it's my height; I would love to be a bit taller.' In another UK first, Katie is also offering two people with visible differences the chance to join her catwalk. 'Anyone who would like to grace the catwalk and reveal their true insecurities simply needs to tweet a picture of their insecurity to me with the hashtag #KatiesSecret,' she said. Last month, Katie rocked the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity' Explaining the inspiration behind the show's name, Katie said: 'It's called Confidence - The Secret because confidence is something you can use to express yourself and convey yourself and it's something I've used through several periods of my life. 'It's not about trying to look and be perfect, it's about a positive mindset and being the best version of yourself that you can possibly be.' Katie, who  penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success. 'I can't express how important positive thinking is,' she said. 'When I was recovering from my attack, I would write lots of little powerful notes and stick them around the room. Before I walk onto the red carpet, I have a mantra and always repeat to myself ""inhale confidence, exhale doubt""; it really is so powerful. 'It's all about looking at what you do have and not what you don't.' Katie, who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008, says that despite what people may think, her height is her insecurity and she would love to be a little taller . Katie heeded her own advice recently when she took to the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'. Her catwalk coup kicked off what looks set to be a successful year for Katie. She's penning a new book, due out later this month, is working on a third series of Bodyshockers and has been busy growing her charity. If that wasn't enough, Katie is planning her wedding, mothering her one-year-old daughter and training for a triathlon, too. She added: 'No matter what you look like, you can live a full life and that's what I want to show with Confidence - The Secret.' Katie, far right, starred as one of Marks & Spencer's leading ladies in 2013 alongside (L-R) Save the Children chief executive Jasmine Whitbread, actress Dame Helen Mirren, Darcy Bussell, Helen Allen, Karen Elson, Tracey Emin and Monica Ali .

"Authorities are investigating a riot at a juvenile rehabilitation camp in rural western Nevada where two buildings were set on fire, four staff members hurt and 10 youths briefly escaped before they were recaptured over the weekend. No one was seriously injured, but one staff member at the Rite of Passage Silver State Academy near Yerington had to be treated at a local hospital after Saturday night's incident, Lyon County Sheriff Al McNeil said Tuesday. The state fire marshal is investigating the arsons, and Yerington Tribal Police are probing the cause of the riot — the fourth uprising in four months at the school for at-risk teens, McNeil said. The camp is on tribal land about 8 miles north of Yerington and 70 miles southeast of Reno. Out-of-control: Authorities are investigating a riot at a juvenile rehabilitation camp in northern Nevada where two buildings were set on fire, four staff members hurt and 10 youths briefly escaped before they were recaptured over the weekend . Destruction: The riot at the Rite of Passage Silver State Academy in rural Nevada at the weekend is the fourth uprising in four months at the school for at-risk teens. The 10 escapees have been recaptured . Six of the escapees were captured shortly after the riot that broke out about 8 p.m. Saturday, and the other four the next morning, he said. One building housing the laundry and another with a maintenance shop suffered an undetermined amount of fire damage. McNeil said he's increasingly concerned about the safety of the community and is pressing officials at the school to make changes so it doesn't happen again. 'I've had public safety concerns over the years because there is no fencing to keep them on the property,' McNeil told The Associated Press. 'They break into my citizens' homes and steal keys and steal cars. My community is at its wit's end right now.' 'This is rural Nevada, and every home has a gun. My biggest concern is one of these kids will go into a house at 2 a.m., and there will be a farmer or a rancher there — and we'll have a fatal shooting. In Nevada, that would be a justifiable homicide, but nobody wants to see that. 'We're all supportive of the program and want to see it succeed. But we need to find a way to do it better.' Investigation: No one was seriously injured, but one staff member at the Rite of Passage Silver State Academy had to be treated at a local hospital after the incident, said Lyon County Sheriff Al McNeil (pictured) The academy is a nonprofit, licensed and accredited charter school operated by the Rite of Passage Adolescent Treatment Centers and Schools, which is based in Minden, Nevada, and sponsored by California's El Dorado County Office of Education. Rick Wright, corporate human resources director for Rite of Passage, said he couldn't comment on details or the status of the youths who were involved because of confidentiality requirements regarding juveniles. 'We had an unpredictable situation,' Wright told the AP. 'We are studying the events of what happened so we can prevent them in the future.' 'We were well staffed up, but we've upped the staffing as a preventative measure,' he said Tuesday afternoon from Minden about 40 miles south of Reno. 'Operations have gone back to normal. Everything was back to normal by Sunday.' The school is required to have one staff member on site for every eight youths, 'and we were well in excess of that — approximately 3-to-1,' Wright said. He estimated that there were about 25 youths at the school at the time. He said he couldn't comment on what sparked the uprising. 'I'm not at liberty to say. It's still under investigation,' Wright said. Scene: A riot at the Rite of Passage facility in Yerington Saturday night resulted in two structure fires and 10 at-risk youth temporarily escaping . Officials for the El Dorado County Office of Education in Placerville, California, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. John Dibble, chairman of the school's advisory board, said school officials are considering changes to improve safety at the facility that opened in 1987. 'I'm devastated that once again we were a threat to the community, and that's not something we enjoy being,' he told KOLO-TV in Reno. The school's website said it provides counseling, educational, vocational and athletic programs for boys ages 14 to 17 'with a troubled past.' The majority are sent there on court orders as an alternative to prison. Rehab: The school's website said it provides counseling, educational, vocational and athletic programs for boys ages 14 to 17 'with a troubled past.' The majority are sent there on court orders as a prison alternative . According to a statement from school administrators, around 8pm Saturday, students started rioting . 'We are disappointed with the actions of a few of our students, and those responsible will be held accountable,' the school said in a statement on its website. 'We are still positive that our program benefits disadvantaged youth and will be evaluating future admissions.' Most of the youths are sent there from neighboring California, McNeil said. Yerington Tribal Police did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. McNeil said several youths 'made a bunch of improvised weapons,' but he had no further details about the incident or nature of the minor injuries. 'You break a table leg, and then you have a club,' McNeil said. There were three less serious riots during a two-day period at the school in December, he said.","Riot broke out 8pm Saturday at Rite of Passage Silver State Academy near Yerington in rural Nevada .

"Our ability to answer questions currently separates us from machines in the world of artificial intelligence. But researchers are working on algorithms to give computers this skill too. Now, scientists at Facebook have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer, if they can ever match human brainpower – but some of them are a bit tricky, meaning some people may fail them too. Scientists at Facebook (logo shown) have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer if they can ever match human brainpower – but some of them are a bit tricky, meaning some people may fail them too . The team from the social media firm’s AI lab in New York have come up with a list of 20 questions to separate humans from robots, because they say ‘many existing learning systems can currently not solve them.’ They test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language. 1) The first question of the 20 listed in the research paper was the simplest for a computer to answer. It is: . John is in the playground . Bob is in the office . Where is John? 2) A harder example for a computer to answer is a question that requires it to differentiate three separate arguments, such as: . Mary gave the cake to Fred. Fred gave the cake to Bill. Jeff was given the milk by Fred. Who gave the cake to Fred? Who did Fred give the cake to? What did Jeff receive? Who gave the milk? 3) Another task tested a machine's ability to perform simple counting operations by asking about the number of objects. For example: . Daniel picked up the football. Daniel dropped the football. Daniel got the milk. Daniel took the apple. How many objects is Daniel holding? 4) Basic deduction skills were tested by questions such as: . Sheep are afraid of wolves. Cats are afraid of dogs. Mice are afraid of cats. Gertrude is a sheep. What is Gertrude afraid of? 5) And reasoning about size was tested by this question: . The football fits in the suitcase. The suitcase fits in the cupboard. The box of chocolates is smaller than the football. Will the box of chocolates sit in the suitcase? The intelligent computers were tested on 20 questions in total, but none of them got a perfect score. The answers to the five examples listed, are shown above . The sometimes tricky questions test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language. A stock image of a perplexed person is shown . Some of the questions require machines to recall facts, while others need reasoning, or to count the number of objects, expressed in a written passage. The researchers say that humans should be able to score full marks. While you may have got one answer wrong, none of the seven computer learning programmes that Facebook tested got all 20 questions right. The experiment was designed to test whether a machine can answer questions ‘via chaining facts, simple induction, deduction and many more,’ the study published on arXiv says. Scientists are keen to create this ability so that humans can talk fluently with machines, which could lead to robots looking after the elderly and more intelligent websites, for example. The paper says: ‘One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to reasoning and natural language, in particular building an intelligent dialogue agent.’ The experts aim to ‘classify these tasks into skill sets, so that researchers can identify (and then rectify) the failings of their systems.’ The results of the test show that humans are still ahead of the game when it comes to interpreting the world’s subtleties and language. The questions are written in very clear and simple terms so there is still a way to go before computers catch us up.","Test was developed by experts at Facebook to test machines with AI .

"Dame Jane Goodall has condemned politicians for pushing 'Frankenstein Food' Dame Jane Goodall, the renowned primate expert, has condemned ‘deluded’ politicians for pushing ‘Frankenstein Food’. The highly respected academic has endorsed a new book, which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers. Historically, critics of GM food have been lambasted by the GM companies, scientists who rely on their funding, and politicians, including the UK Government, as being ‘anti-science’. However, Dame Jane argues that the advocates of GM food have ignored evidence of harm with the result it is they who are guilty of being ‘anti-science’. The intervention is a powerful condemnation of the way biotech companies like Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer, have forced GM crops and food on to dinner plates in the US without proper safety tests. And she is joining a growing campaign warning that Britain and Europe must not drop safeguards that have kept GM crops out. Dame Jane’s concerns have been raised in the foreword to a new book, ‘Altered Genes, Twisted Truth’, which is written by the American public interest lawyer, Steve Druker. Its publication comes as the US is seeing a growing backlash against GM. Just last week it emerged that the country’s favourite chocolate manufacturer, Hershey, is to drop GM from its products. Dame Jane said she has become appalled as what she calls a ‘shocking corruption of the life forms of the planet’. She said the GM process, which involves adding foreign genes to plants to create toxins to fend off insects or give them immunity to being sprayed with chemical pesticides has fundamentally changed them. However, she complains that supporters of the technology have committed a ‘fraud’ by trying to give the false impression that these new plants are essentially the same as those created by conventional plant breeding. She said: ‘This very real difference between GM plants and their conventional counterparts is one of the basic truths that biotech proponents have endeavoured to obscure. As part of the process, they portrayed the various concerns as merely the ignorant opinions of misinformed individuals – and derided them as not only unscientific, but anti-science. ‘They then set to work to convince the public and government officials, through the dissemination of false information, that there was an overwhelming expert consensus, based on solid evidence, that the new foods were safe. Yet this, as Druker points out, was clearly not true.’ Importantly, she claims, the companies have spread disinformation to try and win public support. ‘Druker describes how amazingly successful the biotech lobby has been – and the extent to which the general public and government decision makers have been hoodwinked by the clever and methodical twisting of the facts and the propagation of many myths. Moreover, it appears that a number of respected scientific institutions, as well as many eminent scientists, were complicit in this relentless spreading of disinformation.’ Dame Jane is considered to be the world’s foremost expert on chimpanzees. She is best known for her 55-year study of social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania. She was made a Dame in 2004 and holds many other awards for her environmental and humanitarian work, including the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science, the French Legion of Honour, the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science, Japan’ s Kyoto Prize and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement. The British government has signalled that it plans to use a new GM crop approval process to push ahead with growing the crops in this country. Separately, a new trade agreement between the EU and the USA, which is called TTIP, could make it much easier for GM foods from North America to appear on shelves here. However, Dame Jane warns it would be an enormous risk to accept the technology and describes Mr Druker as a hero worthy of a Nobel prize for lifting the lid on the truth about GM. Dame Jane endorsed a new book, which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers (file picture) She describes his work as one of the most important books of the last 50 years, and adds: ‘It will go a long way toward dispelling the confusion and delusion that has been created regarding the genetic engineering process and the foods it creates. ‘Although this book tells a story that’s in many ways distressing, it’s important that it has finally been told because so much confusion has been spread and so many important decision-makers have apparently been deluded.’ Mr Druker, who gave a press conference in London yesterday(wed), has challenged Britain’s Royal Society to apologies for its pro-GM stance and its part in rubbishing scientists who have safety doubts over the crops and food. His work points to research which has found tumours, liver and kidney harm in animals given GM feed in trials. And he complains, that researchers who dare to raise these problems have been pilloried. He said: ‘Contrary to the assertions of its proponents, the massive enterprise to reconfigure the genetic core of the world’s food supply is not based on sound science but on the systematic subversion of science – and it would collapse if subjected to an open airing of the facts.’ Pat Thomas, director of the campaigning group Beyond GM, warned the TTIP trade talks mean Britain and Europe could see a flood of biotech crops and food arriving here. She said: ‘Steven Druker’s investigation into the history of fraud and deceit that ushered in the era of GM deserves serious consideration before we take actions that will irreversibly alter the European food supply’. Dr Julian Little a spokesman for Bayer CropScience was not aware of Drunker's book. He said: 'We are now up to the three trillion meals and counting, that is meals containing GM ingredients, without a single substantial health issue since the beginning of the technology. 'There has been much dirt thrown but none of it has stuck.' On its website Monsanto say they place the 'highest priority' on the safety of their products and conduct 'rigorous and comprehensive testing on each.' They state: 'In fact, seeds with GM traits have been tested more than any other crops in the history of agriculture – with no evidence of harm to humans or animals. 'In addition, governmental regulatory agencies, scientific organizations and leading health associations worldwide agree on the safety of GM crops.' A spokesman for the company added: 'The denial of the safety of GM seeds and food ingredients is as baseless as the denial of clearly documented climate change. 'Countless peer-reviewed scientific studies performed with biotech crops — including more than 100 feeding studies — have confirmed their safety, as reflected in the respective safety assessments by regulatory authorities around the world.'","Dr Jane Goodall argues supporters of GM food ignored evidence of harm .

"Heart disease kills one in every six men and one in every 10 women in the UK . Don’t put it off because you can’t see it. Take a moment to consider your heart - the most precious of muscles. Cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people in 2012 - that's 30 per cent of all deaths. That’s enough to send your heart rate rocketing to a dangerous level – but the good news is there's a lot you can do to keep healthy. When it comes to keeping your heart in tip-top condition, there are some factors such as genetics that you can’t change. If you have a family history of heart disease, then you are at increased risk yourself. However, there is plenty you can do to decrease your risk whether you have a family tendency or not. Here are some simple changes you can start making today to reduce your risk of heart problems in the future... DITCH THE FAT-FREE DIET . You have probably been advised to cut out saturated fats and replace butter with unsaturated fat spreads. This is because a diet high in saturated fats is thought to be one factor that leads to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood... which in turn may cause narrowing of the arteries and heart attacks. However, there is now some controversy as to whether these dietary changes make much difference to your risk of heart disease. A recent overview of multiple studies found no evidence that restricting saturated fat and increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption lowered the risk of developing heart disease. The jury is still out on this one, and it shouldn’t be used as an excuse to eat high fat doughnuts, pastries, chips and other sources of processed, saturated fat. However, butter, cheese and cream in small quantities may not be the complete villains they were thought to be. Much-maligned butter may not be the dietary villain we once thought, says Dr Sally Norton . KNOW YOUR WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO . The association between heart disease and being overweight is extremely strong. Not least because obesity puts you at risk of type 2 diabetes which, in itself, increases the risk of heart disease and multiple other conditions. If you carry more weight around your waist than your hips you are even more at risk. To calculate your waist to hip ratio, divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement. A high ratio (over 0.85 for women or one for men) means increased risk of health problems such as heart attacks, high blood pressure or diabetes… even if you aren’t that overweight. Dr Sally Norton reveals her top tips to help people keep their hearts healthy. She notes the association between heart disease and being overweight is 'extremely strong', urging people to watch their waistlines . REALISE IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO GET ACTIVE . Don’t despair if you are a couch potato – it’s never too late to start. As well as helping with that weight loss, a recent study showed that you could get the same heart health benefits if starting exercise such as running or cycling after 40, as you would have done if you had started before the age of 30. There are numerous other benefits from exercise too…what are you waiting for? Say bye bye to the bacon and processed meat, to boost your heart health, Dr Norton advisesBUT . BUT SAY BYE-BYE TO BACON... Reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown that eating a large amount can increase heart failure by up to 24 per cent. However, recent evidence suggests that this is linked more to red meat that is processed (we’re talking ham, salami, sausages, bacon etc) – with no definite association shown with the consumption of unprocessed red meat. The researchers calculated that for each 50g of processed meat eaten per day (about one or two extra slices of ham) the risk of heart failure increased by eight per cent and the risk of death by 38 per cent. These results require confirmation with further studies but as processing can increase the risk of stomach disease too, it seems sensible to limit processed red meat wherever possible. ...AND CUT BACK ON SALT . The British Heart Foundation is clear that too much salt can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease later in life. Adults should have less than 6 grams (1 teaspoon) a day. Cutting back on salt doesn’t just mean keeping your hands away from the salt cellar when you are eating…there is also a lot of hidden salt in processed food. Check the labels and cook from scratch wherever possible – then you are in control. SAY NO TO SUGAR . A large population study in the US showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease. That was compared with those people who consumed less than 10 per cent of their calories each day through sugar, independent of other risk factors including weight. More and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic too, and as it offers no nutrients whatsoever. It is time to cut back. Gradually reduce the sugar you add to your food or drinks, avoid fizzy drinks and look carefully at labels – you will be amazed at how much sugar is added to all sorts of food, both sweet and savoury. A large study in the US revealed people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease . STRESS LESS . While you should be aware of keeping your heart healthy, don’t let it stress you out - as stress doesn’t help your heart either. The stress hormone ‘cortisol’ can increase unhealthy fat around the middle, raising your risk of heart problems, as well as leading to cravings for high fat and sugar foods, which only make things worse. BIN THE FAGS . The obvious one is to stop smoking. Smokers die 10 years earlier than non-smokers as shown in a study of one million UK women published last year. If you can stop smoking before you are 40, you are 10 times less likely to have health problems than if you continue. As well as benefiting your heart, you will see rapid improvements in your breathing, mood and reduce your risk of stroke, diabetes, cancer, circulation problems and numerous other problems. So, for a healthy and happy heart, start making a few small changes today – your heart will love you forever.

"The Med diet: People who adopted the eating plan were 47 per cent less likely to develop heart disease over a 10 year period . A Mediterranean diet is more protective against heart disease than exercise, a new study has revealed. Those who stuck to the diet, consisting of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, olive oil, fish and even a glass of red wine were 47 per cent less likely to develop heart disease over a 10 year period. The study, from Harokopio University in Athens, is the first to track 10-year heart disease risk in a general population. Most previous studies have focused on middle-aged people. The study, presented at the American College of Cardiology's annual conference, is based on data from a representative sample of more than 2,500 Greek adults, . Aged between 18 to 89, they provided researchers with health information on themselves each year from 2001 to 2012. Nearly one in five of the men and 12 per cent of the women developed or died from heart disease, including stroke, coronary heart disease and heart attack. The researchers scored participants' diets on a scale from 1 to 55 based on their self-reported frequency and level of intake from 11 food groups. Those who scored in the top-third in terms of adherence to the Mediterranean diet were 47 percent less likely to develop heart disease over the 10-year follow-up period (compared to participants who scored in the bottom-third). Each one-point increase in the dietary score was associated with a three percent drop in heart disease risk. This difference was independent of other heart disease risk factors including age, gender, family history, education level, body mass index, smoking habits, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. Women tended to follow the Mediterranean diet more closely than men, the researchers noted. Study author, Professor Demosthenes Panagiotakos, said: 'Our study shows the Mediterranean diet is a beneficial intervention for all types of people in both genders, in all age groups, and in both healthy people and those with health conditions. 'Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was more protective than physical activity. 'It also reveals the Mediterranean diet has direct benefits for heart health, in addition to its indirect benefits in managing diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure) and inflammation. Protective: The Mediterranean diet comprises fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, olive oil, fish and red wine . 'Because the Mediterranean diet is based on food groups that are quite common or easy to find, people around the world could easily adopt this dietary pattern and help protect themselves against heart disease with very little cost.' The researchers admitted that because the study was limited to Greeks living in the Athens area it might not reflect the health patterns of other countries. But they did point out that urbanised Greeks were eating a more western diet, similar to that of Americans. The analysis also confirmed results of previous studies indicating that male gender, older age, diabetes and a measure of inflammation are associated with an increased risk for heart disease. Earlier research has shown that following the traditional Mediterranean diet is linked to weight loss, reduced risk of diabetes, lower blood pressure and lower blood cholesterol levels, in addition to reduced risk of heart disease.","Greeks who followed the diet were 47% less likely to develop heart disease .
