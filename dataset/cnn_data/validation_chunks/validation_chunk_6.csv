"(CNN)German investigators found antidepressants in the apartment of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz this week, according to published reports. Die Welt, a German newspaper, cited an unidentified senior investigator who said Lubitz suffered from a severe ""psychosomatic illness"" and German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a ""severe subjective burnout syndrome"" and from severe depression, the source told Die Welt. The New York Times also reported that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. CNN has not been able to confirm the reports. Investigators continued to work Saturday to piece together the secret life of Lubitz, who officials say was hiding an illness from his employers. He had been declared ""unfit to work"" by a doctor. They were expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable co-pilot to steer a jetliner into a mountainside on Tuesday. As their efforts continued, dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains. There were 150 people on board Germanwings Flight 9525, including Lubitz. Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with some media reports speculating that he may have had mental health issues. Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The note, Kumpa said, had been ""slashed."" Just what was ailing Lubitz hasn't been revealed. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A subsequent New York Times report on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. According to those unnamed officials, Lubitz also was being treated for psychological issues. Other media reports indicate he was treated for depression. Lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health, and that if Lubitz had vision problems that would have been discovered during the tests. ""We can't believe it. If anything was wrong with his eyes during the physical exam we would have known,"" the official says. The Lufthansa official also said the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own  he would have been required to self-report if he had been deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, ""concerning a diagnosis."" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. German investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they can reveal what they gleaned from the records found in the apartment and at his parents' home in the town of Montabaur. But the fact that investigators found ""ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,"" prosecutors said. Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. Authorities left Lubitz's apartment Friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside. Dusseldorf police said Saturday that a small team of French investigators had arrived in the city and that they were sharing information. Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, told French TV from Dusseldorf that the French team would work in ""full transparency"" with their German counterparts. ""We will interview people related to the investigation in the coming days. The hearings will be conducted in the coming days and weeks,"" he said, according to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. Asked by a journalist about reports of Lubitz's possible mental illness, he replied: ""The elements of the investigation are strictly confidential and we cannot address these matters today."" No scenario can yet be ruled out, including mechanical failure, ""as we do not have the necessary evidence,"" he said. The German tabloid newspaper Bild said Saturday it had interviewed an ex-girlfriend of Lubitz. The woman is not named in the story and CNN has not been able to verify the report independently. According to Bild, the ex-girlfriend said Lubitz was a very nice and sensitive man who needed a lot of care and attention, and he was very troubled. She said he would get into fights with her. The newspaper also cited the ex-girlfriend as saying that Lubitz had bad dreams that his plane was going down. Patrick Sondenheimer was the pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, according to Reiner Sondenheimer of Dusseldorf, Germany, who says he is a relative of Patrick's. Patrick Sondenheimer is the pilot believed to have been locked out of the cockpit by his co-pilot, Lubitz. CNN spoke to Reiner Sondenheimer at his Dusseldorf apartment. Also at the apartment was a woman who did not provide her name but said she was Patrick Sodenheimer's relative. That woman also said that Patrick Sondenheimer was on the doomed flight. Reiner Sondenheimer declined to say anything else, other than the family wanted time to grieve. The pilot has not been named by German authorities. Another Germanwings pilot who once flew with Lubitz, Frank Woiton, told WDR, a local broadcaster belonging to CNN's German affiliate ARD, that his impression of Lubitz was that he was ""friendly"" and that there was ""nothing suspicious."" Woiton also said Lubitz ""was a good pilot and had a good command of the plane."" Woiton's first job after he found out about the crash was the route Dusseldorf-Barcelona-Dusseldorf -- the same route as had been taken by Germanwings Flight 9525 a day earlier. He was praised in German media for the emotional announcement he made to passengers before takeoff, in which he said the crew, like everyone else on the plane, wanted to get home safely to their families. At the scene of the crash, two helicopters were being deployed above the mountainside by recovery crews Saturday. The weather has improved after high winds Friday made their complex task even more treacherous. Lt. Col. Xavier Vialenc, a spokesman for the Gendarmerie, told CNN there were about 40 officers at the crash site Saturday. Once at the crash site, recovery workers spend all day working there, he said. Back in Seyne-les-Alpes at the end of the day, they can see a psychologist if they choose and have a debriefing session with all the workers. Vialenc said the operations were going well so far and that the progress made was meeting their expectations. Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations at Seyne-les-Alpes, told CNN on Friday that rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site, but few of them are intact. It could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered, identified and released to the families, authorities said. What could have prompted Lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft, killing everyone on board, remains the focus of investigators in Germany. He had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013, said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Spohr also told reporters that Lubitz had ""interrupted"" his pilot training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but added that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Spohr didn't give a reason for the break. While the ailment Lubitz had sought treatment for hasn't been revealed, that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail, aviation analysts say. Pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they're found unfit, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. It could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit, authorities say. Lubitz was the co-pilot on Tuesday's flight between Barcelona, Spain, and Dusseldorf when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit, then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain. Germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing. The only sounds, authorities said, were those of pounding on the cockpit door, Lubitz's steady breathing and, eventually, screaming passengers. Lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant, authorities say. Most were from Germany and Spain. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims .

"(CNN)A decision last week to ax the popular University of Mississippi Chancellor Dan Jones rippled into Wednesday with demonstrations at the Oxford campus, powerful alumni denouncing the decision and wealthy donors threatening to withhold funding to the school. ""It's a damn shame,"" Ole Miss alumnus Kelly English said about the decision, which he says felt like a ""gut punch."" English, a chef and restaurateur who has met the chancellor, called Jones ""a man of integrity"" who ""cares deeply about the university."" While the state board that voted not to renew his contract, which expires in September, cited ""concerns centered on financial issues at the University of Mississippi Medical Center,"" the chancellor's advocates feel something sinister is at play. Jones was magnanimous in his response, saying that while he was disappointed not to be granted another four-year term, he was proud of his accomplishments and every disagreement he had with the board was the product of both parties trying to do what's best for the school. The financial issues at UMMC, though, were only part of the problem, he wrote. ""I was informed a key concern for the board was my relationship to board members and the Commissioner and my unwillingness to adjust to the board's desired governance structure,"" he wrote. ""Over the last couple of years, I have expressed concern and disagreement with the board in some areas, including the funding allocation plan that distributes state funds to various public universities, business issues at the medical center, and responsibility for managing the selection process for the position of vice chancellor to lead the medical center."" Jones has been at the university's helm since 2009, when he took over for another popular leader, Robert Khayat, who retired. To hear Jones' supporters tell it, he's ushered in an era of unprecedented GPAs, test scores, enrollment and fund-raising, including three straight years of nine-figure gifts to the school. But he also took stands that ruffled many at the 167-year-old university. Among those were measures aimed at dissociating the school from its Confederate history -- the university athletics teams are the Rebels -- including asking the band to stop playing the fight song ""From Dixie With Love."" Under his tenure, the university also adopted a black bear as its mascot to replace Colonel Reb, a caricature of a plantation owner that had been removed as mascot in 2003. ""He did amazing things for inclusion,"" English said. ""He tried to rid Ole Miss of the good ol' boy network."" Unfortunately for his alma mater, English said, that good ol' boy network ""caught (Jones) in Jackson."" When the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning -- fresh on the heels of Jones completing a reportedly successful round of chemotherapy for his lymphoma -- decided in a 9-2 decision not to renew his contract, the outcry was loud (though the board and Jones concur the decision was unrelated to his health). A protest Wednesday brought more than 2,500 Jones supporters to the Lyceum, event co-organizer Alex Borst said. It's the university's oldest building, which is located in the middle of campus and houses administrative offices. Borst, a sophomore International Studies major, said the board's decision has left him and his classmates ""confused."" ""Chancellor Jones has always made himself available to students and always done what's in our best interest,"" Borst said. Khayat and famous alumni -- such as former New Orleans Saints quarterback (and Peyton and Eli's dad) Archie Manning and author John Grisham -- decried the move, as did numerous university groups, including the Faculty Senate, Staff Council, Alumni Association and Black Student Union. Supporters also quickly assembled a Facebook page, Twitter feed, website and even a GoFundMe page to cover the costs of protests, all pronouncing ""I Stand With Dan,"" which has been adopted as a hashtag for the movement. Nic Lott was the university's first African-American president in 2000-2001.  He took to Twitter to express his discontent with Jones' firing, calling him a ""great leader who made tough decisions."" ""In my opinion, they've made an unforgivable decision,"" said alumnus Jim Barksdale, the former Netscape CEO billed by The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson as the university's most generous donor (he's reportedly given $30 million in the last decade and a half). And that decision could cost the university at least $20 million from one donor alone, as the newspaper reports that Anthony Papa, president of the Gertrude C. Ford Foundation, said he would not move forward with the grant for a new science building if Jones wasn't reinstated. The Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning said in a news release that while it had no concerns regarding Jones' integrity or honesty, the majority of members simply could not find ""a path forward to renewal."" ""Dr. Jones has provided strong leadership in many facets of the University of Mississippi during his tenure. However, the Board cannot overlook its longstanding concerns regarding the business and financial affairs at UMMC,"" the Saturday statement said. Borst said this explanation hasn't given Ole Miss students enough information to understand why Jones won't be reinstated. ""They have to be hiding something, because they aren't giving us all the information,"" he said. CNN reached out to Jim Borsig, Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning's commissioner,  for comment. He has not yet replied. Jones has no intention of retiring or resigning before September, according to his statement.","State board voted 9-2 last week not to renew contract for Chancellor Dan Jones .

"(CNN)The emotional two-hour season finale of Fox's ""Glee"" went full circle from the show's roots to the future, reminding Gleeks why they fell in love with the musical sitcom. Few would disagree that the show's first season was its best, winning over a dedicated fan base who stuck with the show through an uneven six seasons and the loss of star Cory Monteith. For its final episode Friday night, the show that made it cool to join the high school glee club focused on core characters introduced in the first season. The first hour of Friday's season finale, aptly titled ""2009,"" was a retelling of the first episode, which included a memorable performance of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" by the original members of William McKinley High School's glee club. Instead of telling it again through Finn's perspective, the finale showed what led the other characters to join New Directions, culminating in an edited version of the performance that packed an emotional punch by featuring Monteith. The second hour brought us to the present day, with Will passing New Directions on to Sam so he can take charge of McKinley High as a fine arts school. We saw the characters' dreams come true in a requisite flash-forward to the future: Rachel (now married to Jesse) wins a Tony Award; Mercedes sings with Beyonce; Kurt and Blaine are successful Broadway stars; and most amazing of all, Vice President Sue Sylvester starts her second term in the Jeb Bush administration. The entirety of New Directions, past and present, gathered one last time in the auditorium, now named after Finn. They sang one last song before we saw a quote from Finn summing up the show: ""See the world not as it is, but as it should be."" Fans approved of the final episode, sharing tributes and celebrating the show on social media.","""Glee"" ended Friday after six season .

"(CNN)Israel's next prime minister -- whether incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu or Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog -- will be faced with a myriad of international and domestic crises amid deepening tensions with the United States, its closest ally. Here are five key issues waiting in the new leader's inbox after Tuesday's election. 1. Repairing relations with the United States . There are any number of irritants -- from settlement construction to failed peace talks to Israeli military action in Gaza and Lebanon -- which have long tested the alliance between Washington and Israel. But ties have grown increasingly strained between President Barack Obama and Netanyahu, playing out over the last several years in a series of awkward photo-ops, anonymous quotes in U.S. and Israeli media and tense body language. Relations hit a low point recently with Netanyahu's speech to Congress criticizing President Obama's policy toward Iran about its nuclear program. Repairing ties with the White House becomes easier if the next government is formed under Herzog, who has pledged to ""restore intimacy and trust"" with the leadership in Washington. Repairing ties becomes more difficult if Netanyahu remains in office. For all its official praise for the ""unshakable bonds"" between the U.S. and Israel, the White House sees Netanyahu as the problem. If Netanyahu is re-elected, they will have to work with him. Personal relations may be fraught now, but Obama has never suggested watering down or delaying mostly military U.S. aid to Israel, which amounts to $3 billion a year. Privately, however, U.S. officials have warned the level of Washington's political support for Israel with allies and at the United Nations could be affected by Netanyahu's attitude toward the Obama administration. 2. Confronting Iran . World powers are pushing toward a framework nuclear deal with Iran before the March 31 deadline. The next prime minister will take office shortly before a July deadline for a final deal and will need to reach key understandings with Washington on what security and diplomatic guarantees the United States will provide Israel if the deal goes forward. In addition, Israel will want input on what constitutes a violation of the deal and what would trigger punitive measures if Iran reneges. If he remains in office, Netanyahu's differing perceptions of the threat posed by Iran will undoubtedly come to a head as that deadline approaches. Netanyahu has been clear he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the Jewish state from an existential threat posed by Tehran's nuclear ambitions. He worries that the agreement that emerges will leave Iran as a nuclear ""threshold state"" with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon. Herzog has similarly said he would never accept a nuclear Iran and stresses all options are on the table, including the military options. But he has suggested as prime minister he would work closer with the Obama administration and other governments negotiating with Iran to strengthen a deal, rather than try and block the deal through the US Congress. Beyond the nuclear deal, the next Israeli will leader will face an increasingly emboldened Iran in the region. Beyond it's longstanding support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and backing of the al-Assad government in Syria, Iran has extended its involvement in Iraq's battle against ISIS and has provided support to Houthis in Yemen. Israeli officials say Iran is  actively working to open up a front against Israel in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Iran said in January an Iranian general had been killed in an Israeli airstrike in the area. 3. Solving problems with Palestinians . The breakdown last April of peace talks led by Secretary of State John Kerry led the Palestinians to take unilateral steps in international forums such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. In response, Israel has halted delivering tax revenues, which it collects on the Palestinians' behalf, seriously squeezing their economy. Now the Palestinians are threatening to halt security cooperation with Israel. Coupled with a lack of a viable peace process and a potential economic collapse of the Palestinian authority, the lack of security coordination would present a total breakdown of cooperation between the two sides. The next Israeli leader will need to stop this free fall before this dangerous cocktail of instability leads to further chaos and perhaps a third intifada. The differences between Netanyahu and Herzog seem to be more style than substance. During the campaign, Netanyahu has hedged on his longstanding support for a two-state solution, but has not abandoned the idea entirely. Herzog has pledged to restart the peace process, but has expressed skepticism about whether Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is a reliable partner. The new prime minister must also deal with an ever worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, where rebuilding has been slow after last summer's Operation Protective Edge. Egypt has basically cut off the border, further squeezing the strip. While there has been little violence since last year's war, Hamas has not been demilitarized and another round of fighting could be just another matter of time. Although Hamas belongs to a unity government with Abbas' Fatah party, Abbas continues to exercise little influence over the group. 4. Addressing growing social inequality . While Israeli voters traditionally cite security issues as a driving factor, the high cost of living has emerged as a major focus in this election season. Sky-high housing prices are of particular concern. Last month, Israel's state comptroller issued a report finding housing prices in the country rose by 55% between 2008 and 2014.  Rising food prices are another key issue. In July 2011, Israel saw a massive wave of social protests centering on the expensive housing market and food prices. Dubbed the ""cottage cheese"" protests -- because of the rising cost of cottage cheese, a staple in many Israelis pantry -- they were emblematic of a broader concern that Netanyahu's relentless focus on security issues was at the expense of domestic issues. Polls indicate the growing frustration with the economy has resulted in a shift from Netanyahu to Herzog. Herzog has pledged to spend 7 billion shekels (about $1.75 billion U.S.) on affordable housing, health care and other social programs for the middle class, which he called the ""sandwich generation."" For the most part, Netanyahu has not addressed the economy in his few campaign events, focusing more on his strong security credentials. In recent days, he pointed to a 5% decrease in food prices and an increase in affordable housing during his tenure, but acknowledged that the rising costs of living and housing prices were not ""fully addressed"" by his government and promised to make the economy a top priority if re-elected. 5. Reversing Israel's isolation on the world stage . Israel's next prime minister will need to repair Israel's increasingly frayed ties with once-friendly countries and its deepening worldwide isolation. Leading opposition candidate Tzipi Livni, who once served as Netanyahu's main peace negotiator, accused Netanyahu of being responsible for a ""diplomatic tsunami"" against Israel. Indeed, Netanyahu's aggressive style has been cited as a major factor in strained ties with the United States and Europe -- a perception caught in a hot-mic conversation between President Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2011, in which Sarkozy lamented he couldn't ""bear"" Netanyahu, calling him a ""liar."" Obama replied, ""You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with him even more often than you."" Regardless of who is Israel's next leader, Israel faces growing worldwide frustration over its policies towards the Palestinians, particularly settlement construction.  The European Union, Israel's largest trading partner, is in the process of canceling tax exemptions on Israeli products made in settlements in the occupied West Bank and is considering plans to label the origin of other products made in settlements. Federica Mogherini, the EU's new foreign policy chief, is seeking a greater role in helping to mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the absence of a viable peace process, several European nations have already recognized a Palestinian state, with several more promising to consider such a move. This makes Israel ever more dependent on U.S. diplomatic support, including its veto at the United Nations. Washington has traditionally defended Israel against Palestinians efforts to achieve recognition at the United Nations and legal action at the International Criminal Court. And it has lobbied its European allies against sanctions on Israeli exports. As with the United States, it would seem easier to repair these frayed ties under a Herzog-led government. If re-elected, Netanyahu will have his work cut out for him .","Benjamin Netanyahu trying to hold leadership post against Isaac Herzog .

"(CNN)Riders on a New York roller coaster took the long way down Sunday after Coney Island's historic Cyclone got stuck in its track on opening day. No one was injured in the mishap, which occurred about noon during the first run because of an ""isolated mechanical issue,"" a Luna Park spokeswoman said. The park's operations team helped each passenger down ""one by one,"" and the ride was closed the rest of the day for repairs, spokeswoman Erica Hoffman said. ""Safety is the number one priority for our guests here at Luna Park,"" Hoffman said. ""Nobody was injured, and those on the ride were safely evacuated and will be able to come ride again for free when it is open again."" Images and videos shared on social media showed people slowly walking down the 88-year-old wooden roller coaster. ""That thing was the scariest thing I ever did,"" 24-year-old David Zubin told amNY of the walk down. ""The bricks, walking down, looked like it was going to break when you stepped on it."" Steven Hernandez was waiting in line when the coaster got stuck. He and others watched in suspense, taking photos and video on their smartphones, as riders carefully climbed down stairs alongside the track. The 22-year-old from Brooklyn said he shows up for opening day at Luna Park every year. He heads straight to the Cyclone to be among the first 100 people who get to ride for free, he said. ""People were trying to figure out why the Cyclone got stuck at the top,"" he said. ""I go there every year, (and) that never happened."" The Cyclone opened on June 26, 1927, during Coney Island's heyday as one of country's largest recreation areas. With more than 2,640 feet of track featuring 12 drops and 27 elevation changes, the Cyclone was long considered the standard against which ""compact wooden twisters"" were measured. An official New York City Landmark since July 12, 1988, Cyclone was listed in the New York State Register of Historic Places on June 31, 1991, according to NYC.com.

"(CNN)By all appearances Shaun Harrison was living an exemplary life. He was a dean at a Boston public high school. He mentored young people. And, Harrison regularly attended services at a local church for a decade, before leaving in 2012, according to the church's pastor. Now, Harrison is charged with armed assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He's also facing multiple weapons charges. Harrison is accused of shooting one of his students in the head. While he was working as ""dean of academy"" at English High, Harrison was also running a marijuana distribution enterprise, according to Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney, David Bradley.  At an arraignment hearing Thursday, Bradley said the 55-year-old now-former dean shot a 17-year-old student he had allegedly hired to sell marijuana. The teenager, who called Harrison ""Rev"" told authorities he was regularly mentored by Harrison, according to police documents. Bradley said in a news release that the two got into a dispute after leaving Harrison's home Tuesday evening.  They were walking along a street when Harrison then ""produced a handgun, pointed it at the back of the victim's head and fired,"" Bradley said in a news release. The incident was captured on surveillance footage, but the police have not released it. The teen, who has not been named by police yet, was shot behind the right ear, according to a police report. He is expected to survive his injuries, Bradley's release said. Harrison had worked in various positions with the Boston Public Schools since 2010.  He had been ""dean of academy"" at English High School since January 5, where ""he provided services, like finding housing for homeless students or social services or disciplinary alternatives to suspension,"" said Denise Snyder, a representative for Boston Public Schools. His employment has been ""terminated effective immediately,"" Snyder said. The Rev. Dr. Gregory Groover, pastor of the Charles Street AME Church where Harrison attended services said the allegations against Harrison aren't consistent with the man he knows. ""I was stunned beyond description,"" Groover said when he heard about  Harrison's arrest. Groover said Harrison was already an ordained Baptist minister when he came to the Charles Street AME Church.  He recalled Harrison usually attended services alone, but he ""got along with everyone."" ""He seemed to consistently care with a deep heart for saving young people who were in the streets or gang related, prison-involved,"" Groover said.  ""That was the population that his life seemed to center around."" A not guilty plea was automatically entered on Harrison's behalf.  He posted $250,000 bail and is  under house arrest, according to police documents.  He has been ordered to ""stay away and have no contact with the victim"" and wear a GPS monitor, the DA's release said. He is scheduled to be back in court on April 6. CNN's multiple attempts to reach an attorney for Harrison were unsuccessful. CNN's Aaron Cooper, Chuck Johnston and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.","Shaun Harrison is accused of shooting one of his students in the head .

"(CNN)The odds seemed almost impossibly stacked against baby Lily, but she survived. Rescuers found the toddler Saturday, hanging upside down in her mother's car, which had flipped into a frigid Utah river a day before. If the wreck occurred when police believe it did, she may have been there for as many as 14 hours. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash. She was 25 years old. How did her 18-month-old survive? One of the biggest factors was the car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat for her age and the seat appears to have been properly attached. Even though the child was trapped and upside down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but would be even more so if the baby were wet. Dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures. Ironically, the cold might have actually helped Lily survive, said Dr. Barbara Walsh, with the University of Massachusetts Medical School. ""She's going to have a lower heart rate. She's going to have a lower metabolism. She's going to need less sugar,"" Walsh said. ""It's almost like the body is sort of knowing that it needs to shut down to protect itself."" A variety of other factors were also likely at play. ""We don't know what time the child was last fed, when she drank. Given that it's wintertime and she was in her car seat, she was probably wearing mittens, a hat. We tend to over bundle our children, so the fact that she was dry, she probably had on multiple layers because it's winter, and there's always a chance that she had just been sort of fed right before this happened probably all played a role,"" Walsh said. A final factor may have been that the girl, as a toddler, has baby fat -- a little extra insulation. If she had been an infant, it might have been a different story. ""It's amazing. Children are very resilient, and I think sometimes we don't realize how much they actually can withstand,"" said Walsh. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.","Lily's 25-year-old mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash .

"(CNN)A teenage Australian jihadist suspected of having carried out an ISIS suicide attack developed a hatred for the West over the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, before settling on radical Islam as a vehicle for ""violent global revolution,"" according to his purported blog. Jake Bilardi, an 18-year-old student from Melbourne, appears to have documented his path to radicalization and his experiences in ISIS-held territory in a blog, titled ""From the eyes of a Mujahir: An Australian Mujahir in the land of the Khilafah."" The blog has been deleted, but a cached version remains available online. CNN could not independently verify the blog's authenticity, but the biographical details detailed on the blog match Bilardi's. One of the final posts on the blog, which is credited to ""Abu Abdullah al-Australi,"" purports to have been posted on January 13, as the author was ""preparing to sacrifice my life for Islam in Ramadi."" The Australian government said Wednesday it was working to confirm reports that Bilardi had carried out a suicide attack on behalf of ISIS, after the terror group claimed an ""Abu Abdullah al-Australi"" had been killed in a car bombing during an offensive in the city of Ramadi. The claims were made along with a picture that appeared to be of Bilardi, referred to as ""Abu Abdullah al-Australi,"" apparently prior to carrying out the mission. The blogger describes having a ""very comfortable"" upbringing as the youngest of six in the Melbourne suburbs, where he was raised an atheist, excelled in his studies and ""dreamed of becoming a political journalist."" He describes how his older siblings educated him on various subjects, and how his brother's instruction on international politics held a special resonance for him, particularly after the September 11 attacks. ""Being just five years old at the time of the attacks ... my knowledge of the operation was basically non-existent. Despite this, I was immediately drawn to the topics of al Qaeda and 'Islamic terrorism',"" he wrote. ""It was from here that my research into al Qaeda ... and groups with similar ideologies worldwide began. I spent every day researching online and reading the books I had begun collecting."" The blogger writes that it was his reading on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and abuses committed by occupying forces, ""that gave birth to my disdain for the United States and its allies, including Australia. It was also the start of my respect for the mujahideen that would only grow to develop into a love of Islam and ultimately bring me here to the Islamic State."" Eventually, he wrote, he came to view democracy as ""nothing but a system of lies and deception,"" one which ""focuses heavily on providing the people with so-called freedom"" but ""throws celebrities and false reality into the spotlight to distract the people from what is really going on in the world."" The wars ""signaled the beginning of my complete hatred and opposition to the entire system Australia and the majority of the world was based upon,"" he wrote. ""It was also the moment I realised that violent global revolution was necessary to eliminate this system of governance and that... I would likely be killed in this struggle."" While the blogger said he had come to the conclusion that democracy was ""something that can only and must be destroyed by violent revolution,"" he wrote, he ""was never quite sure"" what should replace it. ""Socialism? Communism?? Nazism???"" he wrote. Eventually, as his interest in jihadist groups deepened at about the time of the Arab Spring, he settled on Islam. ""It was Islam that for me stood out as easy to understand and was shockingly consistent with established historical and scientific facts,"" he wrote. Following a stretch in which he turned his back on his growing extremist beliefs, which he described as ""one of the most shameful periods of my life,"" the blogger wrote that he began to try to find a contact to help him join Jabhat al-Nusra or Ahrar al-Sham, two Islamist groups fighting in Syria. His attempts were unsuccessful. While he had initially rejected ISIS after ""falling for the many lies being spread against them,"" he wrote that he began speaking to their members online, and, after witnessing their military successes, developed a desire to join the group. Eventually, he managed to find a contact who promised to get him into ISIS territory. Worried that his plot to leave Australia might be foiled by authorities, the blogger wrote that he developed his ""Plan B,"" collecting materials for what he envisaged as a ""string of bombings across Melbourne, targeting foreign consulates and political/military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centers and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar."" Victoria police confirmed Wednesday that chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device had been found in a search of his family's home in the Melbourne suburb of Craigieburn. The blogger wrote that he abandoned his plans for an attack in Melbourne after realizing that buying bomb-making chemicals could draw the attention of authorities and ruin his bid to join ISIS. He did not reveal how he had been able to enter ISIS territory, but said that on entering the ISIS-held Syrian city of Jarablus, he ""felt a joy I had never experienced before."" In another blog post, entitled ""Being white in the Islamic State: The abolition of racism"" he wrote approvingly that the ""Islamic State has been successful in eliminating racism and in building the world's only true multi-ethnic state."" He said he signed up for a ""martyrdom operation,"" or suicide attack, in Baiji, Iraq, which failed, before registering to undertake another in Ramadi, where he was ""waiting for my turn to stand before Allah."" Clarke Jones, an expert on radicalization at the Australian National University, said that Bilardi ""blew away the profile of what most people think of when they think of people who are going to support the Islamic State."" White and middle class, reportedly bullied at school and vulnerable following the loss of his mother to cancer, he more easily fit the profile of a school shooter than an Islamic terrorist, he said. ""What it does show us is that there are a whole range of profiles,"" he said. Bilardi's aunt has linked the teen's troubles to the loss of his mother, while a former classmate at Melbourne's Craigieburn Secondary College described him as shy. Jones said Bilardi's case was also notable in that he did not appear to have been ""groomed"" by terror recruiters -- indeed, he wrote of initially struggling to make contacts among Islamic extremists -- and had radicalized himself through his own readings. ""The PM here said Jake was brainwashed -- I don't think he was brainwashed. He was very calculated in what he did and documented it quite clearly,"" said Jones. In one of the blog posts, the blogger says that the warm welcome he and other foreign fighters had received in the Islamic State disproved ""the Australian government's laughable claim that we are used as 'cannon fodder'."" But Jones said his Bilardi's ultimate fate in a suicide mission was typical for foreign fighters in his position. He believed that in knowingly signing up for this fate, on two separate occasions, Bilardi had been seeking the kind of recognition and achievement that, as a vulnerable teen, he had been denied at home. ""He wanted that 'religious prize',"" he said. CNN's Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","An Australian teen suspected of an ISIS suicide bombing left behind a purported blog .

"Jerusalem (CNN)After a bitter campaign, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming victory as his main rival Isaac Herzog concedes. Many questions linger about exactly what this means for U.S.-Israeli relations and Israel's standing in the Middle East. CNN global affairs correspondent Elise Labott has been covering the Israel election in depth and took to Facebook to answer your questions about the election. Here are five highlights from the chat: . 1) How did the race go from exit polls saying it was a neck-and-neck race to Netanyahu claiming victory within a matter of hours? I know, right? It's a great mystery as to how the exit polls got it so wrong. There's one pollster here in Israel named Avi Degani who predicted that Netanyahu would win all along. He said that the polls here in Israel rely too heavily on modern methodology and aren't really suitable for people outside city centers like Tel Aviv. There's also the question of whether Netanyahu gained more seats because of the 11th-hour push to the right. Part of the explanation is that he cannibalized votes from the other right-wing parties. Also worth noting that Israeli elections always have surprises. In the last election, no one predicted the amazing turnout for Yair Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party won 19 seats. This time, he only won around 11. Why were the election polls so wrong? 2) What does Netanyahu have planned for his next term? That's the $6 million question. The Obama administration was waiting for the election to be over to see who they would be dealing with. They knew even if Prime Minister Netanyahu won re-election, they would need to re-engage with him. I think both sides realize that the U.S.-Israeli relationship is too important to continue as it has been. But I think the tone Prime Minister Netanyahu sets now will dictate how the White House deals with him. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? 3) What is Netanyahu's plan regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? In the final days before the election, Prime Minister Netanyahu made a big push to energize his right-wing base. He promised that there would not be a Palestinian state under his watch, backtracking from a commitment he made in 2009 for a two-state solution. Now the right wing that helped keep him in office is going to be looking for him to deliver on his campaign pledge. It's not encouraging. Now that he has a new mandate, perhaps he will feel more confident to explore possibilities with Palestinians. However the unilateral moves Palestinians have taken since the collapse of peace talks last summer doesn't give him much encouragement either. 4) Was Netanyahu's statement about not recognizing a Palestinian state a political move to get votes, or a true ideal he wants to hold up? It's a great question that nobody knows the answer to just yet. Even the Netanyahu camp would admit that they made a conscious effort to reach out to right-wing voters, many of whom do not want to see a Palestinian state. For many years Netanyahu has at least agreed to negotiate with the Palestinians, even if sometimes actions like continued settlement activity call into question his true commitment. It remains to be seen whether Netanyahu considers his re-election as a mandate from the right to govern in this hard-line way or whether he will try to soften these hard-line positions. In the hard-line way is how he appeared in the final days of the campaign. 5)  As an American, what impact do the Israeli election results have on me? In other words, why do I need to care? I think Israel is a very important ally of the United States in a region where there is a hell of a lot of turmoil. The U.S. looks to Israel as a stable democracy with whom it shares, for the most part, similar values and interests. Clearly the relationship between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama has soured the ties between the two nations. Whether the two leaders can repair the relationship now that Netanyahu has been re-elected will, in large part, dictate how they work together. As an American, whether the U.S. has a friend in this volatile region does impact our national security.

"(CNN)Reading the headlines out of Madison, Wisconsin, it's hard not to think about Ferguson, Missouri. But law enforcement's response to the shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson will not unfold in the same chaotic, violent and distrusting way as the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, Madison's top police leaders vowed. ""I think it's very clear that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri,"" said Jim Palmer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The head of the state's largest law enforcement group told CNN Monday that the Madison police department, unlike the Ferguson department, has a strong relationship with the people it serves. Madison Police Chief Mike Koval has been out front and outspoken about Robinson's shooting since it happened late Friday night. The chief said he understands people are angry and want answers. ""We have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold,"" he said. Here are some ways Madison law enforcement appears to be responding differently than what was seen in Ferguson: . Difference in what police chiefs did after shooting . Madison: Within hours of the shooting, Koval went to Robinson's mother's home. ""We need to start as any healing or any reconciliation should with an 'I'm sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years if at all to mend,"" the police chief said. The mother didn't want to meet with him but the chief talked and prayed with the biracial teenager's grandparents in the driveway, he said. They told Koval to hold off on trying to talk to the mother because emotions were too intense. ""I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences,"" Koval said. ""Nineteen years old is too young."" He stressed that ""the effort has to be there,"" in reaching out to the family. ""We have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold, as it were."" Ferguson: A day after Brown, who was African-American, was killed, protesters took to the streets of the Missouri town. They were incensed that witnesses said Brown's hands were up and that the teen's body had remained in the street, in the sun, for four hours. A month went by before Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson apologized to Brown's family. ""I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,"" he said, in a videotaped message. A day after Brown's killing a vigil for him devolved into violence. Police tried to keep the crowd under control but clashes erupted. One officer was seen holding the leash of a barking dog, and St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said some officers wielded shotguns. Four days after Brown was killed and more than a day after riots erupted in Ferguson, Jackson spoke at a community forum, saying, the situation ""has been a tragedy for the city and the country."" Responding to criticism that he'd missed immediate opportunities to address tension in the town that turned into violence, he said, ""It breaks my heart [that] some think I'm part of the problem."" The police chief promised the crowd he would be part of the solution. But issues with how the department interacted with protesters and media continued. ""Keep moving"" was a common refrain that police told protesters and law enforcement threatened to arrest anyone who stood along sidewalks, whether they were resting or a reporter taking notes. In some cases, officers told demonstrators they couldn't stand for more than five seconds; some protesters were yelled at for walking too slowly. Such a tactic was a violation of the Constitution, a federal judge later ruled. In his videotaped message, Jackson apologized for that, too. ""The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible and I'm sorry,"" the police chief said. Five ways the Ferguson police chief is in hot water . Difference in investigation procedures: . Madison: Under Wisconsin law, an outside agency is tasked with investigating police-involved shootings. In the case in Madison, that would be the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes its work, findings will be delivered to the local district attorney, Chief Koval said. On Monday, Gov. Scott Walker issued a statement saying that another layer of investigation will come from the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which will conduct an independent investigation -- a requirement of all officer-involved deaths. Ferguson: Chief Jackson asked the St. Louis County Police Department to conduct an independent investigation into Brown's killing. It was only a few days that passed between the shooting and when Jon Belmar, the chief of St. Louis County Police Department, told media what led to Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shooting Brown. ""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" Belmar said. Brown ""physically assaulted"" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer's weapon. Differences with timing of releasing the officer's name . Madison: Chief Koval released the name of the officer who shot Robinson within hours of the incident. He is 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny. The chief volunteered that the officer had shot and killed a man in 2007. Kenny was cleared on any wrongdoing in that incident, the chief said, because an investigation determined that the man was killed in a ""suicide by cop"" situation. During the incident involving Robinson, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Ferguson: Three days after Brown was killed, Ferguson police backtracked on a promise made a day earlier to release the name of the officer. The reason the department gave? Threats made to another officer who was falsely accused on social media of shooting Brown, Jackson said. The chief said he thought the threats were ""credible"" and that ""the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name, which is minimal."" Lawyers representing Brown's family blasted the decision, and accused the police of protecting their own and ignoring standard procedures. Difference in how authorities described victim's past . Madison: Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. But when Koval was pressed for more details, he refused to talk about the teen's record or any run-ins with law enforcement. ""I could but I choose not to,"" the chief said. ""I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his."" Ferguson: Six days after Brown's shooting -- on the same day police released Officer Wilson's name -- police released surveillance video of a convenience store robbery in which Brown was allegedly involved before he died. The decision to release that video frustrated many, including others in law enforcement. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson stated the robbery and shooting of Brown ""are separate issues."" ""I told (Chief Jackson) I think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go,"" Johnson told CNN. ""Today is about taking care of this incident here, getting to those facts that are there, and Michael Brown and his family."" Differences in mayor's reaction immediately after shooting . Madison: Less than a day after the shooting, Mayor Paul Soglin vowed that ""there will be answers,"" the Wisconsin State Journal reported.  ""We all deserve to know the facts in this case,"" he said. ""Tony Robinson's family deserves that, our community deserves that, and the Madison Police deserve that. When the answers come, we will be open and transparent in communicating them."" The promise to be transparent in sharing results of an investigation were repeated on the city's web site. Ferguson: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles urged the community to stay calm and not escalate the situation. ""We don't know what happened and there are lots of conflicting stories,"" Knowles said. ""Unfortunately there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully we will get to an understanding and justice will be served."" Speaking a day after a vigil for Brown devolved into a riot, Knowles said on CNN that ""the events of last night are not indicative of who we are,"" and that the chaos was ""not constructive"" and only ""bringing down the community."" Difference in size and tone of rallies and tone . Madison: On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators gathered in Madison. ""Who do we trust?"" some called out, prompting the response, ""No one!"" And in another refrain, they chanted, ""Black lives matter,"" a phrase that Ferguson protesters coined. Online the #WillyStreet hashtag, referencing to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened, trended. ""Praying for Madison tonight,"" wrote one activist. ""Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies."" The demonstrations, which have been constant, have remained peaceful. Watch protesters outraged over police killing . Ferguson: Just hours after Brown was killed, a vigil for him turned violent as people hurled bottles at officers and kicked police cars parked on the streets. The often-violent demonstrations continued off and on for weeks, and protests around the country were held in solidarity. While many protesters were peaceful, in late November buildings were set on fire and destruction spread after a grand jury said it had decided not to indict Officer Wilson. Fire, chaos erupt in Ferguson after grand jury doesn't indict . CNN's Elise Miller, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Faith Karami, Kristina Sgueglia, Rosa Flores, Ralph Ellis, Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Police officials in Madison say their responses to shooting by officer reflect their role in community .

"Paris (CNN)Police found the bodies of five infants in a home near Bordeaux, France, according to news reports. Four of the bodies were frozen, the reports say. The mother, 35, was hospitalized at Pellegrin Hospital in Bordeaux for gynecological and psychiatric examinations, the French television channel BFMTV reported. The hospital declined comment. The first body was found Thursday morning by the woman's companion, a 40-year-old man, in a freezer bag, BFMTV reported. Police discovered bodies of four other babies in a freezer that evening during a search of the family's home, the channel said. Officials with the Bordeaux prosecutor's office were scheduled to hold a press conference Friday afternoon. Autopsies will be conducted, BFMTV said. The woman's companion was taken into custody, the reports said. He told investigators that he had not known of the deaths and was devastated, according to reports. The couple is reported to have two daughters, aged 13 and 15, and to have led a seemingly routine life. The family home is in Louchats, a village of fewer than 1,000 residents about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Bordeaux, in the Landes forest, in southwestern France. The country's worst case of infanticide was in 2010 when a mother in the village of Villers-au-Tertre in northwestern France was found to have killed eight of her babies.","Reports say police find bodies of five newborns in home in southwestern France .

"Hong Kong (CNN)A 16-year-old teenager has been charged for a tirade he posted on YouTube regarding the death of the late Singapore leader, Lee Kuan Yew. Amos Yee, a moppy-haired teenager posted an online video peppered with expletives that slammed the late leader, who died last week, as a ""horrible person"" and ""undoubtedly totalitarian."" He also made comments comparing Lee to Jesus Christ and Mao Zedong. Lee, highly revered in Singapore was buried Sunday with thousands gathering in a massive state funeral service. While admired for his role turning the former British colony into a financial power house, Lee was also criticized for tamping down on free speech in Singapore. On the day of Lee's funeral, Yee was arrested after Singapore police said it received more than 20 reports regarding his video, which police said contained ""disparaging remarks against Christians."" That YouTube video has since been removed. Critics say Yee's arrest highlights the restrictions on free speech in Singapore. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for the teen's immediate release. Yee faces three charges: intent to wound the religious feelings of any person; circulating obscene objects; and making threatening and abusive or insulting communications. He could face up to three years in prison. Deputy Commissioner of Police Tan Chye Hee said: ""Police take a stern view of acts that could threaten religious harmony in Singapore. Any person who uploads offensive content online with deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings of any person will be firmly dealt with in accordance with the law."" The Strait Times newspaper reported that Yee's bail was set at $14,500 and that Yee's father apologized to Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the son of Lee Kuan Yew.","Singapore teenager arrested over comments about late leader in YouTube video .

"Atlanta (CNN)Nearly 30 years after the first U.S. stealth bomber took  flight, the Air Force's aging fleet is primed for a makeover; albeit an expensive one. The Pentagon is looking to upgrade its stealth aircraft for the first time since the 1970s, developing a high-priority, super-classified, next-generation bomber. The Air Force plans to award a contract to build and develop the Long Range Strike Bomber to one of the industry's most powerful firms later this year and hopes to integrate them into the fleet by the mid-2020s. Competing for the prize are Northrop Grumman, the developer of the Air Force's current bomber, the B-2, and a partnership between aeronautic juggernauts Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Before the House Armed Services Committee earlier this month, William LaPlante, assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, suggested the Air Force will offer a ""cost-plus"" contract to the winning firm, meaning the government will take on the risk of any cost overrun. ""My belief on the LRS-B (Long Range Strike Bomber) is it's going to be more traditional in the sense that we are doing a little bit more cutting edge"" development, LaPlante said. The Air Force has said it plans to leverage existing technologies to help keep the LRS-B affordable. However The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, an independent, nonpartisan research group, warns ""near-sighted, build-for-today acquisition strategies may render the issue of 'affordability' moot, as affordability must also be assessed in the context of a capability's mission effectiveness over its projected lifespan."" Along with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the KC-46 tanker, the LRS-B is one of the Air Force's top modernization priorities, and some experts say its development will go far beyond simply upgrading an aging bomber fleet. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula told CNN this week that it is inaccurate to label the LRS-B as simply a ""bomber"" and that officials need to shed the ""old think"" way of categorizing airplanes into different mission areas. The new ""Long Range Sensor Shooter,"" as Deptula calls it, will have the ability to create a self-forming, self-healing ""combat cloud"" capable of sharing information with other aircraft and conducting a diverse array of operation types. Pentagon officials have stressed the importance of developing the new long-range strike bomber calling it critical to national security and nuclear deterrence. It is ""absolutely essential for keeping our deterrent edge,"" former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in January. ""We need to do it. We need to make the investments. We'll have it in the budget."" Deptula said the No. 1 reason to upgrade the long-range sensor force is to counter the constantly evolving threats around the world. ""The Chinese, Iranians and Russians ... have built advanced anti-air systems and long-range fighters, to attack our bases and aircraft carriers,"" he said. Adm. William Gortney, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, expressed similar security concerns to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Thursday, telling lawmakers Russia is continuing to work on its program to deploy ""long-range conventionally armed cruise missiles,"" that can be launched from its bomber aircraft, submarines and warships. Officials have been tight-lipped as to the specific capability expectations for the LRS-B, but indications are that it will be stealth, able to carry conventional and nuclear weapons and could possibly operate both with or without a pilot. Northrop Grumman teased an initial structural design for the aircraft in an ad during the Super Bowl, stopping short of highlighting specific features. Tim Paynter, a company spokesman, said the aircraft shown on TV is ""representative of any future aircraft our customers may ask us to build."" Generally speaking, Deptula said the LRS-B must have long-range capabilities, be able to carry a large payload, have high survivability and have sufficient adaptability to incorporate evolving sensor and weapon technology. Long-range capability provides the Air Force with the flexibility to persistently respond to threats around the world and reach deep into enemy territory to hit fixed and mobile targets unreachable by cruise missiles, Deptula said. Large payload capability allows for operations with fewer aircraft and increases loiter capability and efficiency, he said. Modernized stealth tactics and upgraded electronic warfare capabilities would allow the aircraft to enter enemy airspace without suffering prohibitive losses. The mysterious Long Range Strike Bomber program is the most expensive weapons system under the Air Force's $17 billion research, development, test and evaluation funding request for 2016. The Air Force requested $1.2 billion for the program under the President Obama's $534 billion proposed 2016 Pentagon budget. Since 2011, the Pentagon has said the LRS-B bomber will cost close to $550 million per airplane, projecting a $55 billion price total for 100 planes. Critics insist the actual cost of the LRS-B will exceed the initial $500 million estimate; yet Pentagon officials continue to publicly tout the cost figure. ""It's like $550 million per copy,"" Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said this January. ""It's an estimate based upon multiple reviews of the program and not a single source."" LaPlante acknowledged the target cost of the LRS-B has increased due to inflation since the initial estimate was made in 2010, saying ""$55 in 2010 is $57 or $58 today. We know that. But we put it in as a requirement -- to build 100 airplanes, it's going to cost $550 million (each). What that does is, that drives the design. Industry has to design to that number and we're going to assess against that number."" Regardless of the exact cost, Deptula said price should not be quantified per individual aircraft, but rather within the context of what the LRS-B system will be able to accomplish compared to the cost of carrying out operations with less-advanced, shorter-range aircraft. ""How can we not afford it?"" he said, warning a failure to incorporate a combat cloud system could actually exacerbate budget demands. The Pentagon's Future Years Defense Program projects the LRS-B's budget will increase to $3.7 billion for research, development, test and evaluation in 2020, bringing the total development cost to roughly $24 billion, according to the CSBA. If Air Force buys 100 planes by the mid-2030s, the research group estimates the program's total cost will be closer to $90 billion. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments said intentionally planning to enhance an aircraft's capabilities over time could also reduce the up-front sticker shock of the LRS-B. ""Instead of buying them with all desired mission functionalities when they first roll off the assembly line, it may be possible to equip new combat aircraft with the most essential systems and plan future block upgrades to keep pace with emerging technologies and threats as funding permits,"" the group said in a 2014 report.","Pentagon to upgrade its stealth aircraft for first time since 1970s, developing a classified, next-generation bomber .

"(CNN)The FBI publicly identified Tuesday the man who died Monday while trying to use an unauthorized vehicle tried to gain access to the National Security Agency campus in Fort Meade, Maryland, as Ricky Shawatza Hall. His passenger who remained hospitalized Tuesday has not been publicly identified. On Monday morning, Hall attempted to gain entry at the National Security Agency headquarters, Jonathan Freed, NSA director of strategic communications, said in a statement. ""The driver failed to obey an NSA Police officer's routine instructions for safely exiting the secure campus. The vehicle failed to stop and barriers were deployed."" NSA police on the scene fired on the vehicle when it accelerated toward a police car, blocking its way, according to the NSA. An NSA police officer was also hospitalized but not identified. The two men who officials say tried to ram the main gate at NSA headquarters were dressed as women, according to a federal law enforcement official. Investigators are looking into whether the men were under the influence of drugs following a night of partying, a federal law enforcement official said. A man reported his car stolen from a hotel not far away from NSA Headquarters and said he had been with two men who had taken his car. Cocaine was found in the vehicle. The Howard County Police Department confirms that a Ford Escape reported stolen in Howard County, Maryland, is the vehicle involved in the incident. The FBI said Monday morning that it was conducting an investigation with NSA police and other law enforcement agencies, and interviewing witnesses on the scene. The incident took place near one of the gates to the complex, far from the main buildings. The FBI said they did not think terrorism was related to the incident. ""We are working with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland to determine if federal charges are warranted,"" the FBI said in a statement. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said President Barack Obama had been briefed on the incident Monday. This is the second security incident this month involving the NSA. At the beginning of March, a former state correctional officer was arrested, accused in a string of Maryland shootings, including one at Fort Meade. Gunshots struck a building near the NSA office, according to a police report. Officers stopped Hong Young, 35, of Beltsville, Maryland, and recognized his vehicle as matching authorities' description of a car seen in surveillance footage near some of the other shootings. A gun in the car matched evidence found at the shootings, and Young was arrested, authorities said. Police said earlier this month that there were no links to terrorism in the case, and no motive has been determined. No one was killed in the five shooting incidents. In addition to the headquarters of the NSA, Fort Meade is home to 95 units from all branches of the armed forces and offices that report to several Defense Department agencies, according to the U.S. Army, which operates the base. About 11,000 military employees and 29,000 civilians work there, according to the Army. Some 6,000 people also live on the base, which began operations in 1917 as a garrison for World War I draftees, the Army said. CNN's Michael Pearson and John Newsome contributed to this report.","Two people tried to enter the main gate to enter the headquarters of the National Security Agency at Fort Meade.

"(CNN)When Oakland Raiders NFL running back Maurice Jones-Drew retired recently at just 29 years old, he said his life had been focused on football for 24 years and he needed a change. It's no wonder he wanted out. He has been playing football since he was 5 years old. Sound too young to strap on a helmet? Not really. Jones-Drew is no different from thousands of other boys whose parents introduce them to the gridiron just a few years out of diapers. Football is America's favorite sport. We pride ourselves on our toughness, on our ability to get back up when we're knocked down. What better sport is there to teach those lessons? But today, youth football is not looking like the best option. In 2012, an estimated 225,287 children -- down 9.5% since 2010 -- between the ages of 5 and 14 played Pop Warner football, in which the weight class for the 5-year-olds ranges from 35 to 79 pounds. With such lightweight boys competing with children more than twice their size, it's no wonder parents feel less inclined to put their kids in this sport. But not too long ago, parents thought nothing of sending their children out on the football field to run around and burn up a little energy. Many parents still insist youth football is safe. What could be healthier for a boy? Certainly, it beats sitting in front of a computer all day. That's exactly what Debra Pyka thought when she signed up her son, Joseph Chernach, for Pop Warner football in Wisconsin, then later in Michigan, when he was 11 years old, in 1997. If only she knew then that her son would be dead at 25. Joseph hung himself in his mother's shed on June 7, 2012. His brain was later found to have severe CTE, a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to concussions in football. Joseph Chernach had played sports, including wrestling, pole vaulting and football most of his young life. But he spent almost four years playing Pop Warner football from ages 11 to 14. ""My son was the class comedian, loved school, always fun to be around,"" Pyka told me. ""But we noticed after high school Joseph changed. He got depressed, angry, paranoid and withdrew from sports and his friends. We just didn't know why. After learning about CTE, I knew he had it even before we got the results. The symptoms were all there."" Pyka is convinced those early days playing Pop Warner football triggered her son's CTE. Last month, Pyka and her son's estate filed a lawsuit against Pop Warner football for $5 million, claiming the nonprofit failed to protect its youngest players and warn them and their parents about the permanent dangers of head trauma. The lawsuit further alleges that Pyka's son and other children were intentionally put in danger because Pop Warner used amateur coaches with short tenures, who were never properly trained in the game of football, injury prevention, concussion or head injury identification. So now, this mother is on a mission. She wants to stop children younger than 14 from playing tackle football in youth leagues. ""I don't want any kids to suffer the way my son suffered, the way my family suffered. It's devastating. Young children should not be allowed to play tackle football until they reach high school,"" said Pyka. Since filing her suit, Pyka, a registered nurse, said she's found some solace by connecting with other parents who want to make football safer for children, but she also has received plenty of hateful emails criticizing her for allowing her son to play in the first place. Critics say that she knew what she was doing when she signed her son up to play football and some even suggest that Pyka should be charged with murder for allowing Joseph to sign up for football, Pyka told me, clearly upset. ""I didn't sign my son up to get a brain disease,"" she said. ""We wanted him to play sports, to be active. We knew nothing about concussions then. It wasn't discussed much. It's still not talked about enough today. Should we all be arrested for letting our kids play football?"" Clearly, the lawsuit faces obstacles, especially since Chernach did play other sports and it may be hard to prove the CTE was triggered by injuries suffered while playing for Pop Warner. But Pyka and her attorney, Gordon Johnson, at the Brain Injury Law Group, which is representing Chernach's estate, insist this case is not just about winning. They are going after the economics of youth football leagues. And if they win the lawsuit it may be less possible for those leagues to buy the insurance policies that allow very young children to play tackle football. ""We have to prove that Pop Warner was a substantial factor in him getting it [CTE], and we knew from research that playing under 12 is when you're most vulnerable,"" Johnson told media when he filed the suit. ""The airing of these issues will benefit everybody,"" he added. Jon Butler, executive director of Pop Warner Little Scholars Inc., told me on Thursday via email:  ""Pop Warner has been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of addressing player safety. ... While there is incredible sadness in this story, we question the merits of singling out four years of youth football amid a career of sports that lasted through high school."" Still, when the lawyer talk is done, Debra Pyka won't get her son back. And amazingly, she did not sound bitter. And she's not out to end football. But ""a 5-year-old playing football, it's ridiculous to have them out there banging their brains around."" Some good has come out of all this, said Pkya. More people are talking about CTE. She said it's important that parents listen closely to NFLers like 24-year-old Chris Borland, the San Francisco 49ers linebacker who retired this week after just one season. Borland said he quit because he was afraid of brain injuries. He understands how his decision may affect parents and he has a message: . "" Parents ... if you weigh the risk and decide this is something you want to partake in. ... It's a free country. ... But If I could relay a message to kids and their parents it would be twofold: Number one: make an informed decision. And number two: Don't play through concussions. Who knows how many hits is too many?"" Considering the consequences, it just may be one of the toughest decisions a parent has to make.","Roxanne Jones: There's a reason why young NFL players are retiring from the sport .
She says youth football is not looking like the best option for kids; parents should know the risks ."
"New York (CNN)The house is primitive, constructed of baked mud and stone. The landscape is sparse and mountainous, with snow cover in the winter. The terrain is rugged and challenging for the long walks the owner liked to take with his sons. Photographs quietly introduced as evidence in the latest major terrorism trial in Manhattan federal court offer a rare look inside Osama bin Laden's lair -- years before al Qaeda flew hijacked planes into buildings or bombed U.S. embassies in Africa and even before the FBI placed bin Laden on its Most Wanted List. Still, bin Laden was preparing, hiding out in a remote, mountainous area of Afghanistan known as Tora Bora. A remarkable set of photos -- the first showing bin Laden in the hideout where he would seek refuge after 9/11 -- came to light only last month in the terrorism conspiracy trial of bin Laden lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz, a communications conduit for al Qaeda in London in the mid-1990s. Al-Fawwaz would arrange bin Laden's first television interview for CNN's Peter Arnett and Peter Bergen in 1997 and a sit-down for ABC News' John Miller a year later. But before then, al-Fawwaz called on a Palestinian print journalist, whose 1996 journey to Afghanistan yielded these photos. Bin Laden had declared war on the United States and wanted more people to know it, especially in the Arab world. He reached out to Abdel Barri Atwan, the founder and then-editor-in-chief of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, an independent Arabic weekly published in London that had been critical of certain Arab regimes and the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Atwan had broken the story about bin Laden's first fatwa, or religious decree, stating his grievances against the United States, such as the presence of U.S troops in Saudi Arabia. He published the entire screed in August 1996. The next month, al-Fawwaz went to Atwan's office to offer him the first print interview with the emerging jihadist leader in Afghanistan. ""I was told that Osama bin Laden was fond of my writing, he liked my style, and he wanted to meet me personally,"" Atwan recalled in an interview for Bergen's 2006 book, ""The Osama bin Laden I Know."" ""I was hesitant, because it was very dangerous."" Danger aside, in November 1996, Atwan was airborne to Afghanistan. The date-stamped photographs from his trip -- which Scotland Yard detectives discovered two years later in a search of al-Fawwaz's London home -- show a healthy, relaxed, sometimes smiling bin Laden, not yet 40, conversing, hiking, videotaping pronouncements, surrounded by children. The photos also show rare images of another man who has become an influential ideologue in the global jihadist movement -- Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, better known as Abu Musab al-Suri, a Syrian now in his mid-50s who has not been seen in public or heard from in a decade. Still, al-Suri is arguably the most influential strategic thinker in Islamist militant circles today. ""A generation of jihadis were influenced by his teachings,"" said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst who has written about al-Suri. ""He wanted a global jihadist intifada, where people rose up and fought  as individuals. ""His teachings have deeply influenced jihadis in Syria -- how to build up an organization, how to win support for it,"" he said. Bin Laden, from Saudi Arabia, first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to participate in the armed resistance to Soviet invaders, one of thousands of Arab fighters defending a Muslim nation. As the anti-Soviet jihad wound down, bin Laden began organizing al Qaeda, meaning ""the base,"" around the border city of Peshawar, Pakistan. By 1992, Pakistan forced him and his fighters to leave. Bin Laden relocated to Khartoum, Sudan, welcomed by a new Islamist regime. But after four years headquartered there, in 1996, under pressure from the United States, Sudan made bin Laden go. By then, the ideologically in sync Taliban had taken control of Afghanistan, and bin Laden decided to move there. In May 1996, bin Laden settled in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. His mountain fortress in Tora Bora was a long drive up a dirt road he had built. Atwan was driven there in a red Toyota pickup in a twisting seven-hour drive through the mountains. As a photo of him shows, Atwan donned Afghan-style baggy trousers and a turban to get past security checkpoints and fit in. Atwan met bin Laden in his cave. It was small, 13 by 20 feet in Atwan's estimation, and as the new photos show, it was lined with shelves of books about the Koran and the Prophet Mohammed. Bin Laden liked to use the bookshelves as a backdrop for his videotaped edicts and interviews. The cave not only offered bin Laden a hiding place but also street credibility in the Muslim world, as the prophet is believed to have received the revelations of the Koran while camped in his own mountain cave. After hours of conversation and an inedible dinner featuring salty cheese and sandy bread, Atwan ended up bunking in the cave on a mattress that rested on boxes of grenades. ""He wanted media exposure,"" Atwan recalled in the interview for Bergen's 2006 book. ""He wants to say, 'Now I am an international figure; I'm not just a Saudi. I am aggrieved at  Americans who are occupying Saudi Arabia who are desecrating the Holy Land.' "" As seen in the photographs, bin Laden always carried a Russian-made Kalashnikov rifle. His comrades addressed him as ""Abu Abdullah,"" for father of Abdullah, his eldest son. Two younger sons, Saad and Ali, then in their early teens, sometimes were at the compound. As one photo shows, Atwan and bin Laden took a two-hour walk around Tora Bora. ""He loved that nature there. He loved the mountain. They were trying to have their own community, grow their foods,"" Atwan recalled. ""It's like an oasis in Afghanistan."" Bin Laden's three wives and more than a dozen children did not share bin Laden's joy in living the life of medieval peasants in the Tora Bora mountains, where the only light at night was from the moon and gas lanterns, and the only heat in a place where tremendous blizzards were common was a wood-burning metal stove. Hunger was a frequent companion to the bin Laden children who lived on a subsistence diet of rice, bread, eggs and that salty cheese. In December 2001, with U.S. troops retaliating for 9/11 closing in, bin Laden fled Tora Bora, eventually making his way to Pakistan, where U.S. Navy SEALs ended a decade-long manhunt by killing him in his Abbottabad hideout, an hour north of Islamabad. Atwan stepped down from the helm of Al-Quds in 2013 and recapped his journey in a deposition for the al-Fawwaz trial. Al-Fawwaz was convicted in Manhattan federal court on February 26 and faces a possible life sentence. Even in Tora Bora, Atwan felt bin Laden was vulnerable to intelligence agencies. ""I thought this man would not last,"" Atwan said Tuesday. ""He wasn't really well-protected. He was visible and moving freely."" In 1996, bin Laden knew but certainly did not disclose the lethal plots he had set in motion -- the embassy bombings, the planes plot that would become 9/11. Atwan said, ""He was very optimistic, and it never occurred to me that this would be the most be dangerous man in the world."" With his pale skin, short red hair and beard, and green wool hat, Abu Musab al-Suri could pass for Irish.  But he is Syrian, originally from the ancient city of Aleppo, fought in the anti-Soviet Afghan war, and lived in London in the 1990s. Al-Suri was close to bin Laden, which explains his comfortable presence in the 1996 photos of Tora Bora, seated next to al Qaeda's leader in his cave or hiking with him, carrying his own cameras. (Al-Suri also accompanied Bergen and Arnett on their visit to bin Laden in 1997.) The United States has since accused al-Suri of training recruits at al Qaeda's pre-9/11 al-Ghuraba and Derunta camps in Afghanistan, where operatives such as Ahmed Ressam, who planned to bomb Los Angeles International Airport in December 1999, learned how to kill with poisons and chemicals. Eventually, al-Suri publicly criticized bin Laden for making al Qaeda so hierarchical, for courting publicity and being so controlling, even calling him a ""Pharoah"" for his imperial leadership style. But al-Suri was no less militant. He set up his own training camp in Afghanistan and advocated a ""leaderless jihad"" featuring, as he put it, ""spontaneous operations performed by individuals and cells all over the whole world without connection between them."" Al-Suri summarized his philosophy in his 1,600-page treatise, ""The Call for Global Islamic Resistance,"" which he published on the Internet in 2004. He coined the Arabic slogan nizam, la tanzim, meaning ""a system, not an organization,"" to describe his belief that there should be no organizational bonds between ""resistance fighters."" Al-Suri advocated terrorist cells of no more than 10 men and envisioned more ""lone-wolf"" attacks, such as the Fort Hood, Texas, massacre carried out in 2009 by rogue U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who was inspired by the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, himself an al-Suri disciple. Strategically, al-Suri argued, a less centralized jihadist network would make operatives who were arrested less likely to expose fellow militants to intelligence or law enforcement agencies, because the fighters would not know who else was part of the movement. Al-Suri was forward thinking about al Qaeda evolving into an international ideology more than a centrally controlled organization. After 9/11, al-Suri appeared on the U.S. Most Wanted Terrorists list with a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. In 2005, al-Suri was tracked down in Quetta, Pakistan, and sent to Syria, where he was imprisoned. There were unconfirmed reports that he was released in 2012, followed by al Qaeda statements by leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and spokesman Adam Gadahn in 2014 saying, ""May Allah release him."" A decade after his arrest, al-Suri's whereabouts are a mystery. A gripping glimpse into bin Laden's decline and fall .

"(CNN)Nicholas Brendon, the actor who played Buffy's sidekick Xander on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" was arrested Friday on a charge of criminal mischief and property damage in Tallahassee, Florida. The actor, who has a recurring role on the CBS show ""Criminal Minds,"" was in Tallahassee for a comic book convention. Tallahassee Police encountered Brendon, 43, at a hotel ""in a state of confusion"" with toothpaste on his face, rips in his clothes and pants wet from an overflowing toilet he allegedly caused, according to a police report. When officers checked the room, they found overturned furniture, the phone torn off the wall and water flowing from the bathroom to the hallway, the report said. In another room where Brendon was staying, they found a ""prescription pill bottle"" with one pill left out of 10 that had been filled earlier that day. Hotel management asked to press charges, the report said, noting that Brendon was cooperative as he was placed under arrest. Brendon was arrested under similar circumstances in October and February. His representatives responded to CNN with a statement that said, ""Nicholas is battling a disease. He has been suffering from a lifelong desolation due to childhood trauma and he is finally coming to terms with what happened and where he sees himself in the future. This is the first time in his adult life that he is able to admit his troubles publicly, and he wants to do so while seeking the treatment that is best for him. This goes beyond a few months in a rehabilitation center, or a quick dose of anti-depressants: Nicholas' struggle will go on for years, but he has a strong support system behind him that will guide him through the uphill battle that is chronic depression."" It went on, ""This past weekend's chain of events was a cry for help. While it's been depicted that Nicholas is a raging alcoholic with an anger problem, that is not the case.

"(CNN)Dynel Lane, a former nurse's aide accused of stabbing a pregnant Colorado woman, was charged Friday with criminal attempt to commit first-degree murder, unlawful termination of pregnancy, and other crimes for allegedly cutting a fetus from the womb. Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett was unable to file a murder charge under state law, and he highlighted how the coroner found that the fetus didn't show any signs of life outside the womb, Garnett said. The victim, Michelle Wilkins, 26, who was seven months' pregnant, survived this month's attack, which occurred when she went to a Longmont home to buy baby clothes advertised for sale on Craigslist. ""Now, I understand that many in the community -- and heaven knows I've heard from a lot of them -- would like me to file homicide charges,"" Garnett told reporters. ""However, that is not possible under Colorado law without proof of live birth. A prosecutor cannot file murder charges when a baby who is killed has not lived outside the body of the mother. For similar reasons, I cannot bring charges of child abuse resulting in death,"" the district attorney said. The fetus' lungs never inflated, Garnett said. The fetus' exact cause of death, however, isn't immediately known and is expected to be revealed when the final autopsy report is released in six to eight weeks, he said. Wilkins and her partner, identified only as Dan, named the female fetus Aurora, the prosecutor said. Lane, 34, appeared briefly in a holding room during an initial court appearance Friday, but she didn't enter the courtroom. Her attorneys waived a formal reading of charges at the hearing, which occurred before the prosecutor's press conference. ""She could get a long sentence and very well could die in prison,"" the district attorney said about Lane, adding he couldn't immediately calculate the maximum number of years she faces if convicted of all counts. Lane was also charged with two counts of crime of violence, two counts of first-degree assault, and two counts of second-degree assault, Garnett said. Lane's next court date, a preliminary hearing, is May 5. She is being held on a $2 million bond. Earlier Friday, the Boulder County Coroner's Office said the fetus wasn't alive on its own after it was cut from Wilkins' womb. The female fetus didn't exhibit ""any signs of life outside of the womb, therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth,"" Coroner Emma R. Hall said in a statement. Friday's finding came a day after prosecutors indicated that Lane wouldn't face a murder charge in the March 18 assault. Wilkins was released from the hospital on Thursday, relatives said. The coroner's office performed an autopsy on the fetus and said Wilkins was 34 weeks pregnant. ""An autopsy has been completed,"" Hall said. ""At this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb, therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth. No evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body. ""Final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete,"" Hall said. The coroner's finding apparently contradicts earlier claims made in police reports that the fetus ""gasped"" and that emergency room personnel described the fetus as viable. David Ridley, the 35-year-old husband of Dynel Lane, told police he found his wife ""covered in blood"" in the family home and later found ""a small baby lying in the bathtub,"" a Longmont police report said. ""He rubbed the baby slightly then rolled it over to ... see it take a gasping breath,"" the report said. Ridley took the baby and his wife to the emergency room of Longmont United Hospital, and the hospital told police the baby ""would have been viable,"" the police report said. But on Friday, District Attorney Garnett said that Ridley altered his earlier statement to police. Without referring to Ridley by name, Garnett cited how media accounts took note of the police report and how a ""witness observed Aurora taking a gasping breath."" ""However, upon a more thorough examination of this witness by the Longmont Police Department, the witness clarified that Aurora was still and her mouth was open, but she was not breathing, which is consistent with medical evidence from the autopsy,"" Garnett told reporters. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","D.A. acknowledges that some people demand a homicide charge .

"(CNN)When one man sat down next to a second man in a St. Louis light rail car and asked him his opinion on the shooting of Michael Brown, it was not the beginning of a discussion. It was the start of an assault, police said. The second man, who was white, didn't want to answer the question. Then the first man, who was black, boxed him in the face. Two more African-American men joined in the beating, according to a police report about Monday's incident. It was caught on surveillance cameras on the MetroLink train and a passenger recorded it with a cell phone and posted the video online. It has gone viral. Police confirmed to CNN that the online images came from the attack. The victim, 43, was commuting home when a young man in a red T-shirt and cap walked up to him. The victim asked not to be named in media reports. The man asked to use the victim's cell phone. He declined, and the young man sat down beside him. ""Then he asked me my opinion on the Michael Brown thing,"" the victim told KMOV, ""and I responded I was too tired to think about it right now."" The suspect, in his 20s, stood up. ""The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face,"" the victim said. The video showed the suspect unleashing a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who covered himself with his hand and forearms. The two other men, also in their 20s, joined in, police said. As the train pulled into a station, a security guard saw part of the beating and alerted police. The man in the red T-shirt could be seen on video kicking at the victim's face before the train's doors opened and the assailants ran out. The train's surveillance cameras captured clear images of their faces, which MetroLink passed on to journalists. Police are looking for the three men. They face possible charges of third-degree assault, police said. It is a misdemeanor under Missouri law. The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, police said. The first punch dug the frame of his eyeglasses into the skin of his nose, the victim said.  He declined to receive medical treatment. But then there was the emotional pain. On the video, people could be heard laughing while the man was beaten. ""I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,"" the victim said. ""And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911."" Condemnation of the beating has spread across social media, including from people who protested the shooting of Brown last year by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer was not indicted in Brown's death. St. Louis alderman Antonio French, a vocal community leader in the aftermath of Ferguson, tweeted his disappointment in the beating. ""Mike Brown question sparks MetroLink beating caught on video,"" he wrote. ""This is disgusting. We have a major problem, STL.""

"(CNN)Lee Kuan Yew will forever be remembered as the man who transformed a mosquito-ridden colonial trading post into a prosperous financial center with clean streets, shimmering skyscrapers and a stable government. Born in 1923, Lee became Prime Minister in 1959 when Singapore, a tiny spit of land with no natural resources and a polyglot population of Chinese, Malays and Indians, was still British territory and beset by riots and unrest. He presided over Singapore's bitter split from Malaysia in 1965 and molded the independent country into the global economic powerhouse it is today. ""I was trying to create, in a third-world situation, a first-world oasis,"" Lee told CNN in 2008. READ MORE: Obama: 'Lee a visionary' Lee's thinking also had an international impact. His brand of capitalism -- which stresses the role of government rather than the free hand of the market -- has provided a blueprint for China's landmark economic reforms. But Lee was also a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents. In 2013, protests over plans to allow more immigrants into the city-state indicated growing unease among Singaporeans about the vision of the country set forth by the People's Action Party -- the party co-founded by Lee that has ruled Singapore for five decades. Lee voluntarily stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990, the first Asian strongman to do so. However, he played a role in the country's Cabinet until 2011 when his eldest son, Lee Hsien Loong, was elected for a second term as prime minister. The elder Lee retained his influence around the world. ""This is one of the legendary figures of Asia in the 20th and 21st centuries,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said during a meeting with Lee at the White House in October 2009. ""He is somebody who helped to trigger the Asian economic miracle,"" Obama added. But there were indications Lee's health had been slipping in recent years. In 2010 he was admitted to the hospital with a chest infection and in early 2013, Lee -- then 89 -- was hospitalized and treated treated for ""stroke-like symptoms."" He was again admitted to the hospital on February 5 for severe pneumonia and more than six weeks later remained on a ventilator. A fourth-generation Singaporean, Lee's family originally emigrated from southern China. A bright student, he gained a place in the city's elite Raffles Institution and went on to study law at Fitzwilliam College at Cambridge. He attributed his decision to go into politics to his experiences during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. ""I learned how people survived and how people had to submit because you need to eat and your family needs to live, so I learned the meaning of power,"" he told CNN in 2002. The city Lee took control of in 1959 was still recovering from the ravages of war and could not have been more different from today's Singapore. However, Lee told CNN he had no ""great vision of transformation."" He concentrated on attracting investment and creating jobs; first finding a successful niche in electronics manufacturing by touting Singapore as an alternative to Hong Kong, which he said was in turmoil due to the Cultural Revolution in China. While Lee has been lauded for his economic accomplishments, he also created a Singapore bound by stringent laws and regulations that dictated most, if not all, aspects of society -- including media and political freedoms, censorship and even the selling of chewing gum. The country ranks 150th in Reporters Without Borders' 2014 Media Freedom Index, putting it just above the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mexico and Iraq. The New York Times, The Economist, the International Herald Tribune and the Asian Wall Street Journal have all been targeted with the ""judicial harassment"" employed by the Lee family, according to the media watchdog. In a 2014 article for CNN, opposition politician Dr. Chee Soon Juan criticized Singapore's authoritarian system, blaming a lack of dissenting views for economic inequality and worsening working conditions. ""The ranks of the opposition, civil society and labor movement have been decimated in the last 50 years through imprisonment without trial and criminal prosecution, and nearly every newspaper, TV channel and radio station is owned and run by the state,"" Chee said. But in a 2008 interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Lee rebuffed charges that Singapore was too domineering or coercive a state. ""I want social peace and stability within the country. I am not following any prescription given to me by any theoretician on democracy,"" he said. While Lee is likely to be remembered with affection and pride by many Singaporeans, a younger generation, with no memory of the poverty and violence that marked the country's birth, is questioning the Lee dynasty's control of Singaporean politics and pushing for greater democracy. In 2011, the People's Action Party lost six seats to the opposition, prompting Lee, then the party's ""minister mentor"" and another former prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, to resign. In a joint letter to parliament, the two explained they ""decided to leave the Cabinet and have a completely younger team of ministers to connect to and engage with this young generation in shaping the future of our Singapore."" How Singapore copes with these democratic demands will be key to its success in its second half-century, but those demands are unlikely to detract from Lee's achievements in its first 50 years.  In 2010, Time magazine listed Lee as one of world's 100 most influential people. ""The mark of a great leader is to take his society from where it is to where it has never been,"" wrote former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the article on Lee. ""There is no better strategic thinker in the world today.""","Lee Kuan Yew became Prime Minister in 1959 .

"Alexandra Carter, who is blind, feels passport officials discriminated against her because her eyes weren't focused in her application picture after they rejected it because of her non neutral expression . A blind woman claims she was refused a passport because her eyes were out of focus in her picture. Alexandra Carter, of Wigan in Lancashire, said she feels discriminated against after Passport Officials rejected her application because they said she did not have a 'neutral expression.' The 25-year-old said she feels her application was refused because her eyes were not focused in the picture due to a condition she has had since birth which makes her unable to move them herself. However officials have disputed her claims, and said the application was rejected because of her expression. Miss Carter has had to provide letters from her doctor proving her eyesight problems in order to have her application accepted. 'I feel disgusted,' said Miss Carter. 'I am a registered blind girl who was refused a passport because my eyes were not correct. 'I have nystagmus from birth which controls the movement of my eyes. It is impossible for me to take a picture where my eyes are focused. 'Within the application there was no box to tick about my disability. 'I rang up to see if I needed to do anything to prove my disability and was told no. I even went to the Post Office to explain my situation and I was told that as long as the photo met the other requirements specified it should be fine.' Nystagmus is an involuntary eye movement condition, which can cause reduced or limited vision. It occurs in infancy or in later life. But officials at the Passport Office in Liverpool in Merseyside rejected her initial application because of Miss Carter's expression in the photograph she provided. She has spent around £25 trying to get the photo right and had feared she was not going to be able to go on holiday with a friend to Santa Ponsa in Majorca - her first overseas holiday in 10 years. Miss Carter, 25, was born with nystagmus - a condition which means she can't focus her eyes independently . 'I have now had to write a letter explaining my disability as well as proof from my doctor and see if they will grant me a passport. I have taken new photos, but they are not much better - my eyes are beyond my control,' added Miss Carter. 'This matter is disgusting and discrimination against people who have eyesight problems. I should not have to explain a disability from birth to anyone. 'I live independently and don't need any help from anyone. I use a symbol cane to get around. 'It is something beyond my control and I just hoped they would be more understanding. I found I was treated with a lack of manners.' Miss Carter said she was concerned she would lose the £400 she had already spent on the much anticipated holiday with her childhood friend. Miss Carter was concerned she would not be able to go on holiday after her first application was rejected . The 25-year-old has had to write letters to officials and get a doctor's note to confirm her eye condition . 'I don't want in 10 years time when I re-apply for my passport to have to go through all this again.' Passport Office officials have now confirmed that her passport has now been sent out. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The letter sent to Miss Carter to explain why her application was refused stated the photo she had submitted was unacceptable because she did not have a neutral expression.

"Gabriel was forced off with a hamstring injury after just 36 minutes during Arsenal's 2-1 victory at QPR on Wednesday night, and Arsene Wenger admitted the defender could be out for three weeks. The £16m January signing was making his second Premier League start for the Gunners having made his full debut against Everton last weekend, but he went down holding the back of his leg in the first half. Laurent Koscielny replaced the 24-year-old Brazilian, who is set to miss the crucial FA Cup quarter-final clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford. Arsenal's new signing Gabriel was forced off with a hamstring injury in the first half against QPR . Arsene Wenger says he expects the Brazilian defender to be out for around three weeks with the injury . Laurent Koscielny replaced Gabriel with just 36 minutes on the clock at Loftus Road on Wednesday night . 'Gabriel had a hamstring problem,' Wenger said after the game at Loftus Road. 'I don't know how bad it is yet, it is usually 21 days.' The former Villarreal centre back was given a torrid time early on by Bobby Zamora as he got used to the physical nature of the Premier League. Wenger added: 'We were nervous in the first half and QPR put a shift in physically. They paid for that in the second half.' Arsenal sealed the win with goals from Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez, though in-form striker Charlie Austin gave Wenger's side a fright late on. Koscielny is expected to partner Per Mertesacker as the Gunners travel to play Louis van Gaal's Red Devils on Monday night, looking to reach Wembley for the second successive season.

"The last time Rudy Gestede faced Liverpool, he missed a penalty in the biggest game of his career so far as Cardiff lost the 2012 League Cup final in a shootout at Wembley. It took three years for Gestede to get another chance from the spot – scoring against Stoke City last month to help Blackburn through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup – and the striker will not be afraid to step up again if Rovers win a penalty at Anfield on Sunday. ‘Yeah, I would take it,’ said the Benin international. ‘That was a great final but penalties are a lottery and I missed mine. I remember it to this day. It’s still the biggest game I’ve played in. Rudy Gestede misses his penalty for Cardiff City during the 2012 League Cup final against Liverpool . It took three years for Gestede - now at Blackburn Rovers - to get another chance from the spot . The 26-year-old sent Stoke City keeper Jack Butland the wrong way in the previous round of the FA Cup . ‘I was younger then and I was a bit tired because it was the end of the game after extra-time. ‘That remains the only penalty I have missed. But it’s gone, it’s finished, it’ s behind me. It’s going to be a different game on Sunday.’ Gestede’s 15 goals this season have not gone unnoticed in the Premier League, and Blackburn rejected a £3.5milion offer from Crystal Palace in the January transfer window. After scoring against Swansea and Stoke in the earlier rounds, the 26-year-old sees Sunday’s game as another opportunity to showcase his talents. Blackburn face Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday, and Steven Gerrard could return to the Reds' starting XI . Gestede attempts to add to his tally of 15 goals this season in the recent defeat at home to Norwich . Gestede has the opportunity to move to the Premier League during January but chose to wait . He added: ‘If I can do well against Liverpool I can show Premier League clubs that the speculation was there because I’m a good player and not just because I’m tall and score a few goals with my head. ‘It was close with one club but I spoke a lot with the manager and he helped me to stay focused and think about Blackburn. ‘Nothing happened so in my mind I never left the club. It was a good chance to play in the Premier League but I wasn’t that disappointed.’","Cardiff City lost to Liverpool on penalties in the 2012 League Cup final .

"Richard Johnson's striking blue eyes water as bright sunlight floods into the Royal Box at Newbury Racecourse and he casts his mind back to a Monday night in Stratford almost 21 years ago. ‘That was the first time I met him,’ he says. ‘He was a lot skinnier and younger looking, as we all were. It was my first year as an amateur and his first as a conditional because he’d been riding on the Flat in Ireland for a couple of years. It was towards the end of the season and he’d already ridden 70-odd winners and I had 10. But even before that I’d heard people saying “This Anthony McCoy rode a winner today, he was amazing”. It takes very little time in the racing world for word to get around. He was getting horses to win that other people couldn’t and all the people that you want to be talking about you were talking about him.’ If AP McCoy had been a postman, a plumber or a professor, Johnson would probably be talked about as the greatest jump jockey ever. He has been runner-up 15 of the 19 times McCoy has been champion jockey and that figure will probably be 16 come the end of the season. Johnson’s tally of nearly 2,800 winners far outstrips the totals of giants of the game such as Richard Dunwoody, John Francome and Peter Scudamore, all of whom won the title at least three times. Richard Johnson would be talked about as one of the greatest jump jockeys ever if it weren't for AP McCoy . Johnson has finished runner-up to McCoy in the race to be crowned champion jockey 15 times . When McCoy retires at the end of the season Johnson, 37, is favourite to finally achieve his dream but there is no hint of bitterness at the years of playing second fiddle. ‘My main ambition has always been to be champion jockey and AP has been the thorn in my side for a long time,’ he says. ‘But it’s not his fault. It’s my fault that I haven’t ridden more winners than him. I find it slightly strange when people say, “Now he’s retired you can give it a real kick”. I go for it every day of the week, every year. I’ll start off the first day of next season as always. ‘Obviously without AP it’s definitely going to help but you’ve got a host of young jockeys like Tom Scudamore, Sam Twiston-Davies, Aidan Coleman and older ones like Noel Fehily and Jason Maguire so there’s going to be no easy run of it.’ Johnson has ridden nearly 2,800 winners during his career but never been champion jockey . Johnson rides Royale Django as he wins Ladbrokes 'National Hunt' Novices' Hurdle at Southwell Racecourse . McCoy celebrates after winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Synchronised in 2012 . McCoy has often credited the pressure Johnson puts on him for motivating him to ride on wet winter evenings as well as at the big occasions like the Cheltenham Festival. In 2009 he wrote: ‘Having Dickie as an adversary has, more than anyone else, spurred me on to ride more winners. The threat of him beating me to the title has made me more driven.’ At this, Johnson chuckles. ‘I’m not sure about that, I’ve just chased him a lot,’ he says. ‘It’s like running with Usain Bolt, he’s just turning back and laughing as he’s moving away.’ Many of the great sporting rivalries of the past have been characterised by sniping and swiping. But Johnson claims there is no room for that in racing, where jockeys know the perils every time they line up at the start and on a more basic level, they have to live with each other day in, day out. ‘The valets set up our gear every morning. It doesn’t matter how many winners you’ve ridden, it’s how long you’ve been riding. Because we started at the same time we’re usually sat next to or near each other. The longer you’ve been there the closer you get to the door. He’s been pushed out and I’m going to be next to the door. Cloud Creeper ridden by jockey Richard Johnson jumps the last to win Nicol & Fielding Mechanical Services Ltd Steeple Chase at Leicester Racecourse on Friday . McCoy credited pressure from Johnson as his motivation for riding so many winners . ‘Through the winter when we’re racing seven days a week there’s every chance we’ll be at the same meetings for days on end. I leave home at 4am and get back at 7pm. I rarely see my children [Willow six, Casper three and Percy, one] awake during the winter. I definitely see AP more than my children and probably my wife, Fiona.’ Johnson grew up on an arable and cattle farm in Hereford. He rode ponies as a child and as a teenager spent summers working at David Nicholson’s yard. ‘He offered me a job when I left school at 16,’ says Johnson, ‘I think my parents thought I’d go for two years, see a bit of life then go to agricultural college and come back and be a farmer.’ He would read copies of the racing newspaper Sporting Life, now defunct, at breakfast time. ‘Peter Scudamore was from the same county so I looked up to him,’ says Johnson. ‘When I understood racing a bit more Richard Dunwoody was the man I looked up to. He’s still someone I look up to today. Even though I’ve won more races, to be champion jockey would make me feel I belong in that bracket.’ The Cheltenham Festival is live on Channel 4.

"Glenn Maxwell scored the second-fastest century in World Cup history as Australia secured their place in the quarter-finals with an exciting 64-run win over Sri Lanka. Maxwell brought up his maiden one-day international hundred off 51 balls, one more than Kevin O'Brien took during Ireland's famous win over England four years ago, as Australia ran up a daunting 376 for nine batting first in Sydney. Maxwell struck 10 fours and four sixes in his 102 while Steve Smith (72), captain Michael Clarke (68) and Shane Watson (67) were also among the runs as the tournament co-hosts made hay after winning the toss at the SCG.

"A horrific video has emerged claiming to show a nine-year-old child being brutally murdered by members of a Shia militia who accused him of being a supporter of the Islamic State terror group. The footage was purportedly filmed near the Iraqi city of Tikrit, where a coalition of 30,000 Iraqi Army soldiers and private Shia armies launched a campaign to oust ISIS militants earlier this week. The horrific film has not been independently verified and could easily be just the latest piece of propaganda to be released by the terrorist organisation.

Although the video clearly shows the murder of a young child, reports that the execution was carried out by Shia militia battling ISIS militants near Tikrit could not be independently verified. The film has been widely shared by pro-ISIS social media accounts since it was first uploaded to LiveLeak yesterday as it plays into the terrorist sympathisers' narrative that the Iran-back Shia militia attempting to oust ISIS from Tikrit are no better than the jihadis themselves. This morning the United States' top general said Iran's direct support for an Iraqi push to dislodge ISIS from Tikrit could turn out to be 'a positive thing' if it does not inflame sectarian tensions. The statement by General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reflected the delicate balance Washington is trying to strike between limiting Iranian influence and allowing Iraqi leaders to determine their own path towards defeating ISIS.

US officials say Iraq did not ask the US to provide air support for the Tikrit offensive, even though the US-led military coalition has been conducting air strikes in much of Iraq since August and has deployed hundreds of US soldiers to try to regenerate an Iraqi army that collapsed last June. General Dempsey said Iran and its proxies have been operating inside Iraq since 2004, but the Tikrit campaign signals a new level of involvement. He said that about two-thirds of the force seeking to retake Tikrit is comprised of Iranian-based Shia militia fighters. Iraqi government troops make up the other third. Tikrit, the hometown of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, is a predominantly Sunni city. Retaking the ISIS stronghold is considered vital if government forces are to succeed in their plan to force ISIS out of the oil rich city of Mosul, the terror group's Iraqi power base which lies just 140 miles north of Tikrit on Highway 1 - a road that effectively marks the front line in northern Iraq.","Shocking footage shows a young child being murdered by armed men .

"In the dream scenario Steven Gerrard's final action in a Liverpool shirt will be the lifting of the FA Cup at Wembley Stadium on May 30, his 35th birthday. It will be emotional. For more than 16 years Gerrard was Anfield's beating heart. The good times were great. He gave them Istanbul, a crazy, glorious night forever etched into the club's history. A year later, in 2006, it was his last-minute long-range strike that gave them life against West Ham in Cardiff. Steven Gerrard returned to Liverpool training earlier this week after almost a month out with injury . The club captain led Liverpool to Champions League glory against AC Milan in 2005 . In total there was a Champions League, a Uefa Cup, two FA Cups and three League Cups. Even in the bad times (and there were plenty as a Premier League title remained elusive) the local boy was a source of Scouse inspiration. When Roy Hodgson wobbled and King Kenny came back but could only lead them to eighth, punters in pubs from Formby to Fazakerley could take solace. 'At least we've got Stevie G'. From next season, however, they will not. They appear to be giant boots to fill. Imagining a Liverpool without Gerrard is like imagining The Beatles without Paul McCartney. But the show must go on and, in Jordan Henderson, Brendan Rodgers might just have the ideal replacement. A year later Gerrard inspired the Reds to an FA Cup win against West Ham . A Liverpool team without Steven Gerrard will be like The Beatles without Paul McCartney (front left) His goalkeeper certainly thinks so. After Wednesday's 2-0 win over Burnley Simon Mignolet cast an early vote for May's Anfield election. 'Jordan is a massive player for us,' he said. 'He is a very positive character who always works hard and leads by example. 'He's vocal both on the pitch and in the dressing room. He goes in front of us and everyone follows behind.' Can Henderson lead from the front like Gerrard? Can he carry the team on his back? Some would point to the penalty spat with Mario Balotelli as evidence that the 24-year-old is not cut out for the job. Jordan Henderson has led the team in Gerrard's absence as Liverpool have made a charge for the top four . Henderson has been in inspired form for Liverpool and struck sensational goals in his last two games . Gerrard, they say, would never have let the Italian take the ball. He would have shown him who was boss. The man himself said as much. But they would be wrong to criticise. Balotelli, being Balotelli, was always going to try and take the penalty. And why not? Have you seen his record? Out of 29 penalties he has scored 27. Aside from his unpredictability, scoring from the spot is one of few things consistent about madcap Mario and Henderson, who has never taken a penalty in such a high-stakes environment, will have known that. For the good of the team he made the right call not to make a fuss. Surely that is the mark of a good captain? Gerrard, a fine skipper, was the master of responding to adversity and Henderson is no stranger to ramming critics' barbs back from whence they came. Since Sir Alex Ferguson's trial by autobiography he has written promising new chapters in his Liverpool career. Against Burnley he hit a netbuster from distance and then slid to his knees in front of the Kop. Sound familiar? Henderson celebrates after finding the top corner against Manchester City last weekend . In the five games Hemderson has played since Gerrard's absence Liverpool have won all five matches . His accent may be more Wearside than Whiston but Henderson is now being talked up as a successor and for good reason. He is not alone. There is a growing clamour to hand the armband to the Emre Can. The midfielder-turned-defender has been impressive since his backwards switch and was first to pick up Dejan Lovren following his penalty miss at Besiktas. The '#beast' is only 21, however, and his time will come. Time will be up for US-bound Gerrard at Stoke or at Wembley. Whether it's in Brent or at the Britannia, Liverpool will bid a painful farewell to their talisman and he will be missed. But if Gerrard remained the player that so often dragged his side from the turf Rodgers would not have allowed him to leave and that is worth noting when the inevitable tears are shed at his watershed. In the six Premier League games that Gerrard has missed this season Liverpool have won them all . It is easy to get sentimental when it comes to such a figure. Gerrard deserves to be remembered as a legend because, in this world where the word is bandied about at the drop of the hat, he is one. The fact of the matter, however, is that his impact has lessened considerably in recent times. In the Premier League this season Liverpool have played 22 games with Gerrard in the side. They have won nine of those, drawn six and lost seven at an average of 1.3 goals for, 1.3 against and 1.5 points per game. Without Gerrard they have played six games and won them all with an average of 2.3 goals for to 0.3 goals against. Maybe those boots are not as big as they used to be.","Steven Gerrard is leaving Liverpool in the summer to join LA Galaxy .

"Lance Armstrong welcomed an investigative report into the murky past of cycling's governing body and said he hopes it can help the sport move on from an era that will always be remembered for the doping by himself and others. The report turned up no evidence to sustain previous allegations that Armstrong paid the UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale) to cover up a positive doping test back in his heyday, yet it explains in great detail how the UCI acted favorably toward Armstrong - a rider dubbed 'cycling's pop star.' The Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) was requested by Brian Cookson, the current UCI president. Its report examined how the doping culture during Armstrong's era was allowed to fester under the previous UCI leadership of former president Pat McQuaid and predecessor Hein Verbruggen. Scroll down for video . Lance Armstrong pictured during his 2013 interview with Oprah where he admitted to doping. A new report published on Monday has found cycling leaders let doping flourish and broke their own rules so Armstrong could cheat his way to become a superstar the sport badly needed . 'I am grateful to CIRC for seeking the truth and allowing me to assist in that search. I am deeply sorry for many things I have done,' Armstrong said in a statement. 'It is my hope that revealing the truth will lead to a bright, dope-free future for the sport I love, and will allow all young riders emerging from small towns throughout the world in years to come to chase their dreams without having to face the lose-lose choices that so many of my friends, teammates and opponents faced.' Armstrong is trying to overturn a life ban imposed by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. He was stripped of his seven Tour titles for doping on every one of his wins from 1999-2005. Armstrong's attorney, Elliot Peters, said Armstrong 'cooperated fully' with senior investigators over two days, answering all questions 'without any restrictions' and providing 'all documents requested to which he had access.' In their affidavits provided to USADA - whose scathing report in 2012 exposed systematic doping by Armstrong and others - former U.S. Postal teammates Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis declared that Armstrong had told them separately that he tested positive for the performance enhancer EPO at the 2001 Tour de Suisse. Landis claimed that the test was hushed up as a result of a financial agreement with Verbruggen. Armstrong was tested five times during the 2001 Tour de Suisse. Three samples were tested for EPO and they came back negative, although there was a 'strong suspicion' that two of the 'A'' samples did contain traces of the banned blood booster, the CIRC report said — adding that it deemed inappropriate the fact that 'Armstrong and his entourage were informed by the UCI of these suspect test results.' A year later, Armstrong sent Verbruggen a letter containing a check for $25,000 as a donation toward the fight against doping. Although CIRC has 'not found any indication of a financial agreement' the report said the 'UCI did not act prudently in accepting a donation from an athlete' already under suspicion. A fan with an American flag running alongside Lance Armstrong during the parade after the 20th and last stage of the Tour de France cycling race in Paris, France in 2010. The report explains in great detail how the international cycling union acted favorably toward Armstrong - a rider dubbed 'cycling's pop star' The collusion between Armstrong and the UCI's leadership features strongly in the 227-page report. Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to draft parts of a supposedly independent report, which sought to debunk French daily L'Equipe's claims in 2005 that Armstrong's samples at the 1999 Tour later tested positive for EPO. The independent report into the '99 allegations, which was led by Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman, was heavily criticized because it 'specifically excluded an examination of the EPO test,' meaning it deliberately avoided addressing whether Armstrong used the substance. The Vrijman report coincided with an agreement between Armstrong and the UCI that he would donate $100,000 for the purchase of a Sysmex blood testing machine. This prompted allegations that his latest donation to the UCI's anti-doping cause was an indirect payment to help fund the Vrijman report and quash L'Equipe's story. The CIRC did not find 'any evidence to corroborate' such allegations but said the UCI acted improperly 'in soliciting and accepting donations from an athlete' under increasing suspicion. The close-knit relationship helped Armstrong on the '99 Tour when he tested positive for a banned corticosteroid. Armstrong did not declare pre-race that he was using medication — even though the argument he used for using a corticoid cream was to treat saddle sores. Rather than start disciplinary proceedings, the UCI accepted a backdated prescription and cleared him. Armstrong, having retired after the 2005 Tour, was also cleared by the UCI to make his comeback at Australia's Tour down Under in 2009 — despite not being eligible because he had not been in the UCI's doping testing pool for a six-month period beforehand. McQuaid first wrote to Armstrong, firmly telling him he could not race. But two days after that, McQuaid informed him that he could compete. The same day, Armstrong told McQuaid that he would race in the 2009 Tour of Ireland, which McQuaid was keen to promote in his homeland. In one email sent to McQuaid, written at the time of USADA's impending investigation, a UCI consultant refers to Armstrong as 'cycling's pop star' and states clearly that for the sake of its image the 'UCI has an interest that LA is acquitted.'

"It boasts a beautiful town centre and a wealth of history to explore. But it turns out there’s another reason why tourists flock to York – it’s considered the world’s safest city. And three more British towns – Bath, Edinburgh and Brighton – help make up the top four safest places. York is considered the world's safest city, according to a new study which found only one per cent of people consider it to be risky . Cairo, Bangkok, Istanbul and Marrakech were the cities deemed most risky to visit on a short break. The survey by Post Office Travel Insurance of 2,075 UK adults showed that 72 per cent felt York was safe, compared to one per cent considering it risky, and 26 per cent having no view. In contrast, only seven per cent thought Cairo was safe – and 56 per cent felt it was dangerous to visit. But London didn’t even make the top ten – with 58 per cent deeming the capital safe and 16 per cent risky. A stolen wallet (24 per cent) was the most common occurrence for those who had had problems in cities. As many as 26 per cent felt they had been ripped off on city visits, with this figure rising to 43 per cent among those aged 18-24. Cairo (pictured), Bangkok, Istanbul and Marrakech were the cities deemed most risky to visit on a short break . Of the eight UK and Ireland destinations in the survey, the least-safe was Belfast with only 37 per cent deeming it safe.

"Ryan Giggs insists Angel di Maria is not suffering from a crisis of confidence and expects him to play a major role in Manchester United's push for FA Cup glory and Champions League qualification. Di Maria became British football's most expensive signing when he joined United from Real Madrid for £59.7million last August but the Argentina World Cup star has struggled to justify that huge fee since scoring three times in his first five appearances. The 27-year-old wideman has netted only once in 19 games and been substituted in United's last three Barclays Premier League matches. Angel di Maria (left) has been backed by Ryan Giggs to show his quality for Manchester United . But United assistant manager Giggs is adamant Di Maria has a big part to play in the club achieving their end-of-season goals, starting with Arsenal's FA Cup quarter-final visit to Old Trafford on Monday night. 'I think his confidence is fine,' Giggs told Press Association Sport. 'He's a quality player and we'll be looking for him to produce because it is big game after big game now. Assistant manager Giggs denied claims that the 27-year-old was suffering from confidence issues . 'Players get used to different leagues, sometimes quickly and sometimes it takes a bit of time. 'He had a really good start to the season but with players who take risks and who can win games it's always difficult to be consistent because they will try things that other players won't do. 'They're capable of doing that and that's why they're match-winners and the best players.' United are involved in a thrilling race for Champions League football with Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and Southampton still chasing a top-four Premier League finish as well as top two Chelsea and Manchester City. The summer transfer from Real Madrid has scored only once in 19 appearances for his new club . Louis van Gaal's side are currently fourth after losing only two of their last 18 league matches and, although the nature of United's performances have often been criticised, Giggs says that form counts for far more at this stage of the season. 'This is the time really when results are the top focus and then the performances will come and the confidence you get from that,' said Giggs, who again denied media talk of a rift with Van Gaal by saying they had a 'great working relationship'. 'I think we've tried a lot of systems this year and obviously the manager's new to the players and new to the league, so that's going to take time. 'But over the last three months or so we've only been beaten twice and we're in pretty good form. Fabricio Coloccini disposes Di Maria at St James' Park where the midfielder was later substituted . 'It's tight and all the teams up there are in relatively good form. 'It could come to a few head-to-heads and we've got to play a few of the top teams yet, so it's going to be exciting right to the end.' Before then, however, United are focusing on the FA Cup and opponents against whom Giggs memorably scored an FA Cup semi-final winner in the club's 1999 'Treble' year. United have won the competition a record 11 times - a total cup holders Arsenal matched last year by beating Hull at Wembley - but not since 2004 when Giggs was part of the side which beat Millwall 3-0 at the Millennium Stadium in his native Cardiff. 'We've got so much history in the cup that it's long overdue,' Giggs said. Adnan Januzaj replaces the winger who was taken off for the third consecutive Premier League match . 'The club as a whole, the players and the fans are desperate to get to Wembley. 'We've had great battles and tussles over the years with Arsenal, especially in the cup. 'Of course, I've got fond memories of the semi-final (1999) and they beat us in the final (2005), but hopefully we can get through to the semis because whoever goes through in this tie has a great chance of winning the cup.' Giggs won the FA Cup four times during a celebrated United senior playing career which spanned an incredible 24 seasons but admits he is learning all the time on the coaching front. The former Real Madrid man failed to make an impact during United's last match against Newcastle . 'I've enjoyed every minute working under Louis,' Giggs said. 'He's been brilliant with me and we've helped each other along the way. 'He's come into a new league which I know all about. I'm starting all over again with coaching and serving an apprenticeship and who better to learn from than someone who is a great leader and has won so much over the years? 'I'm learning all the time and just trying to prepare myself the best I can that if I do become a manager I'm best equipped.'

"The image of the woodpecker giving a small weasel a lift on its back became an internet sensation and went viral around the globe. The emergence of photographer Martin Le-May's incredible snapshot has sparked dozen of hilarious memes parodying his work.

"A fishing guide who was accused of hurling abuse at his clients and defecating off the front of the boat has hit back at allegations made by disgruntled customers. Manager Allan Beale of Darwin’s Barra Base has been slammed over his alleged behaviour on the Australian travel website Trip Advisor. One client, under the name ‘robrobbo’ from Brisbane has penned his fishing safari experience with Beale as ‘so bad it was great’ after staying at the lodge with four other friends in February last year. Manager Allan Beale (left) of Darwin’s Barra Base has been running his business for more than 12 years . ‘Once we hit the water with Allan I think we were all looking around for the hidden cameras!’ the post read. ‘Abused at the boat ramp whilst attempting to help him launch the boat, abused when we hooked a fish, abused when we lost a fish, witnesses to the man himself defecating off the front of the boat…’ In response to these allegations, Beale told Daily Mail Australia the review was not true and are based on ‘one side of exaggeration’. ‘The reviews were pretty rude and distorted to the facts,’ Beale said. ‘Customer service is our business. We've been in the tourism business for more than 12 years and I'm saddened to read these false allegations after all these years.' Beale said the allegation was not true and are based on ‘one side of exaggeration’ - he also added that 'catfish are a pest' so he 'assists to minimise the population' Beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client's best interests . Beale said one person had suffered a sore back during this trip so he suggested an alternative because the man couldn't handle the rough waves and everyone was happy to choose the other location for fish species . Another client, under the name ‘Les N’ from Perth also took to the travel website to post their ‘overrated and disappointing’ experience. ‘I wrote a review on Alan's Facebook account after he used pictures of my group holding fish up that quite frankly I couldn't believe we kept?’ the post read. ‘We came here to catch sailfish & Barra? What a joke, not one sailfish and 3 barra, not one was a keeper, we paid nearly $4000 and didn't take a fish home, great.' Beale, who runs the fishing safari, said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business . A 152cm Black Jewfish landed Finniss River 17th June 2013 by Gary Bez from Karratha at head . But Beale told Daily Mail Australia they had set off for Sail City to go hunting for sailfish but one person among the group had suffered a sore back during the trip. ‘One of the chaps had a sore back and he couldn’t handle the wave action so I told them that we couldn’t go out there because we needed to look after the client’s best interest,’ Beale said. 'I like to make 100 percent of my customers happy but when it comes to bad weather and body conditions, the reality is - it’s hard to give them that because we can’t control the weather. ‘I knew the wave action from the wind would double in the next two hours and the sailfish would have been around 60 kilometres away so it was definitely out of the question. ‘I explained it to them and they accepted that they couldn’t handle the distance so I gave them two safer alternatives – go black jewfish fishing at Peron Island or travel out to Jenny and Blaze Wide for Spanish Mackerel – everyone picked the Spanish Mackerel. ‘I don’t think it’s fair to make these sorts of allegations towards our business because all we can do is offer the best service as possible.' Beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client's best interests . Beale, who runs the fishing safari, said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business . Darwins Barra Base will offer their clients the choice of Two Levels of Extended Fishing Safaris . Les N added: ‘Alan was the skipper the 1st day, what a miserable moany [sic] guy, all he did all day was tell us how much he was struggling to keep skippers & that his secretary was on stress leave. ‘Sorry mate we needed counciling [sic] after listening to your moaning all day,’ the post continued. But Beale responded: ‘During the day clients ask questions whilst fishing about work, fishing, staff and family and their business. This comment about me moaning about staff issues just shows how little he had to go to, to complain. ‘There are issues in these allegations – they are made up and completely false. ‘And as for the defecation claims – I never defecated and they are pure lies. ‘We don’t have commercial toilets. The truth of matter is, if someone has to go, then we have to go but you've got to do it in a safe matter.’ Beale added: ‘Send us an email and I'll look after you and ensure all the little issues presented in these reviews are better handled for you by me and my staff.’ For more information, please visit darwinbarrabase.com.au.","A fishing guide has been slammed over his alleged behaviour .

"If Eoin Morgan wanted to demonstrate that he is taking little notice of the outpouring of criticism that has greeted perhaps the worst of all England’s many under-achieving World Cups then he made a good job of it. The unthinkable possibility of a first-round elimination will become reality if England lose to Bangladesh here on Monday, yet the England captain talked as if nothing has been learnt from three abysmal defeats. The subject of England’s over-reliance on statistics has become the hot topic of a long week of introspection in Adelaide but Morgan does not seem to have noticed, judging by his first answer in Saturday's pre-match interrogation. Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . ‘Having a break has given us time to reflect and the analysis has come through which backs up our feel of what happened during the Sri Lanka game,’ said Morgan. ‘It makes things a lot clearer moving forward. It keeps it simple.’ Well, to put it simply, England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Wellington by nine wickets with 16 balls remaining, when 309 became not nearly enough. Does it need analysis to tell Morgan that England under-estimated what a winning score would be and then bowled like drains? Also, the key statistics in Gary Ballance’s World Cup are 10, 10, 10 and 6, his scores since being parachuted in to the side at the expense of Ravi Bopara on the eve of England’s first World Cup game against Australia. England warm up during a nets session at the Adelaide Oval where they will meet Bangladesh . Chris Jordan (left) is held back at the Adelaide Oval as he and his team-mates get prepared . Yet unless Morgan was being disingenuous to protect his man yesterday England, who tinkered with their team the day before the tournament, are now perversely going to be stubborn and again ignore the claims of Alex Hales. ‘The decision we made to put Gary at three was a huge one,’ said Morgan. ‘There wasn’t much between him and Alex at the time and it was just a feel we had. It is a big decision to change anyone in the side and it won’t be taken lightly nor quickly.’ No one is doubting that Ballance has a bright future but right now, when England’s need is most acute, he looks rusty and short of the dynamism needed at this tournament. If England really are determined not to pick Hales — and every indication here is that deep down they do not think he is the answer — then perhaps Bopara comes back into the frame with James Taylor returning to three. That would give England an all-important extra bowling option if their preferred tactic of bombarding the opposition with short deliveries from Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Steven Finn and Chris Woakes does not work again. Ravi Bopara (right) and Eoin Morgan of England look on during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . Defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide would pile the pressure on England coach Peter Moores . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . The big two of Broad and Anderson are just as big a worry as Ballance at three. Both have taken just two wickets in this World Cup and their return in tandem for the first time in one-day cricket in two years has not been the bowling panacea England were counting on after losing in Sri Lanka. ‘It’s a difficult one really,’ said Morgan. ‘They are exceptional bowlers but have not been putting the ball consistently in the right areas and haven’t been able to take early wickets.’ England need all their under-performing players to come through now. They should beat Bangladesh — who gained an unexpected point when their game against Australia in Brisbane was rained off — at the Adelaide Oval to keep their World Cup flame just about flickering. However, upsets do happen and Bangladesh have the ammunition to cause one. The simple truth is, at the moment, England do not look good enough to challenge the best teams here. And they don’t need an analyst to tell them that.","England face Bangladesh at World Cup on Monday at 3.30am GMT .

"Goals from winger Harry Wilson and striker Jerome Sinclair secured a 2-0 win for Liverpool U21s over Chelsea on Monday night. Sinclair's pace and and determination won a penalty in the first half which Wilson duly converted. The forward then added his own name to the score sheet after the restart, cutting in from the left flank and firing home his 22nd goal of the season from a tight angle. Liverpool U21s winger Harry Wilson scores from the penalty spot against Chelsea to put his side 1-0 up . Chelsea had started the brighter of the two sides and should have perhaps taken an early lead through Issiah Brown, but he could not direct an awkwardly bouncing ball into the net. That early scare prompted a response from the Reds though and Cameron Brannagan sent Sergi Canos through on goal soon after, although the Spaniard dragged his shot wide. The deadlock was broken when Sinclair powered his way into the Chelsea box in the eighth minute and was fouled by Fikayo Tomori, with Wilson scoring the ensuring spot kick. The second goal followed a similar routine - Sinclair's surging pace duped Tomori again and the young striker, dancing along the byline before whipping in from a seemingly impossible angle, was able to add to his already impressive scoring tally for the season.

"Peter Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time even though they face a humiliating early exit from the World Cup if they lose here on Monday against Bangladesh. Moores, a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after England's woeful showing at this World Cup. They need to defeat both Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval and Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday while hoping New Zealand also beat Bangladesh to ensure they claim the quarter-final place that should have been comfortable for them. England coach Peter Moores talks to the media during a press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday . Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time . Moores finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level . But Moores, who often struggles to get his message across in public, cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he cannot afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job. 'No regrets at all,' insisted Moores. 'I came in because I felt I could help make a difference. You have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we've certainly been behind in the one-day format and have to get better. 'I've no regrets on taking on that challenge. As a coach you have only one focus now and that's the World Cup. It comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment – to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament. 'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.' Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him. 'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't. England coach Moores speaks with Moeen Ali during an England nets session in Adelaide . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . 'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player. 'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing. 'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.' England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished. 'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.' Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday ahead of their next game . If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him. England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler. 'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.' There was also discouragement for his old bête noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket. 'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.

"Manchester United starlet Adnan Januzaj is prepared to play in any position to be given more opportunities under Louis van Gaal. The 20-year-old made his breakthrough last season in one of the few highlights of David Moyes' ill-fated reign at Old Trafford, but has been used sparingly by Van Gaal this term as the Dutchman prefers to play a 3-5-2 system without orthodox wingers. The young Belgian has started just eight games from 18 appearances this term but is prepared to play a variety of attacking roles. Louis van Gaal (right) speaks with Adnan Januzaj who has had is chances at United  limited this season . The young Belgian, who has started just eight games from 18 appearances this term, replaces Angel di Maria . 'My game is all about trying to make things happen,' Januzaj told the club's official website. 'We had the diamond at Cambridge and I played as a left-midfielder. I feel comfortable there as well. I think I can play well there without a problem. 'My favourite position is as a winger or a no.10. There are a lot of players here and I can play in different roles – it is just a case of taking any opportunities.' Januzaj shares a joke with United team-mates (L-R) Andreas Pereira, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera . The 20-year-old insists he can 'make things happen' from a variety of attacking positions . United, the former dominant force in the Premier League, have been criticised for not challenging for the title in Van Gaal's first season, although Januzaj insists a return to the Champions League was always a priority. 'I think that's the aim – to try to qualify for next year's Champions League,' he added. 'I played in it last year and it was very good to do so. I was really happy and you know you're waiting for that kind of opportunity again in the future.'","Belgium star has started only eight games in 18 appearances this season .

"The Football Association has written to Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion over what the governing body calls ‘disturbing crowd incidents’ during Saturday’s shameful FA Cup tie. In a statement the FA says all video footage will be studied to identify culprits and ‘ensure they face appropriate punishment’. Tony Pulis has called for West Brom fans found guilty of ripping up seats at Villa Park to receive lifetime bans, while similar sanctions are likely to befall home fans who goaded and shoved opposition players. Police clash with unruly fans in the aftermath of the FA Cup clash between Aston Villa and West Brom . The national lead officer for football policing has questioned the scheduling of the match on Saturday night . Villa face the prospect of a significant fine for failing to control their fans over three pitch invasions and the FA will want to establish whether any negligence was the cause. Villa have already issued an unreserved apology over the scenes at the end of a game which saw 17 people arrested overall. An FA statement read: ‘The FA has contacted both Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion to request their observations in relation to the disturbing crowd incidents which occurred during and after their FA Cup quarter-final tie on 7 March 2015. ‘As well as liaising with both clubs, The FA is working closely with West Midlands Police and notes that a number of arrests have already been made. ‘All available video footage will be studied by the relevant parties to identify anyone who has committed a disorder offence inside the stadium and ensure they face the appropriate punishment. ‘Whilst its investigation continues, The FA will make no further comment.’ Aston Villa fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park . Police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after Aston Villa booked their place in the semi-final . A Villa statement read: 'Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and West Midlands Police are all working together to investigate events which took place both during and after Saturday's FA Cup match. 'The Club will also cooperate fully with the Football Association. There will be no further comment until all inquiries are complete.’ The national lead officer for football policing questioned the scheduling of the match, which kicked off at 5.30pm. 'Saturday night football is here to stay, we appreciate that, Friday night football is due to be coming in,' he told BBC Radio Five Live. 'When you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play. All games have potential (for crowd trouble) but clearly some games have more potential than others. 'They are big clubs, not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture, late on a weekend in particular, alcohol is a factor. 'If you give people four, five, six hours more drinking time, don't be surprised if in a highly-charged atmosphere, their behaviour isn't good. Villa fans leap over hoardings at full-time, and the decision to play the game at 5.30pm is being questioned . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . 'If you're looking at whether alcohol was a factor, there was disorder at a public house near the ground before the game, people being arrested coming into the ground for being drunk and disorderly, being drunk seeking entry to a football ground. 'If you looked at the people who came onto the pitch, a few of them looked like they were worse for wear from some substance and I don't think there is any coincidence that where there's alcohol involved, people's behaviour tends to deteriorate.' He added: 'I do think there is an issue here for the broadcasters because that game was scheduled for a 5.30 kick-off to meet the BBC's scheduling. 'Broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously. 'What we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately. If you look at the four games for the FA Cup quarter-finals this week, you couldn't probably have picked a worse one to have on a Saturday tea-time than a local derby between two big clubs.' The West Brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full-time whistle . Scorer Scott Sinclair (second left) is mobbed by a fan and team-mates Ashley Westwood and Jack Grealish . Villa issued an apology for their fans' behaviour while West Brom vowed to take a 'zero tolerance' approach after promising to co-operate fully with the FA inquiry. And Baggies boss Tony Pulis has called for a lifetime ban for any of the club's fans who were found to be responsible for throwing seats. 'If that was the situation, and they've got CCTV cameras up there, those supporters should never come into another football ground. It is like people coming into someone else's house - you have to show respect.' West Brom forward Callum McManaman is escorted off the field after a row with an Aston Villa fan . The pitch at Villa Park can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass . Pulis was also concerned about the ease with which spectators were able to get on to the pitch. He added: 'I am old enough to have seen isolated incidents happen like that. I don't want to have a go and take anything away from what happened on the pitch and what happened in the game. 'If one thing, Villa should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night, 5.30pm, you need to police it properly, and I am sure Villa will look at it.'","Aston Villa fans twice invaded the pitch during their match vs West Brom .

"Stuart Hogg has whipped up a storm ahead of Saturday’s Twickenham clash by insisting England have ‘no respect’ for Scottish rugby and are ‘all about themselves’. The Scotland and Lions full-back believes his country are very much perceived as second-class competition south of the border - and his thoughts echo those of skipper Greig Laidlaw who claims ‘England don’t rate Scotland very much’. Both players are bottling up their frustrations for the Calcutta Cup clash, with Hogg hoping to silence the critics with Scotland’s first victory of this year’s RBS Six Nations following defeats to France, Wales and Italy. Stuart Hogg claimed England have 'no respect' for Scottish rugby ahead of Saturday's Twickenham clash . Hogg breaks away to score the opening try during the Six Nations game against Wales in February . Hogg (centre) wants to record Scotland's first win of the tournament against England at Twickenham . ‘The English are a fantastic team but they’re pretty much all about themselves at times,’ Hogg told Sportsmail. ‘They don’t really respect us and we find that pretty frustrating. There will be a certain number of people that do respect us but, no matter how good our performance is, on the whole they don’t. ‘We’re not really in a position to make them respect us when we’re zero wins from three, so for that to happen we need to go down there and shut them up with a great performance and a big win.’ Hogg revealed that his frustrations were exacerbated during Glasgow Warriors’ European Champions Cup ties with Bath earlier this season when the Pro12 side won 37-10 in the first leg at Scotstoun before narrowly losing 20-15 in the reverse fixture at The Rec. Asked to explain his comments about the lack of respect, the 22-year-old Borderer said: ‘There are loads of different things. Take Bath, for instance, in the European games. We pummelled them at home in Glasgow and almost beat them down there, yet their coach never once mentioned us after the games. ‘After they went through, they said they had a tough pool with Toulouse and Montpellier, but never once mentioned us. That kind of sums it up for me and, with the way the lads go on with Greig Laidlaw down at Gloucester, it’s quite clear that they don’t respect us.’ Meanwhile, England centre Brad Barritt is a doubt for Saturday after injuring his ankle in Saracens’ 26-17 win at Wasps on Sunday. Hogg clings to the ball in Scotland's 22-19 defeat against Italy in their last Six Nations game . Brad Barritt injured his ankle in Saracens' win over Wasps on Sunday and is now a doubt for England . Barritt seemed destined for a recall against Scotland, with Luther Burrell unable to train last week, but the 28-year-old limped away from the Ricoh Arena after Wasps fly-half Andy Goode landed heavily on his right leg. Saracens’ director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘It seems to be his ankle. The knee seems to be okay. I’m sure he’ll be close to selection for England next weekend, so fingers crossed it’s not as bad as it looked.’ If Barritt is fit to play, he is set to rejoin the back line along with Harlequins full-back Mike Brown. Up front, Northampton’s Courtney Lawes is expected to come into the second row in place of George Kruis.","Stuart Hogg wants to record 'a big win' for Scotland against England .

"You can search far and wide for the answer to a problem, but sometimes it is right under your nose. When Arsene Wenger sent Francis Coquelin on loan to Charlton in November it looked to be the final nail in the Frenchman's Arsenal career. The Gunners manager admitted as much recently, revealing he was prepared to let the midfielder leave in December. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin (right) controls the ball during his side's win against QPR . The Frenchman wore a protective mask at Loftus Road after fracturing his nose against Everton . Coquelin, pictured challenging Sandro, has become the Gunners' midfield enforcer in recent months . But a spate of injuries in midfield saw Wenger recall Coquelin in December. The 23-year-old hasn't looked back. He's grasped his chance to become a key member of Arsenal's midfield with both hands, despite his reluctance to return to Arsenal from Charlton fearing he'd simply be warming the bench. There's an argument to suggest he's the most vital component in Wenger's plans at the present moment; the central midfield enforcer they've been crying out for in recent years. Just weeks after his Arsenal career looked to be drawing to a close, Coquelin is on the verge of agreeing a new long-term contract to stay at the Emirates Stadium. Wenger would like to say Coquelin's emergence has been pre-planned; a managerial masterstroke that has helped Arsenal turn their stuttering league form around. But that is far from the case. Coquelin played five games on loan at Charlton this season but has returned to be a first team regular . Coquelin's stint in the first team has earned him a new long-term contract with the Gunners . The Frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot Mathieu Flamini in the pecking order . Following three substitute appearances after his return from the Valley, Coquelin was handed a rare start against West Ham on December 28 in place of the injured Mathieu Flamini. He hasn't looked back. His energetic and mature displays alongside Santi Cazorla in central midfield have been a revelation - none more so than in the win at Manchester City in January. The concern with Coquelin has always been about his physical stature. Can his slender frame handle the rough and tumble of Premier League football? He's answered those questions unequivocally in recent weeks. Having fractured his nose in the recent win over Everton, the midfielder insisted upon playing on - only coming off in injury time after taking another blow to the face. Three days later he was back on the pitch, sporting a protective mask, in the narrow win over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. He's waited so long to prove himself in an Arsenal shirt, Coquelin's won't let a broken nose keep him on the sidelines now. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger admitted that he was willing to let Coquelin leave the club before his return . Wenger is still interested in Southampton's defensive midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) Coquelin, pictured in training, still needs to convince Wenger that he can play for Arsenal long-term . The big question is whether Coquelin is the long-term answer to Wenger's holding midfielder conundrum. After failing to sign an enforcer last summer, the Gunners will be back in the market for a midfield ball winner once more at the end of the season despite Coquelin's emergence. Morgan Schneiderlin, for the time being, is favourite to land the role provided Arsenal can strike a deal with Southampton, who will want at least £25milliom. That would leave Coquelin's regular place in Wenger's team selections under threat. For now Coquelin will be focusing on keeping his place in the team until the end of the season. The returns of Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere following injury spells will cast further questions over the Frenchman's role. But, for now, the shirt is Coquelin's to lose. Having waited so long for this chance - he'll be desperate to keep it that way.","Arsenal were set to release Francis Coquelin this summer .

"Andy Murray responded to an earsplitting welcome from his adoring Scottish crowd to put Great Britain 1-0 up in their Davis Cup first round against the United States. In front of a packed 7,700 crowd at a Union Jack-bedecked Emirates Arena in Glasgow he recovered from a brief lull to eventually crush American number two Donald Young 6-1 6-1 4-6 6-2 in just under two hours. The match was over quick enough for Murray to remain as the likely option to play in tomorrow’s doubles alongside brother Jamie in the event of the tie ending level today at 1-1. Andy Murray lets out a celebratory scream as the Brit beats Donald Young in the David Cup . The British No 1 sunk Donald in front of a home crowd in Glasgow, winning the match in four sets . Australian Open finalist Murray pumps the air after claiming victory for Great Britain . Murray beat Young during day 1 of the Davis Cup match between Great Britain and USA . British No 1 Murray won the first two sets against the American . 'To play in front of this crowd is very special and I’m glad I managed to play a good match and get the win,' said Murray. 'I played an extremely high level in the first two sets and it was tough to keep that intensity up. I had a slight lull in the middle of the third set and Donald settled down.' After getting a deafening reception when he walked onto the court Murray needed to control his emotions sufficiently to concentrate on beating the world number 47 from Atlanta. The pair knocked up in slightly surreal circumstances to the crowd singing along with Runrig’s ‘Loch Lomond’ and that seemed to inspire the former Wimbledon champion and unnerve the ex junior world number one.

Australian Open finalist Murray celebrates after winning a point against opponent Young . Murray shows his frustration during the match against Young in Glasgow on Friday . Murray rattled through the first set, not dropping a point on serve as he took it in 21 minutes. He was equally unwavering in taking the second after just 47 minutes’ overall play with Young pressing too hard and making errors galore on the slow indoor court. The American lefthander found his range more in the third and when the Scot put in a poor game at the end of it was good enough to close it out. To the delight of a partisan but well-behaved crowd he regained his focus in the fourth set and took it after another two breaks. His fist pumping celebration spoke of how much it meant to him. British number two was up against the huge serving John Isner in the singles rubber that followed.","Andy Murray beat Donald Young in Great Britain's opening match vs USA .

"Ronny Deila has urged his Celtic players to embrace history - rather than fear it - when their aspirations of landing the Treble are put on the line in three showdowns with Dundee United. Celtic travel to Tannadice on Saturday in the Scottish Cup quarter-final - before a Hampden clash with Jackie McNamara's men in the League Cup final seven days later is followed by a Premiership meeting with the Tangerines the following weekend. Those three games will go a long way to determining if this Celtic team have the mettle to become just the fourth in the club's history to complete a clean sweep of domestic honours. Ronny Deila has urged his Celtic players to embrace history, rather than fear it, against Dundee United . Deila says his squad are fully aware that only Jock Stein's sides of 1967 and 1969 together with Martin O'Neill's class of 2001 had previously won the league, Scottish Cup and League Cup. But the Norwegian believes they should be inspired by the prospect of matching such heady feats rather than be daunted by it. 'Everyone is aware of that,' Deila said. 'That's a positive thing - and we really want it. But we have to do it on the pitch. Celtic's Efe Ambrose leaves the field dejected as St Johnstone celebrate their midweek win at Celtic Park . 'There is nothing to fear. These are positive things. We are not talking relegation. That's a hard pressure. We have everything to win and we are really looking forward to it. 'Dundee United have done a very good job this year. They have been a good team and are going to be a tough opponent. We have to be up for the game. 'The three games between them – they are going to be really tough. But to win the championship and trophies is going to be hard. Everybody knows that. The cup is one game so we have to do everything we possibly can before the game to be ready for it.' Celtic blew a chance to extend their lead over Aberdeen to nine points on Wednesday by losing 1-0 at home to St Johnstone. St Johnstone's Steven MacLean holds off Celtic's Jason Denayer during the game at Celtic Park in midweek . Yet, Deila was reluctant to be overly critical of his players, given the game was their eighth in 26 days. 'It is not the second and the third and the fourth game that is hard when you play so many games,' he insisted. 'It is when you come to the sixth and seventh after each other and also only having three days instead of four between games. 'It is a big difference because you can't get 100 per cent rested. You lose 10 per cent against Inter Milan and then go into the game against Aberdeen and lose another 10 per cent again because you can't rest. St Johnstone's Murray Davisdon clears the ball from Celtic's Virgil van Dijk during the midweek clash . 'You saw against St Johnstone that the first 25 minutes was good, we were controlling the game, playing quick and getting chances but suddenly it was like a click and the energy was out of the boys.' However, Deila fully expects his players to be back to their best by the time they arrive on Tayside. 'This is four days (rest) and that is an important thing. It is an extra day and also it is not 12pm but 3.30pm so I am glad we play on Sunday and we are going to bounce back on Sunday – I am confident of that.' As well as the absences of cup-tied pair Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, Deila has a number of injury concerns. Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong will miss the game against Dundee United as they are cup tied . 'Adam (Matthews) got a twisted ankle so hopefully he will be okay,' he explained. 'With Kris (Commons) and John (Guidetti) we will have to see but there are possibilities for both of them. 'With Emilio (Izaguirre) we have to think about what we will do. He is a possibility but we will be taking a risk with him. It is too early for (Mikael) Lustig or (Charlie) Mulgew.' Pressed on the prognosis for Izaguirre's broken finger, Deila said: 'Emilio doesn't need an operation but it might be a bit of a risk to play him.' John Guidetti could return to the Celtic squad to take on Dundee United at the weekend .","Celtic Dundee United in the Scottish Cup quarter finals at Tannadice .

"Fernando Alonso has expressed natural disappointment he is to sit out the season-opening Formula One grand prix in Australia, but is fully appreciative of the circumstances. On advice from doctors Alonso will have to wait for his competitive return with McLaren until the second race in Malaysia later this month. Although given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in a heavy crash in the second pre-season test in Barcelona on February 22, the fear of 'second-impact syndrome' has forced Alonso's hand. Fernando Alonso was involved in a high-speed crash during testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya . Alonso's McLaren is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck after crashing in Barcelona . McLaren driver Alonso was taken by helicopter to hospital following the accident in Catalonia . Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia . The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death. Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks. Via his Twitter account, Alonso said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' £countdownMalaysia.' For the Albert Park event Alonso's seat will now be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014. A thrilled Magnussen, who will partner Jenson Button in Melbourne, tweeted: 'Shame about the circumstances but still I'm so excited to be racing in Melbourne. Can't wait!!' The 22-year-old Danish racer Kevin Magnussen will replace Alonso for McLaren at the Australian Grand Prix . To which a sporting Alonso replied: 'best of luck at the race mate! £BelieveInMcLarenHonda.' Explaining the circumstances behind the decision taken to withdraw Alonso from Australia, McLaren have revealed doctors found the 33-year-old to be 'asymptomatic', with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury' and 'entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives'. But given the prospect of second-impact syndrome Alonso was 'advised he should not compete in the imminent Australian Grand Prix meeting'. A McLaren statement added: 'Fernando has understood and accepted that advice. Fernando's doctors acknowledge he feels fit and well, and he regards himself as ready to race. Medical staff arrived on the scene to give Alonso treatment at the side of the road after the accident . A helicopter was sent to pick up Alonso and taken him to hospital from Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya . Alonso was taken to hospital by helicopter after being involved in a crash at speeds of up to 150mph . 'That being the case they are comfortable with the fact he has already recommenced physical training, with a view to preparing for a return to the cockpit of his McLaren-Honda car for the Malaysian Grand Prix meeting on March 27, 28 and 29. 'Indeed, his doctors are supportive of that ambition, satisfied as they are that he sustained no damage whatsoever during his testing accident on February 22. 'All at McLaren-Honda fully support Fernando's decision in respect of his doctors' advice.'

"A video showing former NFL star Aaron Hernandez allegedly holding a gun and leaving his home with his two co-defendants just hours before the shooting death of Odin Lloyd has been played in court. The footage, taken by the extensive surveillance system in and around Hernandez's Massachusetts house, was captured on June 17, 2013, the day Lloyd was gunned down in a nearby industrial park. It shows the ex-New England Patriots tight end returning to his $1.3million property, where his infant daughter was being babysat, after celebrating Father's Day with his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. After arriving back home at around 12.45am, he is filmed walking through the living room carrying a large black object, before putting it in his pocket. Prosecutors have claimed the item was a gun. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: This video footage, which was played in Bristol County Superior Court on Monday, shows ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez (right) walking through his home carrying a large black object on June 17, 2013 . Evidence: Prosecutors have claimed the object Hernandez was holding (right) at around 12.45am that day - just hours before Odin Lloyd was shot dead at an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts - was a gun . On trial: The video also shows the ex-New England Patriots tight end (pictured in court on Monday) returning to his $1.3million property with his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Their infant daughter was being babysat inside . However, when the video was played for jurors on Monday, the object was indiscernible. Hernandez and Jenkins's babysitter Jennifer Fortier, 28, then testified she had not seen the item in the room. The footage also shows Hernandez and Jenkins being greeted the suspect's two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also accused of killing Lloyd, who was dating Jenkins's sister. And it depicts Hernandez climbing into the front passenger seat of a Nissan Altima rental car and leaving his home at 1:09 am, with Wallace driving and Ortiz sitting in the rear driver's-side seat. The latter two men have pleaded not guilty to murder. They will be tried separately from Hernandez. At an earlier hearing, surveillance video - captured at a gas station south of Boston  an hour after the trio had left Hernandez's North Attleboro home - was played to Bristol County Superior Court. It showed the former NFL player driving the Nissan. Prosecutors have previously said the suspects went to pick up Lloyd, then took him to the industrial park, where he was shot just before 3:30am. Departure: Footage played in court on Monday depicts Hernandez climbing into the front passenger seat of a Nissan Altima rental car and leaving his home at 1:09 am, with Wallace driving and Ortiz sitting in the back . The trio then drive off (pictured). Wallace and Ortiz are also accused of murder and are being tried separately . Babysitter: As the video footage was played for jurors, the object Hernandez was carrying on the night was indiscernible. His and Jenkins's babysitter Jennifer Fortier (pictured), 28, said she had not seen the item at all . The Nissan was returned to the rental car agency by Hernandez later that day. It had scrapes along the driver's side, while the driver's-side mirror was missing, according to previous testimony. Another surveillance video previously played shows Hernandez holding what is alleged to be a gun inside his living room just minutes after Lloyd, a semi-professional football player, was shot dead. Earlier on Monday, Judge Susan Garsh told the Fall River-based court that she had received a note from a juror. He was questioned privately at the bench. Trial then resumed. Court: At an earlier hearing, surveillance video - captured at a gas station south of Boston an hour after the trio had left Hernandez's North Attleboro home - was played to Bristol County Superior Court. It showed the former NFL player (pictured speaking with his attorney, Charles Rankin, during Monday's trial) driving the Nissan . Teary-eyed: Ursula Ward, the mother of victim  Lloyd, listens to testimony during Hernandez's murder trial . On Friday, Diane Fife Biagiotti, a Massachusetts State Police crime lab DNA analyst, testified had she found the DNA of Hernandez and Lloyd on a marijuana cigarette recovered near Lloyd's body.

"The national lead officer for football policing has questioned the scheduling of Aston Villa's FA Cup quarter-final against West Brom on Saturday after the match was marred by crowd disturbances. Villa fans invaded the pitch on two occasions while seats were torn out and thrown from the North Stand which was housing the Albion fans. The Football Association is launching an investigation while West Midlands Police made 17 arrests related to the game and are also seeking witnesses to a disturbance at the Witton Arms pub before the game, which kicked off at 5.30pm. Police clash with unruly fans in the aftermath of the FA Cup clash between Aston Villa and West Brom . The national lead officer for football policing has questioned the scheduling of the match on Saturday night . Four of those arrests were for drunk and disorderly behaviour and Mark Roberts from Cheshire Police believes more consideration should be taken over the scheduling of potentially heated fixtures. 'Saturday night football is here to stay, we appreciate that, Friday night football is due to be coming in,' he told BBC Radio Five Live. 'When you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play. All games have potential (for crowd trouble) but clearly some games have more potential than others. Aston Villa fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park . Police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after Aston Villa booked their place in the semi-finals . 'They are big clubs, not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture, late on a weekend in particular, alcohol is a factor. 'If you give people four, five, six hours more drinking time, don't be surprised if in a highly-charged atmosphere, their behaviour isn't good. 'If you're looking at whether alcohol was a factor, there was disorder at a public house near the ground before the game, people being arrested coming into the ground for being drunk and disorderly, being drunk seeking entry to a football ground. 'If you looked at the people who came onto the pitch, a few of them looked like they were worse for wear from some substance and I don't think there is any coincidence that where there's alcohol involved, people's behaviour tends to deteriorate.' Villa fans leap over hoardings at full-time, and the decision to play the game at 5.30pm is being questioned . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . He added: 'I do think there is an issue here for the broadcasters because that game was scheduled for a 5.30 kick-off to meet the BBC's scheduling. 'Broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously. 'What we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately. If you look at the four games for the FA Cup quarter-finals this week, you couldn't probably have picked a worse one to have on a Saturday tea-time than a local derby between two big clubs.' The West Brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full-time whistle . Scorer Scott Sinclair (second left) is mobbed by a fan and team-mates Ashley Westwood and Jack Grealish . Villa issued an apology for their fans' behaviour while West Brom vowed to take a 'zero tolerance' approach after promising to co-operate fully with the FA inquiry. And Baggies boss Tony Pulis has called for a lifetime ban for any of the club's fans who were found to be responsible for throwing seats. 'If that was the situation, and they've got CCTV cameras up there, those supporters should never come into another football ground. It is like people coming into someone else's house - you have to show respect.' West Brom forward Callum McManaman is escorted off the field after a row with an Aston Villa fan . The pitch at Villa Park can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass . Pulis was also concerned about the ease with which spectators were able to get on to the pitch. He added: 'I am old enough to have seen isolated incidents happen like that. I don't want to have a go and take anything away from what happened on the pitch and what happened in the game. 'If one thing, Villa should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night, 5.30pm, you need to police it properly, and I am sure Villa will look at it.'","Aston Villa fans twice invaded the pitch during their match vs West Brom .

"A video purporting to show the executions of two alleged spies has been released by Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram. One of the men is made to make a full confession, explaining his 'crimes' to the camera, before they pair are beheaded and their bodies shown to the camera. The gruesome execution video echoes those posted by Islamic State and is the second released by Boko Haram. Scroll down for video . Brutal: A gruesome video allegedly showing the executions of two men accused of working as police spies has been released by Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram . The video, called 'Harvest of Spies', was posted Monday on Twitter by Boko Haram, the SITE intelligence group said today. It starts by showing a man kneeling in the foreground with a group of Boko Haram fighters approaching him holding a flag used by militant Islamist groups. In a theatrical display previously seen in the execution videos released by ISIS, the men line up behind the victim. The video then cuts to show two men, identified as Dawoud Muhammad and Muhammad Awlu, led by Boko Haram fighters before being made to kneel. One Boko Haram fighter, whose face has been blurred by the militant group, stands behind Dawoud Muhammad, holding a large knife. Spy: One of the victims is made to confess his 'crimes' to the camera before the two are beheaded . Horror: After one of the men has spoken of how they have spied on Boko Haram on behalf of the local police force, the pair are beheaded by militant fighters . Mr  Muhammad tells the camera that he  is a farmer from Baga, northern Nigeria, and is then made to answer a series of questions at knifepoint. Mr Muhammad reveals that hat he had been approached by a police officer who offered him money in exchange for infiltrating Boko Haram. 'We went to see a man from Mijka and a police officer that was with him. The officer gave me 5,000 Naira (£16.20),' Mr Muhammad tells the camera. Mr Muhammad is made to confess that their mission has been to spy on the 'residents who live here' i.e. Boko Haram, and in exchange for spying, the police officers had promised him that he would 'become rich and will never go back to be a farmer again'. Promoting terror: The video emerged on a Boko Haram Twitter account on Monday . The camera pans from left to right in slow motion, showing Mr Muhammad and Mr Awlu on their knees as they are executed by Boko Haram fighters. The video fades before the actual beheadings take place, and then shows the two men's bodies with their heads placed upon their chests. The video does not reveal how the spies were caught by the militants and MailOnline has yet to confirm its authenticity. Boko Haram previously published only one beheading, of a Nigerian fighter pilot whose plane went missing in September. Mr Muhammad's home town of Baga, was the site of a series of mass killings carried out by Boko Haram in January this year which is believed to have resulted in 2,000 deaths and saw more than 14,000 people flee the city.","Beheading video released by Nigerian terrorists Boko Haram .

"Jonjo O’Neill has no doubts who he will be shouting for if two particular horses are galloping clear to the final fence in Friday’s Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup. One, Irish-trained Carlingford Lough, owned by JP McManus, ridden by soon-to-retire 19-time champion jockey AP McCoy, will be carrying a hill of punters’ money and a mountain of sentimental support. The other, Holywell, a winner at the last two Festivals and who showed his old sparkle when winning his warm-up race at Kelso last month under McCoy, is O’Neill’s main hope for a big win this week. Trainer and ex-jockey Jonjo O'Neill pictured at Cheltenham Racecourse ahead of next week's Festival . AP McCoy (left) and trainer Jonjo O'Neill pictured with Synchronised and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2012 . With McManus being O’Neill’s landlord and staunchest supporter, and McCoy his long-time ally, who helped deliver both the 2012 Gold Cup on Synchronised and 2010 Grand National on Don’t Push It, it might seem at best a difficult dilemma and at worst a nightmare scenario. But O’Neill is clear where his support will lie. ‘I will be shouting for Holywell. The rent may go up but we will talk about that later,’ he says, as he looks out over the famous strip of Cheltenham turf that has defined his career. The arduous climb to the finishing post was the scene of the two-time champion jockey’s 1980 Champion Hurdle win on Sea Pigeon and, even more memorably, the heart-stopping surge to the line on 1986 Gold Cup-winning mare Dawn Run. Don’t be fooled by the sparkling smile and twinkling eyes. O’Neill might come over like a cross between Father Christmas and your favourite uncle but he has not risen to the top of the racing ladder by being soft-hearted. ‘I knew if JP had a runner AP would ride it. He pays the retainer,’ he says. ‘Richie McLernon will ride Holywell and they get on really well. They have clicked and Richie has twice won on him at Cheltenham. He has won at two Festivals so hopefully he can make it three in a row.’ Holywell is one of O'Neill's main hope for a big win in the Cheltenham Gold Cup . McCoy (right) and O'Neil (left) pictured with John McManus after winning the Grand National . While O’Neill is determined to deny McCoy the big final Festival send-off the jockey is hoping for, that doesn’t mean he is not desperate to provide him with a winner despite the blow of one of their big hopes, last year’s World Hurdle winner More Of That, missing the meeting. They have become more than just employer and employee and no one is better placed to assess McCoy than O’Neill, a man who rode against a generation of former weighing room giants including Ron Barry, Dessie Hughes, John Francome, Peter Scudamore and Tommy Carberry. ‘There is a piece of everybody in him,’ says the man who has trained 25 Festival winners. ‘Some fellas are a great judge of pace but wouldn’t be able to produce a horse at a fence. He is the complete all-rounder. ‘He knows the pace, the tracks and the ground. He has ridden north, south, east and west and knows what every other horse in the race and their jockeys will be doing. He knows who to follow and who not to follow. ‘Basically, he is a freak and he loves winning, which is great.’ Regular Festival observers have learned to set their watch by O’Neill, who has only twice driven away from the last day without a winner since the turn of the century. The signs are again positive with 22 winners since the start of February an indicator that his string is back in form. O'Neill is determined to deny McCoy the big final Festival send-off the jockey is hoping for . O'Neill, who has trained 25 Cheltenham Festival winners, described McCoy as a freak that loves winning . That is in stark contrast to dark days when the whole of November, a blank December and January yielded only 11 victories. ‘It was very bleak,’ said O’Neill. The barren patch scuppered hopes of launching an outside challenge for the trainers’ title that had been made possible by a bright start to the season. That remains the O’Neill ambition but one hampered, he feels, by the wrong perception he is McManus’s private trainer. He says: ‘One day, hopefully, I will be champion trainer. We are an open house and there is nobody who enjoys us having winners for other people more than JP. ‘I knew we didn’t have the firepower [this year] but were expecting to have a better season with the better horses. Hopefully, they will finish off the season better.’ No one will be surprised if he does. Course specialist Johns Spirit in the Ryanair Chase and Taquin Du Seuil, winner of the JLT Novices’ Chase last season and possibly heading down the handicap route, both have claims and a Festival gamble on an O’Neill handicapper is almost obligatory. But it is Holywell, winner of the 2013 Pertemps Hurdle and what is now the Ultima Business Solutions Handicap Chase last year, who leads the O’Neill charge. The trainer describes the eight-year-old, who is transformed by blinkers, as a ‘little con man’. If he dashes the McCoy’s Gold run, party pooper might be more appropriate.","The 2015 Cheltenham festival starts begins on Tuesday next week .

"No Davis Cup match would be complete without some kidology, and some of that duly surrounds the match that everyone in Glasgow wants to see this weekend. Andy and Jamie Murray versus world champions Bob and Mike Bryan on Saturday looks to be the pivotal rubber of the World Group first round knockout match between Great Britain and America, which begins this afternoon at the Emirates Arena. Yet the home side were trying to play down expectations that it would happen on Thursday. Middlesex's Dom Inglot was officially named to play with Jamie Murray while the former Wimbledon champion insisted it was 'unlikely' he would play on Saturday. (From left to right) Dom Inglot, Jamie Murray, captain Leon Smith, James Ward and Andy Murray fancy their chances of taking down the USA with the backing of a noisy Glasgow crowd . Murray admits he is unlikely to team up with brother Jamie in an all-sibling Davis Cup doubles pairing . Murray will face the USA's Donald Young in Friday's opening singles tie in Glasgow's Emirates Arena . Jamie Murray (left),  Andy Murray (centre) and Smith speak to the media on Thursday . The smart money, however, would be on a clash of two siblings as the emotional centrepiece of what ought to be a fascinating three days. If, as expected, the match stands at 1-1 by Friday night then GB Captain Leon Smith will surely opt to throw in his trump card against the world's leading pair - however unlucky that would be for Inglot, who has actually beaten them twice this year with Romania's Florin Mergea. The Murrays against the Bryans would have so many ingredients: brothers versus brothers, Wimbledon champions versus Wimbledon champions, the ultimate doubles specialists versus a supreme singles player. SNP versus USA? Let's not go there. Playing America in the Davis Cup is not what it was twenty years ago, but there is still a cachet about the fixture that was the original challenge match for this competition when it was invented in 1900. It is mostly the homecoming of the Murrays that will ensure that the indoor arena next door to Celtic Park will be noisily packed to the rafters when the match begins. Jamie, who has had a cold, on Thursday declared himself fully fit. The doubles will see a crescendo reached, and it is notable that one of the game's most experienced Referees, Stefan Fransson, has been allocated to the match to ensure that everything remains as orderly as possible. As Jamie pointed out, the crowd will be 'full of people we've known our whole life, a lot of familiar faces.' Andy acknowledged that part of the task for him will be to control his emotions over the three days: 'The beginning of the matches are normally where I find it would affect me most in Davis Cup. When you come out, the national anthem, the crowd getting right into it at the beginning. Yes, it's an emotional experience. And sometimes at the beginning of the matches you can be a bit fired up, amped up, whatever you want to call it. 'That tends to subside after the first 15 or 20 minutes. Than you just get down to trying to concentrate on the tactics, the process and trying to win the match.' The last time a significant American team came to these parts it was the Ryder Cup five months ago at Gleneagles. That ended in defeat and recrimination for the visitors, but their chances of success this time are greater and they are marginally the favourites. Not as much as they would be in times when they could call upon the likes of their now Captain, Jim Courier, whose relatively shallow pool of players means this will draw scant attention back home. Murray (right) will kick off the tie at Glasgow's Emirates Arena on Friday against Donald Young . Bob (left) and Mike Bryan field questions from the press ahead of the weekend's Davis Cup action in Glasgow . His biggest call has been to pick world number 47 Donald Young as his second singles player, who could find himself playing a deciding rubber against GB number two James Ward on Sunday afternoon. Young, now 25, was once the youngest ever junior world number one and has found some good form in the past month. But his achievements have never matched his natural gifts and his sometimes flaky temperament will be tested as never before if he faces the lower ranked Ward with the match still alive. Britain's own stocks are so modest that there has been a frisson of excitement around the 27 year-old London cabbie's son recent flirtations with the top 100. What he will not lack is motivation, and some of his best performances have come in the Davis Cup, such as when he beat America's Sam Querrey last year. James Ward chats with Captain of The Aegon GB Davis Cup Team Leon Smith ahead of the Davis Cup match . 'The two biggest passions in my life are Arsenal and playing for my country,' he said. ' I am patriotic. I think you have seen that in the past and I think you will see it here.' He begins today by playing American number one John Isner, who he beat in an exhibition match just prior to the Australian Open. That is unlikely to happen again over five sets against the 6' 10' giant with a sometimes unplayable serve, but against Young he would have a fighting chance. This tie being close presupposes that Andy Murray can shake off his sometimes erratic post-Melbourne form and win both his singles matches. Courier was keen to emphasise that this is not a formality: 'Andy' s one of the toughest nuts in the business, he has great offensive and defensive skills,' said Courier. 'That's what's made him such a great player, but everyone is beatable. If Andy's not sharp, he can be vulnerable and he's had some matches this year where he hasn't been as crisp as we've seen him in Australia.' As ever it is the younger Murray who will bear the greatest burden, with GB trying to pull off its first home win at this elite level of the competition since 1986. So, what’s the story with the Davis Cup, then? Now heralded as the world’s largest annual team competition, with 122 nations taking part last year, this World Cup of men’s tennis actually looked more like the old Ryder Cup when it began in 1900 — when Harvard’s tennis team came up with the idea of pitting the best Americans against the finest players from the British Isles. One of those students, Dwight Davis, bought the original trophy — hence the name. How does it work now? How long have you got? There are divisions and groups, relegation play-offs and zones. Having expanded to six teams in 1905, the Davis Cup responded to the onset of the Open era by going global in 1969. If you’re in the elite top 16, where Britain are now, it becomes a whole lot more simple. Straight knock-out matches, with the winner of the final walking off with the trophy. And Britain are good, are they? Since reaching the final in 1978, GB have plummeted to some pretty low depths over the years. Now ranked 11th, think of us as the West Brom of tennis, yo-yoing up and down between the top division and the Europe/Africa Zone 1. How does the scoring work? There are five matches — or rubbers — played over the course of three days, with a team point available in each rubber. It starts with two singles matches on the Friday, there’s a doubles rubber on the Saturday, then the reverse singles on the Sunday. It can all be over by Saturday afternoon, if one team wins the first three rubbers. Team GB will lean heavily on Andy Murray, who may yet play in the doubles — as well as his two singles rubbers — despite not being named alongside brother Jamie in yesterday’s draw. What happens if we win this one? A victory for Britain would see them progress to the World Group quarter-finals, to be played between July 17-19. Yes, that’s right, the same weekend as the Open Championship. Lose and it’s a relegation play-off in September. How do we get tickets? Despite over 20,000 tickets selling in around 10 minutes when they were made available back in November, there are now extra places available.

"Wasps director of rugby Dai Young described Saracens as a unique team to play against after his side lost a crucial Premiership match at the Ricoh Arena. Brilliant tries from Christian Wade and Elliot Daly, with two conversions and a penalty from Andy Goode, had seen Wasps build up a 17-3 lead after the first 20 minutes. But after that the Saracens pack became the dominant force with Richard Wigglesworth and Alex Goode controlling matters at half-back. Their tries came from Chris Wyles and Mako Vunipola with Alex Goode converting both and adding four penalties. Wasps director or rugby Dai Young believes his side can still make the play-offs at the end of the season . Nathan Hughes surges forward with the ball for Wasps during the Aviva Premiership match with Saracens . Wasps had stormed into a 17-3 lead through tries from Elliot Daly (right)  and Christian Wade . 'We knew what was coming from (them) as they don't play a lot of rugby, (they) kick the ball a lot to squeeze you and it's very hard to play against. 'If you can control it, you get options to play as we showed in the first 20 minutes but after that we struggled to deal with the aerial bombardment as we dropped the ball far too often.' Despite the loss, which was a huge blow to Wasps' chances of making the play-offs, Young was adamant that his team were moving forward. 'Nothing changes as a result of today, we are still a work in progress and we are still aiming for a place in the top six. 'We will address what went wrong today for our set-piece didn't function as well as we would have liked and we lacked a bit of control in the second half.

Elliot Daly breaks clear to score a try during the Aviva Premiership match with Saracens . Saracens boss Mark McCall was complimentary to his side as they had stuck to their game plan after going 17-3 down. He said: 'We had the clarity of thought not to be spooked when they scored two tries in three minutes as we put the ball in the right areas to put pressure on them. 'You can see that they have people who can hurt you from long range as they've scored a lot of tries from inside their own half this season. 'We had chances to close it up late on, which we didn't take, but we did deprive them of a vital bonus point.' The only downside for the Saracens was the loss of Brad Barritt, who limped off in the second half following a heavy collision with Andy Goode. 'We are hopeful it isn't too serious and we have our fingers crossed because Brad must be very close to England selection next week,' added McCall. Chris Wyles slides over the line to score a try despite a last ditch challenge from Christian Wade .","Wasps suffered a 26-17 defeat at the hands of Saracens at the Ricoh Arena .

"England's plans for the Calcutta Cup showdown with Scotland have been undermined by yet another midfield injury – as Brad Barritt limped out of Saracens’ win at Wasps on Sunday. In the 58th minute of the Aviva Premiership encounter, the 28-year-old was contesting a high kick but landed awkwardly and his right leg bent backwards as home fly-half Andy Goode  landed on it. He was treated on the field before being helped off. Initial indications were that Barritt had suffered a medial ligament strain in his knee, but that early prognosis soon changed. Brad Barritt, hopeful of an England return against Scotland, limped out of Saracens’ win at Wasps on Sunday . Barritt's injury after Andy Goode landed on his leg initially seemed to be to his knee, but was to his ankle . After his side’s 26-17 comeback win, Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, said: ‘It seems to be his ankle. The knee seems to be okay. We’re all hopeful it won’t be too serious. 'It didn’t look very good and Brad has been unlucky this season. I’m sure he’ll be close to selection for England next weekend, so fingers crossed it’s not as bad as it looked.’ Barritt was due to join up with the rest of the England squad at their Surrey HQ on Sunday night and he will face urgent medical assessments on Monday, as the coaches wait to discover if he will be available for Saturday’s RBS Six Nations clash with the Scots at Twickenham. With Luther Burrell of Northampton unable to train last week due to a calf strain, Barritt was seemingly destined for a recall at inside centre, but now his hopes hang in the balance. Saracens’ director of rugby Mark McCall is hoping Barritt's injury isn't as bad as it looked . Barritt (obscured by Goode) was penalised for this challenge on Goode in the air that caused the injury . Barritt was due for a recall to the England side as Northampton's Luther Burrell struggles with a calf strain . The Saracen was an heroic mainstay of England’s autumn victory over Australia in his last Test appearance, but a calf injury in that game kept him out for a month, then he damaged knee ligaments in his clubs’ European Champions Cup tie against Clermont Auvergne in France. That untimely setback meant Barritt was unable to retain the national No 12 shirt, as he surely would have done if he had come through that pre-championship weekend unscathed. Stuart Lancaster, England’s head coach, will hope that if Barritt isn’t cleared for a return against Scotland, Burrell does recover in time. The alternative option would be to pick Billy Twelvetrees at inside centre, but the Gloucester captain’s form has been alarmingly inconsistent this season. If Barritt is fit to play, he is set to rejoin the back line along with Harlequins full-back Mike Brown – despite Alex Goode’s superb efforts at No 10 for Saracens yesterday.

"Laura Robson is set to begin her comeback after spending more than a year out through injury at the Miami Open later this month. The former British No 1 last played a match at the Australian Open in January 2014 before undergoing surgery on her left wrist. Robson had hoped to be fit for this year's first grand slam but did not make it and a subsequent plan to return at low-key events in the US, where she has been training, had to be shelved as well. Laura Robson is set to begin her comeback from a 14-month injury lay-off by playing in the Miami Open . The 21-year-old's name also no longer appears on the entry list for next week's WTA Tour event in Indian Wells but she has been given a wild card into qualifying in Miami in a fortnight's time. Wrist injuries are notoriously troublesome for tennis players and Robson's team's focus has always been on ensuring the Londoner is not rushed back before she is ready.

"Arsenal target Virgil van Dijk should be aiming to secure a move to a top six Premier League side if he leaves Celtic this summer, according to John Hartson. Van Dijk has been linked with a number of clubs in England's top flight this season with Sunderland and Everton both being priced out of a deal to sign the 23-year-old in the January transfer window. Last month Southampton also watched the Dutch centre back during Celtic's 3-3 draw with Inter Milan in the Europa League. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (left) could play for a top six Premier League side, according to John Hartson . Hartson also believes that the 23-year-old is currently as good as Arsenal centre back Laurent Koscielny (left) Arsenal also enquired about the defender prior to signing Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal. And Hartson, who played for both the Gunners and Celtic, believes Van Dijk is as good as current Arsenal first-team centre back Laurent Koscielny. 'I like big Virgil. I think he's the full package. He's quick, he can leap and defensively he is sound,' the former Wales international said. 'Celtic did fantastically to keep hold of him in the summer. It was a fantastic bit of business by [manager] Ronny Deila, who no doubt has had a word in his ear and told him: ""If you give me another year to 18 months, then you can have your move."" 'He will keep improving with Celtic and in time, he will become a top-class centre-half that a lot of clubs will be interested in. 'Is he top notch?

"Wasps lost the last remaining unbeaten home record in the Aviva Premiership as they suffered a 26-17 defeat at the hands of Saracens. Saracens have now beaten their opponents in 10 of their last 11 fixtures as Wasps threw away an early 17-3 lead. Brilliant tries from Christian Wade and Elliot Daly with two conversions and a penalty from Andy Goode had seen them build up that lead but after that first 20 minutes, the Saracens pack were too strong and ensured the visitors were deserved winners. Nathan Hughes  is tackled by Brad Barritt  during the Aviva Premiership match between Wasps and Saracens . Saracens scored two tries through Jackson Wray and Chris Wyles with Alex Goode converting both and adding four penalties. Lock Bradley Davies returned from Welsh squad duties to start for Wasps but prop Jake Cooper-Woolley was ruled out with concussion. Italian international, Lorenzo Cittadini was his replacement. Saracens were able to include England's Alex Goode, Mako Vunipola, Brad Barritt and Richard Wigglesworth in their starting line-up. Wing David Strettle was rested so there was a call-up for Wyles. Elliot Daly celebrates with teammates after scoring a try during the match  at The Ricoh Arena . A poor kick from Chris Ashton gave Wasps an early platform in the opposition 22 and when Saracens were penalised, Andy Goode made no mistake with his kick to put his side ahead. However that score was soon nullified when Alex Goode took his first kicking chance to tie up the scores. After 13 minutes Wasps were back in front with the first try of the game. Well-timed passes from Ashley Johnson and Daly gave Wade his chance and the wing powered away down the right flank to kick ahead deep into the opposition 22. Christian Wade Alex Goode to the ball to score the first try during the Aviva Premiership match . Saracens should have cleared the danger but the ball ran loose for Wade to pounce and score with Andy Goode converting with a superb touchline kick. Minutes later, Wasps extended their lead with an even better try. Inside his own half, Andy Goode fed Daly with seemingly nothing on but the Wasps centre mesmerised the visitors' defence by running 55 metres to score. Andy Goode converted and the hosts held a healthy 17-3 lead. Back came Saracens to mount a period of pressure and they were rewarded when Wray finished off a driving line-out for the try, which Alex Goode converted before adding a penalty. Daly  breaks clear to score a try during the Aviva Premiership match between Wasps and Saracens . After 28 minutes, Saracens went ahead for the first time after Wasps lost a line-out in their own half. Vunipola brushed past Johnson's tackle before a neat chip from Wigglesworth saw Wyles collect and hold off the attentions of Wade for the touchdown. Alex Goode converted but his namesake missed a penalty for Wasps with the last kick of the half so Saracens led 20-17 at the interval. Within a minute of the restart, Ashton was yellow carded for a high tackle on Rob Miller but the home side could not take advantage as the wing returned with the scoreboard unchanged apart from Alex Goode's third penalty. Chris Wyles  slides over to score his team's try despite the tackle from Christian Wade of Wasps . Saracens' pack became the dominant force with some skillful kicking from Wigglesworth keeping them on the front foot and they should have gained further reward but Alex Goode's penalty rebounded back off a post. Saracens suffered a blow when Barritt limped off to be replaced by Tim Streather but the visitors still led 23-17 at the end of the third quarter. When Saracens were penalised at a scrum, Andy Goode had a chance to reduce the arrears but surprisingly he was off target and the opposition made him pay. Clever play from Ben Ransom secured the visitors an attacking position and Wasps replacement Guy Thompson pulled down a driving line-out to go to the sin-bin and allow Alex Goode to boot his fourth penalty.","Wasps suffered a 26-17 defeat at the hands of Saracens at the Ricoh Arena .

"Brad Barritt's England return was scuppered after the Saracens centre had to be taken off with a serious-looking knee injury during a win over Wasps. Barritt, who was expected to replace Luther Burrell at 12 for England against Scotland next week, landed awkwardly after contesting a high ball with Wasps' Andy Goode.

Saracens held on, despite losing Barritt, to win 26-17, becoming the first team to win at the Ricoh Arena in the Premiership since Wasps moved there.

"In a sport increasingly dominated by statistical analysis and calm dissection of performances it was reassuring to hear Dan Cole discuss the depth of anger felt by England’s players on reviewing their Ireland no-show. Cole, one of the few England stars to depart Dublin with his reputation enhanced last Sunday, revealed the extent of the frustration within the England squad at their misfiring display when their Grand Slam dream was broken by a series of tactical and technical blunders. Stuart Lancaster’s men held a debrief on Tuesday at their five-star Pennyhill Park retreat in Surrey and the video analysis made for uncomfortable viewing. Dan Cole has revealed the frustration felt by England's squad as they relived the Ireland defeat . Chief among their concerns was the spectacular first-half line-out fail which saw England hooker Dylan Hartley throw straight to 6ft 10in Ireland lock Devin Toner at the back when a clean catch and drive would have almost certainly yielded points. England’s repeated disciplinary infringements also led to a 13 to eight penalty deficit and Cole admits watching the match again was deeply frustrating. ‘There is room for emotion because you are frustrated with the game and there were a few things we’ve gone over,’ he said. ‘We didn’t plan to do a lot of the stuff that we did. Trust me we didn’t train what we did at the weekend. We didn’t do that on the training field. ‘There is that frustration and it comes out in anger or whatever from coaches and players because they are frustrated in that regard. It is not just a cool, calm dissection – sometimes it is but if a point needs to be raised it is talked about. England failed to take their chances and made some basic errors, before being punished by the Irish . ‘It was interesting, it was good, it was honest. I think there were some areas – a lot of areas obviously – where we didn’t perform like we should have done.’ Ireland outmanoeuvred England by denying them scrummaging opportunities and by failing to implement the expected ‘choke tackle’, therefore denying the visitors the chance to play to their strengths. Their British Lion half-back pair of Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray controlled field position with some outstanding tactical kicking. When England did have a chance to gain a foothold in the game, Hartley’s wayward throw to Toner cost them dear after George Ford opted to kick a kickable penalty to the corner. Cole was one of the few Englishmen to come out of the defeat in Dublin with any credit . ‘That line-out was a frustration. In international rugby if you get a set piece in the opposition 22 and especially 5m out you have to take it,’ Cole added. ‘You don’t really get another chance like that against sides like Ireland, and we didn’t really get one. I’m not saying that the game changed on that but it was an emotional swing. 'They steal the ball and the crowd lifts up. You score there and it is a different mentality. It wasn’t the reason we lost the game but next time we’ll probably throw away from the 6ft 10 bloke with long arms!’ The England prop will hope his side can bounce back against Scotland at Twickenham next week . While South African referee Craig Joubert took exception to much of England’s work at the break down, Lancaster and his team hope Frenchman Romain Poite will be more forgiving at Twickenham against unfancied Scotland next Saturday. Cole added: ‘Referees have their strengths and weaknesses, just like players do. Set-piece, open play, some refs will let you play stuff, others won’t. There is a variance but it is a case of being as clean as you can. If you are positive in your actions, you will be on the right side of the referee.’","England lost to Ireland 19-9 last week in Dublin .

"Daniel Vettori became the 12th player to take 300 one-day international wickets as New Zealand eased to a six-wicket victory against Afghanistan. The 36-year-old, who took an impressive 4-18, is the first New Zealander to pass the landmark and now sits in the esteemed company of greats such as Muttiah Muralitharan, Wasim Akram and Glenn McGrath. Afghanistan required a seventh-wicket partnership of 86 between Najibullah Zadran and Samiullah Shenwari to post a respectable 186 all out, having chosen to bat, but a 19-ball 42 from Brendon McCullum ensured there would be no shock in Napier. Daniel Vettori became the 12th player to take 300 one-day international wickets . Vettori of New Zealand celebrates taking the wicket of Afsar Zazai of  Afghanistan at the Cricket World Cup . Vettori  celebrates with Brendon McCullum after taking the wicket of Zazai  during the Cricket World Cup match . Perhaps a mark of the man and an added insight into the where the focus of the team remains, Vettori said the landmark was something he would think about after the World Cup. 'Right now we are caught up in the middle of a World Cup,' he said. 'We have an important game on Friday (group game against Bangladesh), and then probably the most important of our careers the following Saturday (quarter-final). 'Maybe in a month, it will be the time to look back on it. I didn't go into the World Cup thinking about that milestone, I didn't believe I would take this many wickets in this few games.' Understandably stung from being smashed for a record-breaking 417 runs by Australia in Perth days earlier, Mohammad Nabi chose to bat after calling correctly at the toss. Afghanistan were made to pay for a choice that signaled a slight naivety within the camp, with their own coaching staff having previously admitted that bowling was the side's strong suit. The newcomers to the World Cup stage collapsed to 34-3 and then 59-6, as Vettori caused most of the damage after Trent Boult had Javed Ahmadi trapped lbw for just one. McCullum has developed into an imposing captain, known for his ingenuity and outrageously attacking fields – so his decision to bowl his spinner in just the third over was met with mild surprise. The decision was less genius and more to allow New Zealand's opening bowlers, Tim Southee and Boult, to switch ends. The 36-year-old is the first New Zealander to pass the landmark of 300 ODI wickets . New Zealand eased to a six-wicket win over Afghanistan at the Cricket World Cup on Sunday . He now sits in the company of greats such as Muttiah Muralitharan, Wasim Akram and Glenn McGrath . Vettori of New Zealand speaks at a post-match press conference following their Cricket World Cup win . Still, Vettori showed that he's as accurate in the third over as in the 15th as he struck with his first ball. Usman Ghani lost sight of the ball and saw his off stump disturbed. With his opening strike bowlers having switched ends, McCullum resumed the pace attack, and Asghar Stanikzai could only send a short ball from Boult into the geelful clutches of Martin Guptil. Southee, struggling with his line and length, was replaced by Vettori, who took No.300 by bowling Nawroz Mangal for 27 with the first ball of his third over. The Auckland-born spinner was on a roll and had Nabi (6) and Afsar Zazai dismissed off consecutive balls. Nabi was caught at slip, while Zazai was trapped leg before. That brought Najibullah to the crease for the hat-trick ball, and the batsman was welcomed by the sight of nine men around his bat, with no fielder outside the circle. However, he survived and showed maturity beyond his years in his partnership with Shenwari before departing after a run-a-ball 56 that ended when he top-edged a short and wide bouncer from Adam Milne to Vettori at third man. New Zealand's Ross Taylor gets a handshake from Afghanistan's Hamid Hassan (left) after the match . New Zealand are very much on course to end their World Cup victory drought . Shenwari, undoubtedly Afghanistan's best batsman in this tournament, was the anchor of his side's innings, and he made 54 off 110 balls before falling to Corey Anderson. An entertaining cameo from Hamid Hassan (16 off 21) took Afghanistan to 186, but for the fifth consecutive World Cup match New Zealand bowled out their opposition. The number of orange target T-shirts seemed to double after the resumption of play with the crowd undoubtedly expecting McCullum to send a few balls into the stand and help them earn a share of the pot of money for the 'one-handed crowd catch' promotion. But McCullum cleared the rope just once in his innings before being bowled by Nabi with one that kept a touch low. His departure unsurprisingly slowed the run chase, and when Kane Williamson picked out midwicket off Shapoor Zardan for 33, the Afghans believed they had a chance. Two comical run-outs saw Martin Guptill (57) and Grant Elliott (19) further add to the nerves of the McLean Park crowd, but Ross Taylor, the birthday boy, held his nerve to steer New Zealand home. The same side, the same outcome, the same feeling after the match – New Zealand are very much on course to end their World Cup victory drought.","Daniel Vettori became just the 12th player to take 300 ODI wickets .

"Jonny Brownlee had to settle for fifth place in the opening World Triathlon Series race of the season in Abu Dhabi. The Olympic bronze medallist paid the price for slipping towards the back of a large leading pack at the end of the bike leg and was unable to close the gap to leading trio Mario Mola, Vincent Luis and Richard Murray on the run. Brownlee then lost out in a sprint finish to Joao Silva of Portugal but did at least have the consolation of beating great rival Javier Gomez, who could only manage sixth. Jonny Brownlee came a disappointing fifth after a poor bike leg in the World Triathlon Series in Abu Dhabi . Gomez's Spanish compatriot Mola was the class of the field over the sprint distance and pulled away during the second half of the five kilometres run to clinch a comfortable victory. Jonny's brother Alistair missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but, with Olympic qualification to be decided in August and September at the test event in Rio and the world series Grand Final in Chicago, none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon. Jonny, 24, said: 'I wanted better than that. I messed up everything I possibly could. That's what the first race is about. 'I thought my running was going well, but obviously not so well off the bike. I got into it later on but it was too late then. I just need to iron out the mistakes and sharpen up a little.' Brownlee celebrates after winning the silver medal in the men's Triathlon Final at Strathclyde Country Park . The women's race was once again dominated by world champion Gwen Jorgensen of the United States, with a disappointed Jodie Stimpson the leading British athlete in 17th. Stimpson, who won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last year, missed the front bike pack and was unable to make up any ground on the run, with a niggling Achilles problem not helping. Britain's former world champions Non Stanford and Helen Jenkins along with Commonwealth bronze medallist Vicky Holland all chose to stay at home and continue their training.

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has again criticised referee Mike Dean for his handling of Saturday's London derby defeat by Crystal Palace. The Hammers, currently in ninth place in the Premier League, were beaten 3-1 by the Eagles at the weekend in a contentious contest. Allardyce felt that Palace striker Glenn Murray, scorer of two goals at Upton Park, before being sent off in the 69th minute, should have been dismissed by Dean in the first half for persistent fouling. Glenn Murray was sent off for Crystal Palace during the 3-1 win against West Ham on Saturday . Sam Allardyce was frustrated that Murray was not sent off earlier in the game . Allardyce said: 'The biggest problem for me was that Glenn Murray shouldn't have been on the field, not only because of persistent fouling but the level of his fouling. 'Mike Dean, whom I have a lot of respect for, is a very good referee, but he was too lenient with Murray by telling him 'that's your last chance' after the first booking. 'In that particular instance, Palace have been let off. Mike Dean has a massive responsibility on the fact that (Murray) was one of the main reasons why Crystal Palace won. 'And for me that is something disappointing. The fact a referee warns a player for a tackle he has just made, which normally gets a yellow card, and yet he is only warned because he has just had a yellow card. And that is frustrating.' Murray climbed highest to open the scoring for the visitors in the first half with a header . Murray got his second and Palace's third when he glanced a header past Adrian . Palace captain Mile Jedinak was caught on Sky Sports TV cameras apparently elbowing Diafra Sakho as they both challenged for the ball in the closing stages. Though the incident was not seen at the time by the match officials, the Football Association have since charged the player with violent conduct – and Palace have until Tuesday evening to appeal against that decision. Allardyce has welcomed any retrospective punishment, saying that the Australian midfielder deserves a ban for acting in a dangerous manner against the Senegal striker. He added: 'Jedinak was clearly in a position where Mike Dean couldn't see it. I think about how dangerous it was. It was a very dangerous thing he did. He could have seriously injured Sakho. And he will have to take the punishment – because I think he deserves it.' Mile Jedinak has been charged by the FA with violent conduct after catching Diafra Sakho with his elbow . The incident went unpunished during the game but Jedinak was retrospectively charged . Elsewhere, in his pre-match press conference, ahead of the visit of Chelsea to East London tomorrow night, Allardyce spoke about the chats he enjoyed with Dave Mackay, the former Tottenham, Derby, Hearts and Scotland enforcer, who died aged 80. Allardyce said: 'I knew Dave. He lived in around Nottingham, when I was at Notts County for three years (1997-1999). I spent many a good night with him talking away about his time in football, about management. 'It's a sad day. He was a terrific guy not just a terrific a footballer. In life, you take a lot of things from a lot of people. 'If you want to get better, you don't just read a book or do a Masters' degree at university; you learn a lot from listening to the experiences of people who have been great in their own careers.'","West Ham were beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace at Upton Park on Saturday .

"Bafetimbi Gomis' collapse had those inside White Hart Lane holding their collective breath, with players, officials and fans fearing the worst after the Swansea striker's episode. As play was about to resume following a fine, early Nacer Chadli volley, hush fell upon the ground where three years ago Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest. There was a deathly silence as paramedics and medical staff tended to Gomis, who left the White Hart Lane pitch on a stretcher and wearing an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness . Concerned Tottenham players look on as the Swansea forward is attended to my medical staff . Fortunately, good news soon emanated from the Swansea dressing room and, later in the evening, Gomis himself said he was 'feeling well' after fainting. It was the latest episode stemming from a long-standing fainting condition and one which left Brad Friedel, on the bench three years ago and watching from the stands on Wednesday, worried a similar incident to Muamba's was unfolding. 'It went through everyone's mind,' the veteran American said. 'Anyone who was at that game probably thought the worst immediately. 'It's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it's going to be something serious. 'But after a minute or so the word got back, so that's why you didn't see the panic on the players' faces because everyone knew he was all right. 'It was something that had to be dealt with, of course, but it was nothing in the stratosphere of what went on with Fabrice.' Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane . Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentalib (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher . Friedel's comments were echoed by Spurs winger Andros Townsend. 'It kind of brought your memory back to Fabrice Muamba,' he said. 'It didn't look good. 'When (Muamba collapsed) I wasn't here. I was on loan at Birmingham but seeing what happened with Gomis could have meant going down the same route. 'Thankfully he's okay, hopefully he can make a speedy recovery.' As worrying as the incident was, play continued and soon after Ki Sung-yueng drew parity for Swansea. Players from both sides appear shocked as referee Michael Oliver prepares to restart the game . On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham. The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch. Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned. Medical staff rush to Fabrice Muamba's aid after the midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in 2012 . Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance. Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football. Ryan Mason and Townsend netted in the second half to give Spurs a lead Gylfi Sigurdsson chipped away at late on, yet Mauricio Pochettino's side ran out 3-2 victors. It was an important result following their Europa League and Capital One Cup disappointments, especially as defeat on Wednesday would have seriously dented their top-four ambitions. 'It was the perfect response,' Townsend said in a week they have lost big games against Fiorentina and Chelsea. 'To lose a cup final and have to play a very good side three days later is always difficult, but we knew we had to go out there tonight and start fast right from the off. 'We knew we had to get the crowd on our side and lift the doom and gloom from the weekend, and I think we did that. 'We got the early goal and it set us on our way to a great win.' Ryan Mason wheels away in celebration after scoring against Swansea on Wednesday evening . The result denied Swansea a third straight Premier League win, although midfielder Jack Cork does not think the performance or result was impacted by the Gomis incident. 'I was obviously worried,' he told Press Association Sport. 'When something like that happens, you're obviously worried, but the medical staff say he is fine so hopefully it's not too bad. 'The guys said 'don't worry about it, just keep your minds on the game, he is okay' blah, blah, blah. 'Ash (Williams) was just reassuring us saying don't worry about it and we had to carry on like it hadn't happened. 'In the first half we did okay, we played some okay stuff but the second half was tough for us. 'They overloaded certain areas and made space on the wings for the full-backs. 'It was tough for us but we had to try and keep a good shape and a couple of mistakes cost us the game.'","Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed during first half of Swansea's match at Spurs .

"Ireland clung on to claim a controversial five-run win over Zimbabwe to keep their bid to reach the World Cup quarter-finals on track. Ed Joyce's third one-day international century helped Ireland post 331 for eight - their highest ever score at a World Cup - but Zimbabwe looked like running down the record chase until a debatable John Mooney catch. Replays appeared to show Mooney had stepped on the rope when he held on to remove Sean Williams, who was four short of a century and seemingly in control of the pursuit. Alex Cusack (centre) of Ireland is congratulated by team mates after getting the wicket of Tawanda Mupariwa . Kevin O'Brien celebrates after Sean Williams is controversially caught out by John Mooney . Ireland celebrate after winning their pulsating World Cup clash against Zimbabwe and knocking them out . The third umpire was called to judge the catch, although Williams did not remain on the field of play after he instead opted to take the word of Mooney that he had taken the catch inside the rope. There was still drama to follow as number 10 Tawanda Mupariwa slapped 19 from the penultimate over, delivered by Kevin O'Brien, to leave Zimbabwe needing seven from the last six balls. But Alex Cusack held his nerve as he claimed the final two wickets, first getting Regis Chakabva to drag on before Mupariwa skied a catch William Porterfield gratefully accepted. While Joyce's 112 earned him the man-of-the-match award Cusack's four for 32 was just as invaluable, especially after he removed Zimbabwe skipper Brendon Taylor for 121. Ed Joyce celebrates making his third one-day international century and helping Ireland to 331-8 . Joyce scores many of his impressive runs as Ireland boosted their chances of World Cup qualification . Victory was Ireland's second over a full-member nation at the tournament after they opened their campaign with a win over West Indies. They will, however, most likely need to pull off one more shock in their final two pool games against India and Pakistan. Pakistan's surprise win over South Africa earlier in the day did Ireland few favours and their clash in Adelaide on March 15 looms as a potential decider. John Mooney celebrates getting the wicket of Sikandar Raza and helping them on their way to victory . Ireland stand for the national anthem during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe . Joyce became the fourth Ireland player to score a World Cup century although he was given a helping hand by a sloppy Zimbabwe fielding display. The Sussex batsman was twice dropped, while he edged his first ball just short of slip, but was otherwise imperious as he hit nine fours and three sixes. He joined in a third-wicket partnership of 138 with Andy Balbirnie, who was only three runs away from following Joyce to three figures after he was run out during the late-over scramble. Ireland took 108 from the final 10 overs to reach their highest ODI score, surpassing the 329 for seven they racked up during their famous World Cup win over England in Bangalore four years ago. Kevin O'Brien celebrates after taking the controversial wicket of  Zimbabwe batsman Sean Williams . Williams reacts after getting out at the Bellerive Oval ground despite it looking like Mooney touched the foam . When Zimbabwe then crashed to 74 for four in reply Ireland were in total control only for Taylor and Williams to turn the momentum of the match in a 149-run stand.

"Bafetimbi Gomis' collapse had those inside White Hart Lane fearing the worst, but thankfully the Swansea striker is fine - in fact, manager Garry Monk revealed he wanted to carry on playing against Tottenham. Hush fell on the ground where Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest three years ago after the 29-year-old went down as play was about to restart following Nacer Chadli's wonderful, early opener. Paramedics and medical staff raced to tend to Gomis, who left the field on a stretcher and an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness . The French striker later tweeted in French and then English, saying: 'I wanted to reassure you concerning my health , it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now . 'I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to France . 'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight but now everything is back In order . 'I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages .' Earlier in the evening, news emanated from the Swansea dressing room that it was nothing serious, with the 3-2 loss at Spurs one of several times he has fainted over his career. 'He is fine,' Swans boss Monk said. 'Coming off the pitch he was fine, talking and he actually wanted to stay on the pitch. 'It's something that we're well aware of and it's part of his history, but obviously he's had all the checks. 'We knew about this when he came to the club. He's had all the medical checks that you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. It's to do with low blood pressure. 'I didn't actually see the situation. Our physios went onto the pitch and they relayed the message but he was fine. 'Coming off the pitch, he was talking. He actually wanted to stay on the pitch but obviously precautionary wise, we have to make sure that we double check everything but we're well aware of the history.' Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane . Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentalib (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher . Garry Monk revealed that Gomis wanted to carry on playing after collapsing . Monk is not sure whether Gomis, a summer acquisition from Lyon, lost consciousness or not in the incident which stems from a long-standing vasovagal condition. 'We're all well aware of it,' he said. 'He's had every single medical check that you can possibly have, and he's fine. It's just part of his life.' Despite that knowledge, the overriding feeling was still one of relief after the incident proved far less serious than first feared. Gomis has now gone to hospital as a precautionary measure, but Monk foresees 'no problem whatsoever' with him playing their next match against Liverpool on March 16. 'We'll clarify now with the club doctor and see what we do from here, see whether we pick him up or he gets his own car back,' the Swans boss added. Monk does not think the Gomis incident affected his players in the defeat at White Hart Lane - something backed-up by the fact Ki Sung-Yueng drew parity shortly afterwards.

Nacer Chadli (left) beats Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to score the opening goal . Spurs went back ahead through second-half strikes from Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend, before Gylfi Sigurdsson's late effort led to a nervy ending in what Mauricio Pochettino thinks was a deserved win. 'I'm happy for the players because they deserve this victory,' the Tottenham head coach said, 'It was a very important three points for us, I'm happy for the performance, it was fantastic. 'It was 3-2 but we shoot many times and had more than 60 per cent possession - only in the last minute did we put risk in the game. 'We were lucky to have a big save from Hugo (Lloris in stoppage-time) - one of the best 'keepers in world.' Pochettino also took time in the post-match press conference to wish Gomis a 'speedy recovery'. 'A lot of years ago I had the same problem with team mate Oscar Garcia, who was manager of Watford and Brighton,' he said. 'It's a difficult moment because it's your life. Football is not important when something happens like that. 'I was a player on the pitch and it was Oscar Garcia was my team-mate - he fell and then it was the same situation, but he was okay.'

"After another meek surrender, the widespread belief that Everton are far too good to go down may have to be re-examined. Once again, Roberto Martinez's team were dramatically less than the collection of their parts and the amiable Spaniard seems unable to identify what is rotten in the core of his team. Goals in each half from Victor Moses – a long-range header no less – and Mame Biram Diouf deservedly gave Stoke City the points as Mark Hughes' side rose to eighth in the table, a remarkable 14 points ahead of their beleaguered visitors. Stoke winger Victor Moses (centre) rises up to head home his side's opening goal en route to a 2-0 victory against Everton .

Stoke substitute Mame Biram Diouf sealed the win with late goal after reacting to Marko Arnautovic's rebound . Everton manager Roberto Martinez looks concerned with his side collecting only one win from their last 12 games . The statistics for Everton are damning. Just one win in 12 league games, just one league clean sheet away from Goodison Park since September. Ross Barkley, their bright young hope, was kept on the bench while those who played laboured. Poor Aaron Lennon was barracked mercilessly by the Stoke fans after he snubbed them in January to join Everton and was substituted after 60 forgettable minutes. Gareth Barry picked up his 10th booking of the season, and a record 106th of his career, and will miss the next two games against Newcastle and QPR. The speed the 34-year-old moved about the Britannia, that might be a blessing for everyone. What is perplexing is the individual quality on show for Everton. Established internationals like Tim Howard, Phil Jagielka, Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy, Romelu Lukaku and others are the reason they are the sole English survivors in the Europa League. Stoke City (4-2-3-1): Begovic 6.5; Bardsley 6.5, Wollscheid 5.5 (Cameron 17 6), Wilson 6.5, Pieters 6; Nzonzi 6, Whelan 6.5; Walters 6, Adam 6.5 (Arnautovic), Moses 7; Crouch 6 (Diouf) Subs: Butland (Gk), Sidwell, Teixeira, Shenton .

But standing just six points above the bottom three, an almost-inconceivable double – qualification for the Champions League and relegation to the Championship – is still possible. 'It is a tough and demanding period. But there is no such thing as fear, we showed last year we have a really talented squad. We have 30 points to fight for and we are going to give our lives to get as many as we can,' said Martinez. 'We are all disappointed, the fans, the players, everyone but we are going to recover for the next challenge which we are desperate to face. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong, that is what happens when you have negative momentum. But we are not looking down, we want to get as many points as we can.'

Everton fans seemed divided at the end, some booed and some encouraged their fallen idols. They will all be glad to see Leighton Baines back from injury in time to face Newcastle in their next league game on March 15. Without him, Everton's defence looked flimsy. After 32 minutes, Phil Bardsley's cross was met with a tremendous leap by Moses, who headed over Howard from 12 yards. Why Everton's centre-halves Jagielka and John Stones backed off to give Moses a free header was unclear and they immediately held a post-goal inquest. 'We restricted them to very few opportunites afterwards,' said Stoke boss Mark Hughes. Of those that did come, Lennon shot straight at Asmir Begovic and Romelu Lukaku dragged a shot wide, a feeble finish denoting a lack of confidence. Substitute Arouna Kone had the best shot which was well parried by Begovic. If anything, Stoke looked likelier to add a second once Diouf had replaced Peter Crouch, and so it proved. A quick Stoke counter-attack saw the ball cannon off Stones in Diouf's path. He led the charge with Marko Arnautovic and when the Austrian struck the post, Diouf followed up to prod in the rebound.

Moses wheels away to celebrate his strike with Stoke team-mate Crouch as the Britannia Stadium erupts . Stoke's 2-0 victory means Everton have already conceded 41 Premier Leageu goals in 28 games. They let in just 39 in the whole of last season. 'We deserved it, Victor Moses was excellent, he showed strength to the end,' said a delighted Hughes. Stoke were everything Everton weren't, fully commmited to a gameplan. They even recovered from the loss of centre-half Philipp Wollscheid who limped off early, but it was Martinez who complained about the bad luck. 'Six of our 10 games left are at Goodison Park and that is a powerful tool for us,' he said in what was effectively a rallying cry for everyone at the club. Everton finished fifth last season and were predicted to make a tip at the Champions League. Instead they are relying on clubs like Burnley and QPR being worse than they are. 'This is a really talented squad but we are in a period where things are going wrong. The first time we allowed Stoke a cross into our box, they score from it from an unlikely source. We feel there was a foul on Phil Jagielka in the build-up for the second goal at a time when we were making chances.' Martinez talks a good game. Now his team have to play one.

"As Dave King joined hands with his allies to give a triumphant salute on the steps of Argyle House, a great roar emerged from those Rangers fans who had patiently waited to greet the new regime. The noise was more than three years in the making. After so many bitter disappointments, and so much anger directed at so many characters in this sorry saga, here was genuine belief that they finally had their club back. King, Paul Murray and John Gilligan were all elected as directors with around 85 per cent of the vote at Friday's general meeting. The same overwhelming number turfed Derek Llambias and Barry Leach, Mike Ashley’s two associates, out of the Blue Room. A despised board was routed. Dave King (centre) received almost 86 per cent of the votes from Rangers shareholders for power at Ibrox . The incoming directors have a resounding mandate for change but a mammoth task lies ahead. Rangers, in many ways, is unrecognisable to what it once was. As both King and Murray have said, their job is to fix a club that is broken. To find the glue that sticks the pieces back together again, the South Africa-based businessman believes they have to look back in time. Not just in terms restoring financial strength and success on the field, but also in the image and values the club projects. ‘As a day in Rangers’ history, it’s got the potential to be a watershed event,’ insisted King. ‘If you were to ask me sitting here today then I’m confident it will turn out to be that. ‘People ask when will we take the club forward – in actual fact we are taking the club forward to the past. ‘We want to restore the qualities of this club and that is part of the challenge we face here, in trying to build a competitive football team and living up to what the fans expect. Rangers supporters show their pleasure at the news that King at the decision of the shareholders vote . ‘There is a value system attached to Rangers Football Club and this has been lost over the past few years. ‘Rangers has been a club with traditional values. It’s had generational support and a pass-on from father to son. There’s been a consistency, an integrity and a loyalty. ‘Paul has referred to the fact the club has only had 13 managers in its history and that tells you there is a stickability about this club. ‘What we have seen over the last few years has been turbulence, change, lack of loyalty, lack of integrity. What has happened is the exact opposite to the values I associate with my club.’ King, Murray and Gilligan addressed staff inside Ibrox prior to holding a media conference, then travelled to Murray Park to speak with those on the footballing side of the business. In recent times, Rangers has been a place where employees have lived in fear of redundancy. Whole departments have pretty much disappeared. Morale has lurked somewhere south of dismal. A Rangers fan  holds up a sign in protest against Mike Ashley, Derek Llambias and Barry Leach . ‘They very first priority is to get our arms around the club,’ said King. ‘You have the unusual situation of one board en masse going out and another coming in. Normally, there is a process of transition. ‘Much of what we know about the state of the club has been gleaned from newspaper reports. The club is broken, it’s broken in many areas. ‘There are footballing issues, infrastructure issues and scouting issues. Information gathering will be a big part of our immediate job.’ A new manager will also be considered but King stressed that the importance of getting the right man means it will not be rushed. It could well be that Kenny McDowall, the reluctant caretaker, still has a few games in charge beyond today’ s trip to Cowdenbeath. Rangers will have to come through the play-offs to reach the Premiership next season, but King is adamant failure to win promotion would not derail plans to radically strengthen the squad. ‘Promotion is going to be challenging and there is a possibility it won’t happen this year,’ he admitted. ‘We hope that with a full resumption of attendance and energy from the fans that it might give the team a pick-up for the rest of the season. We chatted to the fans outside and we are really optimistic we will see full houses for the rest of the season to help the team kick on. ‘I hope they can still get across the line, but with improved cashflow we will get up the following season. I would expect a huge improvement in terms of quality on the field next season, whatever league we are playing in. 800 Rangers shareholders turned up to show their support to King at Ibrox Stadium on Friday . ‘In terms of the manager, I have said before that we need more of a coach. We need someone with a different set of skills who is going to build, develop and bring youngsters through. We have to be very careful.’ King has already stated around £20million will be required in the short to medium term to get Rangers back on their feet. He intends to provide half of what is needed. The remainder will come from other wealthy fans, including Douglas Park – one of the Three Bears consortium - who was added to the board in the wake of Friday's result. Asked how much of the total sum would be used on the playing squad, King replied: ‘I have included other development issues such as a whole scouting network and maintenance of buildings. If you are asking for a rough figure, I would have to say it has to be more than 50 per cent.’ Just 15 per cent of the club's shareholders voted to keep Llambias (pictured) and Leach . In terms of the boardroom make-up, King insisted the fan groups deserved to be rewarded for their role in the revolution with representation. Llambias and Leach have gone but are still nominally chief executive and finance director. Asked if they would be sacked, King responded: ‘I wouldn’t think so.’ Have they a future? ‘I wouldn’t think so.’ Take from that what you will. Ashley still has the right to appoint two directors via the terms of the £10m loan facility the old board agreed with Sports Direct in January, although King stated the funds are in place to repay that debt if preferable. Llambias and Leach began the process of trying to draw down the second £5m tranche earlier this week. ‘If it is drawn down, I don’t think it would be a bad thing,’ said King. ‘It would nice to go in and find this £5m in the bank. I don’t think it is likely to happen now. For it to happen, it would have to happen through engaging with the board.’ Sandy Easdale abstained from using his voting block – now reduced to around 20 per cent – at the general meeting. Yet that stance is unlikely to lead to an unexpected truce. ‘My personal view is that would be challenging,’ said King when quizzed on whether he would work with current chairman of the football board. King (centre) will be joined by John Gilligan (left) and Paul Murray in running of the Scottish club . King has postponed his own instalment as PLC chairman until he has satisfied the financial authorities and the SFA that he is a ‘fit and proper’ person. The Castlemilk-born businessman remains adamant his 41 tax convictions in South Africa should not be a barrier to a return to the Ibrox boardroom. He will ‘formally engage’ with a new nominated advisor (NOMAD) - to replace WH Ireland – on Monday. ‘Either I am fit and proper or I am not,’ said King. ‘I wouldn’t have started this process if I didn’t think I was fit and proper. ‘I’ve had no discussions with NOMADs or other regulators that suggests there are concerns. ‘The only concerns that were aired came from the other side, who felt the need to flag this. ‘It was a mechanism to deflect away from their own failings. They had very little real arguments as to why there shouldn’t be a regime change. ‘If I was a concern then the NOMAD would not have engaged. The fact they are working with us tells you all you need to know. Me sitting on the board is not critical, but I don’t think it will be an issue.’ King will now start the process of rebuilding Rangers which has been beset in turmoil for the past four years .","Around 85 per cent of shareholders backed Dave King’s push for change .

"Rangers Supporters Trust spokesman Chris Graham praised fans for the part they have played in forcing change at Ibrox before warning them: 'The hard work starts now.' The RST and Rangers First, another group aimed at fan ownership, had amassed almost 19,000 registered members between them going into Friday's EGM. A combination of shares purchased by each organisation, using cash raised from that backing and from proxies, saw them hold around 10 per cent of the voting power at the meeting.

Fans show their delight for the incoming Rangers board of King, John Gilligan (left) and Paul Murray (right) Graham is delighted the club's followers have performed such a significant role in getting Dave King, Paul Murray and John Gilligan on to the board and overthrowing previous incumbents Derek Llambias and Barry Leach but insisted there is still much more to do. Now he has urged supporters to keep investing in the two fan movements to ensure there is never a repeat of the financial turmoil experienced at Rangers in recent years. 'The response to both schemes has been amazing and it has been crucial, not just in winning the EGM but also in moving forward,' he said. 'It is important the fans want to have more of a shareholding in the club. I believe we can trust this board and I think they will run the club properly. 'We don't know what is going to happen in 10 years' time, though, so it's vital the fans have a big enough say to stop anything like we've seen in the last three or four years from happening again. Now they have that. And if there is a new share issue I think it's important they continue to up their shareholding to a more significant portion. 'It has been brilliant seeing how people have risen to the challenge. The Trust has been plugging away at this for 12 years while Rangers First is a more recent thing. But, to be honest, it's just great to see the fans getting behind the same objective, however they have chosen to do that. 'What the supporters have done has been crucial in winning the vote and it will be crucial going forward. Now it's really important we get working as soon as possible. There will obviously be a couple of days of celebration but there's going to be a huge rebuilding process at the club. 'It has been ripped apart over the last few years so the priority is to get the hard work started straight away. Some things can be done quickly and others will take a bit longer . 'I can understand where Kenny McDowall was coming from when he said it is going to take five years to fix the club. I think he was talking there about the football infrastructure and things such as scouting and youth development take a long time to come through if you start doing them properly. A Rangers fan  holds up a sign in protest against Mike Ashley, Derek Llambias and Barry Leach . Just 15 per cent of the club's shareholders voted to keep Llambias (pictured, centre) and Leach at Ibrox . 'But Dave King was right, too, in the sense that there are things you can do in the short-term which would immediately improve the situation. Even just getting the fans back in the stadium is an improvement because there's increased revenue from that alone. On the football side, appointing a new manager will be an improvement and we'll possibly be able to bring in players in the summer who can improve the squad. 'What matters most is there are guys in the boardroom now who actually care about the club. They aren't just there to feather their own nests and that's the difference.' Although Llambias and Leach are no longer on the board, they do remain employed by the club as chief executive and financial director respectively. Severance deals must be struck and, although both men have dug their heels in this week, Graham thinks it's only a matter of time until they are driven out of the club. 'Leach and Llambias can make it a little bit difficult in terms of getting them to leave and I'm sure they will make it as hard as they can,' he said. 'They are obviously in this for themselves so they will try to get what they can out of the situation. 'The Sports Direct contract is obviously something which still needs to be looked at and there are big question marks over how a lot of contracts came to be latterly. That will need to be examined pretty closely but I don't think there is anything that's insurmountable as long as the people in the boardroom want to get it fixed. That's the big difference. There's nothing the club can't do as long as everybody is pulling in the one direction.' Tackling the influence of Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley (pictured) will be next on the Rangers fans' agenda .","Fan ownership groups amassed nearly 19,000 members before Friday's EGM .

"Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has shown an interest in signing Paris Saint-Germain star Edinson Cavani, according to French newspaper L'Equipe. The 28-year-old, who joined the Ligue 1 side for a record-breaking £55million back in July 2013, is a summer transfer target for Simeone as he looks to bolster the La Liga side's ranks. The Argentine recently spoke with the Uruguay forward, after being put in touch with Cavani through his international team-mate and Atletico defender Diego Godin. Edinson Cavani (right) - pictured on the front of L'Equipe - is reportedly a transfer target for Atletico Madrid . Tuttosport are reporting that Juventus are considering offering Carlos Tevez a contract extension . Cavani, nicknamed 'El Metador', has often been criticised for his level of performance since joining the French giants - scoring 15 goals in all competitions so far this season - with his contract set to run out in the summer of 2018. He would command a high transfer fee though, with it unknown whether the current La Liga champions would splash the cash to land the sought-after striker. Manchester United have also been linked with a £60m move for Cavani, with Radamel Falcao flattering to deceive since joining on a season-long loan from Monaco. Elsewhere, in Italian newspaper Tuttosport they headline with Juventus considering offering in-form striker Carlos Tevez a new contract, amid interest from former side Boca Juniors. The 31-year-old started off his career with the Argentina outfit, and could be tempted for a move back to his homeland, after an impressive spell in Italy with Juventus. Marca headlines with coverage of the Copa del Rey, while Corriere dello Sport focuses on Juventus . In January he was quoted as saying he would honour the end of his contract at the Italian giants - which runs out in June 2016 - but was currently not interested in extending it. So far this season Tevez has notched 21 goals in 31 appearances, as Juve sit pretty nine points clear at the top of the table - as they close in on a third successive Serie A crown. In Corriere dello Sport they also focus primarily on Juventus, as Massimiliano Allegri's side look towards the Champions League and their last-16 second-leg tie against Atletico Madrid. Cavani, Marco Verratti and Daniele Rugani have all been mooted as potential signings as Allegri's side look to increase the size and quality of their squad in the summer. Finally, in Spanish newspaper Marca the focus is firmly on the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey. Barcelona take a two-goal lead into the second leg of their clash against Villarreal, while both Espanyol and Athletic Bilbao head into the decisive leg on level terms.","Atletico Madrid are reportedly keen on a move for PSG's Edinson Cavani .

"Goals from David Luiz and Edinson Cavani helped Paris St Germain reach the semi-finals of the French Cup with a 2-0 win over Ligue 1 rivals Monaco at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday.

"A golden opportunity to register a rare victory on the PGA Tour slipped through the fingers of Paul Casey and Ian Poulter on Monday. But their failure opened the door for an even more heart-warming outcome: victory for two-time Open winner Padraig Harrington at the second play-off hole of the Honda Classic at Palm Beach Gardens in Florida. The crushing decline of Harrington has been documented well enough in  the past six years. Padraig Harrington celebrates his Honda Classic golf win on Monday at Palm Beach Gardens . Harrington tips his hat to the crowd as he walks to the green on the second playoff hole . Ian Poulter plays his shot out of a bunker on the 14th hole during The Honda Classic . With Harrington in danger of falling outside the world’s top 300, it seemed a mystery why he didn’t put his name forward last month as a candidate to be Europe’s captain at the Ryder Cup in Minnesota next year. But the model Irishman, now 43, had the last word on Monday with his first win in seven years on one of the two main tours. Reduced to asking for invitations to play in America these days, he made full use of one at the Honda Classic. He led at halfway, and then in a see-saw final round he got the better of rookie American Daniel Berger having needed a birdie at the 18th to force a play-off. Jack Nicklaus opined that he could see tension in the Harrington swing during the third round, which was hardly surprising given all the problems he’s had on the course these last few years. Poulter of England and his caddie are seen during the continuation of the fourth round of The Honda Classic . After winning The Open in 2007 and 2008, followed by the US PGA Championship the same year, he suffered his first winless year for a decade in 2009. While the Irishman managed just one top-five finish in majors over the next five years, his ranking plummeted from world No 2 to 297 at the start of this year. After yesterday’s win, Harrington moves up to No 82 and qualifies for this year’s Masters. And some of the putting woes that have contributed to his fall re-appeared during the final round, only for Harrington to hold his nerve with a level-par 70 that set up the win. Harrington said: ‘Hopefully this isn’t an isolated win. I think I have found that mental edge I had been missing and hopefully I can be consistently contending. Believe it or not, when I get in contention I can still hit the shots.’ For Casey, it was the second week in a row he had experienced such frustration, after losing a sudden death play-off in the Northern Trust Open last week. For Poulter, who went into the water five times in a final round of 75 that left him tied third with Casey, it means the long wait to register a stroke-play success on American soil, stretching back over 150 events and more than 10 years, goes on. Harrington putts on the second playoff hole during The Honda Classic at PGA National Resort & Spa . The 39-year-old has won stroke-play events in Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe, but his sole victory in the US came in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona in 2010. ‘It’s just bitterly disappointing to put myself in the position I have, to play as well as I’ve played... and a couple of loose shots has cost me this tournament,’ said Poulter. ‘It’s a shame to hand tournaments away.’ A Monday finish at the Honda Classic proved a necessity after violent storms had wreaked havoc on Friday and Saturday. The two Englishmen began the last 11 holes of the final round on Monday with a one-stroke lead over Patrick Reed. Paul Casey watches his tee shot on the 15th hole during The Honda Classic at PGA National Resort & Spa . Both Englishmen will look to the positives after going so close. For Poulter it brings to an end a miserable 15 months during which he hasn’t finished in the top 10 in tournaments, never mind win. For Casey, it’s further evidence that his career is now firmly back on track. The 37-year-old turned his back on the European Tour to concentrate on America this year and his decision has been vindicated by his golf over the past fortnight. Barely inside the world’s top 100 at the beginning of February, he is on the verge of earning an invitation to play in the Masters in April. The scene now switches 60 miles south to Miami and the first event this year in which all the world’s best players are in the same place at the same time — the WGC Cadillac Championship at Doral.","Paul Casey and Ian Poulter let a rare PGA Tour victory slip away .

"Newcastle legend Alan Shearer has slammed the club for a lack of ambition under the tenure of owner Mike Ashley. The Magpies are 11th in the Premier League table having escaped with a 1-0 win over relegation threatened Aston Villa on Saturday. Shearer, who scored over 200 goals for Newcastle, believes the St James' Park faithful will consider giving up their season tickets soon because of the lack of investment and hope. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was among the crowd of spectators at St James' Park on Saturday . 'There is no excitement, no anticipation. It takes its toll, even on the most loyal fans in the country. Fans want to dream their team can be successful, whether that's in a domestic cup competition or in Europe,' Shearer told the Telegraph. 'Newcastle fans at the minute are showing why they are some of the best around, because they can't dream. They've been told the cups aren't a priority, that finishing 10th in the Premier League is more important.' The former striker calls for squad investment in the summer but doubts much will change under current owner Mike Ashley, and insists the club should pursue Cup glory more seriously. Newcastle legend, now a pundit with Match of the Day, has criticised the club's lack of ambition . Despite his injury problems Papiss Cisse has become a crucial player for John Carver at Newcastle . 'Unless the club are going to bring in a load of exciting players in the summer, which is highly unlikely when you look at the way it's been run, then I think people might look at giving up. I can only tell you what my mates are thinking about doing because of the lack of hope at the minute,' added Shearer . 'I'd dearly love us to have a cup run, I'd dearly love us to get to Wembley again, I'd much rather that than just finish in mid-table year after year. 'It's not going to happen because we've played a weakened team in every cup game. They've been playing weakened teams in cup competitions since 2007.' Cisse draws the congratulations after scoring the winner for Newcastle against Aston Villa on Saturday .

"Captain John Terry believes Chelsea's 'massive' Capital One Cup final win over Tottenham could be the start of something special for the Blues. Terry's goal on the stroke of half-time put Chelsea in front at Wembley and a Diego Costa shot that deflected in off Kyle Walker 11 minutes into the second half secured a 2-0 win.

"Atletico Madrid head coach Diego Simeone concedes that a third place finish is the best the La Liga champions can hope for this season after losing yet more ground at the top after a 1-1 draw with Valencia on Sunday. Beating Real Madrid and Barcelona to the Spanish title last term, as well as reaching the final of the Champions League, were remarkable achievements but it appears Atletico will fall some way short of matching the Spanish giants this season. The draw at home to fourth-placed Valencia means Simeone's men have won only one of their last four La Liga outings and are now seven points adrift of leaders Barca and six behind second-placed Real with 12 games left. Koke's fierce low strike was too much for Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves to save . But Shkodran Mustafi (second right) headed in Valencia's equaliser in the 78th minute . Atletico manager Diego Simeone admits the limit of his side's ambition this season is to finish third . A resurgent Valencia are breathing down Atletico's necks a point behind in fourth and Simeone said he and the players are determined to hang on to third and secure a place in Europe's elite club competition for next season. Sevilla, who held Atletico to a 0-0 draw at their Sanchez Pizjuan stadium at the start of the month and are five points behind Valencia in fifth, are also still in with a chance of a Champions League berth. 'The league is long and we have always said that our championship is competing against Valencia and Sevilla,' Simeone told a news conference after the stalemate at the Calderon. Koke leads the celebrations after putting Atletico into a first-half lead . Koke is mobbed by his team-mates after his goal had put Atletico ahead against rivals Valencia . 'Neither could beat us in these last two matches and we still have the one-point advantage that we need to protect,' added the former Argentina captain. 'Reinventing ourselves the way we have and competing the way we are competing is a great achievement for the players. 'Hopefully when the season ends we will have secured that third spot.' Atletico were unfortunate not to take all three points on Sunday after Valencia rode their luck to steal a late equaliser that cancelled out Koke's first-half strike. Mustafi celebrates his header with Rodrigo Moreno in the draw at the Vicente Calderon . Mustafi's goal leaves Spanish champions Atletico are seven points adrift of leaders Barcelona .

"Liverpool's win over Manchester City on Sunday lifted them to within two points of the Champions League places and Brendan Rodgers' side are one of the hottest teams in Europe right now. Since the turn of the year, Liverpool - led by the form of Philippe Coutinho - have picked up 20 points from eight games at a remarkable two and a half points per game. Arsenal, with 18 points from eight games, and Chelsea, who have 14 from seven, have been the next best in the Premier League this calendar year, but Liverpool's quest for Champions League football has outstripped all their rivals. Liverpool, with the help of some stunning goals from Philippe Coutinho, are one of Europe's form sides . Brendan Rodgers' team have climbed to fifth in the Premier League table, just two points behind Man United . Arsenal have also begun 2015 well in the league, with 18 points from eight games since New Year's Day . In the top five leagues in Europe only Wolfsburg, who have won five and drawn one of their six games this year, have picked up points at a better rate. The German side have narrowed the gap to Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich since the beginning of January, but still trail the champions by eight points. With striker Bas Dost in remarkable form - with 13 goals in his eight games since January 1 - and former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings behind him, Wolfsburg now look nailed on for a Champions League spot. In fact, qualification for Europe's biggest competition links all of the top form teams, with few of 2015's best performers actually challenging for the title in the top leagues around the continent. Brendan Rodgers celebrates Liverpool's win against Manchester City which continued their great form . In Spain, Valencia's excellent run of just one defeat and one draw in nine games this year has lifted them to within a point of Atletico Madrid in third place, though they are still eight points short of Real Madrid at the top of the table. The most remarkable upsurge in form comes from Caen, who have picked up 19 points from eight games, having only earned 15 from their  19 matches in the first half of the season. The run has seen them earn a 2-2 draw against PSG and beat Marseille 3-2 having trailed 2-0 in both games. Wolfsburg striker Bas Dost is Europe's sharpest marksman in 2015, with 13 goals in his last eight games . The Dutch striker has been a revelation in 2015, having only scored once before the turn of the year . Emiliano Sala scored against Marseille as Caen came back from two goals down . Remy Vercoutre, the Caen keeper, salutes the fans after his side's remarkable run continued in Marseille . On-loan Argentine foward Emiliano Sala, signed from Bordeaux at the end of January, has scored four times in the last three games as Caen have climbed from bottom of the league on New Year's Day to a comfortable mid-table spot, five points above the drop zone. Only in Italy have the team top of the league started 2015 with the best form. Juventus have earned 19 points from nine games - the same number as city-rivals Torino - to stretch their lead over Roma at the top of Serie A to nine points.

"John Carver will use his Holland World Cup stars to inflict yet more St James’ Park misery on Louis van Gaal – and says the Dutchman missed a trick in not taking Daryl Janmaat with him to Old Trafford. The Manchester United boss has already been on the receiving end of two defeats on Tyneside. First, with Barcelona in 1997, he was the victim of Tino Asprilla’s famous hat-trick in a 3-2 loss in the Champions League group stages. Ten years later he was back with AZ Alkmaar as they were beaten 4-2 in the last 16 of the UEFA Cup, turning the tie with a 2-0 victory back in Holland. Van Gaal returns with United on Wednesday where he will come up against Janmaat and Tim Krul, two of the players who helped Holland to the semi-finals of the World Cup last summer. John Carver described Daryl Janmaat (left) as an 'exceptional player' ahead of Newcastle United's match . The Newcastle United boss (right) was surprised United didn't make a move for the impressive full back . And Carver said: ‘Daryl and Tim have been very helpful in terms of how Van Gaal organises his teams. ‘They actually came to me with the advice, which was nice, and it was a helpful insight.’ He added: ‘I’ve heard his record here isn’t very good and he’s lost twice, hopefully it will be third time unlucky. ‘I was there for that Barcelona game and I wouldn’t mind another night like that.’ Meanwhile, Carver admits that Newcastle’s £5million capture of Janmaat has proved one of the best pieces of business from last summer. Tim Krul (left) and Janmaat have been giving Carver insight into how Van Gaal sets his sides up . The 25-year-old was an ever-present in Brazil and, with United short of options on the right side of defence, Carver is surprised Van Gaal did not rival them for his signature. ‘I think Van Gaal perhaps had more pressing issues to sort out because let's not forget, when he came in he was talking about playing with three centre-backs,’ said Carver. ‘But even as a wing-back Daryl would have fitted into the system nicely. ‘He's a top, top player. We lost a top player in Mathieu Debuchy but replaced him with an exceptional player. That's good news. ‘He's been the most consistent player for us this season and is a great character. ‘He is a good defender and likes playing on the front foot and he gives you real quality going forward. The Dutch goalkeeper played under Van Gaal at the World Cup including his heroics in a penalty shoot out . ‘That's what we saw when we signed him. He's second on the list of assists in the Premier League for defenders and he’s been excellent for us.’ There has been talk of Van Gaal making a move for Janmaat at the end of the season. And the former Feyenoord star certainly talks highly of his former international boss. ‘He is a fantastic trainer and he has had a magnificent career,’ he said. ‘I have been very fortunate to work with him and I cannot say a bad word about him. ‘He is one of the best trainers I have ever worked with, and if you see how he works tactically, it is great. He always seems to know what to do to win a game.’ Louis van Gaal doesn't have a good record at St James' Park and has lost his last two games there .","Newcastle United boss John Carver says his Dutch players have been helping him in his preparation for the game against Louis van Gaal .

"It was an emotional day for Jose Mourinho as he lifted his first trophy since returning to Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday evening. It ended a 'drought' of 914 days since Mourinho last won a competition, and the Chelsea boss looked close to tears at the final whistle, before celebrating the success with captain John Terry and the rest of his team.

"Roma were held 0-0 on Sunday against Chievo Verona as the capital side's title hopes took another blow in a Serie A match which was marred by a gruesome injury to youngster Federico Mattiello. The 19-year-old Mattiello, who is on loan at Chievo from Juventus, was stretchered off in tears after breaking his leg in a clash with Radja Nainggolan.

Mattiello was carried off to a standing ovation from the fans and the benches off both teams. It was only his third appearance for Chievo after joining from Juventus in January, but he has impressed and was regarded as one of Italy's promising talents.

There were banners displayed at the stadium against current owner Giampietro Manenti as well as the Italian football federation and the league. It was a new start for Atalanta too after it sacked Stefano Colantuono on Wednesday, replacing him with Reja, but the former Lazio and Napoli coach was sent to the stands in the 63rd minute for dissent.

Parma winger Cristian Rodriguez was also sent off, three minutes from time, following a second booking. Empoli continued their push for survival as they extended their unbeaten run to six, denting Genoa's hopes of qualifying for Europe. Genoa took the lead in the 27th when M'Baye Niang muscled his way into the left side of the penalty area and fired into the far bottom corner for his third goal in as many matches. Empoli leveled with a somewhat bizarre equaliser as it was not entirely clear whether Mirko Valdifiori's corner had already gone over the line before Federico Barba ensured it went in. Torino's 12-game unbeaten streak ended despite taking the lead when former Udinese striker Fabio Quagliarella headed in Alexander Farnerud's cross. Empoli's midfielder Daniele Croce fights for the ball with Genoa's midfielder Iago Falque . Antonio Di Natale leveled moments later and Udinese took the lead in the 27th when Panagiotis Kone's header from a corner went in off the arm of Torino's Cristian Molinaro. Quagliarella hit the post shortly before halftime and Molla Wague headed home his first league goal to extend Udinese's lead after the break. Torino got back into the match in the 69th. A cross was headed out but only as far as Marco Benassi, whose volley was deflected into the net by Ivan Piris. The referee initially appeared to disallow the goal for offside, but changed his mind after consulting with his assistants.","Roma's title bid was dealt a blow as they drew 0-0 with Chievo Verona .

"Bradford striker Jon Stead was disappointed his side could not battle past Reading and into the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The teams will have to do it all again at the Madejski Stadium after a hard-fought clash ended in a 0-0 draw in West Yorkshire.

'We are disappointed because we feel we can do better. 'In the second half we pinned them in for long spells but we needed a goal. We limited them to a few chances.

There's great belief in the players and the staff and we'll give it everything we've got.' Manager Phil Parkinson was more upbeat, saying on BT Sport: 'Were still in the hat so we're pleased with that. 'You've got to give Reading credit, they came and made it difficult. It was a cagey old affair. I thought our lads did excellently in a different type of way than Sunderland. Phil Parkinson (centre) was pleased with his side's overall performance in a tightly fought encounter . 'We had to be very professional and wait for the moment to arrive. Unfortunately it didn't. In the second half we had the momentum but we didn't have that touch of class in and around the box. 'We look forward to the replay.

'When we went to Stamford Bridge, it was a day out, no one expected us to get through.' Reading set out their stall early on to be hard to beat but manager Steve Clarke knows the job is far from done yet. The facial injury received by Alex Pearce showed how physically demanding the contest was . He said: 'We came here and decided to roll up our sleeves. We knew we'd have to battle, fight for every second ball and see if we could produce something. 'We hit the post twice and on another day we could have nicked something. But it was a fair result. 'There was never really a moment where I was too worried. We were in the game from the first minute, and we were determined to get them back to our place if that was the best we could do.

"Even the world-renowned composer himself might have struggled to orchestrate better than Arsenal's 'Little Mozart' on his day. Rosicky earned that nickname during his five years with Borussia Dortmund, yet it was in Germany where he was labelled 'wasted talent' and Arsenal gladly signed the maestro in May 2006. 'When he is fit...' seem to be the same, old four words that crop up when Rosicky becomes the topic of discussion yet, even at the age of 34, he still knows how to make Arsenal tick. Tomas Rosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' in Germany and he continues to make Arsenal tick at 34 . Olivier Giroud celebrates with Rosicky during their Premier League win against Queens Park Rangers . Rosicky has found minutes hard to come by at Arsenal previously but injuries can prove problematic . Pulling on the yellow of Dortmund from 2001, the all-round midfielder's potential was recognised. Remember Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002? Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo and Ronaldinho, among others, playing in a 'secret tournament' hosted by Eric Cantona. Then, among the world's finest footballers, was a 20-something Rosicky. More than a decade on he is in his mid-thirties, and getting better with age. Take the former Sparta Prague youth's cameo against Everton on March 1, for example. There was a moment when Rosicky chased the ball from Phil Jagielka, to Ross Barkley, to Steven Naismith, then back to Barkley, and won the tackle. It merited a standing ovation, before he settled the bag of nerves the Emirates Stadium had become with an 89th-minute goal to make it 2-0. 'This geezer's unreal, how is he 34? Still producing moments of class like that, he's a brilliant player,' one supporter said in his analysis on ArsenalFanTV afterwards. Rosicky scores against Everton previously as he came on as a substitute with just eight minutes remaining . Rosicky shoots to make it 2-0 to Arsenal against Everton on March 1 and settle their nerves . Rosicky should start against Manchester United but is not guaranteed to do so under Wenger . Rosicky mocked up as his nickname 'Little Mozart' 87 - vs QPR (March 4) 8 - vs Everton (March 1) 9 - vs Monaco (February 25) 14 - vs Crystal Palace (February 21) 18 - vs Middlesbrough (February 15) That's exactly how it comes – in 'moments'. The Czech Republic captain doesn't devastate week in, week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift. The mentality to pass sideways is lost on Rosicky, who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward, showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the Premier League. Yet Rosicky – a one-two kind of player, who bleeds the Arsenal way – has averaged just 19 games per Barclays Premier League season under Wenger in his nine years in north London. The injury-prone playmaker has been unlucky, rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an Achilles tendon in 2012. It cost him more than two years, and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since. Minutes have been hard to come by. Eighteen against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, 14 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, and just nine in the 3-1 defeat by Monaco in the Champions League at the Emirates. His eight minutes against Everton led to a rare start against Queens Park Rangers, and Wenger should persist with the playmaker. There is no doubt the Arsenal manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension. 'If you love football, you love Rosicky,' purred Wenger after their 3-2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round. Rosicky treated that match as an exhibition. His assist for Mesut Ozil's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no-look pass led to a one-two that allowed Rosicky to score a volley in the second. You may remember it better for Phil Neville declaring he would 'two-foot him' if he tried that in his neck of the woods, but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess. Rosicky makes a no-look pass against Brighton which pundit Phil Neville found disrespectful . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 defeat of Brighton . During interviews Rosicky can look uneasy, like a teenager making a television debut, not a player just one cap short of a century for Czech Republic. Modesty, can be another way to put it. This week we heard Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, has years left. Can Rosicky keep being his tireless self? Well, a Jaguar Land Rover may be aged but, when it's only got so many miles on the clock, it runs as good as any. Rosicky has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but, with him now fit, Wenger should start the 34-year-old against Manchester United on Monday, then watch him go.","Tomas Rosicky's career has been hampered by injury at times .

"Tony Pulis has demanded life bans for West Bromwich supporters who ripped out seats and threw them at rival fans at Villa Park. The furious West Brom manager also branded as ‘mindless idiots’ the hundreds of Aston Villa fans who invaded the pitch and goaded his players during Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final in scenes reminiscent of the 1970s. The FA are investigating the trouble, with Villa facing a large fine or even a partial stadium closure if negligence is established. West Brom manager Tony Pulis was disappointed that fans ripped out seats at Villa Park . Pulis compared scenes with fans on the pitch at Villa Park to trouble in the 1970s . Thousands of Villa supporters celebrated their win against West Brom by storming the pitch on Saturday . Questions will be asked about the meagre number of stewards, who were overwhelmed by a rush of Villa supporters. In 2010 West Ham were fined £115,000 for failing to control their fans when violence flared at a League Cup tie against Millwall. West Brom could also face sanctions over their fans, with one Villa supporter revealing to Sportsmail that he suffered a bloody head wound caused by a seat flung down from the upper section of the North Stand. Estimates suggested up to 25 chairs had been used as weapons. Pulis said: ‘Those supporters should never come into another ground. It is like people coming into someone else’s house — you have to show respect.’ West Bromwich  issued a stern statement on Sunday insisting they would show no tolerance towards any offenders. Chairman Jeremy Peace was said to have left the stadium in a rage. As thousands of Villa fans stormed on to the pitch to celebrate a 2-0 victory over their local rivals, many chose to swarm around West Brom players. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace reportedly left the stadium furious about what happened . West Brom midfield player Callum McManaman was said to be involved in the most aggressive clash . Winger Callum McManaman was said to be involved in the most aggressive confrontation, while goalkeeper Boaz Myhill was repeatedly barged by yobs. Villa’s Fabian Delph, who scored his side’s first goal, said he was bitten by over-enthusiastic fans. ‘It was dangerous,’ he said. ‘Someone tried to take my boot off. People tried to kiss me and were biting me. It was scary.’ West Midlands Police said 17 arrests had been, while they are are also trying to identify people involved in a fracas before the match at the Witton Arms pub down the road from Villa Park. Villa issued a statement condemning the fans who poured over the barriers in the dying minutes of the game. ‘The club does not condone supporters invading the field under any circumstances. ‘We are very disappointed that what should have been a very memorable and proud moment was marred by the actions of those who could not control themselves. They have let both themselves and their club down. Villa could be in trouble from the Football Association for the crowd problems on Saturday . Fabian Delph scored in the game but the Aston Villa captain described the incident as 'scary' ‘The club extends its sincere apologies to the FA, the West Brom directors, Tony Pulis and all his staff and players.’ Pulis said: ‘It was like the Seventies and Eighties. I am old enough to have seen isolated incidents like that. Villa should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night, 5.30, you need to police it properly and I am sure Villa will look at it. ‘This is just hopefully an isolated incident with mindless idiots.’","Tony Pulis was dismayed at fan trouble during FA Cup match at Villa Park .

"Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana believes captaincy is bringing the best out of team-mate Jordan Henderson. In the absence of Steven Gerrard, who returned to training this week after a hamstring injury which has sidelined him for six matches, the Reds vice-captain has taken the armband and led from the front. His goal against Burnley was his second in as many games - taking his tally for the season to five - and he also provided his 11th assist of the season for Daniel Sturridge to also score against the Clarets. Jordan Henderson (centre) has seen Liverpool unbeaten in his six games as captain . Henderson scored a stunning goal in the 2-0 victory over Burnley on Wednesday . The England international also scored a screamer against champions Manchester City in his previous game . Liverpool have not lost any of the 13 matches in which Henderson has worn the armband from the start and Lallana, who knows something about leadership from his time at Southampton, believes his England colleague has grown with the added responsibility. 'He is unbelievable. He has matured as a player over the last two seasons and he has kicked on another level even with the armband,' said the £23million summer signing. 'I was lucky enough to be captain at Southampton and it does give you that little bit extra and it seems it is doing the same to him. 'It is great to be playing with such good players and the results are on the up. 'We have a great rhythm and a good bit of consistency and are keeping clean sheets as well; we've turned a corner since Christmas and we are really looking good. Adam Lallana (centre) believes Henderson has come into his own after being handed the Reds armband . First choice captain Steven Gerrard (right) has returned to training after recovering from a hamstring injury . 'It was a difficult start (to the season) but all the signings have bedded in now and we have players back fit and we have found a system we are playing really well and are causing teams problems. 'Confidence is a big thing in any team and we have that in abundance and I think it is showing.' Lallana's own improvement in form has also taken an upturn in line with the team's and there is no doubt he is benefiting from the 3-4-2-1 system which allows him the freedom, alongside Philippe Coutinho, to exploit the space behind the central striker. 'I've had a few injuries and been in and out of the team for whatever reason but I am thoroughly enjoying it at the minute,' he added. 'I am staying fit and contributing in the system the manager has got us playing.' Daniel Sturridge scores against Palace to set up an FA Cup quarter-final against Blackburn on Sunday . With Liverpool now at full pelt in the race for the top four, just three points behind third-placed Arsenal, they must now divert their attention to the FA Cup. Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn visit Anfield on Sunday with a place in the last four at stake. 'It is a great competition in which we have a great chance of getting to Wembley in the semi-final,' said Lallana. 'We won't underestimate Blackburn, we will dust ourselves down, recover well and go again Sunday. 'A lot of the big guns went out in the early rounds so it is good that we can maybe capitalise on that but Blackburn will not be an easy game. 'They will come here full of optimism and will want to cause an upset.'","Jordan Henderson has captained Reds in absence of Steven Gerrard .

"Scarlets boosted their European Champions Cup qualification ambitions by seeing  at Parc y Scarlets. The home side remain outside of the top six, but are now just three points behind Connacht in the battle to book a place among Europe's elite. It was a deserved win for the Llanelli-based region, who put a big dent in Leinster's play-off hopes with just five rounds of action remaining. Both sides welcomed back Six Nations squad members with British and Irish Lions prop Cian Healy making his first Leinster start since September, while Wales centre Scott Williams had not pulled on a Scarlets jersey for six weeks. And the Scarlets' vice-captain came to the fore in a bright start from the home side, which was rewarded with a penalty from fly-half Steve Shingler after 10 minutes. However, Leinster began to grow into the game as the half wore on and on 18 minutes they showed the clinical edge of champions to claim the game's opening try. After Leinster had set up an attack in the home 22, former NRL star Ben Te'o cut an exquisite angle through the Scarlets midfield before stepping his way to score at the posts. Fly-half Jimmy Gopperth landed the simple conversion. The Wasps-bound number 10 added another three points following more pressure from the visitors, but Scarlets responded strongly and crossed for their first try just before the half-hour mark. Some slick handling by the home backs had Leinster on the back foot and Scotland back-rower John Barclay did well to squeeze in at the corner - although it needed the television match official to confirm the number eight had avoided touch in the process of touching down. Shingler was short with the conversion and it meant Leinster held a slender 10-8 advantage at the interval. However, a well-worked team try from the Scarlets wiped out that advantage 11 minutes after the restart. After strong work from the forwards which took play to the Leinster line, the home side appeared to have butchered an overlap. However, they regrouped well and silky hands from Kiwi centre Regan King put full-back Jordan Williams over. A long-range Gopperth penalty reduced the arrears to two points, then it needed a try-saving tackle from Barclay to deny opposite number Jack Conan, with James Davies claiming a crucial turnover. The outstanding Barclay was then involved at the opposite end of the field, bursting through to set up the Scarlets third try, finished off with an outstretched hand by replacement Rory Pitman. Shingler couldn't land the conversion and seven points separated the sides going into the final 13 minutes. Replacement Rhys Priestland landed a penalty to put more distance between the sides and Leinster left empty handed after a score by full-back Zane Kirchner was ruled out by the TMO in the final minutes.","Scarlets boosted their European Champions Cup qualification ambitions .

"Bradford boss Phil Parkinson is relishing his side's return to the role of FA Cup outsiders after watching them keep their Wembley hopes alive with a gutsy goalless draw against Reading at Valley Parade. The Bantams' recent knockout heroics had made them narrow favourites to book their place in the semi-finals for the first time since 1911 despite the face they faced higher league opposition. But after watching Gary Liddle come closest in a clattering clash when he hit the woodwork late in the first half, Parkinson was keen to revive the siege mentality which helped them to wins over Chelsea and Sunderland. Phil Parkinson is congratulated by Jose Mourinho as Bradford shocked Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . Parkinson the manager  collides with Garath McCleary of Reading during the FA Cup Quarter Final match . Parkinson said: 'We will go down there for the replay really as the underdogs and we will approach it in a positive fashion because we're at our best when we do that. 'We won at Stamford Bridge which was seen as a day out for us because no-one expected us to go and get a result. So we are still very much alive and kicking.' The draw will mean a rare return for Parkinson to the club for whom he made 361 appearances and as a player and was voted their best ever central midfielder in an online poll. Andrew Davies  heads the ball wide of the Reading goal during the FA Cup Quarter Final match at Valley Parade . 'I'm looking forward to going back there because I haven't got down there many times since I left,' added Parkinson. 'Obviously I would have preferred to have gone through but the next best scenario is the replay.' Pavel Pogrebnyak and Oliver Norwood also hit the post for Reading who were bidding to make their own bit of history by reaching the last four for the first time since 1927. And Steve Clarke's men know they will probably never have a better chance than their replay against League One opposition which is scheduled for a week on Monday at the Madejski Stadium. Pavel Pogrebnyak heads the ball onto the post during the FA Cup Quarter Final match . Clarke had plainly set his side up to combat the physical nature of the Bantams who had stunned Sunderland in the fifth round and taken the lead inside the first four minutes. And the tone for a full-throttle but low-quality encounter was set in a robust opening minute as Billy Knott barged over Jamie Mackie and moments later Nathaniel Chalobah's challenge left James Hanson stretched out on the deck. The bruising encounter continued in the same vein from the first whistle to the last with Reading captain Alex Pearce playing the last three minutes with a broken nose after an accidental clash with Bradford substitute Francois Zoko. Stephen Darby applauds the fans following their team's 0-0 draw during match between Bradford and Reading . Bradford had stepped up the pace in the second half with chances for Hanson and Andrew Davies but it was Reading who came closest to snatching it when Norwood's late free-kick caused a mighty scramble in the home box. Clarke said he hoped the replay would attract a sell-out crowd at the Madejski Stadium but rejected his side's role as favourites and stressed the Bantams were still very much in the hunt for a semi-final place. Billy Knott strikes the ball as Daniel Williams of Reading closes in during the FA Cup Quarter Final match . 'We are both still in the hat and can look forward to the draw, and both teams will fancy their chances in the replay,' said Clarke. 'We hit the post twice and on another day we could have nicked it but it's probably a fair result and now we will look forward to them coming back to our place. 'I knew we were in the game from the first minute from the way we were challenging and getting the second balls. I knew we were determined to get them back to our place if that was the best we could do, and everyone was 100 per cent concentrated on that.'

'We did not have the intensity in training leading up to that match and we were exposed on the day. 'We weren't pointing fingers, we were looking at ourselves as to how we could have prepared better for that game. 'It was a bitter pill to swallow because we were well-beaten and it was the first time in a long time that had happened to us.

"Roberto Martinez insists he does not take the backing of Everton chairman Bill Kenwright for granted as he vowed to arrest the club’s worrying domestic form. Everton may have been impressive in Europe this season but results in the Barclays Premier League have been poor and a sequence of one win in 11 matches has seen them slide to the fringes of the relegation zone. The patience of some supporters has been stretched by those results but Kenwright is not a man who makes knee-jerk decisions and Martinez recognises how crucial that is, given that other chairman might not have been so tolerant.

Kenwright and Martinez are all smiles on the day the Spaniard was appointed Everton manager in June 2013 . ‘Remember when you make a decision in becoming a manager of a football club you take that into consideration,’ said Martinez, whose side face Stoke on Wednesday night. 'I was always very aware of the support that I would get from the chairman. Bill Kenwright is a mad Evertonian who became a chairman. ‘It’s not the other way round. He’s not a chairman that gets to know the football club. I can feel that relationship. I had his support when we were flying in the league, when we were flying in Europe and I’ve got his support when we haven’t been able to get the wins we wanted in the league. ‘He is always supportive and hands on in terms of helping and that’s where a manager can be at his best – when he feels the support of his chairman. We always look forward. It is just support and pain – because when you don’t win and you are a proper Evertonian we all feel pain.’ Romelu Lukaku reacts after missing a chance during Everton's 2-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday . This might be the most scrutiny Martinez has faced in his career but he maintains the pressure is not comparable to the game he played in for Swansea in 2003 when their professional status was on the line. ‘It doesn’t get any worse than that because if you lose your status people lose their jobs around the club,’ said Martinez. ‘We were 2-1 down with two mistakes and that is a pressure situation when you have 50 minutes on the pitch to get it right as a player. ‘Those moments help me because I can see the seriousness of a situation and it is a serious position we are in, but I look at our squad and believe me it is a lot easier to win games with this squad. I am very confident we will improve.’","Everton have struggled for form in the Premier League this season .

"West Brom boss Tony Pulis insists he has no problem with his Aston Villa counterpart Tim Sherwood following the latter's comments about the size of the two Midlands duo. Prior to Tuesday's Barclays Premier League clash between the teams, Sherwood - a contender to take over as Baggies boss in the recent past - described Albion as a 'good little club' before expressing his delight at having landed the manager's job at a 'massive football club' like Villa. Then, after his side won 2-1 in the game at Villa Park, Sherwood again made an apparent dig at West Brom, saying they will 'have to improve' for the next meeting - Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at the same venue - if they are going stop the hosts triumphing again. West Brom manager Tony Pulis insists he does not have a problem with Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood . Sherwood said West Brom were a 'good little club' ahead of Aston Villa's 2-1 win against the Baggies . But Pulis said ahead of this weekend's derby: 'That is Tim - there are no problems with me or the chairman at all. 'Tim is Tim and he will be good fun for everyone around the West Midlands for the time he is at Aston Villa I'm sure.' Pulis stressed West Brom will not need to use either the words of Sherwood, for whom the win on Tuesday was his first since taking the Villa post last month, or the disappointment of their defeat in that game to generate any additional motivation for Saturday's contest. With his players only one match away from a Wembley semi-final, Pulis - a beaten FA Cup finalist in 2011 as Stoke boss - said: 'I don't need to pin that (Sherwood's comments) up in the changing room. 'We have a good group of lads here and they will want to win the game as much as Villa will. 'I don't think we need any (extra) motivation. It's a local derby, it's the quarter-final of the FA Cup and it's absolutely wonderful that we've got to this stage. These are big games that everybody should look forward to and we will certainly be looking forward to it. 'We've got as good a chance (of winning the competition) as any of the eight teams left in there. 'You go and ask Bradford. They will fancy winning it as well.' West Brom defeated non-league side Gateshead 7-0 in Pulis' first official game in charge of the Baggies . Pulis' first game officially in charge of West Brom following his appointment in January was the 7-0 FA Cup third-round victory over non-league Gateshead at the Hawthorns. Since then, Albion's run in the tournament has also seen them win 2-1 at Birmingham and 4-0 at home against West Ham. Overall, the Baggies have lost only twice in their 11 games in all competitions under Pulis so far. And asked if he had underestimated Villa on Tuesday night, the 57-year-old said: 'I have great respect for every club and every team. 'From the third round right the way through, and in every game we play in the Premier League or anything else - I have total respect for clubs, the people there and the supporters. 'I never underestimate anyone. I've been in the game too long to do that.' West Brom will be without injured forward Victor Anichebe (groin) and cup-tied midfielder Darren Fletcher for Saturday's tie. Pulis says he has a few 'knocks and niggles' in his squad to assess - winger Callum McManaman (foot) is a doubt, while forwards Saido Berahino and Brown Ideye have both been playing recently with pain-killing injections. Pulis also said the club 'have to go carefully' with Stephane Sessegnon, with the forward understood to have suffered a family bereavement, and it remains to be seen whether goalkeeper Ben Foster keeps his place after his costly late error in Tuesday's loss.","Aston Villa host West Brom in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup .

"Brendan Rodgers took radical steps to transform Liverpool’s season as he feared a failure to do so would leave him in danger of being sacked. Liverpool’s fortunes have transformed since Rodgers drastically switched his side’s system to an attack-minded 3-4-3 formation in December; they are the form team in the Barclays Premier League, having taken 27 points from the last 33. The memory of how bad things were in November, though, has not left Rodgers and he has admitted that his experience at Reading, when he was axed in December 2009 after just 20 matches in charge, triggered his decision to rip things up and start again. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks to his coaches during a training session at Melwood . The former Swansea City manager shares a joke with Ivorian defender Kolo Toure in training . Rodgers chats to England full back Glen Johnson during the training session at Melwood . Rodgers is highly-regarded by Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners, and he signed a new long-term contract last May but the 42-year-old knows none of that would have mattered had his side’s results continued on a downward spiral. ‘I certainly wasn’t going to roll over and die,’ said Rodgers, whose side face Burnley On Wednesday. ‘I love it here and I want to be successful. But after the Crystal Palace game (in November when Liverpool lost 3-1) in particular, I felt ""it doesn’t matter how much support you have, the team is not functioning"". ‘It could not go on, really. My experience at Reading told me that. That’s what I learned from that sacking. I went in with the full backing of the chairman, who was great to me. Even though it was a three-year project and they wanted me there, I got the sack after 20 games. ‘I learnt that it does not matter how much support you have in the boardroom, you have to get results – and you have to win. So I needed to make sure that I was going to make decisions which would allow us to get back to at least somewhere near where we were. Liverpool beat Premier League champions Manchester City 2-1 in their last league outing . Midfielders Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho both scored brilliant goals during the win . Rodgers admitted the fear of being sacked had driven him on to turn the club's results around . ‘I think the transformation in the team has been really good to see; to see the confidence, and everyone talking about the system and how dynamic it is, and the fluency. I should have done it earlier! I am an innovative coach and I needed to find a way to make us play better.’ At the lowest point in the campaign, when Liverpool tumbled out of the Champions League and were playing predictably, Rodgers’ was noticeably subdued, particularly before they drew at home to Basel in December. He needed to lift himself as much as his players. ‘We had a huge challenge, probably the biggest I have had as a coach or manager,’ said Rodgers. ‘We had no identity and everyone could see it. We just weren’t the team I had created over a couple of years with an identity for the way we played. ‘I knew I had to do something radical because I had seen enough of the players to know we were not going to be able to shape up and work and play as we had done for the previous couple of years with what we had got. It just wasn’t happening and that eats away at you.’","Brendan Rodgers enjoys a good relationship with Liverpool's owners .

"There was a time in 2012 when just about every selfie going was doctored by a grinning picture of John Terry, super-imposed in his full Chelsea kit and lifting the European Cup. Their captain popped up all over the internet, a subject of ridicule after missing the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena through suspension. This time he wore the Chelsea strip for real, lifting the Capital One Cup high up in the Wembley stands and dancing like a dad in front of their celebrating fans behind the goal in the West Stand. John Terry lifts the Capital One Cup after captaining Chelsea to victory over Tottenahm Hotspur . Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris watches as Terry's shot finds the back of the net during the first half . Diego Costa, Terry and Gary Cahill celebrate the opening goal of the game in London . Terry was man of the match here by a distance, driving this team towards their first trophy since Jose Mourinho returned with a performance that sent shivers down the spine. He scored Chelsea’s opener on the stroke of half-time, a finish that settled any anxiety and pretty much any doubt about the destination of this year’s Capital One Cup. After that, he was peerless. The Capital One Cup is a level or two down from the European Cup, or the three Barclays Premier League titles he has won at Chelsea during a 17-year career at Stamford Bridge — but one look at the Chelsea captain told you it really mattered. This was further confirmation, as if it were needed, of his class. His last-ditch tackle on Tottenham’s talisman Harry Kane, sprinting across to cover for his team-mate Gary Cahill in the final minutes here, evoked memories of the days when he was rated best in the world in his position. Former Atletico Madrid forward Costa had a hand in the second goal of the game on Sunday afternoon . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino watch on from the sidelines . Goalscorer Terry celebrates with Costa during their Capital One Cup final win in London . It hurt like hell for Terry to miss out on the Champions League final, that one night in Munich when Chelsea finally realised their ambition to win the biggest club cup in European football. At the age of 34 he plays one season at a time now, waiting for the call from Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo or director Marina Granovskaia to tell him that he will be staying on for another campaign. That conversation is coming, ‘a formality’ according to Mourinho recently as Terry matured into a new role at the heart of the Chelsea defence. Incredible as it sounds, opposition managers and their players have yet to suss out that Terry has passed on the main responsibility of marking to his usual central defensive partner Cahill. That savvy move added another five years to Alessandro Costacurta’s career with AC Milan when it was put to him by Carlo Ancelotti at the turn of the millennium. Here, after lifting the first trophy since Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge, Terry played like he could go on for another thousand years. Terry slides in to block a shot from Tottenham's top scorer Harry Kane during the second half . Mourinho has been instrumental in Terry's return to form, inspiring new motivation in his captain . Fellow defender Cahill has taken over many of the marking duties that Terry used to perform himself . Kane went cold here, frozen out by the discipline of Cahill — comfortably his best performance of the season — and the organisational ability of Chelsea’s captain alongside him. Cahill was terrorised by Kane in the 5-3 defeat at White Hart Lane on January 1, roughed up by the Tottenham striker and losing his guaranteed place in Chelsea’s team as a result. Terry is talking this team through games, just as Marcel Desailly did when he returned to Stamford Bridge after winning the World Cup with France in 1998. Terry has matured these past couple of years and it is at times like this when you begin to wonder what else he could have achieved if he had kept his nose clean. The rehabilitation will never quite be complete, never quite final because he has never spoken about the day in 2011 when he racially insulted Anton Ferdinand. He really ought to speak about it because even if the words he used at Loftus Road that day are unacceptable, society will accept an apology, or a least an explanation. Football can be a forgiving place. The Chelsea squad celebrate their cup success following the final whistle in the capital . Didier Drogba, Terry and full back Branislav Ivanovic celebrate their first trophy since Mourinho's return . Chelsea's captain and manager embrace after the Portuguese coach's first trophy since 2012 . Chelsea supporters see him differently, in awe as he added to his collection of trophies by hauling his team towards their first major honour of the new Mourinho era. This was a reminder of days gone by, taking those familiar with his career back to his goal for England in this stadium when he rose into the night sky to head home a David Beckham cross against Brazil in 2007. Those days are a distant memory and even England manager Roy Hodgson, admiring this performance from the stands, accepts that Terry will never play for the national side again. Everybody has moved on, and rightly so. He has played at the highest level and yet he reached new heights here, leading his team up the Wembley staircase and leading the celebrations when he collected the trophy. Dressed head to toe in Chelsea’s blue strip, Terry wouldn’t have it any other way.","Chelsea beat Tottenham 2-0 in the Capital One Cup final .

"Kevin Pietersen has reiterated his desire to play for England again after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves appeared to open the door on a shock return. Graves, who assumes the post in May, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the ‘first thing he’s got to do if he wants to get back is play county cricket’. Pietersen, sacked by England over a year ago, is currently unattached after leaving Surrey, but admitted he was ‘pleasantly surprised’ by Graves’s remarks. Pietersen told Sky Sports: ‘The previous chat was clearly that I had been banned from playing for England, which for me was incredibly sad because I do feel my career was cut short and taken away from me at 33.’ Kevin Pietersen has revealed he 'loves' playing for England and could be set for a return to the set up . Colin Graves has revealed that Pietersen will need to play country cricket if he's to play for England . A county stint would almost certainly mean Pietersen having to sacrifice one or both of his Twenty20 franchise deals in India and West Indies, but he insisted: ‘This is not a deal about money. This is about me playing cricket for England, doing something I love. I will have to go away and see where my future lies. But this is really encouraging.’ Graves was later reported as saying: ‘If he does that and scores a lot of runs they can’t ignore him, I would have thought, but that is up to him. Forget personalities. Selectors pick the best players in form. That is their job.' An ECB spokesman sought to clarify the comment, adding: ‘Nothing has changed — only players who are playing consistent high-quality county cricket and who are seen as a positive influence will be selected for England.’ Pietersen's contract with Surrey expired last year so he could go and play in the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash but it's unclear if he'll return to his former employers. Chairman Richard Thompson told Sportsmail: ‘Our understanding at the end of last summer was that Pietersen had no intention of playing red-ball cricket. If not, he will not play for Surrey.’ The batsman's contract with Surrey ended last year but it's unknown if he'll return his former club .","Kevin Pietersen admits he'd love to play cricket for England again .

"England are the embarrassment of the World Cup after a third humiliating defeat in three matches against Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Sportsmail's panel of experts — Nasser Hussain, David Lloyd, cricket correspondent Paul Newman and cricket writer and Wisden editor Lawrence Booth — discuss the big questions arising from another World Cup failure. England captain Eoin Morgan plays a shot during the World Cup match against Sri Lanka in Wellington . England Gary Ballance (front) loses his wicket to Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan during the World Cup match . Is there any hope left for England at this World Cup? Nasser Hussain: If there is, it's because of the ridiculous format of this tournament. They should beat Bangladesh and Afghanistan, but the best we can hope for is some one-off brilliance in the quarter-final. Paul Newman: You would think not and yet the flawed format still gives them every chance of facing India, a team they have beaten in their past two meetings, in a quarter-final in Melbourne. That should not be possible after the way England have stunk the tournament out. Lawrence Booth: The bare minimum for them was a quarter-final. Now, if either Bangladesh or Afghanistan have a good day, they may not even make that. They've had four years to prepare, yet look further off the pace than ever. David Lloyd: Realistically, no. It's sad to see so much effort going into plans and strategy that just do not fit in modern international cricket. I've never seen a team leave the ball so much in the one-day game. If there's any width other teams just whack it. Joe Root bats for England during their match against Sri Lanka at Wellington Regional Stadium . England have slumped to three straight World Cup defeats against Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka . Can anything be done in the short-term? Hussain: They need variety in their bowling, and a more attacking No 3. If they get through to a quarter-final on a drop-in wicket against India or South Africa, four 85mph right-arm seamers aren't going to surprise anyone. Ravi Bopara offers something different, and Tredwell is England's best off-spinner. And I'd get Hales in for Ballance. Newman: They must play Alex Hales. Why not? Gary Ballance should not be learning the ropes in the biggest limited-overs tournament of all. England just do not seem to rate Hales and if that is the case what is he doing here? If he does not play in Adelaide on Monday they might as well send him home. And get Jos Buttler in earlier. Leaving him just 19 balls against Sri Lanka was criminal. Booth: They've got to stop going on about stats, which mean little in the new era of fielding restrictions, and go for broke with players who scare the opposition. Hales springs to mind. They should also pick their best spinner, James Tredwell, because four right-arm seamers aren't doing the job. Lloyd: Hales can be brought in but don't expect him to start blasting it. If he was a success from the word go it would be a bonus. So many people in the game say he should have been in the 50-over team for the past 18 months! England batsman Jos Buttler ducks a delivery against Sri Lanka at the Wellington Regional Stadium . Sri Lanka batsman Lahiru Thirimanne (left) dives to make his crease just in time against England . And what about the long-term? Hussain: There's no easy fix. But I wish selectors would show faith in their one-day players like in Test cricket: look at how they backed Joe Root. Give Hales 20 one- dayers to see what he's made of. Newman: Rip it up and start again. England need to work towards as separate a one-day team as possible, leaving Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, to name two, to focus on Tests. Bring in the likes of Sam Billings, Jason Roy and Ben Stokes and keep them together, ideally under a different coach working on modern limited-overs skills. Perhaps Paul Farbrace, who won the Asia Cup and World T20 with Sri Lanka, could step up while Peter Moores concentrates on Tests. I know split coaches didn't work last time but England prioritised Test cricket then. They have to give equal billing to 50 and 20-over cricket from now. Booth: England have to accept, finally, that the game has changed, and back more youngsters — the likes of Roy and James Vince. But the problem runs deeper: England is inherently a Test nation. Until they take 50-over cricket seriously, they'll always flop at World Cups. Lloyd: England need to show imagination in selection. Think about the words 'dynamic' and 'power' and pick the team accordingly. I'll throw in three names: Stokes, Roy and Adil Rashid. I'd implore England to look at how other teams are doing it — people like Aussie Glenn Maxwell, Corey Anderson of New Zealand and the dynamic Australian duo of David Warner and Aaron Finch. They show absolutely no fear at all. Sam Billings (pictured in January 2015) has been backed by Paul Newman to help reinvent the England set-up . 24-year-old Jason Roy (pictured playing for Surrey in June 2014), is another name being mooted for England . What do you think of Eoin Morgan as captain? Hussain: I've been disappointed with the way he's become infected with management-speak. Here's a player whose flair and inventiveness made him what he is. Instead, he's talking about statistics. But you do need a plan, and a captain's only as good as his bowling attack. Newman: Disappointing so far. Still looks out of form with the bat, hasn't been the pro-active, imaginative leader we hoped and seems to be in denial. He should be criticised for playing in the IPL rather than leading England against Ireland in May. If he doesn't want the captaincy, give it to Root. Booth: He has a bit more about him tactically than Alastair Cook. Morgan was given just the tri-series in Australia to prepare. What did the ECB expect? Lloyd: I like Morgan immensely but I shudder at the interviews he's giving. He's just talking statistics all the time! Forget stats — if we've got the players to make an impact, let them play in a different style, on instinct. He must also show more imagination in the field. Morgan's form for England has come under particular scrutiny during England's woeful World Cup campaign . Does Moores still have much to prove as coach? Hussain: Yes, lots. He's partly a victim of England's one-day struggles, but it's a worry to see some players going backwards. Turning round the Test series against India was to his credit, but he'll be judged on the rest of this World Cup and the Ashes later this year. Newman: I so want him to succeed, but there are worrying signs he looks out of his depth at international level. The players seem to like and respect him but he does not seem to be inspiring them. Booth: He has everything to prove. He was lucky to be re-appointed and results have mainly been poor. He inherited a shambles but at some point that stops being relevant. Lloyd: Peter is ageing by the day. I hope he is looking at what other coaches like Darren Lehmann and Mike Hesson are doing with Australia and New Zealand. Don't have any regard for reputations — swing from the hip. England's disappointing World Cup has raised questions over the future of coach Peter Moores . Can Kevin Pietersen really play for England again? Hussain: I've always believed in picking the best side, then man-managing it. But I feel there's too much baggage with KP now. Also, he's not the player he once was. If he was 24, rather than 34, you might give him another go. But the focus should be on England's one-day team, not Pietersen. Newman: Well, what a can of worms incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves opened. The suggestion is that nothing has changed regarding Pietersen but Graves' clumsy words undermined the management while the ECB's attempt to distance themselves from his comments by talking about 'positive influences' just made it worse. Booth: Would he really have saved England at the World Cup? He played nine ODIs in 2013 and averaged 28. And he'll be 35 soon. I loved watching him, but let's not pretend he's a panacea. Lloyd: If it is going to happen Kevin must be playing county cricket — red-ball and white-ball. If he commits to the English game and scores heavily then he should be back in the mix. Whether or not Kevin Pietersen should return to the England set-up remains a hotly contested debate .

"Batsman Joe Root feels England need to make a convincing statement that they belong in the World Cup quarter-finals when they meet Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their final two group games. England must win both matches, against lower-ranked opponents, to have any chance of reaching the knockout stage. An early exit looms large after Sunday's nine-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka in Wellington followed wide-margin beatings by co-hosts Australia and New Zealand. Joe Root has insisted that England must succeed in securing convincing victories in their next two games . Root snicks a ball down fine leg during England's defeat by Sri Lanka in their previous World Cup match . That has piled the pressure on, albeit in two games Root points out that England would have needed to win in any circumstance. 'If you play those two games at the start of the competition you still have to win them,' Root said. 'The way our schedule is, we have these games towards the end. If it was broken up a bit more it might look slightly different. 'But it doesn't take away from the fact that we want to win these two games convincingly.' England's hastened need to restore confidence is underlined by the fact that should they reach the last-eight they will now most likely play the highest-ranked team in Pool B. That will almost certainly be either South Africa or world champions India, who England did beat twice during the Tri-Series leading up to the World Cup. 'We don't want to just scrape through - we want to put in some really good performances and put to bed some of the things we've got wrong so far,' Root added. England captain Eoin Morgan was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the World Cup . Sangakkar and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket wi . 'We know that if we get through to the quarter-finals we'll be in a position where we have nothing to lose. 'There will be sides coming up against us who could potentially be quite timid and think they should beat us and that could work in our favour. 'By the time you get to that stage it's crunch time and every side is under pressure; not just us. Hopefully we can get those wins and build some momentum.' Root believes the gap between England and the best teams at the World Cup is not as large as their heavy defeats would suggest. 'I don't think that's fair,' he said. 'Yes, we have been beaten heavily in those three games, but I don't think that we are that far away from beating those sides. 'If we get the best out of every individual and all play as well as we can then we are just as good as sides like that if not better. It's about making sure, for the next two games especially, that we turn up and do everything we possibly can to put those performances in. 'That's got to come from the individuals to make sure they front up. Not just the senior players; not just exciting young players coming into the side. From everyone.' Root hit a career-best 121 from 108 balls against Sri Lanka but England's bowlers couldn't match his exploits . Steven Finn and James Taylor show their disappointment after England's third loss of the tournament . Root stood up to be counted in the Sri Lanka defeat when the 24-year-old became England's young World Cup centurion. His career-best 121 from 108 balls inspired England to a formidable 309 for six - the second successive match they had passed 300 - only for the bowlers to lack any penetration as twin tons from Lahiru Thirimanne and Kumar Sangakkara eased Sri Lanka to victory in 16 balls. 'At the start of the day, if you'd given us 310 we'd have thought that a very good effort,' Root said. 'Whenever you get 310 on the board you are immediately putting sides under pressure to chase it. Unfortunately we didn't create that pressure with the ball and we didn't do anything to make it difficult for them from 10 overs onwards.' The ease of Sri Lanka's chase suggested England did not set their sights high enough and, while Root admitted more risks can be taken with the bat, they had left Sri Lanka with a record chase at the ground. 'There was no feeling turning up to the game that 270 was a par score,' he said. 'We got out there, we played it as we saw it, there were periods when Sri Lanka bowled really well at us. We got 310 which, on that wicket, I felt was a good score. 'In one-day cricket maybe we could have taken a few more risks, potentially we could have gone a bit earlier at them, be more aggressive earlier. But it's a fine balance. If you then lose two wickets - on that wicket, we'd done well to get to where we were. 'Unfortunately we couldn't quite create the pressure with the ball that they did. We weren't disciplined enough and we leaked too many boundaries.'","England have lost heavily to Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka .

"Even when England put what looks like a challenging score on the board they are still brushed aside with contemptuous ease. Not for the first time in this World Cup they seemed like boys in the men’s world of modern one-day cricket. Sri Lanka, with the imperious Kumar Sangakkara to the fore, cruised to their target of 310 here in such a ridiculously easy manner that England appeared just as far away from competing in this tournament as they did when they were thrashed by Australia and New Zealand. It is frightening how far away England seem from the real challengers in this World Cup, astonishing how far they have been left behind in 50-over cricket since they should have won the Champions Trophy less than two years ago.

Thirimanne is almost down on one knee during his knock as he celebrates with Sangakkara (right) England should still reach the quarter-finals – and that in itself tells you all you need to know about the flawed format of this tournament – but it simply seems a matter of time before they are put out of their misery and sent home. The stark reality is that they need to beat Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their last two group games to advance to the last eight and while they should still do that it is fanciful to expect them to defeat anyone of note. England now need to win their next five games to lift the World Cup when they have won just seven of their last 24 one-day internationals. Even winning two on the bounce has proved beyond them in that time, let alone five. As ever it is the hope that gets you. When England had scored 309 for six they looked favourites at a Westpac Stadium where Tim Southee had destroyed them with swing when they were last here just nine days ago. But that was to overlook the sheer quality and experience of the Sri Lankan batting. They defeated England in all formats last summer and thrashed them in a one-day series before Christmas. Here they confirmed their superiority with a masterful display of one-day batting to romp home with 16 balls and nine wickets to spare. England simply never looked like containing nor dismissing them. England, desperate not to be seen to be chopping and changing again, kept faith with Gary Ballance but he looked even more rusty and nervy than in his three previous failures and it was no surprise when he fell cheaply again. England are adamant that Ballance, who averages over 50 in domestic one-day cricket, can be just as effective in the 50-over game as he is in Test cricket but the trouble is that he is trying to establish himself during a World Cup. James Taylor drops a catch on the boundary as England failed to build on their score in Wellington . England captain Eoin Morgan was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the World Cup . Sangakkar and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket wi . It is another indictment of England’s long-term one-day strategy that they threw Ballance into this side on the eve of the World Cup and it would appear they have no choice but to throw him out again. If Alex Hales, who England seem so reluctant to pick, does not play next week against Bangladesh in Adelaide then he really should despair about ever breaking into the 50-over side. England made a great start, reaching 62 after nine overs, but they ran into trouble when they resorted to their old-fashioned habit of consolidating in the middle overs when they lost Moeen Ali, Ballance and Ian Bell within 11 overs. It may seem harsh to criticise England when they have ended up scoring more than 300 but the one-day game has progressed so rapidly that you just cannot afford to score at four an over for 10 overs as England did here. The pace was picked up by the impressive Root, who has that knack of compiling run a ball hundreds in one-day cricket before stepping it up with the sort of improvised, expansive shots that have became simply integral. It was when James Taylor joined Root, and then when Jos Buttler was finally let loose for the last four overs, that it was possible to see a future where England really could compete with the big boys. Root, dropped on 17 at slip by Mahela Jayawardene, was superb in reaching 121 off 108 balls, with two sixes, as England accelerated against some indisciplined bowling, 164 coming off the last 20 overs, 106 off the last 10. Joe Root was at least one bright spot for England as he hit 121 off 108 balls including two sixes . Root celebrates with his team-mate James Taylor after reaching a century against Sri Lanka . The impressive Yorkshireman is the youngest Englishman, at 24, to score a World Cup century and upon him rest so many hopes over the next 10 years in all forms of cricket. He will be captain in all three forms before too long. The hapless Thisara Perera disappeared for 25 off the 45th over and was then hit for another boundary when he had to complete an over for Rangana Herath when he was struck on the finger by Buttler. Buttler was struck himself first ball when a nasty bouncer from Lasith Malinga thudded into his helmet but he recovered his poise to hit a quite brilliant unbeaten 39 from 19 balls. One of the many things that England need to improve in one-day cricket is making sure Buttler gets to the crease much earlier. When Suranga Lakmal was banished from the attack after bowling two high full tosses in the last over Sri Lanka speared to be wilting and they had been forced to use five bowlers to deliver the last 13 balls of the innings. Sri Lanka fans were in full voice as they watched their side ease to victory over England . Morgan talks to bowlers Steven Finn and James Anderson as England struggled against Sri Lanka . Fat chance. England perhaps had their opportunity when Root dropped Lahiru Thirimanne on three off Stuart Broad but from then on, with England failing to locate the swing that Southee gained here at the Westpac Stadium to take seven English wickets, it was all one-day traffic. Once Sangakkara joined Thirimanne the game was effectively over as the pair put on an unbeaten 210 after the loss of Tillekeratne Dilshan and only faltered when Thirimanne offered what looked like a simple chance on 98 but Moeen Ali did not even get a hand on it. It said everything about England’s plight. When Sangakkara, in his 401st one-day international, reached his 23rd century off just 70 balls Sri Lanka’s triumph was almost complete and England’s misery was acute. He really is a true great of the game and Surrey’s gain next summer will be Sri Lanka’s loss. England now slope off to Adelaide and face a long week of soul-searching before they meet Bangladesh. There is much to contemplate. Both in the immediate future and in the long-term in this form of the game.","England made  309 for 6 in their 50 overs which looked a good score .

"Kevin Pietersen has a vocal supporter in fellow former England captain Geoff Boycott as he clings to renewed hope that he might yet play international cricket again. New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves has provided the first hint that Pietersen could resume a career which reached an apparently irrevocable full stop when he was sacked 13 months ago. Pietersen was in optimistic mood again on Monday that an unlikely reconciliation could be achieved, tweeting: 'Incredibly humbling how supportive you've all been since the news broke yesterday from Mr Colin Graves. Gonna try work this out for sure!' Kevin Pietersen has made no secret of his desire to return to the England setup but it seems unlikey . Indications in the 24 hours since Graves' BBC interview appear to have been less encouraging for the exiled 34-year-old batsman. The ECB issued a statement on Sunday, insisting 'nothing has changed' in his status and adding 'only players who are playing consistent high-quality county cricket and who are seen as a positive influence will be selected for England'. But BBC pundit Boycott has called for face-to-face discussions in which the governing body is 'fair' to Pietersen and does not 'lead him on' without a true intention to recall him as long as he plays well. He also suggested that, if key personalities such as ECB managing director Paul Downton and national selector James Whitaker disagree with Graves, they should leave their jobs. Graves stressed the pre-requisite of any conceivable progress must be a return to county cricket, something Pietersen's summer Twenty20 contracts in the Indian and Caribbean premier leagues will hardly help. New ECB chairman Colin Graves suggested over the weekend the door could still be open for Pietersen . His involvement in English domestic cricket for Surrey last summer was fleeting - exclusively in the NatWest t20 Blast - following his sacking by England. Downton has spoken on several occasions since then of the record-breaking batsman's apparent 'disengagement' with his team-mates while England were losing the final 2013/14 Ashes Test in Sydney by 281 runs. Surrey de-registered Pietersen at the end of last season, and are not publicly inclined to reopen negotiations. Boycott has identified clear communication between Pietersen and Graves as the starting point to ensure no new stumbling blocks are created. He told the BBC: 'It says to me that Kevin needs to get a meeting with Colin Graves as soon as he can - and, preferably, with Paul Downton and James Whitaker there after he has spoken to the chairman - because he wants to be clear. New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves wants Pietersen (right) to play county cricket . 'It's all right the chairman saying he has to play county cricket. But if he does that and gives up a lucrative IPL contract and Downton and Whitaker are still not going to pick him, that's kind of like leading him on isn't it? And that's not fair. 'It needs to be put clear to him that if he plays well in county cricket then there's going to be a genuine - and I mean the word genuine - change of heart and change of opinion that he is going to be open for selection and that they are going to put bygones to one side. 'I don't think that it is fair to ask anybody to give up an IPL contract - because that's all he has. 'He only has Twenty20 around the world.' Boycott senses Downton and Whitaker could even be expendable, if there is a difference of opinion on Pietersen between them and former Yorkshire chairman Graves. He added: 'If Whitaker and Downton can't accept a change of plan or opinion from the chairman then they have to resign, don't they? Former England captain Geoff Boycott has warned the ECB to not 'lead on' Pietersen over a possible return . 'It's simple. They have to do what the chairman tells them, or go. 'We need to listen to our chairman from Yorkshire. He is no fool. He is very quiet and a nice man - but underneath he has got some steel about him.' There was, understandably, little engagement in the Pietersen topic from former team-mate Joe Root who has more pressing issues to confront in Australia and New Zealand as England try to stay in the World Cup after three defeats in four matches. Root is tipped by many as a future England captain, however, and opinions such as his could yet be pivotal to Pietersen's chances of a recall. He made it clear Pietersen is hardly uppermost in his mind at present, but also that he has a good working relationship with the South Africa-born batsman. Kevin Pietersen (left) has recently been playing for the Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash competition . 'We're in the middle of the World Cup, and there's plenty of other stuff we need to be focusing on,' said Root. 'He doesn't really enter that. I've no problems with Kev. I've not spoken to him for a while, but he seems to be doing okay.' Pietersen, meanwhile, intends to seek an audience with Graves - well aware he and his advisers must somehow try to resurrect a county career before they can think about any more glory days with England. His world-class standing means he can command a budget-busting salary, but if he finds himself in a position where he needs a county contract at all costs, he could perhaps be re-entering a buyer's market. He closed his Monday tweet with a 'peace' motif - but it will surely be a vexed process if he is to get his wish.","Kevin Pietersen admits he'd love to play cricket for England again .

"Former England spinner Graeme Swann has called on the England and Wales Cricket Board to realise their approach is 'out of date', saying that there is a 'stubbornness' about their selection policy and that they are 'living in the past'. Swann watched on as England slumped to another heavy World Cup loss, with Sri Lanka chasing down their 309 for six with ease, winning with nine wickets and 16 balls to spare. The defeat goes alongside reverses against Australia and New Zealand, with Scotland the only team England have beaten so far. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cricket World Cup Highlights: England vs Sri Lanka . Former England spinner Graeme Swann (pictured in 2013) has hit out at the England and Wales Cricket Board . Wins over Afghanistan and Bangladesh would take them to the quarter-finals, but Swann thinks the problems are evident. Writing on Twitter, he said: 'A positive thing that can come of this world cup is that maybe the top brass will realise just how out of date our approach is.' Swann also aired his views on BBC Radio 5 Live, adding that England had been overly pleased to get what he considered to be an average score. 'I think the problem lies not just with the bowling but the whole approach. It was a very self-congratulatory 310, everyone was saying 'brilliant'. These days that's about average and not a great score,' he said. 'We should be looking for 340, 350; The difference between the top teams and everyone else is immense. They're saying the is the limit when you bat, we're still looking at par scores.' Swann feels the answer could lie with former Nottinghamshire team-mate Alex Hales. 'There's a bit of stubbornness about the selection policy,' he added. 'I like Gary Ballance, he's a great lad, but I think even he'd admit that he shouldn't be in the team at the minute, he's in horrible form. 'We have a lad in Alex Hales, one of these new generation players who does go out and knock it about, he tries to smash everything for four and six. 'We need to get these young lads playing. We have too many people running it, too many people involved, too many plans and I think we're just living in the past.'

Former England captain Michael Vaughan added: 'We are watching a era of Cricket where if you are predictable you will end up with a predictable outcome.' Another ex-England player, Geoffrey Boycott, said the England team were not being realistic. Boycott has long spoken his mind about the national team's woes, and though he conceded to some positives, he sees plenty of work to be done. He told BBC 5 Live: 'I do think we could have got another 20-odd runs, there was a period where we were just cantering around. We are not a force to be reckoned with at all. 'The batting was quite good, but the bowling? No, no, sorry. It wasn't very challenging. 'They're not bad players, we don't have a bad side at all. But we're not firing on all cylinders in any department whatsoever. 'The sad thing for me, even Joe Root, (he gave) a nice interview, lovely lad, but there's no realism. They keep telling us 'we'll take the positives, we did well, we did this'. 'They are trying to tell us little things and we don't see them. They think ex-players like us are just watching to criticise, we're not, we want you to win. 'But we can only tell you what we see and you keep losing.' Opinions also reigned in from other nations, with ex-Australia spinner Shane Warne saying on Twitter: 'Broad & Anderson are averaging 80 with the ball you can't defend any total, also lacking fire power with bat.'

"Former England captain Michael Vaughan has challenged Kevin Pietersen to prove he wants to play for England by turning his back on the Indian Premier League and playing county cricket. Pietersen was axed from the England set-up in February last year in the aftermath of the 5-0 Ashes series defeat to Australia, but was given hope of a possible return by incoming chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, Colin Graves. Graves said in a recent BBC Radio 5 Sportsweek interview that Pietersen, who left Surrey last autumn, has to play county cricket if he harbours any hopes of an England return and Vaughan agrees with this viewpoint. There have been calls for Kevin Pietersen to return to the England fold following World Cup struggles . Former England captain Michael Vaughan has challenged Pietersen to prove his loyalty by playing county cricket next summer instead of chasing the big dollars in T20 tournaments . 'You say it for a while you want to play for England - prove it!' he told BBC Radio 5 Live. 'Give up your IPL deal, go and play for, say, Surrey - freezing cold away at Derby.' Vaughan added: 'If Kevin is going to do exactly what he's been saying and he's desperate to play (for England), he will play county cricket and I will pretty much guarantee that he will score plenty of runs doing it.' Pietersen was in optimistic mood on Monday that an unlikely reconciliation may be achieved, tweeting: 'Incredibly humbling how supportive you've all been since the news broke yesterday from Mr Colin Graves.

"A compensation payout should cover future medical costs and living expenses, not go towards paying for four TV sets, a pool table, a ride-on mower, a gaming machine, model cars, and fishing gear. This never dawned on a Canberra man who was awarded more than $1 million in worker's compensation and spent almost all of it on these luxury items in just four months. But now after blowing the cash he wants welfare too. 9 News' A Current Affair programme told the tale of Jason Cooper a former tiler who was placed on a Disability Support Pension and eventually awarded damages totalling $1,025,000. Scroll down for video . An elaborate gaming machine is one of the luxury gifts Jason Cooper bought himself . The Canberra man bought a beachfront house near Bateman's Bay on the NSW south coast for $410,000 . It all began at an NRL footy match in 2006, where the Canberra Raiders were leading the Brisbane Broncos 14-6 at the break. But things took a turn for the worse at Canberra Stadium during a half-time promotional competition. Mr Cooper was one of a few spectators chosen to take part in a competition where they had to catch a ball in a milk crate to win a prize, however he received spinal injuries during the event that he said prevented him from ever working again. He received a payout of $1.025 million. After receiving his payout, Mr Cooper bought a three bedroom house near Bateman's Bay on the NSW south coast worth more than $400,000. A large selection of classic model cars was another expense that Mr Cooper splashed out on . A new ride-on lawnmower made gardening a little easier for him . Mr Cooper also has an impressive collection of classic model sports cars . Centrelink said he could not access welfare until late 2017 because of his huge payout . The main problem was that he blew the rest in four months on a variety of personal items, and now believes he's now entitled to welfare. A Current Affair confronted Mr Cooper about his purchases, and he denied any wrongdoing. '""So I bought a house for $410,000. You want me to go spend it on alcohol or drugs or gamble it away?' he told the interviewer. 'A bloke got $3 million, mate, and blew it all away.' As well as substantial legal fees that were taken out of his payment he also blames his financial mismanagement on not being able to access internet banking to monitor his spending.

He went to the administrative appeals tribunal to have the ruling overturned but they told him his purchases were ‘unwise, irresponsible and unnecessary decisions’. Lawyer Sam Macedoni told A Current Affair that Mr Cooper failed to structure his compensation payout to provide for his future needs. 'Some of it is for medical expenses, some of it is for income you won't be able to earn and some for other reasons, so you just can't go and blow it,' Mr Macedoni said.

"He is notorious for remaining tight-lipped about his personal life in interviews. And last night Davis Cup team-mate Dominic Inglot must have hoped Andy Murray would extend the same privacy to his fellow players. Asked by Eurosport presenter Annabel Croft how the team would celebrate following victory over the United States, Murray was quick to point out that his 29-year-old team-mate has a ‘little girlfriend on the go here in Glasgow’. Quiet Andy! Murray, far left, with Anabel Croft, his brother Jamie, centre, and a mortifies Dominic Inglot . Tweet: Dominic Inglot appeared eager to set the record straight on Twitter following Murray's joke . Unfortunately for Inglot, he already has a girlfriend of six months at home in London. When asked for the name of the lady in question, a mortified Inglot replied: ‘You’ve actually landed me in this. Because I actually have a girlfriend that’s going to be watching this.’ The jokey stitch-up left Murray in hysterics as the team sheepishly shuffled away from the disastrous interview. A source close to the team last night explained that Murray was unaware Inglot has a girlfriend in London and did not know that the joke would backfire on his team mate. But a spokesperson for the Lawn Tennis Association last night dismissed the stitch-up as ‘pure banter’. Laura Lord of the LTA said it was ‘just a bunch of guys messing around’.

"Captain Eoin Morgan will not entertain thoughts of a premature World Cup exit even though a nine-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka left England on the brink of disaster. England suffered yet more pain at the Wellington Regional Stadium as centuries from Lahiru Thirimanne and Kumar Sangakkara inspired a record pursuit of 309 for six. Defeat leaves England needing to beat lower-ranked Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their remaining pool games and, even then, it might not be enough to keep them alive. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cricket World Cup Highlights: England vs Sri Lanka . Eoin Morgan talks to the press after another disappointing defeat for England at the Cricket World Cup . Kumar Sangakkara (centre) hit 117 not out and, alongside Lahiru Thirimanne, put England to the sword . Morgan was not willing to consider the prospect, however, of an early flight home after his side's third loss in four games at the tournament. 'It's not even a thought at the moment,' he said. 'Two games to win to get us into a quarter-final.' Morgan's side never got going in both of those games, but after Joe Root's career-best 121 had put England in the box seat at the half-way stage, the bowlers posed little threat as Thirimanne and Sangakkara embarked on an unbeaten 212-run stand to coast home with 16 balls in hand. 'It definitely is harder to take,' Morgan said. 'When you don't turn up for a race like those first two games it's scratched. Today when we turn up and we're beaten in the fashion we were is harder to take.' One-day captain Morgan (centre) leads England off the pitch in Wellington after their nine-wicket defeat . Thirimanne (left) and Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka to a comfortable win over England in New Zealand . Morgan bemoaned a bowling performance in which he claimed England simply bowled too many bad balls. Thirimanne certainly agreed, after he had suggested in his earlier press conference that batting against England's bowlers had been 'very easy'. The opener was asked to compare England's attack to Afghanistan, who almost pulled off a stunning win over Sri Lanka earlier in the tournament, and said: 'To be honest that day Afghanistan's bowlers did really well but there was a little bit for the seamers. 'Today it was very easy for me to be honest.' Morgan was at a loss to explain why his bowlers were so ineffective and will wait to see a statistical breakdown of England's bowling performance in the next couple of days when they will take time off after flying to Adelaide. Thirimanne plays a shot on the way to scoring a century as Sri Lanka made light work of England's bowlers . Thirimanne is almost down on one knee during his knock (left) as he celebrates with Sangakkara (right) 'No. I don't have a theory yet,' he said. 'We bowled a lot of bad balls. Over the next couple of days we'll get the HawkEye stuff back and the proof will be in that. My feeling is we bowled a lot of bad balls.' The skipper denied that the England attack was too predictable in the light of Thirimanne's observations, adding: 'In terms of being too predictable you look at the best sides and they're predictably good. When we're firing we are predictably good. 'We've got two tall guys who are effective, they've got pace and bounce, and two guys who swing the ball and Moeen who does his job. 'When we bowl well we put sides under pressure and create opportunities - today we didn't.' Root celebrates  after reaching a century against Sri Lanka, but it wasn't enough to secure a win for England . Morgan, post-match, did not entertain thoughts of an early exit, instead remaining confident of progression . England were not helped by missing opportunities in the field, most significantly when Root grassed a chance at first slip off Stuart Broad when Thirimanne was on just three. The Sri Lanka openers then put on a century stand to pave the way for a chase that easily broke the previous record at the ground - 254 for four achieved by South Africa against New Zealand three years ago. 'You can talk about the chances we put down. Thirimanne was one,' Morgan said. 'It would have brought Sangakkara to the wicket earlier with more chance of him getting out. He played well. He came in an ideal situation.' England have now been soundly beaten by the three sides ranked higher than them in the group and, should they reach the knockout stages, there is apparently a large gap to be bridged if they are to make any impression. 'Losing any game is always a concern,' Morgan added. James Taylor drops a catch on the boundary as England failed to build on their score in Wellington . Sangakkara and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket win . 'Over the next few days, we'll have them off, and then we'll reconvene. Me and Mooresy will have a sit down along with the backroom staff and debrief the game and see where we've gone wrong and how we can get better.' Morgan is confident, though, that he will have no problem in lifting his young squad who now have an eight-day gap to stew over their latest defeat before they meet Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval. 'It's not a big deal getting those guys up,' he said. 'It's a World Cup everybody is like a kid at Christmas, they want to play and they want to win. That part of it is easy. 'It's simple things moving forward. I keep banging on about them because we haven't done them so far this World Cup. 'The simpler we keep it moving forward, the more obvious what we do or have to do over the next 10 days. That will be the message from me to the players.'","Sri Lanka beat England by nine wickets at the Cricket World Cup .

Jose Mourinho lifts his third Capital One Cup for Chelsea after the Blues beat Tottenham 2-0 at Wembley . Mourinho rang his wife immediately after the match to inform her of the good news that Chelsea won . ‘I rang my wife,’ an emotional Mourinho explained. ‘She didn’t know the result. I had my son and my daughter here, but my wife was at home and didn’t know the score until I called.’ Mourinho, who was winning his seventh trophy with Chelsea and the 21st of a remarkable career, admitted lifting the League Cup made him feel like a kid again. ‘For me, it’s important to feel that I’m a kid,’ he said. ‘Before the game I had the same feelings as my first final however many years ago. The Portuguese manager roars with delight as he lifts the Capital One Cup for Chelsea on Sunday . ‘It’s important to feel the same happiness after the victory, and to feel a kid at 52-years-old. ‘I know I have a team to build, which is what we’re doing, but it’s difficult for me to live without titles, even with all the work that we are doing to be stable. I need to feed myself with titles. ‘In this country it’s much more difficult to win than in my first period.’ Mourinho stopped his players from reacting to City’s defeat against Liverpool so they could concentrate fully on the Wembley final. The Blues boss posed for fans as he walked onto the pitch with the Capital One Cup trophy . He said: ’I prepared the players for an impossible mission, which was not knowing the City result. Forget City. I knew that was an impossible mission, but I didn’t want the television on in the hotel or on the bus. ‘I told them I didn’t want any kind of manifestation or disappointment if City scored in the last minute, or Liverpool won. I wanted complete silence. We were successful on that. ‘But one member of my staff, Silvinho, jumped up in the bus. I wanted to kill the guy. He broke the rule.’ Chelsea striker Diego Costa celebrates his deflected strike, which made it 2-0 for the Blues . John Terry fires Chelsea ahead just before the half-time whistle as the Blues triumphed against Tottenham . Nemanja Matic, suspended for the final, then gave the pre-match speech to his team-mates. ‘He made the speech in the dressing room expressing his pain not to be playing, and asking the players to express the pleasure he couldn’t have to play this final,’ Mourinho revealed. Kurt Zouma was chosen as Matic’s replacement and played alongside Ramires in defensive midfield. Mourinho called him ‘our new Marcel Desailly’ and added: ‘We were preparing a bit, now and again, in some exercises for him to play that role in an emergency, and the kid did a fantastic job for us.’ Mourinho's son, Jose Jr (front), celebrates the Capital One Cup final triumph for Chelsea at Wembley .","Capital One Cup triumph his seventh trophy as Chelsea manager .

"England's hopes of winning the Grand Slam is over after being comfortably beaten by Ireland in Dublin - who themselves moved to the top of the Six Nations standings and put themselves in pole position. Robbie Henshaw scored the only try of the game and Jonny Sexton kicked four penalties and a conversion as the Irish dominated Stuart Lancaster's side for most of the game. But the star was scrum half Conor Murray who terrorised his opponents with his clever kicking and quick thinking passing. Conor Murray (cetre) was the star for Ireland during their win over England in the Six Nations clash . IRELAND . Rob Kearney – 6.5 . Made a couple of important tackles when England threatened out wide, but not a major presence in attack. Tommy Bowe – 6 . Ireland didn’t play expansively so he was quite peripheral. One glaring fumble but largely tidy in defence . Jared Payne – 6 . Another who didn’t have much of an opportunity to run with the ball but he tackled and competed at rucks with gusto. Robbie Henshaw – 8 . He had already shown great courage and commitment over the ball, before his brilliant try settled the match. Robbie Henshaw (left) collects the high ball to score Ireland's only try in their victory over England . Simon Zebo – 7 . Soon set his stall out with swerving runs. Superb in the air; with one brilliant leaping catch above several opponents. Jonathan Sexton – 7.5 . Eventually withdrew injured but pulled the strings with typical authority and quick off the line in defence. Conor Murray – 9 . Enhanced reputation as one of the world’s best scrum halves. His kicking tormented England and one fine break early in the second half. Murray's kicking and passing game troubled the English throughout as he showed why he's rated so highly . Jack McGrath – 6.5 . He was asked to once again fill Cian Healy’s berth at loosehead prop and he did not disappoint as a physical deputy. Rory Best – 9 . The Ulster hooker is a stalwart of this team and was superb. Efficient at lineout, nearly scored early on and a ruck colossus. Mike Ross – 7 . England would have hoped to gain an advantage in the scrum, but the Leinster tighthead ensured that didn’t happen. Devin Toner – 6.5 . One crucial lineout steal in the first half. Eclipsed by his second-row partner around the field but a solid effort. Paul O’Connell – 8 . Another giant display by the veteran Lion. He kept carrying hard throughout and was a towering figurehead. Jonny Sexton kicked four penalties and a conversion to help the Irish seal their place at the top of table . Peter O’Mahony – 7 . The Munster flanker offered his side the abrasive, unglamourous work they needed to gain the edge up front. Jordi Murphy – 7 . Impressive over the ball despite conceding early penalty. Not a prominent ball-carrier, but played his part in momentous win. Sean O’Brien – 6 . Went off before the half-hour and seemed to be concussed after a strong drive out of defence. Good early impact. Replacements . S Cronin 6, C Healy 6, M Moore 6.5, I Henderson 6, T O’Donnell 6.5, I Madigan 5, F Jones 6. ENGLAND . Alex Goode – 7 . Composed under high ball, showed intent to run from deep, good escape from behind own line but beaten to kick for Henshaw try. Anthony Watson – 5 . Missed early high kicks and struggled in the air. Made one blistering run from deep but spoiled it with wild off-load. Jonathan Joseph – 6 . After two glorious performances, this wasn't his day. No chances to cut loose but he kept looking for work. Luther Burrell – 6.5 . Prevented Best from scoring a try amid early siege and often carried strongly in midfield to give his side momentum. Jack Nowell – 7 . Energetic and committed, couple of good kick-and-chase efforts and late on he threatened the Irish defence, to no avail. Jack Nowell (right) was England's best performer in a disappointing performance in Dublin . George Ford – 6 . Conceded turnover in the first minute and blew hot and cold from then on. Some nice touches but some lapses too. Ben Youngs – 6 . Looked bright and dangerous for a spell during the first half but couldn’t match Murray’s impact with testing box-kicks. Joe Marler – 6.5 . Heavily involved. Forceful hits, a few effective carries and strong over the ball, to continue his fine Test form. Dylan Hartley – 6 . His lineout throwing went awry a couple of times in the first half but he was full of intensity around the field. George Ford (left) kicked three penalties for the away side but he struggled with lapses in concentration . Dan Cole – 6 . One barnstorming charge late on, but by and large the Leicester prop was occupied with desperate fire-fighting up front. Dave Attwood – 7 . Prominent with early carries, aggressive in defence and showed staggering work-rate, especially during the first half. George Kruis – 5.5 . Kept trying in vain to pressurise the Irish kickers. Not among the leading carriers and quieter than in previous games. James Haskell – 6 . Strong defensive presence early on and he made the Irish fight for every yard, but a limited breakdown presence. Dave Attwood (centre) also gave a solid performance and showed terrific tenacity and fight . Billy Vunipola – 6.5 . As with earlier matches, he grew into it as time went on, after a slow start. Was at full throttle in the final quarter. Chris Robshaw – 6 . Not his best game. Conceded penalty in first minute, a fumble later and couldn’t impose order amid hasty chaos. Replacements . T Youngs 6.5, M Vunipola 7, N Easter 6.5, T Croft 6, R Wigglesworth 7, B Twelvetrees 6.","Ireland comfortably beat England 19-9 at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin .

"Chelsea won their first trophy since the return of Jose Mourinho on Sunday as they got the better of Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final.

"Emotional France coach Philippe Saint-Andre has launched a scathing attack on his own players following Saturday's lackluster 20-13 defeat to Wales in the Six Nations, saying the team has become 'the Father Christmas of international rugby' because it gives away so many points. His voice trembling with emotion, Saint-Andre looked on the verge of tears Sunday as he made it clear he feels extremely let down. 'International rugby is about combat, humility. But above all it's a collective sport. We don't need starlets,' he said.' In rugby, the team is the star and we need champions. Yesterday, I didn't see any champions, or not many.' Saint-Andre looked on the verge of tears Sunday as he made it clear he feels extremely let down . Brice Dulin scores a try for France during the RBS Six Nations match against Wales at the Stade de France . France, which has lost its past four games to Wales in the tournament, lost 18-11 to Ireland and narrowly beat Scotland at home in its opener. Next up is a tricky away match in Italy followed by a full-blooded showdown with England at Twickenham. Flyhalf Camille Lopez was particularly poor, missing two of his four penalty kicks - and Yoann Huget's first-half try was ruled out because of Lopez's careless forward pass. 'For my part, I don't think I played badly,' a defiant Lopez said. 'I tried different things ... Let's keep on daring.' France's scrum-half Sebastien Tillous-Borde is joined by the rest of his dejected teammates at full time . His attitude may not have pleased Saint-Andre, who is likely to make sweeping changes for the game against Italy in two weeks' time. Asked if some players are now playing for their futures, six months ahead of the World Cup, Saint-Andre replied with an emphatic 'yes' - although he stopped short of saying some would never play for France again under his leadership. 'I only want players who are ready to go to the end of the world. If anyone thinks that international rugby is too difficult, then they have my telephone number,' he said. 'They can call me and I'll take someone else. I'll even take a 20-year-old lad who's never played in the Top 14 (French league) before.' Morgan Parra  in action during the RBS Six Nations rugby match between France and Wales . Saint-Andre, one of France's best wingers, took over after the 2011 World Cup, where France lost 8-7 to New Zealand in a tense final. Almost all of that side has gone and Saint-Andre has been rebuilding ever since, although his habit of constantly tinkering with the side has not helped instill continuity. But he feels the players should take more responsibility and show more pride. 'I've covered and supported them for three years. At some stage you need to know how to win games at the highest level,' he said. 'The French jersey should not only be something you're proud of but also something that enables you to surpass yourself. You need to be a gladiator. It's thumbs up for Wales star Jamie Roberts after their win against France at the Stade de France . 'We've lost four in a row to the Welsh, this has to stop. We have guys who started playing (regularly) three years ago and now have 30 caps. It's time to stop hiding.' An irate Saint-Andre raised his voice several times during a passionate news conference. 'At some point you have to ask the right questions. We're at our level, that's the truth,' he said. 'It takes the Welsh 30 seconds to score three points and it takes us four minutes. We're the Father Christmas of international rugby and that's what I told the players.' However, Saint-Andre is no mood to quit. 'I've never abandoned ship, whether as a player, as a captain or as a manager. I've been given a role: to prepare this team for the World Cup,' he said. 'I'll fight every day to do that.'

"Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas admits the club have hit 'rock bottom' following Tuesday's 4-3 home defeat by Schalke in the Champions League. Carlo Ancelotti's side have hit a disappointing run of form after surrendering top spot in La Liga to rivals Barcelona following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao having dropped two points six days earlier against Villarreal at the Bernabeu. Real still qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals despite Tuesday's defeat and Casillas is keen to look forward and stop the rot. Iker Casillas admits Real Madrid have hit rock bottom following Tuesday's 4-3 home defeat by Schalke . Gareth Bale, Alvaro Arbeloa and Cristiano Ronaldo look frustrated as Real Madrid were booed off the field . Casillas insists his Real Madrid team-mates acknowledge the home supporters following the loss . Speaking to Spanish sports paper AS, Casillas said: 'We have hit rock bottom in a resounding way but the positive is that next week we play again and we can forget the last ten days. Because they have been ten dramatic days. The Spaniard, who suggested Madrid have a chance of turning things around when they face Barcelona a week on Friday, admits Real must improve if the club are to progress any further in the Champions League. 'We are not up to the standards we should be as Madrid and the quarter-finals of the Champions League,' said the 33-year-old. 'We are in a privileged position and now what we have to do is think about tomorrow. We can't look back, nor can we remember those 22 victories or other things we have succeeded in.' Schalke players celebrate Leroy Sane's goal during the German side's shock 4-3 victory in the Spanish capital . A group of Real Madrid fans waved a white handkerchief after the final whistle following a disappointing result . Schalke took a 2-1 lead on 40 minutes after Casillas' unconvincing save from a Max Meyer shot led to Klass-Jan Huntelaar's first goal of the night. However, the Spain international insists it is not a time to scrutinise his own performance. 'I think a goalkeeper is always to blame. It was not one of my best games but it's not a time to think about yourself. Despite not doing what we should have done, we were able to get through. 'The sooner we get the fans on board the better. We weren't at our best.' Casillas failed to keep hold of Max Meyer's shot which led to Klass-Jan Huntelaar giving Schalke a 2-1 lead . At the final whistle, Casillas insisted Cristiano Ronaldo - who cut a frustrated figure for most of the night - acknowledged the fans. The former Manchester United winger did not appear to be too happy at the end of the game despite his side's progression in the Champions League. Ronaldo shook his head in disgust repeatedly and stared into the camera with a frosty glaze following Real Madrid's 4-3 defeat on the night. In fact, Ronaldo was so angry that he told reporters: 'I won't talk again until the end of the season.' Real Madrid fans jeered their side's players throughout the defeat and waved white hankies to show their unhappiness at the performance.

"A driver had his supercar confiscated by police because he could not bear to screw a numberplate into its bodywork. Tsao He refused, saying the order by officers in Taiwan would spoil the bodywork of his £270,000 McLaren. The MP4-12C, which does 0-60mph in just 3.1 seconds, was seized when police saw it parked in a street bay without its front plate. A man in Taiwan refused to fit a front number plate to his McLaren MP4-12C (file picture) as he felt it would the spoil the supercar's bodywork . Mr He, 37, said: 'The car looks so perfect, I just couldn't bear to put holes in that beautiful body for something as ugly as a registration plate. 'I told them it was registered and I showed them the plate, which I keep under my seat. I couldn't believe it when they towed it away.' Police in Taichung also gave him a £230 ticket for overstaying in the bay while they waited for a tow truck. Mr He can apply for the car's return after he fits a plate but faces a fine to cover the cost of towing it away. A police spokesman said: 'The car failed to display the proper documentation and has been confiscated.'

"Chelsea go into their second leg against Paris Saint-Germain with a small advantage due to Branislav Ivanovic's crucial away goal in Paris. The Blues will be wary of the threat posed by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Co as they look to seal a spot in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Here, Sportsmail lists three reasons why Chelsea should be cheerful and three reasons why they should be fearful going into their match against the Ligue 1 outfit. Three reasons to be cheerful... Chelsea’s home comforts . At home, Chelsea are unbeaten in the Champions League against French opposition, keeping five clean sheets in six games (Won 4, Drawn 2, Lost 0) Ibrahimovic struggles to provide knockout blow . Zlatan Ibrahimovic may strike fear into the hearts of opposition defences, but the PSG striker’s record in the knockout rounds of the Champions League is not so terrifying...  (Group stages: A goal every two games, Knockout stages: A goal every 4.9 games) They all count... Half of Chelsea’s Champions League goals this season have been scored via set-pieces (nine). Interestingly, the same proportion of PSG’s goals conceded in Ligue 1 have been from dead-ball situations (12 of 24). Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has struggled during the Champions League knockout stages . Three reasons to be fearful... Terrific record . Laurent Blanc's men are unbeaten since January 10 (Played 14, Won 10, Drawn 4, Lost 0, Goal difference +16) Keeping it tight at the back . In the first leg at the Parc des Princes, Chelsea were largely dominated by PSG and restricted to just two shots — the second of which was Branislav Ivanovic’s  opener. Chelsea to pay penalty . The Blues will be desperate to get the tie wrapped up in 90 minutes - their win percentage in penalty shoot-outs in Europe is just 25 per cent (won 1, lost 3).

"Paris Saint-Germain boss Laurent Blanc has called for calm in the anticipated cauldron of Stamford Bridge as his side bid to oust Chelsea in Wednesday night's Champions League last-16 second leg. On the eve of the first leg three weeks ago Blanc spoke of Jose Mourinho being the arch provocateur and called for his players to keep their composure. Now the PSG coach has warned of striker Diego Costa's combative nature and the need for his side to balance risk-taking with being difficult to beat in a tie finely poised at 1-1. PSG star  Zlatan Ibrahimovic plays a first-time pass as he prepares to take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . David Luiz (second left) returns to his former home turf in a bid to end Chelsea's Champions League run . PSG players are put through their paces on Tuesday night ahead of Wednesday night's second leg match . Ibrahimovic will lead the line for PSG while Luiz is keen to show Chelsea they were wrong to discard him . 'He likes contact, and provokes opposition players. That's part of his game. He thrives off that,' Blanc said of Costa. 'He really needs that to bring out the best in his performances. 'The most important thing is to not get caught up in the way he plays. 'He will try to provoke a reaction. We need to stay calm, not get caught up in his game. We need to be as effective as possible in stopping him. 'It's up to us to try to take some risks, but not lose our heads and take unnecessary risks. 'Paris Saint-Germain need to stand up and be counted. We also need to stay in the game. That's the difficulty. Yes, we need to attack, yes, we need to create chances, but we also need to stay solid.' Luiz looks to the heavens as he takes to the pitch for training on the eve of their must-win encounter . Laurent Blanc addresses his players, including (from left) Thiago Silva, Luiz and Ibrahimovic . Blanc gestures to make a point to his players on Tuesday at Stamford Bridge . The Frenchmen, eliminated on away goals at Stamford Bridge last term when they let a 3-1 first-leg advantage slip, must score to advance to the quarter-finals for a third straight season. Blanc avoided talk of revenge after Demba Ba's heroics last term - the striker's last-gasp goal earned Chelsea progress to the semi-finals - and called for his side to take their chances. The PSG boss said: 'Chelsea have a slight advantage, because they were able to score an away goal. It's up to us to try to do what Chelsea did in Paris. 'One of Chelsea's main threats is the fact they're very good on the counter attack, so I don't think we should go gung ho. 'We have to attack and we need to score a goal, regardless of whether Chelsea get one or not. Although injuries have hampered Ibrahimovic's involvement, Blanc is sure he will have an impact . Brazilian defender Silva sports a black eye after contact with Dimitar Berbatov last week . 'I hope we do better than Chelsea did in the first leg. Chelsea created only one chance and they scored from that. I hope we create more than one chance.' Blanc hopes Thibaut Courtois is busy, but beaten, in Chelsea's goal. Blanc added: 'Their goalkeeper's performance was what allowed them to start as slight favourites going into the second leg. Over the 90 minutes PSG played better than Chelsea. 'If we create chances tomorrow night and he plays very well again that will prove that PSG have once again been better than Chelsea. 'He was very good in the first leg and I hope he's not as good tomorrow night.' Luiz plays with a ball as his team-mates look on with stern glares as they prepare for Wednesday night . PSG traverse the Bridge turf under lights ahead of their bid for a Champions League quarter-final place . For all the millions they have spent - including paying £50m to Chelsea for David Luiz - PSG are still to break into Europe's elite. Blanc believes it will take time. 'It's very easy to talk about, it's less easy to go out and do it,' Blanc said. 'In order to progress as a club you need experience. Paris Saint-Germain have got a little bit more experience, but we're still a long way off having the same levels of experience as Chelsea. 'Chelsea took a long while to become one of the best sides in Europe. They also invested a lot of money to get there. 'We need to be patient. 'In order to become one of the top four or top six sides in Europe it does take time. We've started that process.' Diego Costa (left with Ramires) will try to get under the skin of PSG's players, says Blanc . One notable difference this season over last is that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is available to Blanc. The Sweden striker was injured last term, but will come up against Chelsea captain John Terry and either Gary Cahill or Kurt Zouma. 'I don't think those two players (Cahill and Zouma) are going to be happy about facing Zlatan,' Blanc said. 'He's someone who loves the big occasion. He's a player who can score at any time, in any venue, against any opponent. 'I hope he shows that tomorrow night.'","Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea meet on Wednesday at Stamford Bridge .

"Louis van Gaal ended his post-match press conference on a prickly note after being asked about the failings of Manchester United's on loan striker Radamel Falcao. Falcao was left as an unused substitute as United pressed for an equaliser in their FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, but Van Gaal was quick to defend his forward. The Dutch manager interrupted a journalist asking about the striker to defend his forward's record, and hit out at the press for enjoying the Colombian's dismal record, before ending with a sarcastic remark. Louis van Gaal (left) trudges away after the defeat, with Radamel Falcao (right) walking ahead of him . Van Gaal was in a bad mood at the press conference, pointing accusingly at a journalist for the question . As he left the room the Dutchman sarcastically remarked 'very good question', and gave a thumbs up . The United boss decided not to use Falcao despite chasing an equaliser, keeping the expensive star benched . 'He scored four goals and has 3 or 4 assists, so that is his contribution,' said a clearly annoyed Van Gaal. 'And he stimulates also the other players, so that's also an aspect of the profession.' 'But it is now easy for you to say that (criticism of Falcao), and that's why you are saying that. And you are very happy to say that, I see that in your face.' When the journalist then pointed out that four goals is not very much for a striker on £280,000 a week, Van Gaal seemed to agree, but continued to take issue with the line of questioning. The 63-year-old took issue with the line of inquiry about Falcao, interrupting a journalist's question . Falcao has scored four goals since joining on loan, a meagre return for £280,000 per week . Van Gaal issues tactical instructions during the game, but was unable to stem the tide against Arsenal . 'Yes,' he responded. 'I cannot change that. I cannot change facts, and you know that. But you can continue.' The United boss then called an end to his press conference, before leaving with a sarcastic jibe of 'very good question' to the offending journalist, and giving him the thumbs up.","Manchester United manager responded angrily to question about striker .

"Previous stunts have seen him dangling from a zip-wire and dancing to the Spice Girls at the 2012 Olympics. Now Boris Johnson has donned a hairnet and yellow gumboots to pose as a fishmonger presiding over a spread of fresh fish and seafood, including a vast yellowfin tuna. The Mayor of London tried his hand at tuna loining, salmon filleting and ‘pin-boning’ - the art of removing fish bones using tweezers - as he launched National Apprentice Week yesterday. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson donned a hairnet and yellow gumboots to pose as a fishmonger over a spread of fresh fish and seafood . The Mayor of London appeared to be having an enjoyable time as he poked a fish at the seafood factory in Chessington . Mr Johnson met apprentices working at the New England Seafood factory, where he confirmed plans for a £1.8million scheme that will create more than 3,500 new apprenticeships across the capital. He said: ‘Our new programme will reach out to those companies yet to dip their toe into the rich pool of talent contained in our capital.’ The London-based New England Seafood has taken on 12 apprentices since 2012, five of whom have gone on to take up full time positions.

"Nemanja Matic returns to the Chelsea team after serving a two-match ban in domestic football and Jose Mourinho admits the club has learned valuable lessons from the way he was allowed to leave for Benfica. Matic has become arguably the most important player in Mourinho's team, providing the midfield security and physical presence which allows others the freedom to create. The Chelsea boss insisted he would 'never' have allowed the Serb to leave Stamford Bridge but understands how it happened and applauded the board for showing the courage to sign him again for £22million, three years after he joined Benfica as a makeweight in a deal to sign David Luiz. Jose Mourinho believes Chelsea were 'brave' in deciding to bring Nemanja Matic back to Stamford Bridge . Matic has become an important member of Chelsea's first team since rejoining Chelsea . The 28-year-old has missed Chelsea's last two games against Tottenham and West Ham due to suspension . 'Chelsea were brave by bringing him back,' said Mourinho. 'If in this world you want to do the best for your club you don't protect yourself from possible critics. You simply do what you think is the best. 'We wanted a midfield player and we had on the table three or four but the best one he was a former Chelsea player. I don't say a player they lost but they were brave to say we are sure this is the right one, we are sure he is the best one, we are sure he is going to be a success here. 'Probably the next time Chelsea does a deal with a young player they will keep control. At these ages, the evolution of players can be good or bad. You can loan or even sell a player but you have ways of being in control of his future. 'Another aspect is the fact that Chelsea had so many managers in these years. It is difficult for the business people on the board. For one manager, Matic is the right profile of player, another one thinks Matic can go because I don't like him. This guy I like because he is fast, this guy I don't like because he is small. 'With a philosophy on the table, it is much easier for our board. If I was here, a left-footed player, 1.95 metres tall, would never, never, never leave. Never.' Matic was handed a two-match suspension for pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes . Mourinho insists Matic wouldn't have been sold if he was in charge during the midfielder's first Chelsea spell . Matic was sent off against Burnley last month for a retaliatory push on Ashley Barnes and missed the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham and a London derby at West Ham, when young centre-half Kurt Zouma deputised in midfield. He returns to the team for the Champions League last-16 tie against PSG at Stamford Bridge, which is poised at 1-1 after the first leg in France. 'It is goof to have him back with we did well without him,' said Mourinho. 'So I've told him maybe he is not so important. It was a bit of a joke and he laughed, but I told him we won a final and beat West Ham at West Ham, so we did well without him. 'But he is important, of course he is. He is very important in the balance of our team. Our team was developed with Matic in that position and everybody feels comfortable with him there. 'Zouma did amazingly well for us in those two games, in that position, but Zouma is a central defender and will always sbe a central defender, while Matic is Matic and the team feels very good with him.'","Nemanja Matic was used as makeweight in David Luiz's move to Chelsea .

The club are tenth in the Premier League after Wednesday's 1-0 defeat to Jose Mourinho's side with 39 points but are only three  behind Stoke in eighth. But on Thursday, Allardyce was boosted by Winston Reid emphatically ending reports that he will depart Upton Park at the end of the season by penning a six-and-a-half year contract at the club. 'It's one of those things that took a bit of time, but we got there in the end,' Reid, 26, said upon announcing the news. Reid's game against Chelsea was curtailed after only eight minutes due to a hamstring problem but the New Zealand international hopes his team's break will allow him to recover swiftly. 'It's just one of those things with the injury,' Reid said. 'I had it a little after Crystal Palace and unfortunately it flared up again. It's just part of the game I guess.

"At one minute to three, Tony Mowbray walked from the spacious Ricoh Arena tunnel, gave a thumbs up to the photographers clicking away and returned to the capricious game that is football management. By five o’clock, he must have been wondering quite what he’d thrown himself back into after a rollercoaster afternoon that did nothing to soothe Coventry City’s acute relegation anxieties. Mowbray had not stood on a touchline since October 19, 2013, when his Middlesbrough team were beaten 3-2 by Barnsley at Oakwell. The game has certainly not grown any kinder or more predictable in the meantime. Coventry's Jim O'Brien opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match . Coventry City: Burge, Phillips, Pennington, Martin, Stokes, O'Brien (Jackson 77),, Barton (Odelusi 62), Fleck, Nouble, Tudgay (Williams 63), Samuel . Subs not used: Webster, Turgott, Finch, Charles-Cook . Booked: O'Brien . Scorer(s): O'Brien 4, Odelusi 70 . Port Vale: Neal, Veseli, Inniss (McGivern 36), Robertson, Dickinson, Moore (Daniel 81), Brown, O'Connor, Marshall, Williamson (Dodds 77), Pope . Subs not used: Yates, Birchall, Lines, Johnson . Booked: Dickinson, Inniss . Scorer(s): Pope 40, Marshall 45, O'Connor 76 . Referee: Mick Russell . Attendance: 9,446 . The 51-year-old Yorkshireman, late of Hibernian, West Brom, Celtic and Teesside, spoke of restoring City’s glory days when he arrived in the week. But his short-term contract speaks of a more pressing mission - saving the Sky Blues, famously FA Cup winners in 1987 and staple of the top flight for many years, from the indignity of League Two football. They remain above the relegation zone - just, by a sole point - after this 3-2 defeat but the new boss will be under no illusions that this is no time for grand future plans, just steely focus and cast-iron resolve. The initial signs had been so positive. On the first sunny afternoon of Spring, the whole place seemed energised by Mowbray’s arrival and Coventry had a precious lead just four minutes in. From the left, the ball was worked into Dominic Samuel’s feet but he couldn’t get them synchronised to shoot. Instead, he passed backwards to O’Brien in plenty of space and he picked out the bottom corner with a perfectly-placed shot from 20 yards. Tony Mowbray issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of Coventry . ‘We are staying up’, sang the home faithful, confident again that a club in the Premier League as recently as 2000-01 wouldn’t be playing fourth tier football next season for the first time since 1959. Mowbray - who spent most of the match stood, hands in pockets, on the edge of his technical area - betrayed little emotion. It was only a start, after all. The Sky Blues were well on top, looking threatening going forward and Samuel’s deflected shot from a good position had Chris Neal scrambling across. But Vale, who still harbour hopes of reaching the play-offs, slowly grew into the game and took command in the minutes just before half-time. First, Tom Pope was left with a straightforward side-foot finish after the ball was played across the penalty area, nobody seemingly wanting to take responsibility. There was a strong suspicion of offside, but the striker’s 11th goal of the season stood. Few will come as easily as that for him. Then, four minutes later, Coventry’s fragile confidence at the back was dented again. The impressive Mark Marshall played a neat one-two with Michael O’Connor around the home defence and produced an emphatic finish. The Coventry wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start . To make matters worse, Marshall had been released by Mowbray’s predecessor Steven Pressley last summer having been deemed unworthy of a new contract. Marshall politely declined to celebrate. The travelling masses were less diplomatic, chanting ‘that’s why you’re going down.’ Mowbray sent his players out five minutes early for the second-half and, having composed themselves following the double blow before the break, they started on the front foot. O’Brien’s flighted cleared by Neal’s legs just a fraction ahead of the onrushing John Fleck and Aaron Phillips curled an effort wide from range. But they couldn’t sustain the bright start, allowing Vale to dictate things again. Byron Moore volleyed over the bar after a clever piece of chest control and Marshall tested Lee Burge with a low drive. The former Middlesbrough and Celtic manager holds his arms aloft in appeal at the Ricoh Arena . Then, out of nothing, an equaliser. Frank Nouble, brought back into the side by Mowbray, bulldozed his way forward on the counter-attack before picking out Sanmi Odelusi bursting up on his right. After a touch to control, the substitute rifled home and in one swing of the boot, totally transformed the mood. A cloud of thick blue smoke rose in one corner from a flare as the home fans found their voices again. Not for long. From their next piece of attacking play, Vale were awarded a free-kick 25 yards out after O’Brien felled Michael Brown. Up stepped Michael O’Connor, bending the ball precisely around the wall and beyond the outstretched arm of Burge. Mowbray didn’t know where to look. Some welcome back to football this had been.","Jim O'Brien gave the home side the lead in just the fourth minute .

"This year’s renewal of the Queen Mother Champion Chase could double as an episode of Casualty given the two chief protagonists have hauled themselves off their sick beds to face the starter. Both Sprinter Sacre, successful in 2013, and last season’s hero Sire De Grugy have suffered well-documented issues, with connections striving to return their charges to the form which saw them dominate consecutive runnings of this feature. As the preparation of both horses has not been smooth — despite their trainers issuing upbeat bulletins — it might be worth opposing them with CHAMPAGNE FEVER (Cheltenham, 3.20). Champagne Fever, ridden by Ruby Walsh (right) wins the William Hill Supreme Novices Hurdle in 2013 . Racemail tipsters got off to a stunning start on the opening day. Robin Goodfellow (Sam Turner) and Captain Heath (Marcus Townend) napped 8-1 National Hunt Chase winner Cause Of Causes, while Townend also landed his next best bet (The Druids Nephew 8-1) to complete an 80-1 double. Turner also picked winners Douvan (2-1), Un De Sceaux (4-6) and Champion Hurdle winner Faugheen (4-5), while Peter Scudamore went for the first two Willie Mullins’ winners. But for an agonising defeat in the Arkle Chase 12 months ago at this meeting, the eight-year-old would have an undefeated record in three starts at the Festival after successes in the bumper and Supreme Novices’ Hurdle. Admittedly, he can be a hit-and-miss character on occasion, falling at Thurles two starts ago before repairing his confidence with an easy win at Gowran. A fine effort in the King George Chase in December, when finding the three miles on soft ground beyond him, suggests the drop back to the two-mile trip will suit. And his stable are bang in form, with trainer Willie Mullins enjoying a memorable day on Tuesday. If the rain stays away, I could see Simply Ned out running his price as he has been kept fresh for this and has already finished in front of Dodging Bullets at Prestbury Park this season. Arabian Revolution (right) ridden by jockey Tony McCoy wins at Sandown Park Racecourse in January 2015 . Earlier on the card, DON POLI (Cheltenham, 2.05) has looked awesome in his two chase starts to date and is strongly fancied to lift the RSA Chase. He repelled a classy rival in Apache Stronghold with a degree of comfort at Leopardstown last time and looks a Gold Cup horse in the making. Apache Stronghold has gone on to boost that form with an accomplished defeat of Valseur Lido, and Don Poli has a great opportunity to follow up his triumph in a handicap hurdle at last year’s meeting. ARABIAN REVOLUTION (Cheltenham, nap, 4.40) is a sporting selection to win one of the season’s fiercest handicaps as he looks to have plenty in his favour in the Fred Winter Handicap Hurdle. Like three previous winners, the selection boasts a victory at Sandown and the form of his recent run at Ludlow has since taken a marked boost with the winner Beltor, a Triumph Hurdle contender, hacking up at Kempton. I also like the move to equip Arabian Revolution with headgear for the first time, while the booking of Barry Geraghty is another huge positive.

"And so finally it arrives. The clash we have been waiting so long for. The top-of-the-bill dust-up which for many is the highlight of the meeting and one which is quite simply too close to call. Nicky Henderson’s Sprinter Sacre versus Gary Moore-trained Sire de Grugy in the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase. Sprinter Sacre was the imperious winner of the race in 2013 but could not defend his title 12 months ago because of illness. In his absence, Sire de Grugy galloped away with his crown displaying the same disdain for the leaden-footed gallopers chasing him. Barry Geraghty riding Sprinter Sacre celebrates victory in the Queen Mother Champion Steeple Chase in 2013 . Sprinter Sacre clears a fence on his way to winning the race two years ago . Both pack a killer punch and both are battled scarred giants. Both also hail from stables reluctant to admit the possibility of defeat. If they were boxers, they would probably be nose-to-nose, eyes bulging, refusing to be the first to blink. But underneath would be a grudging respect borne not only out of mutual ability but also shared battles against adversity. They have met once before in the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton in December 2013. But it was a race memorable for the wrong reason as jockey Barry Geraghty pulled up Sprinter Sacre after the seventh fence with a fibrillating heart problem. It was an issue which kept him off the track until his second to Dodging Bullets at Ascot in January, a good performance off such a lengthy lay-off but one which only fuelled debate about whether the Sprinter Sacre of today is a shadow of the horse rated one of the best steeplechasers in his pomp. The delayed return had scuppered the pair’s first anticipated clash in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown in December. Sire de Grugy, ridden by Jamie Moore, galloped to the crown at last year's Festival . But by then Sire De Grugy, who mopped up Britain’s four Grade One two-mile chases in Sprinter Sacre’s absence, had also been sidelined. In his case it was a hip injury which initially had Moore fearing his season might be over. But after a blip when Moore’s jockey son Jamie was unseated in last month’s Game Spirit Chase at Newbury, confidence was restored with a smooth winning performance at Chepstow. The debate over their relative merits and how much talent they retain has been endless but now the time for talking is over. Henderson (left), the most successful trainer in Festival history, has shown trademark patience in nursing Sprinter Sacre back into shape. He said: ‘It will be the clash of the Festival. It is what we wanted last year and didn’t happen. It will be a hell of a clash. They have got a crown that we want back. I think we have a chance. You can’t be confident but I am hopeful. He is in seriously good shape and doing everything we have remotely asked him to do. Sprinter Sacre (left) finished second to Dodging Bullets in comeback at Ascot in January . Moore celebrates with Sire de Grugy after claiming victory last year . ‘I am not saying he is back to his very best. When he was, he was absolutely ridiculously unbeatable. It didn’t matter what anyone threw at him. I am not saying he is still like that but he is in seriously good shape.’ But Jamie Moore is equally bullish for Sire de Grugy. He said: ‘I am hoping will see the same horse as last year and I am pretty sure they will. At the start of the season I thought he was working better last year. I think we will see the real Sire turn up and he will give them all a hell of race.’ The danger, of course, is that all the focus on the big two leads to a talented rival being underestimated, just as when Imperial Commander gatecrashed the 2010 Gold Cup billed as the Denman versus Kauto Star show. Lining up against them is Paul Nicholls-trained Dodging Bullets, whose breeder Frankie Dettori was thinking more Derby and Royal Ascot when he sent dam Nova Cyngi to stallion Dubawi. Barry Geraghty acknowledges the crowd after being lead into the winner's enclosure in 2013 . The three-time champion Flat jockey will be at the track to watch the form horse of the season and winner of both the Tingle Creek and Clarence House Chases run. Then there is Willie Mullins-trained Champagne Fever, who was just a head away in the Arkle Trophy Chase from winning at his third consecutive Festival, 12 months ago. Nicholls also saddles much improved Mr Mole, the mount of AP McCoy. The Cheltenham Festival is rightly billed as the Olympics of Jump racing. That make the two-mile Queen Mother Champion Chase the 100metres final. Fast, furious and compelling … and almost impossible to call.","Sprinter Scare won the Queen Mother Champion Chase in 2013 .

"Louis van Gaal admitted he had not prepared for the possibility of matchwinner Danny Welbeck facing his former club at Old Trafford. The Manchester United manager, under pressure after this dramatic 2-1 defeat in the FA Cup quarter-final, expected Olivier Giroud to spearhead the Arsenal attack. Instead Welbeck scored Arsenal's glorious 61st minute winner when he clipped the ball beyond David de Gea and ran on to score in front of 9,000 travelling Arsenal supporters. Danny Welbeck slides the ball into an empty net to secure a 2-1 win for Arsenal against Manchester United . The former United striker celebrates in front of Arsenal's 9,000 travelling supporters at Old Trafford . Van Gaal, who sold Welbeck to Arsenal in the summer because he didn't believe he was good enough, said: 'In football it happens, but it was also a surprise that Wenger put him in that position. 'When a player returns to play his former club he will always be very motivated, but we gave the goal away. 'It is very disappointing because we gave the victory to Arsenal. The players are disappointed because they know it could have been different. 'This is a big blow, we have to recover. We are sportsmen so we have to recover. I cannot say that the motivation of the team was bad. 'We have to show fantastic fighting spirit, that is not the problem.' United finished with ten men after the dismissal of Angel di Maria in the second half. He was booked by referee Michael Oliver - who had an outstanding game - for diving and was then shown another yellow card for tugging at the official's shirt. Van Gaal added: 'Di Maria knows that he doesn't have to touch the referee. That is not so smart of him. Angel di Maria is shown a red card by referee Michael Oliver after picking up two bookings inside a minute . Di Maria heads for the Old Trafford tunnel after a moment of madness cost him a second yellow card . 'But controlled emotion is not so easy in a match like this, but I mentioned it before the game because I know these red cards are easily given. 'I cannot give a comment about the referee and you know why. He knows that he doesn't have to touch the referee. 'We have to see every decision of the referee in the circumstances because he whistles, but I want to see the video tape to see how he has decided it all.' Arsenal took the lead here when Nacho Monreal ended a brilliant move by Wenger's side in the 25th minute, but Wayne Rooney equalised four minutes later. The FA Cup holders, who will now play Bradford or Reading in the FA Cup semi-final, went on to score again when Welbeck read a disastrous backpass by Antonio Valencia. Welbeck barely celebrated his goal, his eighth for Arsenal since his move from United, but Wenger insisted he had added motivation to score. The Arsenal manager said: 'He has pace, he also has a bit of psychological consideration by playing against his old club, and I have to rotate a bit without affecting the players. Louis van Gaal and his assistant Ryan Giggs gesture on the touchline during United's defeat by Arsenal . Van Gaal opted to sell matchwinner Welbeck to Arsenal for £16million in last summer's transfer window . 'I thought we might need to counter attack, so I played him. He has had a great game. 'We want everyone to do well against their former club to show they are great players, but it is not aways easy to deal mentally with it. 'I only knew very late that he would play, but he has shown great mental strength. 'He just wants to win, he is a team player. He just wants to do well and he wants to produce s complete performance. 'He kept calm and De Gea made one or two outstanding saves.' Arsenal deserved to win and Wenger insisted that his team can respond to the challenge ahead as they target a sixth FA Cup since he became manager of the club. He also paid tribute to the 9,000 travelling Arsenal fans who made their way to Old Trafford on a Monday evening for this FA Cup quarter-final. Some of Arsenal's 9,000 travelling fans celebrate at Old Trafford after the final whistle . Van Gaal trudges towards the tunnel after seeing his side miss out on a place in the FA Cup semi-finals . He said: 'We started at a high tempo and without apprehension. We were in control. We could have scored more. 'The team was a bit down at 1-1 at half-time, because we felt that we should be winning. 'Mentally we were at the level I requested. It was a physical game, a committed game. We did that well without forgetting to play our football. 'Every win makes us stronger. Winning at Man City earlier in the season helped us to show that we can win big games. 'I have huge respect for the fans to come here. To come here on a Monday night, with 9,000 fans, shows you the huge size of the club. 'We will be favourites in the semi-final, but we have tricky memories from last year. 'It was our hardest game, we but we to focus now on the Premier League and then we have a big game against Monaco in the Champions League.'","Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-1 to reach the FA Cup semi-finals .

"Johnny Sexton is on course to start Saturday’s Six Nations clash with Wales, a match that Warren Gatland is delighted to see Wayne Barnes officiate. As Sexton and his hamstrings were coming through Ireland training unscathed, Wales coach Gatland was naming an unchanged team for the Millennium Stadium encounter and giving his seal of approval to English referee Barnes, an official with whom Wales ‘have a good rapport’. Barnes was called in to take charge of the match after Steve Walsh was ruled out and Gatland said Wales were delighted to have the Englishman on the whistle. Johnny Sexton begins running as he  recovers from a hamstring injury sustrained against England . The Irish fly half is no longer a doubt for Saturday's trip to Cardiff as he returned to a  training programme . ‘We have had him before, he is a referee we have got a good rapport with,’ said Gatland. ‘The players get on well with him and we are really looking forward to him taking control of the game. I am looking forward to meeting him on Friday just to get his thoughts on the Six Nations so far and things that he is looking for from us.’ Sexton remains on course to start in Cardiff, according to assistant coach Richie Murphy. ‘He didn’t do any contact but took part in full training. He ran all the plays, did all the defensive stuff and was running at 100 per cent. ‘He’s really happy where he is at. We’re expecting him to be fit at the weekend. Ireland's Johnny Sexton has won his battle to be fit to face Wales in the RBS 6 Nations on Saturday . ‘He’s a really important part of the package,’ added Murphy. ‘His direction and leadership are massive, those decisions he makes on the run. ‘We’re really happy he will be fit to play at the weekend, but I suppose the back-up is the whole squad doesn’t rely on just Johnny.’ Murphy also confirmed Jamie Heaslip is good to go, stating the No 8 took a full part in Tuesday’s training after recovering from the three vertebrae fractured against France, while the assistant also clarified Monday’s concussion return-to-play protocol confusion surrounding Sean O’Brien and Jared Payne, who suffered bangs against England. Sean O'Brien (right) makes a tackle in the win over England, but is not yet back in contact training . Jared Payne (left) is also still out of full training, but should return to contact later in the week . ‘They can be cleared within six days if they’re playing the following week, but that process can take longer if you don’t need them. ‘Both have finished their return to play protocols and did contact training. An eye will be kept on them over the next 24 hours but both are fit and healthy and look like they’re ready to play.’ It means Joe Schmidt will deal from a full deck on Thursday when unveiling his team.","Ireland fly half has overcome his hamstring injury .

"Scotland may not have won at Twickenham since 1983 — but captain Greig Laidlaw insists there is no reason why Vern Cotter’s men should head south with an inferiority complex this weekend.

Scotland captain greig Laidlaw (above) insists that England are not invincible ahead of Saturday's clash . ‘I’ve always thought highly of the England players but seeing them down there just shows me that we can win,’ said Laidlaw. ‘They are not invincible, that’s definitely not the case. ‘I believe they are good players but you look at Glasgow Warriors when they played Bath in Europe this season and how well they did. ‘Bath were going well in the Premiership but Glasgow beat them at home and arguably could have won down there, too. It wasn’t really Glasgow’s first team as they had a lot of injuries that day — and it probably was close to Bath’s first team.’ Laidlaw’s emotions are running high ahead of the Calcutta Cup clash, especially after team-mate Stuart Hogg told Sportsmail he feels there is a lack of respect for Scottish rugby south of the border. Laidlaw made a similar point before the start of the Six Nations, based on the experiences of his first season with Gloucester, following his move from Edinburgh. Scotland full back Stuart Hogg (left) accused the English of lacking respect for Scottish rugby . For Laidlaw, a win at Twickenham will not only belatedly ignite Scotland’s Six Nations campaign, following defeats to France, Wales and Italy, it will give him bragging rights in the Gloucester dressing room and make him even more proud to be a Scot south of the border. ‘Respect has to be earned and that is something we’ll be aiming to do at the weekend,’ he said. ‘The England boys will respect us if we do a job on the field. ‘We’re not far away from getting things right but I’m getting pretty sick of telling people that, I really am. It’s up to us as players to step up, go again and put in that performance against England. ‘We have had some tough talking from the coaches this week and rightly so since the defeat to Italy — but it has been good as we have been shooting ourselves in the foot a lot of the time and we have to change. ‘We have now seen both sides of Vern Cotter this week. He is a hard man and rightly so. He has high standards and we have certainly seen what he is all about — and that’s good. We know what is expected of us and he is a very clever coach who wants to make sure we come away from Twickenham with a positive result.’ Laidlaw also has two very personal reasons for wanting to lead Scotland to what would be a famous victory at Twickenham. The first is to emulate his uncle, Roy Laidlaw, who helped his team to a Calcutta Cup win back in 1983. The other is to wipe out the memory of last year’s 20-0 defeat by England at BT Murrayfield. It still makes him bristle and was arguably his worst performance in a Scotland shirt. England captain Chris Robshaw lifts the Calcutta Cup at Murrayfield last year after a 20-0 victory . Nothing went right for Laidlaw that day and, after missing two penalties and struggling to make any sort of impression on the game, the Scotland skipper was replaced by Chris Cusiter after 65 minutes. The boos that rang round the stadium at the final whistle hurt Laidlaw and he knows that defeat, on top of Scotland’s dreadful Six Nations campaign so far this season, makes it vitally important to put things right at the home of English rugby. ‘That was personally one of my worst games for Scotland, to be honest,’ he admitted. ‘I don’t think many of the boys played well that day for whatever reason. ‘It was made worse because we were playing England. It is the oldest game in the world and you want to do yourself proud — and we didn’t. ‘Vern’s analysis this week has been about going back a bit further into previous Six Nations tournaments and he has been on our case. He has certainly been on my case, that’s for sure, after he brought up that match. ‘We’ve had a look at that last game when we lost 20-0 and he pointed out mistakes in that match and told us we need to learn quickly and not make those same mistakes again. ‘We certainly want to turn around that defeat and how we have performed in this Six Nations, if we can, by winning at Twickenham and there is slightly more added spice to the fixture because it is England down there. ‘I’ve talked to my uncle Roy about their win in 1983 but that was a different group of players and the guys who won more than 30 years ago have made their own bit of history. ‘It’s up to us now to make our own bit of history and go down there and be strong and have the mentality that we can impose our game on them — and not worry about what is coming out of the other changing room.’ England centre Luther Burrell is mobbed by his team-mates after he scored a try in last year's match . Much will rest on the performance of second-row Jonny Gray, who turns 21 on Saturday. He has already come of age for Scotland and is calling the line-outs. In the absence of big brother Richie through injury, there is now even more responsibility on his shoulders. There was an indication against the Italians of how much Gray is respected by Cotter when, with Laidlaw taken off and vice-captain Ross Ford off injured, he was asked to fill in as skipper near the end of the game. It was a dream come true for the second row, who knows he has a huge role to play against England. ‘It’s very special to be a part of the Scotland squad in the first place, then to lead your country is something you grow up dreaming about,’ he said. ‘To have done that, even if for only a couple of minutes against Italy, was a huge honour and a very special feeling. Jonny Gray (above) will have a big role to play if Scotland are to upset the odds and beat England . ‘The result was hugely disappointing but we have to put that behind us now. ‘We have been looking at the England game and what we need to fix and we’re just training hard to try to get it right. ‘It will be a huge occasion in an amazing stadium against a tough England team. They have got a very strong pack and the driving maul is a real strength of theirs, so that is an area we will be working hard on this week.’","Scotland face England at Twickenham in the Six Nations on Saturday .

"Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti says under-fire Gareth Bale will remain in the starting line-up against Schalke. The Welsh winger has been criticised by a section of Real's fans and the local media for a dip in form, having set up just one goal and failed to score in Real's last eight matches. According to a poll in Spanish newspaper AS 46 per cent of supporters would prefer to see Bale dropped form the team ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo or Karim Benzema. Garteh Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo were in high spirits on Monday despite the club's poor form recently . The Wales forward has been criticised by sections of the Real Madrid support in recent weeks . Real Madrid manager talks to Bale and Ronaldo during training on Monday ahead of Schalke clash . But Ancelotti has no qualms about starting him in the Bernabeu clash with Schalke, which Real Madrid go into with a two-goal cushion having won the first leg 2-0 away from home. 'If I had to replace those who were not playing at their best, I would have to change the whole squad,' the Italian told the Spanish media on Monday. 'The whole team needs to improve. I'm sure Bale is not happy with what he is doing and he understands that and wants to do better.' Ancelotti is confident his side can rediscover their best form, despite a disappointing draw with Villarreal and a defeat to Athletic Club in their last two games. A shortage of goals has been Real's biggest problem, with Benzema and Ronaldo also struggling. Bale (left), Fabio Coentrao and Ronaldo (right) were put through their paces on Monday . Former Tottneham players Bale and Luka Modric laugh and joke as they go through their warm-up . Ancelotti says he will keep faith with his misfiring strikeforce for the second leg of the Schalke tie . 'I have complete confidence in them (Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo),' he said. 'They have given us so much in the past and our identity is not going to change. 'There has been a general drop in form, not just of the three of them, but of the whole team. 'Right now the team is not helping our strikers much. 'We are not playing fast, we are passing the ball too much and we need to try to find the right pass to make the most of our strikers' potential.' Even so, there is now not much room for error if the Spanish giants are going to win titles in Europe or on the domestic front. After the Schalke game, Real will host Levante this weekend before travelling to the Nou Camp to face Barcelona on March 22. Ronaldo reacts to a decision during Madrid's loss to Athletic Bilbao at San Mames on Saturday evening . Bale has been booed and jeered by Real Madrid supporters a couple of times . 'No team can make any mistakes from now on because otherwise you compromise the campaign,' he said. 'There is more pressure now at this stage of the campaign. 'In the Champions League, we want to do the best we can because this is the best competition in the world. 'We did well against German opposition last season and we hope to do the same this year.' Real hammered Schalke 9-2 on aggregate at the same stage and then beat Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich en route to lifting a record 10th European cup last season. The Spanish giants have won all of their Champions League games so far and will be bolstered by the return of midfield pair Luka Modric and Sami Khedira from injury.

"Thomas Aiken may not be defending his title, but South African players will look to maintain their stranglehold on the Africa Open in East London this week. England's Andy Sullivan is favourite to spoil their plans after winning the Joburg Open last Sunday, the 27-year-old claiming his second European Tour title in South Africa in the space of eight weeks. But home players have won the event every year since it began in 2010, with former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel winning the inaugural event and being followed into the winners' circle by fellow major winner Louis Oosthuizen (twice), Darren Fichardt and Aiken. Andy Sullivan  in action during the pro-am ahead of the Africa Open at East London Golf Club . European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke hits an approach shot in practice ahead of the tournament . Aiken's win 12 months ago helped him top the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit and secure a place in the field for the WGC-Cadillac Championship, which is also being staged this week at Doral. That leaves the likes of Fichardt and George Coetzee to lead the home challenge, with Coetzee keen to keep the trophy in South African hands. 'It was my first time playing (in 2010) and it was a big deal to see all the foreign players pull into East London,' said Coetzee, who finished 24th in the defence of his Joburg Open last week. 'Since then the Africa Open always attracts a strong contingent of local and international players. The crowds are always fantastic, because they are lively but very neutral. They just want to watch some great golf and they cheer for everyone. It's fun to play in front of galleries like that. 'Personally, I would very much like to put my name below Thomas' on the trophy before the international players have their day.' Matthew Baldwin of England tees off on the fifth hole  during practice at the stunning East London Golf Club . European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke is a notable name in the field but it is Sullivan, however, who looks most likely to gatecrash the home party. 'I think if I did I'd become one of the most hated people down here, so I'm not sure if I want to win this week,' Sullivan joked. 'But obviously it would be great to get a victory down here as well. 'It's quite hard because we go from week to week so it still has not sunk in yet. I am on the crest of a wave and just want to keep riding it and hopefully keep going this week. I'm looking forward to the task at hand, I think the wind is going to keep the scoring pretty fair and it should be fun. A buck crosses the fairway as home player Trevor Fisher jnr plays a shot . Thankfully for Graeme Storm the bucks stop with him able to hit his drive during the pro-am . 'It's a hell of a lot different to last week where we were just hitting the ball straight up in the air, it could be a massive change to what we are used to but I've had a couple of days in the wind now to get used to it and a feel for the course. We are professional golfers for a reason, we should be able to adapt.' Four of the players who finished runner-up to Sullivan last week - David Howell, Jaco van Zyl, Wallie Coetsee and Kevin Phelan - are in the field at East London, along with Oliver Fisher, who lost out in a play-off to Aiken 12 months ago. 'I have fond memories of the place, it was a good week last year and hopefully I can have a good week again,' Fisher said.

"An Indonesian clothing company has come under fire over  washing instructions printed on its sports shirts which said women should clean the shirts because 'it's her job'.

It's her job,' the label reads, according to BBC. The controversial washing instructions on the shirts of Indonesian Super League side Pusamania Borneo . Salvo Sports, the company that prints the shirts, was forced to issue an apology after the instructions went viral on social media . Social media was quick to shame the company, which tweeted an explanation of its actions. 'The message is simply, instead of washing it in the wrong way, you might as well give it to a lady because they are more capable,' the company tweeted on Sunday. 'There is no intention to humiliate women. In contrast [we want to tell the men] learn from women how to take care of clothes.' The company has not said whether they will recall the shirts. 'The message is simply, instead of washing it in the wrong way, you might as well give it to a lady because they are more capable,' a tweet from the company reads . 'There is no intention to humiliate women. In contrast [we want to tell the men] learn from women how to take care of clothes' The shirt controversy caps off a rough week for the sporting industry, with claims of sexist behaviour at the highest levels of the sport making news. A women's international football match between Australia and England, played near a military base in Cyprus, has been overshadowed by claims British soldiers shouted sexist abuse at Australian players throughout the match. FFA Media Operations spokesman Adam Mark said a formal report was currently being prepared by the team in Europe, and it will be reviewed before any potential action is discussed or taken. England's FA and the Ministry of Defence are also investigating the claims. The women's international match was marred by reports of abusive comments and behaviour from British soldiers watching on from the stands . The match was played near a British military base in Cyprus, where it is believed many of the soldiers were based (Stock image) 'We're waiting for the report before commenting. It would be inappropriate to say anything at this time,' Mr Mark told Daily Mail Australia. The alleged incident comes just days after the launch of the 'Women in Football' campaign designed to promote equality in the sport and 'tackle sexism in the game'. Rachel O'Sullivan, a UK journalist for the Girls on the Ball website, claimed about 10 of the 50 soldiers abused the women at the game in Nicosia, Cyprus on Friday. 'They were making horrible comments, shouting, whistling,' Ms O'Sullivan said. 'One Australian player, No.6 [Uzunlar], they were harassing her over and over and over again, throughout the game. 'These are teenage girls and they were sexually objectifying them.' Football Federation of Australia and England's Football Association are investigating the alleged incident, which comes just days after the launch of the 'Women in Football' campaign designed to promote equality in the sport and 'tackle sexism in the game' 'We're waiting for the report before commenting.

Sophie Downey, who also writes for Girls on the Ball, said she had been hesitant to report on the comments. 'At the end of the day we are just two young women who just love our football and want to support our team,' Ms Downey wrote. 'But we have sat through more than our fair share of women's games and we have never witnessed anything quite like it. Why should we keep quiet?' Servet Uzunlar, pictured in action with Sydney FC, was harassed 'over and over again', according to reports . She also said it was important to highlight such behaviour to ensure all fans understand it is 'offensive and unacceptable'.

"Open Championship venue Royal St George's has voted to allow women members for the first time in its history. A statement from the club read: 'The Royal St George's Golf Club is pleased to announce that, following an extraordinary general meeting held on 14th February 2015 and a subsequent ballot of the full members of the club, a resolution to alter the club's rules to make ladies eligible for membership has been duly passed. 'Under the club's rules, the resolution would only be passed if it obtained the support of three-quarters of the votes cast on the ballot. More than 81 per cent of the full members took part in the ballot and a decisive 90 per cent voted in favour of ladies being eligible for membership. Darren Clarke won The Open the last time it was held at Royal St George's in 2011 . 'The alteration of the club's rules has immediate effect and the club looks forward to welcoming ladies as junior and full members.' Royal St George's had been one of three clubs on the Open rota with a male-only membership policy. The club last hosted the Open in 2011 when it was won by Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke. Muirfield and Royal Troon are the other two courses to have male-only membership policies. Muirfield, which is owned and run by The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, is reviewing its membership criteria with a report due to be completed this month, while Troon announced in January its intention to undertake a 'comprehensive review' of its membership policy. Rickie Fowler hits a shot in the 2011 Open Championship amid a familiar St George's backdrop . St George's boasts a 60-foot bunker, the deepest in Britain, as a unique feature of the course . Troon has always considered itself a special case in this respect as it shares facilities with the Ladies Golf Club, Troon.

"Andy Cole has revealed how he was made to feel 'small' by a perceived snub from Teddy Sheringham that led to the England pair not talking. The former Manchester United striker played alongside Sheringham at Old Trafford for four years but did not enjoy a relationship with his compatriot following an incident on international duty. Cole made his England debut from the bench in a 0-0 friendly draw with Uruguay in 1995 and, in replacing then-Tottenham forward Sheringham, felt the lack of acknowledgement from his future United team-mate was disrespectful. Andy Cole (right) played alongside Teddy Sheringham at Manchester United for four years - but the pair never got on following a perceived snub from Sheringham during an England international in 1995 . Sheringham - and David Beckham - congratulate Cole after scoring in a 6-0 win over Bradford City in 2000 . 'From my England debut against Uruguay, he was going to be substituted for me to come on to replace him, and he snubbed me on the line,' Cole said. 'I just thought to myself, 'I'm making my debut here and Wembley is a packed house'. And I felt so small. 'I don't think his apology would come, because I honestly do believe that he believes he was not in the wrong.' Despite a fantastic goalscoring record at club level, Cole only made 15 international appearances and scored just once - famously calling former England boss Glenn Hoddle a 'coward' for announcing he was dropping Cole through the press. 'I don't think it was damaging to my career,' Cole said of his remarks. 'I just think a lot of the media and a lot of Joe Public picked up on that and ran with it and ran with it, and exhausted it. And I remember when it came out, I mean of course it was going to be massive news. He was the England manager.' Cole and Sheringham celebrate on the pitch in 2000 but the didn't speak off it . The pair come face-to-face when Cole played for Manchester City and Sheringham at West Ham in 2005 . Despite a prolific goalscoring record at club level, Cole won just 15 caps for England . Kevin Keegan and Cole, pictured here on international duty, fell out briefly in October 1993 . Cole also had a high-profile falling out with Kevin Keegan in 1993 while at Newcastle, something the striker said was a consequence of tiredness more than anything else. 'I felt so tired, and I couldn't get myself going,' Cole told ITV, 'He [Keegan] said, 'Don't you fancy it today?' So I said to him, 'No I don't fancy it today.' So he said, 'Well if you don't fancy it you can do one.' So I said, 'Okay, not a problem to me,' and I just walked off. 'I got in a taxi and my girlfriend then, she was at home so I just ended up going to hers. And I remember I rang the doorbell and she said to me, 'What are you doing here, you've got a game tonight haven't you?' 'I said I just walked out of there, I couldn't be bothered.' Keegan added: 'We went to play the game, no Andy Cole and we lost, and we go in Friday for training, we've got a game on Saturday. Andy poked his head round [the door] and he just said, ""Gaffer, what do I do now?"" I said, ""I'll tell you what to do, you go out, you train properly and if I think you are fit enough I will put you in the team tomorrow.""'

"No wonder England's renaissance man Paul Casey turned up at Doral yesterday for the WGC-Cadillac Championship with a broad smile on his face. Yes, it had to hurt a little that he had glorious opportunities to win the last two events on the PGA Tour and didn't close the deal in either instance. But this is a man who had fallen so far in America he hadn't registered a top-three finish here in five years, let alone two in a row. Now, after becoming the last man to earn a spot in this elite field and on the verge of earning his first invitation to the Masters for three years, it is not surprising the 37-year-old has no trouble dwelling on the positives.

'I'm fine about not winning because the first thing was to earn loads of world ranking points to get me back into the top 50,' argued Casey, who has moved from 83rd to 45th — his highest ranking since 2012. 'I'm happy on the course, happy off it, and I really think I can build on what I have achieved these past two weeks. There's better golf ahead of me.' Casey has turned his professional life around after making what he describes as 'the hardest decision of my career'. Three months ago he resigned his European Tour membership and woke to headlines proclaiming he had spurned the chance to play in the Ryder Cup, since you have to be a member to make the team. 'I understood the stories and if it hadn't involved me, it's what I would have thought,' he said. 'But I haven't given up on the Ryder Cup. Anything but. My dream is to play in several more but I just haven't figured out how to yet. 'My energy has been focused on getting back in the top 50 because that's where I will be of most use to Europe.' 37-year-old Casey secured a third-place finish at the Honda Classic as he continues his renaissance . Casey was such a European Tour loyalist he served on any number of committees. 'It was such a difficult decision to resign that I took a few months to tell my manager Guy Kinnings because I felt I was betraying him and the Tour,' said Casey. 'But I was running out of second chances. I was going back and forth across the Atlantic and it was clearly affecting my golf. 'Now I feel so relaxed knowing I don't have to run myself ragged. I can't tell you the difference it is making.' Becoming a father has also helped. Golf author Keith Elliott highlighted long ago the positive effects the 'nappy factor' can have on a top pro and Casey is another paid-up subscriber. 'The great thing is I don't take my work home with me any more,' said Casey, who lives with wife Pollyanna and infant son Lex in Arizona. 'I used to hang around the golf course all day at home wasting time but now I'm much more savvy.' The world's top 50 players get invitations at the end of this month to the Masters, so no prizes for guessing the next target for one of Europe's best ball strikers. Ranked world No 3 in 2008, it's exciting to think where this second act might take him. Casey has scaled the world rankings from 83rd up to 45th, his highest placing since 2012 .","Paul Casey is on the verge of returning to the Masters tour .

"Andy Murray finds himself with the task of killing off America in the Davis Cup on Sunday after Great Britain’s scratch pair came tantalisingly close to doing the job for him. Taking their cue from James Ward’s heroics on Friday, Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot almost mimicked his comeback before going down 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-7, 9-7 to the Bryan brothers, Mike and Bob, in another epic, this one lasting three hours and 39 minutes. It left GB leading this World Group first-round match 2-1 with two to play, but it could so nearly have been all over as the British pair shocked the sport’s most feared duo with the force of their comeback. USA's Mike and Bob Bryan celebate after holding on to win the doubles rubber in their Davis Cup clash . Dominic Inglot and Jamie Murray (right) battled back bravely from two sets down before losing decider 9-7 . The American Bryan brothers are the top ranked pairing in world doubles . British No 1 Andy Murray screams encouragement from the sidelines . Inglot and Murray put up superb resistance, spurred on by more passionate support. Inglot was impressive from the start in only his second Davis Cup tie while Jamie Murray recovered admirably from a terrible first two sets. By opting to rest Andy Murray, GB captain Leon Smith knew he could be sacrificing a doubles point, with the calculated trade-off that his No 1 player would be fresh for this afternoon’s reverse singles. He will tackle John Isner, whom he has beaten in all three meetings, and if he can extend that record, a home quarter-final will be secured against France, who have beaten Germany. Inglot plays a one-handed backhand to GB's American opponents Bob and Mike Bryan on Saturday . The Bryan brothers, representing USA at the Davis Cup, celebrate after winning a point against Great Britain . Murray celebrates after winning a vital point against the Bryan brothers during his double's match . A buoyant Jamie Murray was confident his younger brother can finish it, partly due to superior team spirit. ‘It’s pretty obvious we are a much tighter team than the US,’ he said. ‘I didn’t feel the rest of their team were cheering much, while our guys were up on every point. ‘I don’t think Isner will be back-flipping out of bed tomorrow to play Andy. I guess with his serve he has a chance but I wouldn’t bet against Andy in this situation.’ So far this tie has uncannily mirrored last year’s first round between the countries in San Diego, when Murray sealed it in the fourth rubber after the Bryans had reduced the deficit to 2-1 by the Saturday night. Inglot and Jamie Murray played together a few times as juniors but are unfamiliar as professionals. Mike Bryan plays a forehand shot as he attempts to win a point back for USA in the Davis Cup in Glasgow . Andy Murray watches on while his brother serves (left) and the GB team discuss tactics (right) Bob and Mike Bryan of the USA line up alongside Murray and Inglot of Great Britain before the match . In contrast the Bryans are almost telepathic, having won 16 Grand Slam titles. Mike Bryan had no complaints about the atmosphere but did point out that the DJ ramped up the music after the home team won a game, while playing ‘a lullaby’ when the US struck back. While Inglot did not lose his serve throughout, Murray dropped his first four service games as they lost the first two sets before another massively committed crowd of nearly 8,000. Once Murray had held early in the third he stepped his game up and they held on to take the set. GB slipped behind 3-5 in the fourth-set tiebreak but after running off the next three points, Murray converted a volley on their second set point to take it 10-8, having saved a match point at 7-8. The USA bench started to look like death row as their banker pair struggled and the decider became desperately tight. But the older Murray brother could not hold on at 7-7, and was broken, with Inglot, ranked 38 in doubles, making several mistakes that belied his previous form. The USA are still in with a chance of completing an unlikely comeback from 2-0 down but they have done that only once in 40 Davis Cup ties, and Andy Murray looks mightily up for the contest.","Bryan brothers beat Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot in five sets in Davis Cup .

"The BBC has apologised after John Inverdale made an x-rated comment during BBC Radio 5 Live's coverage of the Cheltenham Festival. While interviewing former jockey John Francome and young jockey Lizzie Kellie, the presenter referred to 'rose-c*****' glasses live on air. Speaking to Kellie, Inverdale had said: 'This is looking at it through rose-c*****... rose-tinted glasses from the past...

After the incident, a BBC spokesperson said: 'It was a slip of the tongue and John apologised immediately afterwards.' It is not the first time Inverdale, who has over 30 years' broadcasting experience, has been forced to apologise for making inappropriate comments. In 2013 he sparked outrage when he said tennis player Marion Bartoli was 'never going to be a looker' live on air before her appearance in the Wimbledon women's singles final. Inverdale later apologised to Bartoli, while also claiming his comments were in part attributable to a bout of hayfever which had left him feeling under the weather.

"This party was meant to be all about Andy Murray coming home to Scotland, but the guest of honour turned out to be the 28- year-old son of a London cabbie. Murray responded to the earsplitting support from the people who love him the most by delivering a winning start for Great Britain against America in their Davis Cup first-round knockout. But the ex-Wimbledon champion’s four-set win over Donald Young turned out to be a mere warm-up act, as Glasgow's Emirates Arena screamed on James Ward as he battled John Isner to a standstill to put the home side 2-0 up with three rubbers to play. James Ward dug out a sensational fightback against John Isner on Friday night . Andy Murray celebrates epic victory with team-mate Ward . Ward embraces Great Britain captain Leon Smith after near five-hour thriller . An emotional Ward finally clinched his sixth match point to sensationally beat the world No 20 6-7, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6, 15-13. He is transformed when in national colours. Murray seemed close to tears as he embraced him at the end of a career-best win that makes GB firm favourites to reach the quarter finals. Ward so often saves his best for Davis Cup, to the extent that it is fairly staggering to think that he has never cracked the world’s top 100. ‘This is by far the best atmosphere I’ve ever been part of in the Davis Cup,’ said Ward. ‘I’d prefer not to play five sets every time but the crowd was incredible and really helped.’ Against the USA in San Diego 13 months ago he put another tall man, Sam Querrey, to the sword with a comeback win to put Great Britain 2-0 up. Isner, though, is a tougher proposition altogether. American No 1 John Isner let slip a two-set lead against James Ward in Glasgow . World No 111 Ward did little wrong in the first two sets, except for blowing the five points that followed him going 4-2 up in the opening tiebreak. One thing apparent in this match was how Britain have got the court surface right in making it relatively slow and low, and he fashioned his rebound by keeping the ball skidding and attacking the American’s weaker backhand side. The 111-minute deciding set became a tug of war in which neither man would yield. Isner is, after all, the player who once won an 11 hour five minute match over Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon. Ward forced two match points at 5-4, one at 10-9 and one at 11-10, then needed to save two break points at 11-11 before breaking to love to clinch the match. GB captain Leon Smith said: ‘It’s really tough for the USA now but they have Jim Courier as captain and he will not let them go down without a fight.’ Andy Murray and Jamie Murray roared on James Ward to victory in five-set thriller . The question now is whether Murray will put himself on the line in today’s doubles with brother Jamie for what would be a highly charged encounter with the world champion Bryan brothers. After Ward’s win he is surely much more likely to make way for Dom Inglot and save himself for tomorrow. Murray completed the first leg of his task when he took down USA No 2 Donald Young 6-1, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 in just under two hours. Apart from an untimely dip at the end of the third set, Murray was in imperious form against world No 47 Young. By the time he had finished the warm-up the crowd had joined in a rousing singalong to Runrig’s Loch Lomond, and for Murray it was the perfect preparation. He said. ‘I used that energy and emotion very well at the beginning of the match. I had a bit of a lull but I couldn’t maintain the intensity I had in the first two sets.’ Murray compared the feel of the occasion to what he experienced at the 2012 Olympics, and he responded in much the same way. It was certainly different to the lacklustre defeat by Croatian teenager Borna Coric in Dubai last week. Murray was ever so slightly more pumped up yesterday. It might still come down to Ward in a fifth and deciding rubber, but after yesterday evening’s heroics that that may not be necessary.

"Few  would be surprised if Noel Meade's love affair with the Cheltenham Festival had turned sour and he had filed for divorce long ago. Four wins are outnumbered by a list of defeats, some of them crushing. But if you have to feel real pain to truly appreciate ultimate happiness, the Co Meath trainer could experience a legal high to catapult him over the grandstand if Road To Riches wins the Gold Cup on Friday. Road to Riches (right), ridden by Bryan Cooper, jumps the last to win The Lexus Steeplechase in December . Trainer Noel Meade has high hopes for Road To Riches in the Cheltenham Gold Cup . The winner of the Lexus Chase, who will be ridden by Bryan Cooper, is one of 18 remaining. He may have lost his place as shortest-priced Irish contender – that now is well-backed Willie Mullins-trained Djakadam - but Meade's hope is arguably the form horse from across the water. Few would have even dreamt of a Gold Cup challenge when the eight-year-old landed the Galway Plate in August. Back then he was a promising gelding beginning to bounce back from a disappointing slump thanks to a change in his diet and work routine. His only defeat since – behind Sizing Europe over two and a half miles at Gowran Park in October – came in a race that had not been on his original schedule and was a mistaken afterthought. When the gelding, owned by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, landed the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown over Christmas, defeating 2014 Gold Cup runner-up On His Own and AP McCoy's Gold Cup mount Carlingford Lough, hopes were raised that Meade might finally secure the feature Festival prize he craves. Bryan Cooper celebrates after riding Road to Riches to victory at the 2014 Leopardstown Christmas Festival . Meade celebrates after Road To Riches win the Galway Plate, ridden by Shane Shortfall (right) Meade, the seven-time Irish champion trainer who started training in 1970, saddled Harbour Pilot to twice finish third in the Gold Cup behind Best Mate. He said: 'Anyone who trains a jumping horse wants to win the Gold Cup. I would rather win one Gold Cup than 10 Grand Nationals. To me that is just an ordinary race compared to the Gold Cup. 'The Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle, they are the two cherries.' The latter race was a 'cherry' that was picked out of Meade's back pocket in 2005 when Harchibald cruised up to Hardy Eustace with long-time jockey ally Paul Carberry sitting motionless. It looked done and dusted until, in a dramatic final 50 yards, the rallying reigning champion trained by the late Dessie Hughes got his head back in front. It was a result as tough to take for Meade as the short-head 1998 Arkle Chase defeat of Hill Society by Martin Pipe's Champleve when he was still searching for his first Festival winner. Meade-trained Harbour Pilot (right) twice finished third behind Best Mate in the Gold Cup . Harchibald's (left) capitulation to Hardy Eustace in the 2005 Champio Hurdle was hard to take for Meade . Meade said: 'Harchie was the one that hurt the most. He was going to win and then didn't. I was watching with Dessie and he was nearly congratulating me. He had his hand on my shoulder and then, the next moment, it was just like someone had pulled a trap door from underneath me. 'Hill Society was also tough. Martin came over and said I am sure you have won but, luckily, Richard Dunwoody had ridden mine and said he thought we were beat. But the photo-finish went on for so long. 'When they called the result, I walked straight out and went back to the car park. 'I talked to the attendant for half an hour about the joys of parking cars at Cheltenham. It just me got away from the whole thing.' The disappointments meant Meade became used to a familiar refrain before each Festival. The trainer said: 'The same thing would start. 'Noel Meade has never had a winner' and at Cheltenham previews some fella in the audience would start getting on to you. You'd say it didn't bother you but of course it did.' Meade finally scored a Cheltenham winner with Sausalito Bay's victory in the 2000 Novice's Hurdle . When Sausalito Bay finally cracked the Festival for Meade, he knelt down and kissed the turf in the winner's enclosure that had eluded him . It is where he would love to be again and the trainer, who was hit hard by the recession, seeing his string half in number from a high of 150 horses, reckons he is bringing one of his strongest ever teams. There is Wounded Warrior in Monday's National Hunt Chase, Very Wood, winner of last year's Albert Bartlett Novices' Hurdle, in Wednesday's RSA Chase and Apache Stronghold, the 'big white hope' and rated a future Gold Cup contender, in Thursday's JLT Novices' Chase. But it is Gold that Meade seeks most and he reckons he might be on the right road. 'Favourite Silviniaco Conti is the form horse but I don't think there is an awful lot between the Irish,' he said. 'My horse lost his way as a novice but we always thought stamina would be his forte and no horse was staying on better in the Lexus.'","Road To Riches will be competing for the Gold Cup at Cheltenham .

"Taulupe Faletau believes winning the RBS 6 Nations title this year would top Wales' comeback triumph of 2013. Two years ago Wales became the first team to win the championship after losing their first game and history could repeat itself should Warren Gatland's side overcome Grand Slam-chasing Ireland at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. Wales lost their first game of the 2015 championship to England in Cardiff but back-to-back wins in Scotland and France have put them back into title contention. Taulupe Faletau takes on the French defence during his side's victory in Paris in round three . '2013 was great and the win against England at the end was probably the most satisfying I've had,' said British and Irish Lions number eight Faletau. 'To lose the first game in 2013 [to Ireland] and to have people on your backs and knocking you down... then to come back from that as a team was great. 'When the final whistle went against England it was amazing, but if we could replicate that it would probably be even better. 'Just doing it again I think would make it better.' Wales' title hopes seemed a distant dream when England recovered from a first-half deficit in the tournament opener to run out 21-16 winners. But successive wins on the road in Edinburgh and Paris have lifted Welsh spirits before confronting impressive Irish opponents who have already recorded victories over Italy, France and England. Faletau brings down France prop Uini Atonio as Warren Gatland's side triumphed at the Stade de France . 'The boys put a good shift in and we got the result we wanted in Paris,' Faletau said of last weekend's Stade de France success. 'It was a good day at the office for the pack and the platform we had at the scrum, especially for me, was noticeable. 'It's what we want going forward and the longer we spend together the more we seem to get better. 'Hopefully we can build on last weekend and keep our tournament alive.' Faletau seems set to lock horns again with his old Lions team-mate Jamie Heaslip as the Ireland number eight is on course to make a dramatic return from injury. Heaslip cracked three vertebrae when he was kneed in the back by France lock Pascal Pape in Dublin last month, but Faletau believes Ireland will do everything in their power to have the Leinster man available at the Millennium Stadium. Faletau seems set to lock horns again with his old Lions team-mate Jamie Heaslip in Cardiff on Saturday . 'He's a great guy and a great player who's made a name for himself for many years now,' Faletau said.

'But there's another 14 players you've got to stop as well and Ireland are definitely favourites.

Tuohy trudged out of Ireland's 26-3 Six Nations victory over Wales in Dublin last year, suffering his first arm fracture just nine minutes after joining the second-half fray. The former Gloucester and Exeter tight-five forward missed out as Ireland clinched the 2014 Six Nations title, before being ruled out of the autumn Tests after suffering another broken arm. The luckless lock is back fit and firing again however, and will be keen to make an impression as Ireland gear up to face Wales in Cardiff on Saturday. Tuohy will find it tough going to break the match day 23 for the Millennium Stadium clash, with captain Paul O'Connell and Devin Toner inked in to start, with Iain Henderson impressing from the bench. Forwards: . M Bent (Leinster), R Best (Ulster), S Cronin, T Furlong, C Healy, J Heaslip (all Leinster), I Henderson (Ulster), M McCarthy, J McGrath, M Moore, J Murphy, S O'Brien (all Leinster), P O'Connell, T O'Donnell, P O'Mahony (all Munster), M Ross, D Ryan, R Strauss, D Toner (all Leinster), D Tuohy (Ulster).

"England face a nervous run-chase to avoid the ignominy of being eliminated from the World Cup at the first hurdle after Bangladesh posted a challenging total here at the Adelaide Oval this morning. Mahmudullah, who had never scored a one-day international hundred in his eight-year career, hit the first century by a Bangladeshi in any World Cup as they reached 275 for seven, their highest one-day score against England, in this winner takes all Group A match. Only a direct hit from Chris Woakes to run out Mahmudullah ended a partnership of 141 with Mushfiqur Rahim that gives Bangladesh real hope of progressing to the quarter-finals at England’s expense. It had all looked so positive for England when Jimmy Anderson took two wickets in his first seven balls to reduce Bangladesh to eight for two after Eoin Morgan had won the toss and elected to bowl on Adelaide’s drop-in pitch. But Bangladesh recovered so well, with the ‘mighty atom’ Rahim eventually falling to Stuart Broad for 89, that England will face a tense chase if they are to avoid what would arguably be the worst of their many woeful World Cups. Now England, who brought in Alex Hales and Chris Jordan for Gary Ballance and Steven Finn, keep to hold their nerve against Bangladesh’s array of spinners if they are to live to fight another day in this World Cup. They really should be able to reach this target with ease but so low is confidence after three shattering defeats by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka in this tournament that nothing can be guaranteed.","England will find themselves out of the World Cup with defeat .

"Everton midfielder Leon Osman has declared himself fit and raring to go after completing 90 minutes for The Toffees' Under 21s side against Sunderland. The 33-year-old spent nearly three months on the sidelines earlier this season after sustaining a split tendon during the Premier League game with Manchester City back in December. Osman made cameo appearances from the substitutes' bench in Everton's recent 3-1 win over Young Boys and 2-0 defeat by Stoke, but now having managed a full run out for the Under 21s, he is hoping to reclaim his starting spot. Everton midfielder Leon Osman (pictured in 2014) has declared himself fit and raring to go for The Toffees . Osman made a cameo appearance from the substitutes' bench during the 2-0 defeat by Stoke City . Speaking on Thursday to EvertonTV, Osman said, 'It's important for me to get as many minutes as I can on the pitch.' He added, 'The games came quick and close together, but I'm just trying to get myself out there as much as I can. 'It was good to get more minutes under my belt, I'm trying to get that last little bit of sharpness and hopefully then I can show that on the pitch for the first team.' Now, Osman is hoping to be involved from the off for Everton when they face Dynamo Kyiv in the last 16 tie of the Europa League next week. Osman was also used as a substitute against Young Boys during the Europa League round of 32 . While The Toffees have performed well in continental competition this season, the same cannot be said for their Premier League form, which seems them sit 14th in the table and with three losses in their last four games. Osman has revealed how frustrating that poor run has been for the team, and has issued a rallying cry to improve. 'It's not great being out injured for any player, I'm especially bad when I'm out injured and it's even harder when things aren't going well on the pitch for the team. 'But we're in it as a team. We're in it together whether you're injured, or if you're playing every week. We've got 10 tough games now before the end of the season, but 10 games we're very confident of getting results from.'

"Playing Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals holds no fears for Doneil Henry - providing he does not have to take the train to Anfield. The Canadian's whirlwind beginning to life at Blackburn looks set to continue with a starting spot on Sunday. Injury problems in defence prompted Rovers boss Gary Bowyer to take Henry on a month's loan from West Ham on Wednesday, the same day they played Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship. Three hours after meeting his team-mates for the first time, Henry walked out onto the pitch at Hillsborough and was instrumental in the victory that just about keeps Blackburn's play-off hopes alive. Doneil Henry made a good start to his Blackburn career after joining on loan from West Ham . Henry said: 'I got a call from the manager in the morning and I was told I was going on loan and I was hopefully playing that night. 'I had to collect my stuff from Upton Park, sign some paperwork and then be on a train. I got on the wrong train, asked the ticket man if it was going to Sheffield to find out I had to get off and get on another train. 'After that finally I recognised some people in Blackburn kit at the train station and from there I was in safe hands. I met the team, did pre-game stuff and then just played. 'I was just really happy to play. It's been a while. I knew me thinking too much wouldn't be good, I just wanted to get on the pitch as soon as possible and establish myself in the team.' Henry began his career at home-town club Toronto and joined West Ham in January after being recommended to Hammers boss Sam Allardyce by former Toronto manager Ryan Nelsen. Nelsen played for Allardyce at Blackburn, where he was captain and a hugely popular figure. Canadian international Henry joined West Ham in January from MLS side Toronto . 'It was funny coming to Blackburn and walking through the facility and then seeing him amongst the boards,' said Henry. 'Ryan has been a mentor since he came to Toronto. He really has a lot of faith in me and has really guided me along my journey. I knew he was a big figure here and he was a solid defender everywhere he went. 'Junior Hoilett also played here, who's a close friend of mine, so I knew it would be a good move for me.' The 21-year-old has never been to Anfield before but did face Liverpool on their pre-season tour to North America in 2012. He knows securing the win needed to get to Wembley will be a huge task but has been impressed by the togetherness of the squad. Henry played against Liverpool in America in a pre-season game - but has never been to Anfield . Henry said: 'I'm still getting familiar with a lot of the guys but on the pitch it was great because there was constant chatter and communication and I just thought they believed in me from the get-go. 'When we get the test on Sunday, I think we'll definitely be ready. There's a lot of quality players in here so I think if we can go there and do our job, as long as we stay together as a team, it's definitely possible to get a result. 'I'm not going to shy away from the opportunity. These are the games where you can really see how far you are from the top level.' Bowyer is definitely without three defenders in injured trio Jason Lowe, Shane Duffy and Alex Baptiste, while Grant Hanley is a major doubt. But the Rovers boss has total faith in his new man, saying: 'Full credit to him and his character. 'He's been brought in to play games for us and we have to thank West Ham for allowing him to come to us. Everybody at West Ham spoke very highly of him and his performance on Wednesday backed that up. 'We wouldn't have any problems playing him on Sunday against Liverpool.'","Doneil Henry joined Blackburn Rovers on loan from West Ham .

"Alex Bruce has defended his dad Steve over the touchline bust-up with Gus Poyet – a spat which could yet land the two managers in trouble with the Football Association. The FA were last night going through referee Mike Dean's report of the unsavoury incident - which came during Tuesday's 1-1 draw between Hull and Sunderland at the KC Stadium – and could decide to bring charges against the pair. Poyet protested at Dean's decision to book Jack Rodwell for diving by kicking over a drinks carrier. He was sent to the stands by Dean before sarcastically applauding in Bruce's face and directing a comment which the Tigers boss later said was 'not very pleasant'. Hull City boss Steve Bruce (left) was involved in a touchline row with Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet . The two men argued after Sunderland midfielder Jack Rodwell was booked for simulation . Steve Bruce's son Alex (left) did not appear to make contact with Rodwell (right), who fell to the floor . That provoked a reaction from Bruce, who had to be restrained by the assistant referee as he attempted to get at the Uruguayan. Bruce Jnr was the defender who challenged Rodwell before the dive which sparked the clash, and he said: 'I didn't touch him. If that's what Gus was unhappy about then he was wrong, because I didn't touch him. He was just too quick for me.' Bruce has also attempted to play down the subsequent confrontation between his dad and Poyet. 'It was just handbags,' he said. 'In games like that there's always going to be a bit of a hoo-ha. It was a big game that everyone wants to win. 'Temperatures were high and I'm sure all the supporters enjoyed it.' Meanwhile, Bruce has accused Rodwell of using his arm to score Sunderland's late equaliser. 'I saw it. I was claiming for it when he put it in,' he said. 'To be honest, I thought it was going in anyway. He didn't need to touch it but he definitely put it in with his arm as it went in. 'We can't be too down about it. At least we weren't been beaten, that's the main thing, and that point could yet be crucial.' The incident during Hull's 1-1 draw with Sunderland could see both men punished by the FA . Alex Bruce has since attempted to play down the row between his father and Poyet . The 1-1 draw leaves both sides still fighting for their Premier League survival this season .

"Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara pointed the finger of blame at ref Craig Thomson after Paul Paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1-1 draw with Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Paton was astonished to be shown a red card along with Virgil van Dijk after the Dutchman and Calum Butcher clashed on the ground following a poor tackle by Celtic captain Scott Brown on Nadir Ciftci – who appeared to kick Brown’s head in retaliation. McNamara vowed to appeal in a bid to clear Paton for next Sunday’s League Cup final against Ronny Deila’s men at Hampden, and it remains to be seen whether SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan will take retrospective action against Butcher, Ciftci or Brown, with TV pictures indicating they could all have seen red. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara wasn't impressed with referee Craig Thomson's performance . Paul Paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1-1 draw with Celtic . But the United boss claimed that, had the match official sent off Brown for the initial challenge, the ensuing melee and embarrassing card blunder would have been avoided. ‘I think we will be appealing,’ said McNamara, whose team were reduced to nine men in the second half when Paul Dixon was sent off for handling the ball in the box. ‘Paul Paton feels a bit hard done to for being sent off for nothing. He wasn’t even involved in the incident. But I think the ref should have dealt with the original bad challenge (from Brown) that sparked the whole thing off. But that went unnoticed. It was a two-footed challenge off the deck. It was a bad onebut it didn’t get dealt with properly. ‘We should be talking about the football rather than the ugly scenes. But, for me, the officials should have dealt with it first and we would not have had the problems we had today.’ Asked if he expects Brown to be hit with disciplinary action from the SFA, McNamara replied: ‘No comment.’ Ciftci scored United’s opener on the stroke of half time after Aiden Connolly appeared to go down easily in the box, with Celtic boss Deila later insisting the player should be punished for diving. Three minutes after the break, United’s Dixon was dismissed for blocking a goal-bound drive by Leigh Griffiths but the striker’s penalty was saved by keeper Radoslaw Cierzniak. Thomson ended up sending three players off, and United will appeal the red card of Paton . Griffiths had the last laugh, however, with a headed equaliser in the 71st minute to take the match to a replay at Parkhead on March 18. Ciftci was lucky to still be on the park after kicking out at Brown but McNamara claimed not to have seen the incident. ‘I need to see it. I haven’t looked back at the TV footage. And when Nadir gets tackled by Brown, the ball breaks and Butcher wins the challenge to put us through and I was looking at that next bit of play. I did not see what happened with van Dijk, Butcher or anyone else. I actually didn’t know the ref had got the wrong man until Paton came over and told me. It was a melee but the ref did not deal with the original bad challenge which sparked it all off.’ McNamara, whose side will now face Celtic four times in March, also defended young striker Connolly. ‘I don’t think he dived,’ he said. ‘I think he (Anthony Stokes) has caught him although he hasn’t caught him on the leg. It might have been soft but it was a penalty.’ McNamara had no complaints about the spot-kick award and red card when Dixon handled a shot by Griffiths. ‘Rules are rules but Rado made a great save. He didn’t deserve to lose a goal today. But we switched off for one moment and Griffiths peels off and scores a header. ‘We can take certain things from today’s game but Celtic will be saying the same. Cool heads will be needed for the final next week. The disciplinary side needs to be better. ‘It’s a chance for silverware and for the lads to create a bit of history. Will I be sick of the sight of Celtic by the end of our four games this month? Not if we beat them.’","Paul Paton was sent off in a case of mistaken identity .

"Ronny Deila has branded Dundee United’s Aidan Connolly a diver - then called on the SFA to prove they don’t just punish Celtic players for simulation. Connolly tumbled to win United’s goal from the penalty spot - scored by Nadir Ciftci - towards the end of the first half after ref Craig Thomson deemed he had been tripped by Anthony Stokes. In August, Celtic winger Derk Boerrigter was handed a two-match ban for diving to win a penalty in a 2-0 win at St Johnstone. And Deila insisted he was baffled as to why it’s only his team that is targeted – albeit he was seemingly unaware St Johnstone’s Brian Graham was also suspended for diving to win a penalty against Inverness in December. Celtic manager Ronny Deila wants retrospective action after claiming Aidan Connolly dived to win a penalty . The referee points to the spot after Connolly was brought down in the Celtic box during Scottish Cup clash . Celtic keeper Craig Gordon fails to stop Nadir Ciftci from giving Dundee United the lead at Tannadice . ‘The United penalty was a dive and hopefully it will be the same rules for everybody,’ fumed Deila. ‘We are the only team this season in the league to have a suspension for diving, Derk Boerrigter. ‘I said at the time it was no problem because that is the line that will be taken by everyone. But I don’t think anybody has had it since then. The Scottish players have been unbelievably good. They’ve not dived but if they do (like Connolly) it should be the same rules. ‘Is it the fault of the ref or the player they got a penalty? It’s both. But I accept people make mistakes. We have a rule where people look at things afterwards but I don’t see anybody else getting suspensions.’ Celtic defender Virgil van Dyke (right) was sent off after only nine minutes of the Scottish Cup quarter-final . In what appeared to be a case of mistaken identity, the referee also sent off Dundee United's Paul Paton . Dundee United had a second player sent off after Paul Dixon (3rd left) receives his marching orders . Deila will study footage of the melee that saw Virgil van Dijk ordered off alongside Paul Paton before deciding whether to appeal in a bid to clear him for Sunday’s League Cup final against United at Hampden. But Stefan Johansen will miss the Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead on March 18 after being booked yesterday. ‘I have looked at some pictures but it’s hard to see what happened,’ said Deila. ‘Virgil just said there was a tackle and suddenly somebody was holding his legs. There was some kicking of each other to get off each other. It was nothing. 'Hopefully everybody can play in the next game. Will we appeal? We will see. I actually didn’t know until now that Stefan is out of the replay. It’s good we have a big squad.’ Leigh Griffiths missed his chance to equalise for Celtic from the penalty spot . Griffiths made up for his penalty miss by drawing Celtic level with a header . Celtic captain Scott Brown celebrates with Griffiths as the game finishes in a 1-1 draw . Deila didn’t fear any further disciplinary problems in the final but took a swipe at the abysmal Tannadice pitch. ‘There is going to be a high temperature, yes, but I’m not worried. It is fantastic. That’s why we love football. We are fighting for big things, trophies, and we have to keep our discipline. But the pitch made it a fight today. It was nothing about playing football. If you are going to develop players in this league, you have to have pitches you can play on.’ Meanwhile, the SFA compliance officer could be forced to look at footage from Dutch TV in which Celtic’s John Guidetti is alleged to have performed a song during an interview including the words ‘the huns are deid’. A recent petition lobbying the Scottish Parliament was launched by a group of Rangers fans who claimed ‘huns’ is a derogatory term used against Protestants.","William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-final ended in a 1-1 draw at Tannadice .

"The Football Association will wait on referee Mike Dean's report before deciding whether to take action against Steve Bruce or Gus Poyet for their touchline spat on Tuesday night. Dean's report is due in to the FA on Wednesday, meaning if action is taken against the Hull and Sunderland managers it will be announced on Thursday at the earliest. Sunderland boss Poyet has refused to apologise for the behaviour which saw him sent off during the 1-1 draw at the KC Stadium. Hull boss Steve Bruce (left) and Sunderland's Gus Poyet (right) will find out if they will be charged this week . Bruce is held back by the assistant referee during his clash with Poyet on the touchline . Things turned sour when Bruce and Poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart . Poyet was dismissed for kicking over a cooler box before clashing on the touchline with Bruce. The rival bosses were only kept apart by the assistant referee and both could face further sanction should the FA investigate the clash which was sparked when Poyet sarcastically applauded in Bruce’s face. But the Uruguayan blamed Dean for his reaction after he booked Jack Rodwell for diving. Poyet said: ‘Kicking a bottle of water is nothing serious. ‘I was not happy with Paul McShane (Hull defender) dancing like he was in the theatre, or like he’d been shot, and won a free-kick before that. ‘Jack then dived and got a free-kick against him, I just want fairness. ‘I have no regrets whatsoever. I now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me.’ Jack Rodwell appeals for a foul but is booked for diving, a decision that led to Poyet's reaction . The two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other . As the pair locked horns Bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in Poyet's direction . Poyet's side were lucky to escape with a point and will be fined £25,000 by the FA after six of their players were booked, including Lee Cattermole who picked up a two-game ban following his 10th yellow of the season. Bruce, meanwhile, did not reveal what Poyet had said to provoke his furious reaction. But he admitted it had been unsavoury. ‘I think it’s right that I keep what he said to myself,’ he said. ‘But it wasn’t very pleasant. It wasn’t “have a nice evening, Steve”. ‘But I don’t know why I reacted like that. We all do stupid things but it was handbags. ‘I thank the assistant referee for stepping in. I’ll have to buy him a beer. ‘I just think Gus had seen it differently about Rodwell diving. But the referee got it right. ‘All I said to his assistant was that Rodwell had dived. ‘These things happen in the heat of the moment. Grown men acting like a couple of children. They happen in big games. Let’s forget about it and go and have a glass of wine.’ Poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game . The 47-year-old watches on with interest as his side searched for the equaliser at the KC Stadium . The result moves Hull five points clear of the relegation zone with Sunderland a point behind. And Bruce said: ‘We’re making a fist of it and I would say that is a point gained. We’re six clear of the relegation zone now if you take into account our goal difference. ‘We have to remember it’s our second season in the league. For Sunderland they’ve been there for eight.’ Dame N’Doye opened the scoring in the first half before Rodwell levelled late on, although the ball appeared to go in via his arm. Bruce said: ‘I didn’t see it to be honest, but if Rodwell has said he handled it then I suppose he did. These things happen.’ Hull striker Dame N'Doye (far left) shoots from inside the area to put the Tigers 1-0 up at home to Sunderland .

"Kevin Pietersen has yet to consider Leicestershire's bold attempt to sign him for this summer's NatWest T20 Blast. After new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted last weekend there is still a possibility of a return to international cricket for the record-breaking batsman, sacked last year, the first definite attempt by a county to secure his services surfaced on Friday. Leicestershire chief executive Wasim Khan told Cricinfo he had been in touch with Pietersen's advisers about the possibility of signing the 34-year-old between his existing commitments at the Indian and Caribbean premier leagues. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Pietersen's agent confirmed an initial discussion did take place, but added it was 'some time ago'. Leicestershire's gambit therefore appears to pre-date Graves' remarks, in which he indicated Pietersen's return to county cricket - as a pre-requisite of being considered again for England - would need to encompass all formats, rather than just Twenty20. Wasim told Cricinfo: 'I approached his agent about his T20 availability. 'But he said it was unlikely he would play any T20 (in England) due to his full CPL commitments.' The former England batsman pictured watching QPR's 2-1 defeat by Arsenal on Wednesday night . Pietersen's agent said: 'I haven't had a conversation with Kevin about Leicestershire - it is not something we have discussed.' Pietersen, who was axed by the ECB 13 months ago after England's 2013/14 Ashes whitewash defeat and described by his employers' managing director Paul Downton as 'disengaged', has since published an autobiography in which he is very critical of several former team-mates and management staff. He played for Surrey in last year's domestic T20 competition, but was de-registered by them at the end of the season.

"League One and Two clubs have been asked to consider proposals allowing Premier League Under-21 clubs to take part in the Football League Trophy. Clubs were very much against the addition of Premier League B teams to the Football League pyramid when it was suggested in June 2014, and this has now been put forward as an alternative. The proposal was one of many aired at a recent meeting at St George's Park to discuss issues arising from the FA Chairman's England Commission. The Johnstone's Paint Trophy could involve Premier League 'B' teams in future if plans get the go-ahead . Youth squads from the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea could soon be headed for the lower-tier cup . If the Football League do bring 'B' teams into the Johnstone's Paint Trophy, they could adopt a similar format to that suggested by Greg Dyke last year, meaning teams would: . It would see a change in format for the Trophy, with a group system being brought in. A statement from the Football League clarifying the situation read: 'Clubs have been asked to consider the concept of permitting 16 U21 teams from clubs with category one academies to participate in The Football League Trophy. 'The competition would feature 16 groups of four teams with one U21 team in each group, before a knockout stage leading to a final at Wembley Stadium. 'Given the previous concerns of the League and its clubs about Premier League B teams playing in the pyramid, any final proposal would also be accompanied by a change to the League's Articles of Association that would protect the current 72 club constitution, save for any changes to promotion/relegation that clubs wished to make. 'Therefore, having provided them with this comfort, clubs willingly debated the potential commercial, financial and player development benefits of having U21 teams in this competition from 2015/16. Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson holds the trophy last year - but a youth coach win it in future . Fans head to Wembley Stadium for the show-piece final of last year's competition in March . 'No formal proposals were tabled and no formal vote taken. 'Instead, League One and Two clubs were asked to indicate whether they were content to see The Football League progress the matter, which would include discussions with the Premier League and Football Association, so that clubs can consider a full proposal at a future point. 'Therefore, as yet, no club has voted in favour or against the idea of having U21 teams in The Football League Trophy, they have only indicated whether they wish to consider the matter further. 'Ultimately any changes to this competition will only happen with the support of League One and Two clubs.' What is the Football League Trophy? More commonly known as the Johnstone's Paint Trophy because of its sponsor, the Football League Trophy is a competition for the clubs of League One and League Two. The competition is divided into North and South sections and runs in a knockout format to a final staged at Wembley. This year's final will be played between Bristol City and Walsall on March 22. Peterborough United beat Chesterfield 3-1 in last season's final. What is a category one academy? Those clubs who have academies graded at the highest level under the Elite Player Performance Plan, an initiative introduced in 2011 by the Premier League to improve the quality and quantity of home-grown players in England. Category One academies have high contact time with young players, require a minimum of 18 full-time staff and an operational budget of £2.5m or more. Which clubs fall into this category? Those that compete in the Barclays U21 Premier League are category one. There are 24 clubs. In Division One: Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Leicester City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Norwich City, Southampton, Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United. In Division Two: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Brighton and Hove Albion, Derby County, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United, Reading, Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers. How would this work? 16 of these under 21 sides would enter the JPT. The initial part would see 16 groups of four teams, with one under 21 team in each. It would then be followed by a knockout stage culminating in the Wembley final. Would it be fair? The current rules for the Under 21 Premier League allow teams to field three overage outfield players and one overage goalkeeper. That's why you will sometimes see a player returning from injury or struggling for form playing in an under 21 match. So the Football League clubs would predominantly be playing against teenage players but potentially with the odd big name thrown in. Of course, the rules could be altered. How would it fit into the calendar? While some Football League clubs take the Trophy seriously, it is viewed by many as a distraction from the league and other, more prestigious Cup competitions. Some clubs have fielded weakened sides in the competitions in the past. Crowds are also significantly lower than in other competitions, with a day out at Wembley the main attraction. For the under 21 teams, the games would have to be shoehorned in between Premier League games, the Under 21 Premier League Cup and the Under 21 International Cup.

"David Luiz showed he was back in a familiar place on Tuesday ahead of PSG's clash with Chelsea in the Champions League last-16 second leg on Wednesday night. Luiz returns to Stamford Bridge having played there between 2011 and 2014, and is looking to spoil his former club's chances of reaching the next round. The Brazil defender posted a photograph on his Instagram and wrote: 'Right time to be back! #LondonCity #Amazing #BigBen #BeautifulDay'.

PSG are in town to face Premier League leaders Chelsea as they go head to head in the Champions League . Luiz posted the snap after warning Chelsea they won't achieve success by simply sitting back when the two sides meet. The first leg of the Champions League tie ended 1-1, meaning a goalless draw would be enough to send Jose Mourinho's side through to the next round. But Luiz feels it would be foolish of his old club to invite pressure on themselves, considering the strength of the Ligue 1 champions' attacking options. 'I know how Jose (Mourinho) will prepare for this, he will be telling the boys to be patient and hit us on the counter attack,' Luiz told The Mirror. 'He knows that we need to score and that they don't, I know that is his way. We must be careful because I know that Chelsea have the ability to hurt on the counter attack, but they must be careful as well. 'To sit back and just defend against Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), (Edinson) Cavani and (Ezequiel) Lavezzi can also be very dangerous, so it is not just us who have to be careful.'

"Manchester United are to go without a trophy for two seasons for the first time in 26 years. Louis van Gaal's team were beaten 2-1 by Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final on Monday night, meaning United will now concentrate on qualifying for the Champions League instead. It makes this their longest run without winning the FA Cup since between 1963 and 1977, and Van Gaal is breaking all the unwanted records in his debut season at Old Trafford. Manchester United are to go without a trophy for two seasons for the first time in 26 years .

"Real Madrid might be feeling the heat from Barcelona in the La Liga title race, but it doesn't seem to be placing too much pressure on  Neymar and Co. Barca closed the gap at the top of the table to two points last weekend, and face Rayo Vallecano this weekend hoping that a Real slip-up could send them top. But while the pressure has been heaped on the European champions, Barcelona players Neymar, Adriano, Dani Alves and Douglas looked relaxed on Friday. Neymar posted this picture on Instagram of him and his team-mates at Barcelona's training ground . The Brazilian star scored on Wednesday in Barca's 3-1 win over Villarreal in the Copa del Rey . Neymar - suspended for Sunday's visit of Rayo - posted a picture of the quartet on Instagram after finishing off a training session at Barca's Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper base. That came after Neymar was called up to Brazil's squad for their upcoming friendlies against France and Chile - with manager Dunga being questioned over whether his side was too reliant on their star man. 'Since he has been designated captain of the team, he has had an upgrade on his level of football,' Dunga said of Neymar. Neymar has been training with Barca ahead of facing Rayo Vallecano with the hope of closing a league gap . 'He likes challenges, the more responsibility he has, the more he will develop and get better. 'We are very happy to have him; he is doing fantastic things in Europe. 'Our priority is first to have a strong collective, and then as a second step, one outstanding player can naturally differentiate himself and help us to be better.'

"Brazil coach Dunga has recalled Real Madrid full back Marcelo for friendlies against France and Chile later this month in a squad he said mixed blend youth and experience. There were no surprises in the squad, his last before the Copa America in June, with all 23 players having some international experience, including Fabinho, the 21-year old Monaco right back. 'Marcelo is a regular again at Real Madrid, he has experience in World Cups with Brazil and we are trying to cast a wide net,' Dunga said. 'We are mixing youth and experience.' Brazil coach Dunga has selected his latest squad ahead of international friendlies against France and Chile . 'We brought Fabinho in before and we hope he can get a run of matches with Monaco. He is a right back but has been playing midfield in Monaco.' Brazil face France in Paris on March 26 and Chile at the Emirates stadium in London three days later. Dunga also recalled Sao Paulo midfielder Souza and Santos forward Robinho. Striker Diego Tardelli was the only one of the three Brazilian players who recently signed for Chinese and Arab clubs to make the squad. Marcelo, the Real Madrid full back, is included in the squad having been left out in previous selections . 'They are starting the pre-season, we haven't seen them on a daily basis,' he said of the other two, Everton Ribeiro and Ricardo Goulart. 'So we reduced the risk by not choosing players who are not at peak condition. We wanted players who are already up to a competitive speed.' Dunga took command of the Brazil team for the second time in July, just days after Brazil were dumped out their own World Cup 7-1 by Germany. He has won all six of his matches in charge, conceding just one goal. The March fixtures will be the last before Dunga announces his squad for the Copa America in Chile in June.

"Angel di Maria must deliver performances worthy of his £60million price tag if Manchester United are to achieve their goal of Champions League football, according to Gary Neville. Di Maria has failed to live up to his early promise in a Manchester United shirt since his big-money move from Real Madrid in the summer. And former Manchester United defender Neville is sympathetic to the reasons why the Argentina international has struggled over the last eight months at Old Trafford – but says it is time for him to deliver. Angel Di Maria struggled to make an impact on Manchester United's game at Newcastle . Di Maria looks dejected after he was take off at St James' Park . Adnan Januzaj came on to replace Di Maria on Wednesday night in Newcastle . Di Maria has struggled to live up to his £60m price tag in recent months . Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, Neville cites the burglary of Di Maria’s house at the end of January, his lack of English and coming to terms with the fact he did not want to leave the Bernabeu in the summer as some of the reasons why he has been off the boil. Neville said: ‘I fully expected Di Maria and Luke Shaw to form a devastating partnership down the left flank and, even at close to £60m, I had no thoughts whatsoever that his signing was a risk. ‘When he dribbled down the wing at the King Power Stadium before chipping the Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to score his second goal in three games since arriving from Madrid, the United fan in me was so excited and I was thinking, ‘Here we go!’ Di Maria has had a difficult few months at Manchester United after his great start to life at Old Trafford . Di Maria did not want to leave Real Madrid in the summer but was sold to United for £60m . ‘It was an example of everything I expected Di Maria to bring to the Premier League - pace, audacity and a moment of magic capable of turning a game. ‘But since that day, Di Maria has scored just two more goals - one of them coming against Yeovil in the FA Cup - and he has quite simply looked a shadow of his former self.’ ‘He has come to United when he did not want to leave Madrid, has suffered the trauma of a burglary, and started to work for a new manager while playing in a team that is still in a ‘storm’ phase of development. Di Maria scored an excellent goal for United away at Leicester earlier in the season . ‘All of those are factors that would go some way to explaining why Di Maria has struggled after his bright start, but I feel as though I have a parrot on either shoulder, with one telling me to give the benefit of the doubt because of those reasons while the other is saying that, actually, the time has come for a £60m player to deliver.' United are still in the top four of the Premier League and face Arsenal at Old Trafford in the Sixth Round of the FA Cup. And if Louis van Gaal’s side are to end the season on a high then Neville says Di Maria will be required to play a major role. He added: ‘If United are to achieve their aims this season, primarily Champions League qualification, Di Maria is going to have to rid himself of the complexities that have emerged over the past eight months and escape the demons that are playing on his mind.’","Angel di Maria has been substituted in recent games for Man United .

"Southampton have jetted off to Switzerland for a break ahead of what James Ward-Prowse believes are the 10 biggest matches in the club's history. Saints' late, and somewhat fortuitous, victory against Crystal Palace on Tuesday evening got them back to winning way after their remarkable season started to go off kilter. The latest in a line of disjointed displays looked set to cost Ronald Koeman's men, only for Sadio Mane to strike late on to secure a 1-0 win which moved them back to within a point of the top-four. James Ward-Prowse (front) uploaded an image to Instagram of the Southampton team on the plane . Sadio Mane (centre) scores the decisive goal as Southampton beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Tuesday . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has taken the squad to Switzerland fora team break . It means Champions League qualification remains a realistic - and scarcely-believable - prospect for Saints, whose players flew to Switzerland on Wednesday for a break ahead of what Ward-Prowse knows is a crunch period. 'I think it will be great to just have a good time, the pressure of the Premier League is massive, especially where we are in the table,' the midfielder said. 'It's good to get away, put our feet up and have a bit of a laugh with the group. It should be a good bit of fun and then we'll move on from there . 'These next 10 games are probably the biggest in the club's history and we're determined as a group of players to make history for the club. 'We want to get us to the biggest stage in the world where we feel we belong with the best teams and best players in the world.' Next up for Southampton is the unenviable task of a trip to Chelsea on March 15 - a match Ward-Prowse will hope to be starting after his telling impact against Palace. The England Under 21 midfielder was brought on in a bid to inject some fresh impetus into Saints' toiling attack and had the desired impact, producing the shot which led to Mane clipping home. 'We reflected on the win in the changing room and we believe it's going to be a pivotal three points come the end of the season,' Ward-Prowse told Southampton's official YouTube channel . 'We haven't been on the best of runs lately and it's great to obviously get the three points and move forward. You could feel the whole stadium was pleased. 'It wasn't a pretty performance, not a vintage Southampton display, but we dug deep, the fans got behind us and I think we showed great character.' Southampton's displays have been inconsistent lately but Mane's goal keeps  their Champions League hopes . Ward-Prowse believes the final 10 league games of the season are the biggest in Southampton's history . While Ward-Prowse deserved credit for the run and shot that led to Mane's goal, it would not have got that far had Julian Speroni dealt with the initial attempt. The long-serving Palace goalkeeper could only parry Ward-Prowse's shot into the Senegal winger's path, but defender Scott Dann stood up for his team-mate after the costly mistake. 'You can't just point the finger at Jules,' he said. 'He has kept us in games at times this season and he will carry on making important saves for us. Scott Dann refused to criticise goalkeeper Julian Speroni for spilling the ball into the path of Mane for the goal . 'Jules said he should have done better but these things happen and we should have reacted better. 'He is a great goalkeeper and has done really well for us. He made a couple of good saves last night and made some good decisions coming out when they played balls through. 'These things happen but we'll stick together as a team.'","Southampton have 10 days off before their next game against Chelsea .

"Louis Van Gaal said this week it could take £60million man Angel di Maria a year to adapt to life at Old Trafford - but it took the United boss 59 minutes to decide he had seen enough at St James' Park. Another unconvincing display was brought prematurely to an end moments after Di Maria flopped a hopeless right-wing cross into a visitors' box bereft of team-mates. But it could have been a different story if Di Maria - hauled off at half-time in Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland - had made his mark inside the opening minute. Angel di Maria trudges off the field after another disappointing performance for Manchester United . United's record £60m signing has struggled to adapt after a bright start to his Old Trafford career . Di Maria was marshalled out of the game by Newcastle midfielder Ryan Taylor (left) The Argentinian was sent clean through after a mistake by home defender Mehdi Abeid - but he inexplicably hesitated with the goal at his mercy and the chance was lost. It was destined to be Di Maria's best chance of making an impression. He was afforded plenty of space on the right flank but worked in fits and starts and was well marshalled by home pair Ryan Taylor and Sammy Ameobi. When he was too easily robbed in his own half one minute before the interval it sparked a charge upfield from Moussa Sissoko which ended in a clear-cut chance for Emmanuel Riviere in the visitors' box. The Argentina international is ushered back to the dug out after being substituted on 59minutes . Louis van Gaal hauled Di Maria off early for a second consecutive Premier League game . Di Maria did offer the occasional hint of quality in the second period, not least in the 54th minute when he provided the cross from which Marouane Fellaini then Ashley Young brought fine saves out of Tim Krul. But all too often the fickers were extinguished by those lackadaisical losses of possession of inexplicable passes into empty space. And shortly after one wasted opportunity too many, Di Maria was substituted again with the home fans' chants of 'what a waste of money' ringing in his ears.

"He has become used to rewriting the record books these past few years, amending football history in style with wonderful goals and dazzling pieces of skill. But there's one record Lionel Messi has some way to go to break - one held by England's very own Jimmy Greaves. It is the all-time leading goalscorer list across Europe's top five divisions - England, Spain, Italy, France and Germany - but at least the Barcelona wizard is making progress up the ladder. Lionel Messi (right) is congratulated by team-mate Luis Suarez after scoring for Barcelona in their 3-1 win over Granada at the weekend - it moved him to 269 goals in the Spanish league . Messi's close-range finish took him into the top 10 all-time goalscorers list for Europe's top five leagues . Jimmy Greaves, seen here playing for Tottenham in 1967, leads the chart with 366 league goals . Messi's goal in Barca's 3-1 win at Granada on Saturday was his 269th in the Spanish league and took him into the top 10 of the all-time standings for league goals, as pointed out by MisterChip on Twitter. However, he is still some way behind Greaves' tally of 366 league goals set between 1957 and 1971. The prolific England international striker scored 357 goals for Chelsea, Tottenham and West Ham in the English top flight, plus nine for AC Milan in Serie A. It set some precedent, one almost matched by Gerd Muller, who scored 365 goals for Bayern Munich in the German top flight and is second in the table. There is then a gap to the pre-war English scoring duo of Steve Bloomer (317 Division One goals between 1892 and 1914) and Dixie Dean (310 between 1924 and 1938). German legend Gerd Muller is second on the all-time list, just one goal behind Greaves . Messi's rival, Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid, is sixth on the goalscorers list .

"Kevin Pietersen remains as far away as ever from a return to England colours after it emerged on Friday that Surrey are no nearer an agreement to re-sign the maverick star. Sportsmail can reveal that Pietersen has told Surrey, who released him at the end of last summer, that he will not play all county cricket for them next season — even though he was urged to do so when offered a lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves. He appeared to call Pietersen’s bluff by saying the 34-year-old would be considered for an England recall if he threw his lot in with a county and stated his case by scoring heavily in domestic cricket. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Yet it seems unlikely the county will be Surrey, who have not been able to reach agreement with Pietersen over a deal to play in red-ball cricket as well as the white-ball game. The fact Pietersen struggled to attract a contract in this year’s Indian Premier League, before Sunrisers Hyderabad signed him in a cut-price deal, seemed to suggest the path may be clear for a return to domestic cricket. But unless Pietersen is prepared to move away from London — something he previously stated he would not do — it seems that his options are diminishing. Leicestershire may take on Pietersen but it remains to be seen if he will deign to play in the second division. A return for Pietersen in England colours (above) is now looking more and more unlikely . Somerset, coached by Pietersen’s friend Matt Maynard, remain an option but the odds are against him being given a platform to stake a claim for England.

"West Brom boss Tony Pulis is keeping his cards close to his chest in terms of his goalkeeper selection for Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at Aston Villa. The Barclays Premier League derby between the two clubs at Villa Park on Tuesday ended in a 2-1 victory for the hosts after a stoppage-time error from Ben Foster saw the Baggies and England shot-stopper give away a penalty that was converted by Christian Benteke. Pulis spoke up for Foster - who has kept six clean sheets in all competitions since the Welshman took over at Albion - after the game. Ben Foster is not guaranteed to keep his place against Aston Villa in the FA Cup quarter-finals . Foster brought down Matthew Lowton to concede a penalty against Villa in Premier League clash on Tuesday . Christian Benteke scored from the spot to give their midlands rivals a late victory at Villa Park . And while refusing to say outright whether or not the 31-year-old would keep his place at the weekend, the head coach once again had praise for Foster at his press conference on Thursday to preview the cup tie. Asked about his goalkeeper selection for Saturday's game, Pulis said: 'I'll be telling the goalkeepers first before I tell you! 'Boaz Myhill has had an injury with a finger, which we have to take into account. 'With the number of clean sheets he has kept (12 overall this season), Ben has been absolutely fantastic. 'Everybody makes mistakes. Goalkeepers get highlighted, like referees, because it can cost you games.' Baggies boss Tony Pulis has backed his No 1 without confirming Foster will keep his place on Saturday . Saido Berahino celebrates while being chased by his team-mates, after netting his 18th goal of the season . With regard to referees, another notable incident from the latter stages of Tuesday's game saw Villa defender Alan Hutton make a nasty-looking challenge on West Brom striker Saido Berahino and the pair square up to each other before each being booked. It appeared Hutton was lucky not to have been sent off by referee Jonathan Moss. And while Pulis was keen on Thursday to avoid hitting out at the official for not doing so, he did once again express his desire for there to be a referral system for managers during games where they get 'two calls' each, something he has spoken about in the past. 'I've seen the challenge back,' said Pulis. Alan Hutton appeared to raise his studs into Berahino's leg during Aston Villa's win over West Brom . Berahino goes down in pain on the touchline following Hutton's nasty challenge on Tuesday . Hutton and Berahino squared up after the challenge (left) and were both booked by referee Jonathan Moss . 'I thought Jon managed the game pretty well, and there are enough people at the moment criticising referees and looking to blame them. 'Jon didn't cost us the game on Tuesday, we cost ourselves the game. 'People make good decisions and bad decisions and you have to accept it - but I'm sure he'll look back at it and maybe will analyse it differently to how he did on the night.' He then added: 'I would have two calls during a game, where managers can call things back. 'You could put advertising on the big screens (at the same time) - the clubs could make some money from it. Pulis has labelled the alleged spitting incident involving Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse as 'disgusting' 'And it gives a chance to the officials to get right decisions that could be big. They, FIFA and UEFA, have to accept that referees do make mistakes.' Pulis also made his feelings clear about spitting following Wednesday night's incident involving Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse. 'It is disgusting and disgraceful,' Pulis said. 'Spitting should never be anywhere near our game. It should be dealt with.' Pulis, while mindful of his side's ongoing league battle to avoid relegation, says he will try to put his 'strongest team' out on Saturday. Stephane Sessegnon (right) will be given time to cope with 'personal problems' before returning to the team . Forward Victor Anichebe (groin) remains unavailable, and winger Callum McManaman is a doubt due to a foot injury. Pulis has also said West Brom 'have to go careful' with Stephane Sessegnon due to the forward's 'personal problems' - understood to be a family bereavement - and that there are a few 'knocks and niggles' to deal with. Berahino and fellow frontman Brown Ideye have both been playing recently with pain-killing injections.","Ben Foster's mistake led to 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa in Premier League .

"The song is straightforward and carries the usual expletive, for semi-rhyme as well as effect. Gabby Agbonlahor, cry Aston Villa fans to the tune of Karma Chameleon, is rather fast. That’s the clean version. The frequency with which the words are heard from now until the end of the season will prove largely correlative to Villa’s chances of remaining a Premier League team. They have not been sounded all too often this campaign. But at Villa Park on Tuesday night, especially during the first half, Agbonlahor produced a performance to warrant adulation. Gabby Agbonlahor salutes the Villa Park crowd in celebration after opening the scoring against West Brom . Agbonlahor threads the ball through Ben Foster's legs to give the hosts the lead in the Midlands derby . It was arguably his best display in years, a return to those days when his speed and strength shot him into the England set-up. Agbonlahor consistently harried Gareth McAuley and Joleon Lescott, chasing down balls he had no obligation to reach, using his stocky physique to keep hold of possession when under threat. Christian Benteke got the headlines for his late winning goal, but it was Agbonlahor who set the tone. His goal was a classic case of pace proving the difference. He latched onto Benteke’s nodded flick and finished while making statues of the West Bromwich Albion central defenders. He did similar when creating a pass out Ashley Westwood’s hopeful ball, sprinting to startle the opposition backline and only being denied a second by Lescott’s goalline clearance. Boy George’s ditty rang loud. Agbonlahor beat Foster again shortly after but Joleon Lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line . Agbonlahor reacts after West Brom keeper Foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line . Foster initially caught the shot from Agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly . In all, he had three shots on target – including the badly fumbled effort by Ben Foster than nearly trickled over the line – which is a significant uplift of recent matches. In this statistic, the sequence of his last 12 games reads: 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1. Fantastic figures should Jimmy Anderson be bowling a couple of overs at the death in the World Cup. As shots on target for a Premier League striker? Not so much. Agbonlahor failed to test the goalkeepers of Newcastle, Chelsea, Arsenal (admittedly as a substitute), Liverpool, Leicester, Crystal Palace, Manchester United (albeit sent off unjustly after 65 minutes) and West Bromwich Albion. His inability in that period to make a difference in opponents’ penalty areas is symptomatic of Villa’s wider attacking paralysis, stymied by a style that ranked possession over purpose to an adverse extent. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after Agbonlahor's goal . Christian Benteke sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for Aston Villa . It is hard as a centre-forward to strike for goal if the ball is rarely within 30 yards of the target. Agbonlahor would often operate on the wings under Paul Lambert too. This is not to absolve the 28-year-old. As one of the club’s senior figures his form has been disappointing, particularly since he signed a new four-year contract last September. Born locally and graduating from Villa’s youth set up he is a supporter of the club and the depth of his feeling has been clear in his commitment since he broke through to the first team nine years ago. So it has been odd to see his on-field demeanour at certain times this season, exhibiting none of the vim Villa fans know well. Benteke celebrates his goal with Aston Villa team-mates Jack Grealish and Andreas Weimann . Brad Guzan looked on in horror as Saido Berahino equalised for the visitors before Benteke's winner . That was back with a bang against West Brom. Tim Sherwood restored Agbonlahor up front alongside Benteke and allowed for the direct style that suits their attributes. Agbonlahor found the net for the first time in 14 matches and it proved valuable. Each one of his four Premier League goals has counted for something: a draw against Southampton and wins against Liverpool and Hull, accompanying the West Brom victory. Seven extra points in total. Sherwood knows the worth of the player whose speed is celebrated in chant. The Villa manager needs to continue utilising his talents for the final 10 Premier League matches to make sure this spark of brilliance does not fizzle out. Agbonlahor on song means Villa should stay up.","Aston Villa beat West Brom 2-1 in Midlands derby on Tuesday night .

"Just for a moment, when he gained a thin edge to an attempted pull off Pakistan' s Sohail Khan in Auckland, it was possible to believe that Abraham Benjamin de Villiers was human after all. All other evidence suggests the South African known as AB is some kind of super power, a man so talented in so many sports that cricket was blessed when he decided to make taking one-day batting to another, exalted level his destiny. Nothing sums up England's out-dated methods at this otherwise expansive World Cup than to watch the extraordinary De Villiers going about his work. South African captain AB De Villiers leaves the field during the  Cricket World Cup match against Pakistan . Joe Root  leaves the field after being dismissed by Rangana Herath of Sri Lanka during the World Cup match . Okay, perhaps it is unfair to criticise them for not living up to a genius who has defied belief with the most spectacular batting in cricket history but De Villiers has become the benchmark now for everyone else to attempt to emulate. We are lucky he is a cricketer at all. De Villiers grew up in Pretoria playing hockey, football, rugby, tennis and badminton to international standard at age-group level while also being an accomplished sprinter and swimmer. These days, in his spare time, he plays golf off scratch on top of being an all-round cricketer who keeps wicket, bowls and fields to a high level for his country as well as indisputably the best limited-overs batsman in the world. Give him the throne of Albania and he would surpass even the legendary CB Fry. Mitch Marsh celebrates after taking the wicket of Eoin Morgan during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match . De Villiers  looks on after the dismissal of teammate Rilee Rossouw  during the match at Eden Park . And those who have suggested the current England team may be a bit too nice to succeed in this tournament might like to note that it is hard to find anyone with a bad word to say about De Villiers. Perhaps the suggestion of a receding hair-line, at the age of 31, is his only nod towards mortality. De Villiers has been around for 10 years now at the highest level but it is with two particular innings in the last two months that he has breathed life into the 50-over format and re-written the rules on what can be possible. First, against the West Indies in Johannesburg in January, De Villiers reached three figures in just 31 balls, going from nought to a hundred in 40 minutes and smashing 16 sixes, the same number as India's Rohit Sharma during his record-breaking 264 against Sri Lanka. A dejected Morgan looks on during England's game against Sri Lanka in Wellington, New Zealand . De Villiers talks to teammate Francois du Plessis  during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match . Then, in this World Cup, he demolished the poor, hapless West Indians again with an extraordinary unbeaten 162, racing from a hundred to 150 in just 12 balls. De Villiers now holds the records for the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in one-day international history. South Africa, at one stage looking set for a total of around 270, instead made the small matter of 408 for five. Extraordinary. De Villiers does not look particularly powerful, as Chris Gayle does, nor stocky and pugnacious like David Warner and Aaron Finch. There is plenty that is orthodox about his methods but also an incredible ability to hit full-length balls outside of off-stump to the leg-side for six. When he is in full flow he is a joy to behold and for a while, against Pakistan on Saturday, he looked capable of winning the match on his own until that thin edge saw his side consigned to defeat. South Africa are a notoriously fragile tournament team but in their captain they have a man capable of taking them all the way to the final. Root leaves the field after being dismissed during the World Cup match between England and Sri Lanka a . Younis Khan talks to AB de Villiers  during the  Cricket World Cup match between South Africa and Pakistan . The lesson for England to absorb is that the pioneers of this new impossible is nothing brand of one-day cricket are basically playing Twenty20 over 50 overs. Even now, while all evidence points to a different approach, they still prefer to treat a one-day international as a shortened Test innings. They do have the players capable of doing it the modern way, that's the frustration of England's World Cup so far. None more so than Jos Buttler, whose eyes positively lit up when asked if the World Cup had been exciting him. 'Definitely,' said Buttler. 'AB de Villiers is I someone I look at who has played some amazing knocks. Cricket's changed. The introduction of the IPL and Twenty20, people are coming up with things and the hitting at the end is nothing short of spectacular. England coach Peter Moores looks on during the  Cricket World Cup match between England and Sri Lanka . Dale Steyn celebrates with De Villiers  and the team after taking a catch to dismiss Ahmad Shahzad of Pakistan . 'As a fan of cricket you watch these guys perform at the top of their profession and you take a step back and enjoy it. De Villiers has been fantastic to watch. Brendon McCullum faced two guys who were bowling at 90 miles per hour (against Australia) and was swinging even harder. There's been some great moments as a fan to sit and watch and enjoy.' Sadly not many of them have involved England but what comes next is clear, whether they scrape into the knockout stages or not. England simply have to rip it up and start again in one-day cricket and build a new side around the likes of Buttler, Joe Root, Moeen Ali and those coming through like Jason Roy and Sam Billings. De Villiers has shown what is possible. Now England have to play catch up. And fast.

"Tim Sherwood has redrawn the derby battle lines and warned West Brom they will have to improve to end Aston Villa's Wembley dream. The sides face a rematch in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday after Villa's dramatic 2-1 Premier League win on Tuesday. Christian Benteke's last-minute penalty sealed Sherwood's first victory as Villa boss and lifted them out of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone before Wednesday's fixtures. Tim Sherwood appeals to the referee after Matt Lowton was brought down by Ben Foster in stoppage time . Aston Villa manager Sherwood looked to the heavens as his side pressed for a winner against West Brom . And ahead of their second showdown this week, Sherwood is eyeing another derby success. He said: 'Now the cup is the most important one as it's the next one and we want to get to Wembley. West Brom will have to improve to stop us getting there. 'I'm confident I'm telling them the right things to do but there is nothing like a win to cement things. Everyone can see we're improving and the result is massive for us.' Villa have struggled all season and it was only their sixth win of a wretched league campaign, and Sherwood admitted they must forget about their fight against the drop in order to escape it. He said: 'We've got a group of players who are not really suited to a relegation battle, if I'm honest. 'The old-fashioned style is blood and thunder to dig out results so we have to change it. West Brom goalkeeper Foster brings down  Villa full back Lowton to give them the match-winning penalty . Christian Benteke (centre left) slots home the last-gasp penalty to hand Villa a crucial win against West Brom . 'We have to play as if we're not in a relegation battle. We have to pass the ball and move and we did that in the first half. It takes bravery to do that, especially against an expectant crowd.' Saido Berahino cancelled out Gabby Agbonlahor's first-half opener before the hosts claimed derby bragging rights after Ben Foster's rush of blood saw him take out Matt Lowton for Benteke's match-winning penalty . Albion boss Tony Pulis did not rise to Sherwood's comments, though, and insisted his side remain focused. 'Did he (say that)? Like I say, we'll take Saturday's game as it comes,' he said. 'I'll have a look at what the squad is like and then we'll go from there. 'They (the fans) might think Wembley and Saturday was more important, it wasn't for me. The next game is always the most important. If Ben didn't make a mistake we'd be very happy.'

"Stiliyan Petrov will return to Aston Villa as part of Tim Sherwood's backroom team. The former Villa and Celtic midfielder has joined the club's staff and will help to coach the senior squad. Petrov, now 35, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2012 and retired in May 2013 despite being in remission. Stiliyan Petrov is returning to Aston Villa to join manager Tim Sherwood's coaching staff . Sherwood said: 'Stiliyan isn’t here to be a mascot. He can contribute to everybody just with what he’s done in his life. 'Going out to win a football match is secondary to what he has had to battle with and come through. 'I want him here and quickly. He is respected here and he is very important.

"John Guidetti has seemingly distanced himself from a longer stay at Celtic by telling Dutch media he wants to return to Feyenoord 'perhaps as soon as possible'. The Swede scored 20 goals when on loan in Rotterdam in the 2011-12 season and remains hugely popular with Feyenoord fans. Guidetti, who made the comment in an interview with RTV Rijnmond, will become a free agent at the end of the season when his loan at Parkhead from Manchester City expires. John Guidetti has scored twice in his last four appearances, raising his tally to 13 overall for the Hoops . The 22-year-old striker placed talks about a permanent deal in Glasgow on hold in January as he endured a long scoreless run. Guidetti has since scored twice in his last four appearances - raising his tally to 13 overall - but it remains to be seen whether Celtic will put forward a lucrative contract offer to try to persuade him to stay. French giants Marseille and Southampton have also been linked with interest in the striker. Meanwhile, Ronny Deila claims he wants Craig Gordon to stay with Celtic for the remainder of his career. The Parkhead boss has already spoken with chief executive Peter Lawwell about the possibility of a new contract for the keeper, who signed a two-year deal when he joined the club last summer. Gordon's excellent performances since then have been key to Celtic's progress under Deila and brought the 32-year-old firmly back into contention to be Scotland's No1. Guidetti (left) goes down under pressure from Danilo D'Ambrosio during Celtic's clash against Inter Milan . According to reports in England, they have also attracted the attention of Chelsea, who have apparently included his name on a list of candidates to be back-up to Thibaut Courtois next season. Deila, though, is keen for the former £9million man to remain in his squad for as long as possible. 'He's a great goalkeeper and a man we want to keep at the club,' insisted the Norwegian. 'We will do everything to keep him here. I understand why other clubs are looking at him because he's had a fantastic season. Myself and Peter have already talked about this. It's also about what Craig wants and hopefully he wants to stay here and be with Celtic.' Gordon's acquisition on a free transfer was one of the best bargains of recent time in Scottish football. Asked what value he would now place on the ex-Hearts and Sunderland man, Deila replied: 'I can't sell him. I don't want to. I want him here for the rest of his career.' Celtic boss Ronny Deila wants Craig Gordon (above) to remain at Parkhead for the remainder of his career . On the prospect of Gordon signing up for life on the Chelsea bench after coming through two years of injury anguish and rekindling his career at Celtic, Deila said: 'It would be a shame but I don't think he wants to do that – he wants to play football until the end of his career. 'It's a rumour and we will see what's in it. There will be clubs interested if he wants to go, but we want to keep him. 'He's performed great and without him we wouldn't have gone through the group stage (in the Europa League).' Gordon will again form Celtic's last line of defence as they seek to open up a nine-point Premiership lead with victory over St Johnstone on Wednesday night. Emilio Izaguirre and Kris Commons are, however, sidelined with knocks.","John Guidetti scored 20 goals when on loan with Feyenoord in 2012 .

"The appliance of science behind Ronny Deila’s Celtic reign was there for all to see on Sunday afternoon. Any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as Aberdeen’s resistance. Despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding, frustrating 90 minutes against Inter Milan three days previously – and the associated, sleep-disturbing travelling – Deila’s team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4-0 victory. It was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus. The Norwegian’s insistence that Celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure. It was interpreted – or perhaps misinterpreted – as a slight on predecessor Neil Lennon. Ronny Deila's Celtic side are starting to become formidable under the Norwegian's reign at Parkhead . But this much is clear. Deila has unquestionably made the Parkhead side more formidable in that regard. And he has all the stats to back it up. Including one which earned recent arrival Gary Mackay-Steven a rapid (in more ways than one) gold star. Crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of Deila’s work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players’ performances. To the 39-year-old, these reams of figures produced by the technology at Celtic’s disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion. The hope is that it leads to better decisions. Again, there would have been a few from the football old-school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk. But what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers. Deila (centre) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics . ‘I think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective,’ said Deila. ‘There are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results, but I think we have had six victories after coming home from European games. That’s really good. You don’t see that around the other European leagues. Inter Milan lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back — so we did well to win in that way. ‘The amount of metres and sprints on Sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before. We have increased the high-intensity running by 30-40 percent since the summer. That is a lot. Gary Mackay-Steven (right) ran an impressive 1300 metres against Aberdeen on Sunday . ‘We want to be direct, we want to create things, we want to have penetration, we want to be a high-pressing team, so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform.’ Asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables, Deila broke into a grin. ‘I know everything about the players,’ he laughed. ‘When we played Inter at home, their striker, Rodrigo Palacio, ran 1250 metres at high intensity against us, sprinting. That is an incredible number. But at the weekend Gary Mackay-Steven ran 1300m! ‘You have to know the references of what it means to be fit. It’s easy to say that to the other players, if I tell them how far Gary Mackay-Steven ran in a game and compare it to them. Deila highlighted how impressive Palacio's running was against his side in the Europa League clash . ‘If a player asks me why he is sitting on the bench and not playing, I can show him the numbers. If he is running 600m and the guy in the team is running 1200m, what does he think of that? ‘Why can’t Gary run as far every game? Stuart Armstrong ran 900m on Sunday and he didn’t play the whole game.’ It was pointed out that Armstrong actually lasted only 62 minutes after replacing Kris Commons against Aberdeen, before being hurt and making way for Anthony Stokes. Was that not evidence of the midfielder being overworked? The winger also scored a terrific solo goal against their title rivals to send the Bhoys six points clear . ‘It was cramp, he’ll be okay for (tonight’s game) against St Johnstone,’ said the Celtic manager. ‘It was a sign that he is not strong enough yet. You have to think of the mental and physical loading on a player. ‘Just coming to Celtic - dealing with the contract, the media and so on - used a lot of mental energy in Gary and Stuart. ‘Then the training is at a much higher tempo then they have been used to before. The total loading gets too much. That’s why Stuart started on the bench. ‘But then Scott Brown is doing it every day. He is so strong, unbelievably strong. Why? Because he has done this for many years, he works really hard every single day and he looks after himself. Stefan Johansen is also starting to get that into his body.’ So is it a case of simply saying the best teams are the fittest teams? Scott Brown has been praised by his manager for his unbelievable strength and work ethic . ‘No, that’s not true,’ countered Deila. ‘But that’s the easiest thing to do something with. I don’t think the best teams are the fittest – they could be – but there are so many parameters, so many boxes you have to fill in football. ‘We don’t train more than they did before but hopefully we train better and we give more in that hour-and-a-half every day. ‘As for the stats, we use them in different situations. It is not only stats about running but who has been involved in goal chances offensively and defensively. Instead of saying something subjectively, you can see it as a fact. Stuart Armstrong is also a willing runner for Celtic and his stats are impressive since he joined the club . ‘But everything has to be related to football. We are not marathon runners. It is about what we do on the pitch.’ What Celtic have done on Scottish pitches is win their last 10 domestic matches. Making it 11 against St Johnstone at Parkhead will push them nine points clear of Aberdeen. Complacency might be the creeping danger, but Deila doesn’t detect any traces of that corrosive commodity. ‘There is still so much to fight for,’ he insisted. ‘We are working here on the culture, every day, to be 100 per cent every day. ‘I have no reason to be worried because I haven’t once seen the players have a bad attitude or a lack of concentration. I am really looking forward to the game and I expect a good performance and hopefully a good result.’","Ronny Delia's side are formidable in the Scottish Premier League .

Boulahrouz ran over to me straight away and apologised.' What about in other sports? American football has its moments, too, such as when Fox reporter Pam Oliver was hit by a Chandler Harnish throw.

"It is supposed to be to Chelsea’s advantage that they have to leave London only three times in what remains of the Premier League campaign. Really? Are we sure about that? Arsene Wenger always thought it was harder for a London club to win the league because there were so many derbies, and this match rather supported his theory. Chelsea still collected three points but, by Jove, it was tough. Their defence was stretched in a way that it was not at Wembley on Sunday and, by the end, Chelsea were happy to hoof the ball forward or run it into corners to take time out of the game.

Eden Hazard finished off a well-worked Chelsea move to score the only goal of the game. Check out more stats from our Match Zone . West Ham have won a single league fixture since Christmas, but it did not look like it here. They had chances, real chances, to wrest the points from the league leaders, and it says much that Chelsea’s prime performers were once again the central defensive core of John Terry, Gary Cahill and Thibaut Courtois in goal. And Eden Hazard, of course. Always Hazard. He scored the goal, never stopped wanting or carrying the ball, and left the field hobbling, as always, due to a standard battering. Not that West Ham were excessively dirty — Chelsea had four bookings to West Ham’s three — more that a player of Hazard’s ability is always going to attract a certain kind of attention. The group hug that Terry, Cahill, Courtois and Branislav Ivanovic shared at the end should have included Hazard; in his own way, he is as hard as any of them. If Chelsea maintain their supremacy, this is one of those games that will be remembered the day the title is won, one of those they-shall-not-pass performances, all bodies flying, desperate lunges and the ball in row Z if needs be. West Ham were left banging their heads against a wall — no wild metaphor in the case of Cheikhou Kouyate, who ran face first into the back of Terry’s skull late in the second half. Both required treatment, but one came off considerably worse. Hazard runs to Ramires after the pair combined for Chelsea's opening strike which gave Jose Mourinho's men a vital victory . Adrian makes an acrobatic save to keep West Ham in the game as Chelsea threaten to extend their advantage . Adrian keeps out another Chelsea attack as he thwarts Diego Costa on a busy night for West Ham's goalkeeper . West Ham have now failed to score in six of their last seven Premier League matches against Chelsea, including the last five in a row. Eden Hazard’s last four Premier League goals have come away from home after a run of 11 consecutive home goals . It is fair to say if they are ever pondering a fresh material to use in the construction of those black boxes in aircraft, Terry’s cranium may have to be considered. Alas, Diafra Sakho. It is hard to remember a striker getting in so many excellent positions for such paltry return. He knows where to be, he just lacks the clinical touch when he gets there and, thwarted by his own failings and the excellence of Courtois, West Ham drew a blank. Yes, Chelsea could have scored more, too. This was not a one-sided game — but we expect Chelsea pressure on the goal. They have world-class finishers and magicians in midfield. The surprise was West Ham going toe-to-toe with them, particularly, in the second half. Right up until the last minute they were still heaping on pressure. Chelsea have matches at Queens Park Rangers and Arsenal, and a home fixture against Crystal Palace, to come, so nobody should underestimate the challenge to their championship ambition contained in a London derby. This was one of the hardest-fought wins of Chelsea’s season — every bit as much of a proving ground as a wet Wednesday in Wigan, or whatever northern outpost is the current venue for popular cliche. Hazard is the Premier League's most fouled player this season and he goes down after some attention from Mark Noble . Hazard writhes around on the Boleyn Ground pitch in agony but continued to play on for the title favourites . Thibaut Courtois parries the ball with his foot as Nolan closes in during a heart-in-mouth moment for Chelsea's rearguard . Courtois was once again called in to action as West Ham appeal in vain for a handball against Gary Cahill (floored) Mourinho’s favourite scoreline is apparently 2-0 away. He regards it as the sign of a controlled, confident, emphatic performance in a close game. They certainly went in search of it here and came very close on three occasions in the second half. In the 56th minute, a beautiful through pass from Hazard set Ramires clear on goal. He cut inside but his delicate side-footed finish struck the inside of the far post and rebounded into the hands of Adrian. Minutes later, West Ham’s goalkeeper was in the right place again after Terry found Hazard whose cross picked out Ramires at the far post. This time there was no good fortune. The save was superb. There were six minutes of injury time due to the Terry-Kouyate collision and Chelsea came close to wrapping it up then. Hazard broke, for the last time, drawing Adrian yet squaring the ball unselfishly to Willian, whose shot was somehow smothered on its way to the net. The single goal was the fairer margin of victory, however. West Ham did not deserve to appear mastered in the scoreline after a simply thrilling second half. Kurt Zouma gets stuck in against Enner Valencia as the centre half continued to play in the holding role in midfield . Zouma continued in midfield after playing the holding role in the Capital One Cup final, and regularly battled with Kevin Nolan . Cheikhou Kouyate unsuccessfully shoots at goal under the ever-watchful eye of Chelsea skipper John Terry . Cahill attempts to tackle Diafra Sakho as Kouyate is poised to pounce on the loose ball . The first wasn’t bad either, West Ham going close in the 17th minute, when a cross from Mark Noble found a dangerous area at the near post where Kevin Nolan caused localised chaos and Kouyate arrived late only to have his shot blocked by the shins of Courtois. Two minutes later, a run by Enner Valencia opened a gap to slide a pass through to Sakho, who missed his kick. More frustration was to come. In the 37th minute, Carl Jenkinson crossed from the right and the ball dropped perfectly to Sakho, directly in front of goal, but planting his header into the ground, landing safely in the hands of Courtois. After 53 minutes, Courtois saved from Sakho again, pushing out a shot one-handed, just the right side of Nolan. He saved from Sakho after 60 minutes, too, and when he finally spilled a Valencia shot 12 minutes later, the outstanding Cahill cleared as Sakho threatened in vain. It was not all wastefulness by West Ham, though. In the 15th minute, a mix-up by Ivanovic saw Valencia about to speed past Terry and go through on goal. The ever-alert Cesc Fabregas probes into West Ham territory with Valencia and Mark Noble close by . West Ham werew forced into an early change as Winston Reid pulled up in the eighth minute with James Collins coming on in his place . Mourinho and Allardyce share a moment prior to kick-off on a crisp night in east London . The Chelsea captain weighed the odds in a split second and hauled him down, rugby style. Did he prevent a goalscoring opportunity? Probably. Did he play the percentage chance of referee Andre Marriner showing him a red card 30 yards out and early in the match, with Cahill covering, if not really in a position to stop? Undoubtedly. Did he get away with it? Yes. Yellow card. It was a cynical move, but the smart one, too. It was seven minutes later that the winner was scored. To be beaten by a header playing Chelsea is no disgrace; when the man on the end of the ball is Hazard, however, a manager has a right to be aggrieved. Sam Allardyce certainly looked it as the Chelsea man completed a headed goal that was as casually taken as a tap-in, with West Ham’s defence appallingly lax. James Collins had replaced the injured Winston Reid after five minutes, but that was no excuse. The back four had plenty of time to bed in but went to sleep doing so. It was a neat build-up involving Hazard and Cesc Fabregas, who slipped the ball to Ramires overlapping on the right. He had too much room and cut the ball back to leave West Ham flat-footed, Hazard sneaking between the statues to glance a stooping header past Adrian. It was too easy, and it is hard enough to beat Chelsea already — a point Allardyce seemed to be making on the touchline.","Hazard nodded Ramires' cross past Adrian in the 22nd minute to give the Premier League leaders the upper hand .

"Manager Arsene Wenger remains convinced attack will prove the best form of defence as Arsenal look to stay in the top four of the Barclays Premier League. The Gunners recorded a seventh win in the last eight league matches when beating relegation-battlers QPR 2-1 at Loftus Road on Wednesday night with goals from Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez. Arsenal sit a point ahead of Manchester United, their FA Cup quarter-final opponents, and four behind second-place Manchester City. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger sasy he wanted his side to continue to attack during 2-1 win against QPR . Wenger watches on from the sidelines as the Gunners consolidated their place in the top four . Giroud's second-half opener came following a swift counter-attack after Arsenal had soaked up plenty of pressure. Wenger, though, expects to see his team always stay on the front foot. 'I wanted the team to continue to attack, because we are not a team that can sit off and wait for the teams who commit and get them only on the break. We need to master possession and we did that well,' Wenger told Arsenal Player. Giroud has rediscovered his scoring touch in the last two matches following a series of misses in the 3-1 Champions League defeat by Monaco.

Alexis Sanchez cut in from the left hand side to double the Gunners lead minutes after Giroud's opener . Wenger hailed the mental strength of the France forward, who now has 10 Premier League goals from a campaign which was hampered by four months sidelined with a broken leg. Full-back Kieran Gibbs believes Giroud does not get the credit his work-rate for the team deserves. 'Olivier has certainly responded in the way we wanted. He is that kind of character who always wants to bounce back and do well for the team. He puts a lot of pressure on himself. Credit to him, because he is having a fantastic season,' Gibbs said, quoted by the London Evening Standard. Sanchez remains Arsenal's most potent attacking threat, taking his tally to 19 following a seven-match barren spell. Sanchez celebrates doubling Arsenal's lead mid way through the second half at Loftus Road . Charlie Austin pulled a goal back for the home side with a ferocious drive from the edge of the box . 'Every player goes through a difficult patch but he is not the type to let it get to him. He has shown great determination in every game,' said Gibbs. 'We need that from him and that is why he is world class.' Gibbs believes Arsenal have overcome the setback of their defeat by Monaco, which leaves hopes of qualification for the quarter-finals of the Champions League all but over ahead of the second leg in Monte Carlo later this month. He said: 'We wanted to respond for the fans and the people at the club. We know we are a good team and we want to show that.' Arsenal defender Gabriel suffered a hamstring injury at QPR and is expected to be out for a couple of weeks.

"So much for the start of a green-and-white procession towards the title. Having just cruised beyond their nearest challengers, Celtic promptly ran into a roadblock. It was built by a deeply determined St Johnstone side seemingly inspired by a return to the scene of the greatest day in the club’s history. Danny Swanson wasn’t on the books when they lifted last season’s Scottish Cup, yet his winning strike here was worthy of its own place in the memory banks of every Saints fan. With that pure, powerful swipe of his right boot, Swanson not only lifted his team into the Premiership top six, but kept Celtic within six points of Aberdeen. A run of ten successive domestic victories – a sequence which had granted Ronny Deila a new level of acclaim from Parkhead supporters – was brought to a shuddering halt. St Johnstone's Danny Swanson marked first Scottish Premiership start with a glorious first-time effort . Bookmakers will hardly be hiking their odds on them ending up with a four successive league crown. That much can still be viewed as a racing certainty. Here, though, was evidence that the odd chicane may still have to be negotiated en route. By the next time Celtic play in the top-flight – at Dens Park on March 18 – they will have come through Scottish Cup last eight and League Cup final meetings against Dundee United. Their Treble ambitions will be much clearer after that double-header, but any repeat of the wayward sluggishness shown last night will place the much-desired clean sweep in peril. To focus only on the failings of the Parkhead side would, however, be a gross injustice to St Johnstone. Not for the first time in his tenure, manager Tommy Wright produced the ideal tactical plan for his charges to follow. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths can't hide his disappointment after the defeat by St Johnstone . They had numerous fine performers and defended doggedly, occasionally desperately, throughout. But it wasn’t only Swanson who brought a touch of class. In David Wotherspoon, who operated just off central striker Steven MacLean, they had the most impressive overall contributor on show. Now two points ahead of Dundee, Wright’s men look well set for a fourth consecutive top-half finish. The Parkhead pitch is far from pristine as spring approaches but that couldn’t entirely account for the sloppiness Celtic showed in the first half. Compared with some of their recent showings, this was turgid stuff at times. As expected, they still dominated both possession and chances, yet Alan Mannus wasn’t exactly in need of a lie down at the interval. Anthony Stokes – making his first appearance since being late back from Dublin prior to the first leg against Inter Milan – offered the first flicker of threat with an angled shot whipped across the face of goal. Perhaps the most fluid move of the opening period then led to Gary Mackay-Steven striking a wicked curler first-time. Mannus stretched high to thwart it before denying Stokes on the follow-up. Celtic manager Ronny Deila sits dejected in the dugout o Wednesday night . Leigh Griffiths was being rationed on opportunities at the apex of Deila’s side. He took matters into his own hands with a low, left-foot thump that zipped fractionally wide from almost 30 yards out. The striker then threatened to hare clear down the left when released by Craig Gordon’s quick throw, only to be halted by a Swanson foul straight from the ‘professional’ drawer. The Saints midfielder earned both a yellow card from referee Calum Murray and a jabbing finger of rebuke from Scott Brown. Nir Bitton had dropped to the bench after showing signs of tiredness against Aberdeen, which meant Stedan Johansen taking a step back to partner Brown in central midfield. It was far from a radical alteration but the pieces weren’t quite clicking into place. Stuart Armstrong looked as likely as any in Celtic colours before the break but his rising drive was beaten away by Mannus. St Johnstone were persistently stretched but kept going about their defending in an organised manner. There were, though, only the most fleeting signs of danger at the opposite end of the field. Danny Swanson (far right) celebrates with his team-mates after scoring against Celtic . Jason Denayer was forced to divert a Michael O’Halloran shot behind, before David Wotherspoon had their clearest opportunity of the half. After Efe Ambrose was hustled off the ball, Wotherspoon cut along the 18-yard line but failed to find the space on either side of Craig Gordon. Deila opted for a switch at half-time, introducing Wakaso Mubark for Adam Matthews. The attack-minded Ghanaian slotted in at left-back, with Ambrose shifted to the opposite flank. The move carried an element of risk, with Wakaso looking unsure defensively, but Celtic fell behind to a 53rd minute strike they could have do nothing about. Swanson watched Wotherspoon’s corner being headed out and stepped forward to connect with a quite brilliant half-volley that arrowed past Gordon from 25 yards. Expect it to feature on all forthcoming goal of the season showreels. Saints should have gone two in front in quick succession when another somehow found its way through to Steven Anderson. It was, though, a case of wrong man in the right place as the centre-back miscued wide from around eight yards. Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon attempts to catch the ball in the air under pressure . Deila had watched it all from the edge of his technical area with increasing concern. He played his final hand before the hour mark, withdrawing Mackay-Steven and Stokes for James Forrest and Bitton. That allowed Johansen to step forward into his more regular role and help bring about the inevitable rise in pressure. Mannus made a terrific stop to thwart an Ambrose headed from Johansen’s corner before then grasping a Bitton daisy-cutter at the second attempt. Another Amstrong shot was calmly clutched to his chest. The signal for only two minutes of added time brought loud jeers from the home support. Rightly, they suspected that last night was simply one of those occasions when their team would need a lot longer to find the net.","On-loan Coventry midfielder Danny Swanson scored winner for Saints .

"Tim Sherwood's arrival at Aston Villa has given the squad a new lease of life, according to experienced goalkeeper Shay Given. After a disappointing start to his reign, in which the Villans lost two Premier League games in a row, Sherwood has turned it around with two Midlands derby wins over West Brom, first in the league and then in the quarter finals of the FA Cup. And Given, who was in goal for the latter of the two victories, admits that at half-time in Saturday's match, Sherwood wasn't pleased with his side's performance. Tim Sherwood has produced two consecutive victories against West Brom; in the league and FA Cup . Aston Villa players celebrate after Fabian Delph opened the scoring in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday . 'He wasn't too happy at half-time,' Given told Stan Collymore on talkSPORT. 'The flip-chart went flying in the dressing room and I think you saw our reaction in the second half, we were much better and caused West Brom a lot of problems. 'But that's what he's there to do. He's given us a rollicking when we've needed it and that's probably the first time he's really let go. I think a few of the lads were a bit shocked, but it got the reaction we needed.' Given and Sherwood have history, too. As a player, the now Villa manager won the Premier League title with Blackburn, and a young Given was also in the squad. Shay Given, who was in goal for the FA Cup win, was quick to praise the Villans' new manager post-match . Gabriel Agbonlahor gestures in celebration towards the Villa fans, who were delighted with the derby win . 'I know Tim from our Blackburn days,' Given continued. 'We were players together and he was a leader then as the captain, he captained Blackburn to the Premier League title, and he's very much the same. 'He's so positive on the training ground, so positive in the stadium and the players are responding to that.' Villa's league win over Tony Pulis' West Brom put some breathing space between them and the bottom three, but there is still a long way to go if they are to avoid the drop.

I just find it strange that they don’t protect their own showpiece competition.’ Parkinson secured Bradford’s place in the FA semi-final draw for the first time in 104 years following a fiercely fought goalless draw, and he said: ‘I think it’s a little bit disrespectful to the FA Cup and the magnitude of this game coming up. ‘It’s a history-making game.

"Only 12 men have scored in every round of the FA Cup in its 143-year history. Bradford’s Jon Stead hopes he can join them — and he’ll be one step closer if he nets against Reading in their quarter-final on Saturday. Here are the fascinating stories behind the deadly dozen... Archie Hunter (Aston Villa, winners 1887) The Scot was one of the first footballing celebrities of the Victorian era. ‘Old Warhorse’ captained Villa to their first FA Cup with a 2-0 victory over West Brom at the Kennington Oval. Forced to retire in 1890 after a heart attack on the pitch, he later died of heart failure aged 35. Archie Hunter of Aston Villa was one of the first footballing celebrities of the Victorian era . Sandy Brown (Tottenham, winners 1901) Hailing from the same Ayrshire mining village as Bill Shankly, Brown was known as the ‘Glenbuck Goalgetter’. Spurs became the only non-League side to win the FA Cup thanks to his goals. During Brown’s Scotland debut against England, part of the terracing at Ibrox collapsed, killing 25 fans. Sandy Brown (circled), pictured with Tottenham's FA Cup winning team, was a fine goalscorer in the cup . Harry Hampton (Aston Villa, winners 1905) ‘The Whirlwind’ remains Villa’s all-time leading scorer in League football with 215 goals.

He served at the Somme during World War One and survived a poisonous gas attack. Harry Hampton (circled) puts Aston Villa 1-0 up against Newcastle United in the FA Cup final in 1905 . Harold Blackmore (Bolton, winners 1929) Blackmore was a goalscoring sensation as a teenager playing for Silverton, a village team in Devon. He also worked at the local paper mill before signing for Exeter City and then moving to Bolton for £2,150, a princely sum in 1927. It looked as though his chance of scoring in every round had gone as Bolton led Portsmouth 1-0 at Wembley, but Blackmore netted at the death to seal his place in history. Harold Blackmore signed for Bolton for over 2,000 and scored in every round of the 1929 FA Cup . Ellis Rimmer (Sheffield Wednesday, winners 1935) The Scouser was a showman, attracting big crowds as a jazz pianist. Left winger Rimmer was the first non-striker to score in every round after his late brace in the 4-2 win over West Brom. The England man later ran the Hallamshire House pub in Sheffield before returning to Formby, where he died aged 58. Ellis Rimmer was a showman for Sheffield Wednesday, and was the first non-striker to score in every round . Frank O’Donnell (Preston, runners-up 1937) The Scot was one of 15 siblings and played in the final against Sunderland alongside brother Hugh, as well as Bill Shankly. O’Donnell became the first player to score in every round but end on the losing team. He died 15 years later in Macclesfield aged just 40 after a short illness. A tribute in Glasgow’s Evening Times described him as one of the finest players of his generation. Frank O'Donnell was in fine form for Preston in 1937, though his side lost the final . Stan Mortensen (Blackpool, runners-up 1948) Mortensen is better known for becoming in 1953 the only player to score a hat-trick in an FA Cup final. Five years earlier his side lost to Manchester United as he became the first post-war player to score in every round. A Blackpool legend, there is a statue of him outside Bloomfield Road. He died aged 69 in 1991, just nine days before Blackpool appeared at Wembley for the first time since the 1953 final. Stan Mortensen (second left, centre row) in a Blackpool team photo with Stanley Matthew to the left of him . Jackie Milburn (Newcastle, winners 1951) ‘Wor Jackie’ — cousin of Bobby and Jack Charlton — was Newcastle’s top scorer until Alan Shearer broke his record in 2006. He scored both goals in the 2-0 victory over Blackpool in the 1951 final, defended the Cup in 1952 and scored after 45 seconds in the 1955 final win. Milburn later reported on Newcastle for the News of the World and predicted a teenage Paul Gascoigne would become the best player in the world. Former club top goalscorer and Newcastle legend Jackie Milburn (right) in action against Arsenal . Nat Lofthouse (Bolton, runners-up 1953) Lofthouse completed his scoring feat in the ‘Matthews Final’ in which he gave Bolton the lead, only to end up losing 4-3. It was a final attended by Queen Elizabeth II. He did get his hands on the Cup after scoring in the 1958 final, when he barged Manchester United keeper Harry Gregg over the line, later admitting it was a foul. He is Bolton’s record scorer with 285 goals. There is a statue of him outside their stadium. Bolton captain Nat Lofthouse holds the 1958 FA Cup after their win over Man United at Wembley . Charlie Wayman (Preston, runners-up 1954) Wayman worked at Chilton Colliery in County Durham and served in the Royal Navy during World War Two. He was a team-mate of the great Tom Finney in the 1954 final as Preston were beaten 3-2 by West Brom and it was reported that his goal looked suspiciously offside. The pint-sized centre forward was a crowd-pleaser and it was a mystery how he never won England honours. Charlie Wayman (No 9) heads past the Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper in the 1954 FA Cup Semi-final . Jeff Astle (West Brom, winners 1968) Jeff Astle — ‘The King’ as he was known to West Brom fans —scored the only goal in the 1968 victory over Everton, while his strike in a League Cup final defeat by Manchester City two years later saw him become the first player to score in both domestic finals at Wembley. Astle died at 59 and the Justice for Jeff campaign has since been launched calling for an independent inquiry into a link between degenerative brain disease and heading footballs. Baggies fans still applaud during the ninth minute of every match in memory of their great No 9. Jeff Astle of West Brom (second right) jumps for the ball with Arsenal's John Radford and Ian Ure in 1968 . Peter Osgood (Chelsea, winners 1970) Another dubbed ‘The King’ by supporters, Osgood is the last player to score in every round. His goal forced extra-time in the replay versus Leeds, with David Webb netting the winner. Osgood is an icon at Stamford Bridge because of his flair and personality, both on and off the pitch. He died aged 59 following a heart attack at a family funeral. His ashes were buried beneath the penalty spot in front of the Shed End and a statue was later unveiled outside the stadium.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to avoid the kind of mistakes which have seen many top sides falter in the FA Cup this season as he eyes a place in the semi-finals. The Reds head into the weekend as favourites for the competition after fellow big guns Manchester United and Arsenal were drawn together in the last eight. Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn visit Anfield on Sunday and while Rovers are 25 places below their hosts Rodgers insists they will be treated the same as Manchester City - second in the Premier League - were last weekend. Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool will give Blackburn Rovers the respect they deserve in the FA Cup .

Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge (right) loses his marker to score a goal against Burnley on March 4 . Winger Raheem Sterling drills in a low cross against Burnley players during Liverpool's 2-0 win at Anfield . 'They got their first league win away from home in four months in the week (at Sheffield Wednesday) but we will give them the same respect we would give Manchester City or any other team,' said the Liverpool boss. 'It is a big game. We made it clear our intent in this competition was to get to the final and win it and to do that you have to beat different types of teams and Blackburn will come and look to make it difficult for us. 'I think (Rovers manager) Gary Bowyer has done an outstanding job since he has gone in there. 'He's had a similar pathway to myself in terms of working in youth development so he understands football clubs from the top to the bottom. 'He has gone in there in very difficult circumstances and stabilised the club and got everyone on the same path and has done an outstanding job.' While securing Champions League football for next season remains the priority Rodgers would dearly love to win some silverware in his third year in charge. Having reached the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup he hopes to go at least one better in this competition, although he admits he is only interested in a final at Wembley. 'People say getting to Wembley for the semi-final is a big thing but not really. Winning and getting to the final is the big priority,' he said. 'In many ways I wish the semi-final wasn't at Wembley because I think it takes a little bit away from it. For me Wembley should be the ultimate game. 'But of course it is a great opportunity if we do go through to play a game at Wembley, which we certainly wouldn't turn down. 'In domestic cup competitions we were unfortunate not to make the final and in the FA Cup we are giving everything we can to win a trophy while trying to fight to get into the top four. 'We want to get as high as we can - not just fourth - and win a trophy and if we can do that it will be a success.' Blackburn secured their first league away win in four months against Sheffield Wednesday earlier this week . Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho (right) tussles with Burnley striker George Boyd (left) at Anfield . Liverpool are the team of the moment with their Premier League form second-to-none and, although their attacking style is again winning plaudits, what is probably more significant is their new-found defensive resilience. They have conceded just six goals in nine league matches since the turn of the year, during which time they are unbeaten. Despite enforced changes to his backline everyone now appears to know what job they are supposed to be doing - unlike earlier in the campaign when no matter who he brought in there was always an air of vulnerability. 'What is pleasing are the poor goals we have stopped conceding,' he said. 'Our method of play is based on aggressive pressure and with that you limit teams to not many opportunities. 'When that doesn't function well you concede poor goals. That was the key, we made too many mistakes. 'In the last three months there is a better balance to the team, players are comfortable and with and without the ball collectively we are much stronger.'

"Mauricio Pochettino believes Charlie Austin and Harry Kane could form a partnership for England in the future. The pair are both set to start as Spurs travel to Queens Park Rangers on Saturday and are the in-form English strikers in the Premier League. And Pochettino knows that both could have a future for Roy Hodgson's national team. Mauricio Pochettino believes Charlie Austin and Harry Kane (pictured) could form a partnership for England .

'Charlie is a very good player,' he said. 'In football you never know - why not? They're both very good players.' Tottenham will discuss Kane's workload with the FA in the next month. Spurs - who insists Emmanuel Adebayor still has a future at the club - would rather Kane has a rest at the end of the season. But FA technical director Dan Asheprth wants the striker to travel with Gareth Southgate's Under 21s to the Czech Republic for the European Championships as well as turning out for the senior side. 'I always protect the player,' Pochettino added. Spurs are looking to break into the top four, starting with the trip to Loftus Road - although Pochettino refused to set any targets in terms of points, also suggesting some of the youth team who played against Chelsea on Thursday night could be handed debuts before the end of the season.
