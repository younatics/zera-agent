"A stash of about 80 grenades dating back to the Second World War was found on a building site in East Sussex yesterday. The explosives were discovered by workmen on the site in Eastbourne and are thought to have been phosphorus incendiary grenades created as improvised anti-tank weapons at a time when Britain was facing a Nazi invasion following the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. The grenades, marked AW Bomb 1940, were made by chemical company Albright & Wilson in the form of bottles filled with an incendiary liquid. A stash of about 80 grenades dating back to the Second World War was found on a building site on this road in Eastbourne . Police revealed that one or two of the grenades had exploded after they were discovered, sending up a sheet of flame, but that no one was hurt. Bomb disposal experts, from Folkestone in Kent, later carried out a controlled explosion to destroy the remaining cache of grenades. A police spokesman said: 'During this activity the A2021 King's Drive was closed to pedestrians and traffic between its junction with King's Avenue and the Rodmill roundabout outside Eastbourne District General Hospital. 'Local householders were warned to expect the explosion by police community support officers and council workers knocked on doors beforehand.'

"It has been a sci-fi dream for decades - a car that can simply take to the air to avoid traffic. However, a Slovakian firm has said it has finally cracked the problem - and it will sell in it just two years. The AeroMobil can fly 430 miles on a tank of petrol - and when its wings fold down, it'll fit into a normal parking space. Scroll down for video . Aeromobil is a 'flying car' that can fit in a standard parking space, and could both take off and land at any airport in the world. When in flight mode, it can go 430 miles, reaching 124mph - but can fold up its wings to travel on the road and fit in a single parking space. Aeromobil is a 'flying car' that perfectly makes use of existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes, and opens doors to real door-to-door travel,' the firm says. When in its car configuration, it can fit into a standard parking space, and it also takes normal fuel pumped at every service station. The latest version is the third generation of the craft. 'It is now finalised and has been in regular flight-testing program in real flight conditions since October 2014,' the firm said. At South By Southwest, Juraj Vaculik, co-founder and CEO of AeroMobil, spoke at a panel about the future of flying cars, predicting a world ahead in which these vehicles easily merge with existing transportation. He says it will be on sale in 2017, and that the firm was also developing a self driving (and flying) version. Tatiana Veber, an AeroMobil spokesman said: 'We have been developing the concept of a flying car since 1990. 'Our first model looked quite bizarre and it would have problems in the regular use. 'That was a signal to improve the concept of the flying car in a way to become an integral part of the regular road traffic. The winds fold behind the driver of the car when it is on the road . The car seats two, although the pilot will need a licence to fly it. 'We got a positive feedback from several experts in avionics, which appreciated design and the technical solution of the process of transformation. 'The car is constructed to be fuelled at regular gas stations using the fuel for Rotax 912 ULS engine.' AeroMobil says its third prototype is ready to be shown to the world this October 29th at the Pioneers Festival in Austria. When in plane mode, the craft is powered by a propeller . The firm has even completed the interior of the craft, and says it is undergoing advanced flight tests in Slovakia. However, design is still not perfect- the wings fold into the back seat behind the driver when in car mode. The firm has also released a video of it in action, driving through city streets then taking to the air. 'Aeromobil 3 is stylish, comfortable for both the driver and passenger, and exceptionally combines the performance of a sports car with qualities of an 'ultralight',' it says. The vehicle can reach 200km/h when in the air, and 160km/h on the roads.","AeroMobil can fly 430 miles on a tank of petrol .

"When it comes to shaving, boys are normally taught the art by their fathers or older brothers. But this means bad habits can also be passed down through generations. Now a principal scientist from Gillette has revealed the science behind shaving including how hairs behave, why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink. She also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain. Scroll down for video . Beard hairs are, on average, a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. When dry, the hair is around 130 microns in diameter (left) but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns. Washing the face before a shave increases the surface area the blades can cut through said Gillette principal scientist Kristina Vanoosthuyze . Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze has worked in the Gillette Shaving Technology area at the Innovation Centre in Reading for the past nine years. Every morning 80 volunteers visit the centre and shave in front of a filming rig that combines magnifying lenses, high-speed  cameras and special high-intensity lighting. This has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair, and in the case of multiple-blade models, the first blade   pulls the hair up,  the second cuts it, the third blade acts in a similar way to the first, and so on. In some of their products, Gillette also offers a vibrate function that further lifts the hair and reduces the friction caused by the blades. This footage has also revealed the differences between dry and hydrated skin and beard hair. Every day 80 volunteers shave in front of a rig that combines magnifying lenses and high-speed cameras. This has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair. In the case of multiple-blade models, the first blade pulls the hair up, the second cuts it, the third blade pulls and so on . When hydrated, skin is also tighter (an image of the skin is shown before washing left and after washing right). This exposes more of the hair's surface area to the blade.  As a result Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze recommends showering before shaving - and not the other way round . This image is a microscopic image of cut hairs on dehydrated skin. Dry hair can have the strength of copper wire and when hair and skin hydrates it swells and makes the hair easier to cut. Additionally, the lubricating ingredients in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving glide . Beard hairs are, on average, a tenth of a millimetre in diameter. When dry, the hair is around 130 microns but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns. This increases the surface area that the blades can cut through, and when hydrated, skin is plumper, which reveals more of the hair. Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser: This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull: The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave: This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. As a result it makes more sense to shower before shaving and not the other way round. 'Allowing water to penetrate the hair is key for a comfortable and close shave because dry hair is difficult to cut,' explained Dr Vanoosthuyze. 'In fact, dry hair can have the strength of copper wire. When hair hydrates, it swells and becomes easier to cut. 'So, men should wash the face and neck with a mild cleanser before the shave. Or at least take a shower before the shave and not the other way around. 'Additionally, the lubricating ingredients formulated in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin, improving razor glide for a more comfortable shaving experience.' Scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek, neck and chin, for example. On the cheek these hairs resemble the shape of an egg, while on the chin they are wider on the underside than the top. The hairs of the neck look similar to those on the chin but are thicker and more robust. The skin on the cheek is also flatter than the raised bumps on the neck. This suggest that shaving in one direction on the cheek may not have the same affect when used on the neck, for example. However, Dr Vanoosthuyze revealed that shaving in the direction of the hair is often the best place to start. 'It is difficult to give a simple, straightforward answer, because the comfort of the shave - or lack of irritation - is dependent on so many more factors than simply the direction of the shaving stroke,' she told MailOnline at the launch of Gillette's Fusion ProGlide with FlexBall technology razor. 'Our  data has shown that men who shave with ProGlide against the grain rated the product as high for 'gives a comfortable shave' as those men who shaved with the grain and/or in both directions.' Scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek, neck and chin (pictured). On the cheek these hairs resemble the shape of an egg, while on the chin they are wider on the underside than the top. The hairs of the neck look similar to those on the chin but are thicker and more robust . The skin on the cheek is also flatter than the raised bumps on the neck (pictured). Dr Vanoosthuyze said: 'As a general rule, most men find shaving first in the direction of the hair growth and then following up with upstrokes provides the closest, smoothest shave with good skin comfort' But she continued that a man's facial hair tends to grow in different directions, so even if he thinks he shaves with the grain, some hairs will still unknowingly be cut against the grain. 'As a general rule, I would say that most men find using light strokes and shaving first in the direction of the hair growth and then following up with upstrokes provides the closest, smoothest shave with good skin comfort.' And when it comes on what not to do, Dr Vanoosthuyze said that some men place as much as 3.3lbs (1.5kg) of force on the blade. 'The closeness of the shave is largely determined by the quality and design of the razor, not by how hard you press,' she added. 'The best way for a close, comfortable shave is to use gentle strokes. The razor should do the work, not you.' Dr Vanoosthuyze also explained that under no circumstances should a person tap their razor on the side of the sink. Tapping the razor causes the precision blades to misalign which affects the cutting quality, but also how long the blades will last. This image shows the angle a blade takes on a typical cheek hair . She also explained that under no circumstances should you tap the razor on the side of the sink. Tapping the razor causes the precision blades to misalign which affects the cutting quality, but also how long the blades will last. 'At the end of the shave, just rinse the razor thoroughly with water and shake off excess water before storing,' Dr Vanoosthuyze. And after the shave, Dr Vanoosthuyze recommends using a moisturising lotion. 'A good moisturiser will leave the skin soft and smooth and help to maintain the skin's natural moisture barrier.' Many aftershaves also contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. This is what causes them to sting.","Dr Kristina Vanoosthuyze studies the shaving habits of 80 men every day using high-speed cameras at Gillette's Innovation Centre in Reading .

"Extra-curricular: John Cridland,  director general of the Confederation of British Industry, says pupils need more than just A*s . The glut of top grades at GCSE and A-level is forcing employers to focus on young people’s extra-curricular activities, according to a business leader. John Cridland – director general of the Confederation of British Industry – said his members must consider character-building elements of a candidate’s CV, rather than just qualifications. He told the Times Educational Supplement that ‘frankly everybody has A*s’ and said employers want someone who ‘stands out from the crowd’. ‘What have you done in the local theatre club? 'What have you done in the local sports club? 'What have you done to put something back into the community?’ he said. ‘[These] are just as important to employers.’ He added that most bosses ‘do not recruit on subject or qualification’ but look for ‘enthusiasm, creativity and passion’. The CBI has previously bemoaned the poor quality of candidates entering the workplace, criticising levels of numeracy and literacy. However Mr Cridland stopped short of suggesting ‘character’ should be taught as a separate subject, saying: ‘A good teacher develops these things in the classroom while teaching English.’ He added that Ofsted inspections should focus more on the all-round development of pupils. Extra-curricular: He suggests pupils look at extra activities which may impress future bosses .","John Cridland says pupils need more than just good grades to get a job .

"The children arrived at Bishopsgate police station at about 3am on Saturday asking for a taxi home . On nightshifts at his police station, Superintendent Paul Clements is used to dealing with the usual collection of drunks and other ne’er do wells. But he was surprised when three Romanian children arrived at the central London police station at 3am and said they were 130 miles from home. The children, aged 12, 14 and 17, told officers they lived with their parents in Nottingham and then asked for a taxi home and a meal from McDonalds. Instead, officers bought the youngsters sandwiches from a nearby petrol station and called social services to care for them. They also called the children’s parents who immediately travelled from the family home in Nottingham to pick them up. It remains unclear how the children managed to travel to London or how they were able to leave their home without their parents noticing. Details of the visitors to Bishopsgate police station, near Liverpool Street Station, emerged when Mr Clements described the incident on Twitter yesterday. He wrote: ‘Bizarre night shift. 3am and in walk three Romanian children from Nottingham with no money or ID asking for a taxi back home and a McDonalds.’ The children were found roaming the streets in the early hours by officers of City of London Police. They were not treated as criminals and at no time were they put in the cells. Superintendent Paul Clements took to Twitter to let his followers know about his strange night . The number of Romanian immigrants begging and sleeping rough in some of the wealthiest areas of the capital has trebled since EU restrictions on movement were lifted in January 2014. It is reported to have led to a spate of aggressive begging, pickpocketing and prostitution, which is blighting exclusive London addresses.","The children were found roaming the streets in the early hours by officers .

"Home ownership will become a 'distant' dream for an entire generation, with just one in five under-35s able to buy a house by the end of the decade, Labour claims today. A dramatic slump in property ownership among the young from 60 per cent to 20 per cent in a generation means a record number of people in their twenties and thirties are still living with their parents. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds warns five more years of the Tories' 'failed plan' will create a housing gap between those on the property ladder and millions forced to rent. By 2020, just 21 per cent of under-35s will own their own home if the current trend continues, according to Labour. In 1991 the figure was 60 per cent . Latest figures show that just 31 per cent of people aged 16-35 owned their own home in 2012-13, down from 10 per cent in the year before the last election. Labour warns that if the trend continues, it will mean that by 2020 just 21 per cent of young people will be on the property ladder. In a speech today, Miss Reynolds will say: 'Over the past five years, David Cameron has presided over the lowest levels of house building in peace time since the 1920s. 'For a whole generation of young people and families the aspiration of buying their own home is becoming a distant dream. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds warns five more years of the Tories' 'failed plan' will create a housing gap between those on the property ladder and millions forced to rent . 'A record number of young people are still living at home with their parents in their twenties and thirties because they can't get on the housing ladder.' In 2001 more than half of under-35s (55 per cent) owned their home, and in 1991 it was as high as 60 per cent. At the same time, the proportion of over-75s owning a property has risen from 53 per cent in 1991 to 76 per cent in 2012-13. In a speech to the Town and Country Planning Association, Miss Reynolds will set out how Labour would try to reinvigorate the aspiration of home ownership. Overall, just 63 per cent of people own their own home, the lowest level since the mid-1980s. Labour claims that if the trend continues it will reach the lowest level for 40 years. 'After five years of empty announcements and failed initiatives the Tories are offering more of the same,' Miss Reynolds will say. 'But they can't even say how their latest pie-in-the-sky scheme will work or how they will pay for the £8.6 billion cost of the supposed 20 per cent discounts that are on offer. 'Five more years of the Tories' failed plan will see a growing housing gap, falling home ownership and unrealised aspiration for the next generation.' She will promise that Labour has a plan to build 200,000 homes every year by 2020. A Labour government would make tackling the housing crisis a 'national priority', giving communities stronger powers to build homes. First time buyers would be given priority access rights in new 'Housing Growth Areas' while small builders will be given more support. Overall, just 63 per cent of people own their own home, the lowest level since the mid-1980s, according to the English Housing Survey . Labour is also promising a new generation of New Towns and Garden Cities. Miss Reynolds will pledge that Labour will recreate the post-war spirit of house building. 'Labour has developed the first comprehensive plan for a generation to tackle the housing crisis. A Labour Government will get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020 but we won't stop there. 'The next Labour Government will recapture the post-war spirit for building new homes and match that renewed ambition with a drive to build high quality homes and great places for new communities. 'While the Tories still believe, despite their failure over the past five years, that the housing crisis will be solved by the market alone, Labour is clear that to tackle the housing crisis there must be a much more active role for national and local government.'","In 1991 60% of under-35s owned their home, falling to 31% in 2012-13 .

"The bi-racial granddaughter of a Nazi concentration camp leader has revealed the horrifying moment she discovered the truth about her ancestry after she was given up for adoption. Jennifer Teege was 38 when she came across a book in a Hamburg library written by her mother - a name she recognized - and learned that she was the granddaughter of SS Commander Amon Goeth, who was portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 Oscar-winning movie 'Schindler's List'. 'It really turned my world upside down,' said Teege, now 44. She has now penned a book - due out next month - about the life-changing discovery and how her adoptive parents and therapist helped her find peace with who she was. Scroll down for video . Learning the truth: Jennifer Teege, pictured, has written a book that comes out this month about her soul-searching experience after she found out her grandfather led a concentration camp in Nazi Germany . Ancestor: When she was 38, she learned that her grandfather was SS Commander Amon Goeth (pictured left), who was portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in the 1993 Oscar-winning movie 'Schindler's List' (right) 'A Nazi gene doesn't exist,' she told People magazine. 'We can decide for ourselves who and what we want to be.' Teege was the result of a brief relationship between her German mother and Nigerian father; by the time she was born, her mother was in another relationship and she was given up for adoption. By the age of seven, she had been taken in to a foster family but she reconnected with her mother, Monika Hertwig, when she was 20. Her mother told her nothing of her ancestry. By nearly two decades later, she came across her mother's book, 'I Have To Love My Father, Don't I? The Life Story of Monika Goeth' and recognized the author as her mother. 'The moment I had that book in my hand, I knew it would give me so many answers,' she told People. She learned that her grandfather had ran a concentration camp in Plaszow, Poland in World War II. Family: Teege, who was adopted, made the discovery when she found a book about her biological mother, Monika Hertwig (pictured), in a library. She had had contact with her mother, who never told her the truth . Ancestors: Teege's mother Monika is pictured right in the 1940s with her own mother Ruth Irene Kalder, who had an affair with Goeth while working as a secretary in his factory . Goeth was known for shooting Jewish inmates for sport at the concentration camp and for training his large dogs to attack them, and was a central character in the film 'Schinder's List'. Compelling: Jennifer Teege has penned a book about the discovery, due out next month . The German industrialist Oskar Schindler saved more than 1,200 Jews by bribing Goeth and other Nazis to have them work in his factories rather than be sent for extermination in death camps. Goeth, who was known as the 'Butcher of Plaszow', was convicted as a war criminal and hanged in 1946. After learning about her grandfather, Teege was overwhelmed with emotions, knowing that her mother had gone public with her story while failing to tell her own daughter the truth. Hertwig also featured in a 2006 documentary about Goeth entitled 'Inheritance'. Teege, who had spent several years in Israel and had met with Holocaust survivors before finding out her family secret, was also haunted by the thought that her grandfather would have killed her because she is bi-racial. She also felt betrayed by her grandmother, whom she had known as a child. Her grandmother, Ruth Irene Kalder, who had an affair with Goeth while working as a secretary in his factory, called him 'the most important man in my life'. Kadler took her own life when Teege was 13. 'I could never have stayed with him like she did,' Teege told People. 'But if I say I love her would it mean that I too close my eyes to what my grandfather did.' Through the years: Teege's mother is left aged 18, while her grandmother is right at Plaszow concentration camp. Teege said one of the hardest parts was wondering how her grandmother loved such a man . Killer: Goeth, seen in 1943, was known for shooting Jewish inmates for sport at the concentration camp . On trial: Goeth, who was known as the 'Butcher of Plaszow', is pictured at his court trial in Krawkov in 1946 where he was convicted as a war criminal and later hanged. Teege's grandmother later killed herself . She has now written a book about her experience entitled 'My Grandfather Would Have Shot Me' and said she plans to tell her own two young sons about their heritage when they are older. She told the Associated Press that one of her motivations in writing the book was an interview with the grandniece of Nazi leader Hermann Goering, who  had herself sterilized to end her blood line. Teege said she would never do anything so extreme. 'You decide who you want to be,' she said. 'It is your character and you set an example that you can be different. It is not connected to genes.'","Jennifer Teege, whose mother is German and whose father is Nigerian, was given up for adoption and taken in by a foster family when she was seven .

"One of Australia's biggest airlines has revealed that they are still considering whether to strengthen their cockpit policies following the Germanwings tragedy that killed 150 people. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they are 'monitoring' the information coming out of the French investigation following the chilling revelation that the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 locked the pilot out before hurtling the plane to the ground. The airline say they are in 'discussions with regulators' over cockpit changes and are still unsure if a review is needed to safeguard passengers. Qantas has announced that it is discussions with regulators over it's cockpit policies . 'We have a comprehensive safety management system that guards against risks to our operations. This includes multi-layered systems to protect the flight deck on our aircraft,' a spokesperson for Qantas said. The airline also said that their pilots' health and well-being are very important to them, claiming they have a rigid recruitment process which includes psychometric testing. 'Periodic aeromedical tests are carried by doctors out once a year for pilots under 40 years old and every six months for pilots over 40,' they said. 'All pilots must complete regular Crew Resource Management training, which among other things includes training in stress management, teamwork, communication and behavioural awareness. 'Like all employees, pilots have access to confidential counselling services and safety reporting channels.' In the UK, a few airlines have announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines . Qantas have said that they are still considering whether or not their policies need to be tightened . A more thorough review had been ordered to consider the findings of the investigation of the Germanwings crash, in which 150 people were killed when the A320 slammed into the French Alps. In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia, Virgin Australia said their pilots also undergo medical exams. They said they are constantly in contact with regulatory bodies and have comprehensive measures in place on all flights to ensure the safety of guests and crew. However they said that these details remain confidential for security purposes . 'The Virgin Australia Group continuously undertakes detailed risk reviews, including consultation with the relevant regulatory and industry bodies. Any updates regarding changes to our processes will be provided where appropriate,' a Virgin spokesperson said. 'All Virgin Australia Group Pilots undertake regular aeromedical exams, which include mental health assessments.' It dramatically emerged today that the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 that crashed into the French Alps locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane. The final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said it was 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz's plan to 'destroy the plane'. The Qantas review comes as airlines and aviation regulators around the world have begun taking steps to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit. Tragedy: It emerged today that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people on board . Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . The Civil Aviation Authority urged airlines to review their policies to avoid the pilot or co-pilot being alone at the controls and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across airlines. In the UK, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic announced plans to change their aviation policy on staff numbers in the cockpit. Monarch and Thomas Cook also confirmed they had changed their policies, while Ryanair, Jet2 and Flybe said they already required two crew members to be in the cockpit at all times. Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures. Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door, EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet . 'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence. As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually. 'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards. 'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.' Doomed: The captain of the ill-fated flight - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter (file photo) 'Deliberate': Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually . It also transpired today that the Germanwings co-pilot who flew the plane into the Alps at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and 'burnout'. Mr Lubitz - whose family were at the scene of the crash in Seyne today -  postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was 'in depression'. Airline bosses confirmed Lubitz had taken several months off work and had to retrain to join the firm but insisted he was '100% fit to fly'. German police have since raided Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf. Heart-broken: Family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene in Le Vernet near the French Alps today, as rescuers tried to recover the dead bodies of their deceased relatives . Rescue: Helicopters lowered investigators down to the scene of the obliterated plane where debris and human remains were scattered . At an extraordinary press conference earlier, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box. He said Lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck. At that point, Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually - and deliberately. He said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'. Raid: German police have investigated Andreas Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf . Killer's home: A French prosecutor in Marseille said Mr Lubitz's breathing was normal as the plane descended rapidly before crashing into the French Alps . Earlier in the flight, Mr Robin said Lubitz's responses were initially courteous, but became 'curt' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane. The captain - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter. Mr Robin said: 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something. 'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane. 'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit.'","Qantas are in discussions with regulators over their cockpit policies .

"An educational centre at Cambridge University nearly lost two 'irreplaceable' artefacts after they were taken by an oblivious tourist who thought they were souvenirs. The Japanese artefacts – a wooden plaque and replica school textbook – went missing from the Kaetsu Educational and Cultural Centre last Saturday as it hosted a Japan Day celebration. The replicas were loaned to the university from a museum in Japan, marking the first time they had ever been taken out of the country. Punt boats carry tourists on the river Cam past King's College at Cambridge University . Staff launched a search after they noticed the precious objects were missing. They eventually found the tourist who had mistaken the artefacts for souvenirs and returned them with an apology. University officials said the textbook is a replica of those used in Japanese schools during World War II. During the war residents of the island of Okinawa – a key battleground for Japanese and American forces – were forced to speak the Japanese language the rest of the country used, rather than their own dialect, for the purposes of unification. The Japanese artefacts were taken by a tourist during a Japan Day celebration at Cambridge University . As punishment, those who spoke their native tongue were forced to wear the wooden plaque around their neck. The artefacts are now being returned to the Peace Memorial Museum in Okinawa. Peter Roberts-Taira, the education centre's director, said he was relieved when he found out that the artefacts had been recovered. He said: ‘It's the first time these items have ever been out of Japan, so the museums themselves were taking a risk. University officials said they located the tourist and the artefacts were returned with an apology (file photo) ‘It was Saturday, right at the very end of the day when everyone was packing away that we realised they had gone. ‘One was a wooden plaque with some Japanese on it, the other was a maths book which children had in their classrooms.’ He added: ‘You wouldn't know they were valuable to look at, so maybe somebody just though they could take them. ‘The message went out wider to people who asked their friends, and apparently they discovered a friend of a friend had thought those things were possible to take away as souvenirs. ‘They are irreplaceable, if they are gone, they are gone forever. It's very, very special to have them at all.'","Artefacts were on display at the Kaetsu Educational and Cultural Centre .

"Appearing to hover in midair, this is the astonishing moment a U.S. Special Forces Paratrooper was snapped throwing a salute to his comrades while jumping backwards out of a plane over Germany. Despite being nearly 17,000ft in the air, the soldier, from the 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, appears completely unfazed as he leaves the C-130 Hercules aircraft. The stunning photograph was captured during a training mission over a U.S. Special Forces Parachute Jump drop zone on February 24. The 10th Special Forces group was founded in 1952 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, but was split in 1953 with one half being sent to Germany, while the other half folded into the 77th Special Forces Group. The unit regularly takes part in training expercises with NATO allies in Europe, and has served in the Gulf wars, carried out humanitarian missions, and helped to train Middle Eastern forces. This is the astonishing moment a U.S. Special Forces solider appears to float in midair while saluting his colleagues while taking part in a training mission over Germany last month .","Solider from 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, taking part in a training mission when photograph was taken .

"Across the globe there are millions of 'letters' and 'numbers' hiding among buildings and in the landscape of the Earth. The shapes can be spotted in satellite images and include buildings shaped like the letter 'A', trees planted in the shape of an 'E' and circular marks in the landscape that resemble 'Os' or zeros. A pair of designers has created a tool to help seek out these natural and manmade shapes and is hoping to use the findings to develop software as well as a new font. The Aerial Bold project was set up by German designer Benedikt Groß and geographer Joey Lee. Their tool lets people scour Mapbox images to find letters, numbers and characters in the landscape (pictured) The project began as a Kickstarter campaign, set up by German designer and computer scientist Benedikt Groß and Californian geographer Joey Lee. They raised $11,492 (£7,630) and have since set up the Aerial Bold crowdsourcing tool. ‘While satellites orbit around the Earth taking thousands of images each day, we have limited idea about what unique features actually live on those photographs,’ said the pair. ‘Aerial Bold is as much about developing new methods of mapping features on the Earth’s surface, as it is about generating the first map and typeface of the planet. German researchers recently developed a computer system  that can scan Google Earth satellite images looking for faces. Called Google Faces, it was developed by German design studio Onformative and uses an algorithm that can highlight land masses and terrains with face-like features. The system scans the world, switches to the next zoom level, and starts the scan again taking snapshots and coordinates of the faces it finds. Seeing faces and other shapes in objects and landscapes is known as pareidolia. It is also the tendency to hear hidden messages when songs are played backwards. Human eyes can spot faces, letters and numbers easily and this helps them recognise friends and see patterns. It is harder for computers to mimic this behaviour and software must be trained to do so. ‘In order to develop the smartest and robust letterform detection and classification algorithm, we need to find dozens of real world ""training data"" for each letter, number, or character that we are interested in including in Aerial Bold. ‘These training data include examples all of the possible shapes of ""A's"", ""Z's"", ""6's"", ""❤'s"", and so on that we might be able to see in aerial imagery.’ This database will help researchers at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at HS Weingarten to automate what the designers call ‘the planetary search for letterforms.’ Once trained, this algorithm could be used to automatically find words and letters on images. One example could be to find business addresses using visual search - such as all shops on a Street View map where people can buy lottery tickets. The tool lets people scan through Mapbox satellite images and catalogue all the letters, numbers and characters they find. Users begin with a grid divided into 21 rectangles. The exact location of the satellite imagery isn’t revealed. The software will suggest letters, numbers or characters in each rectangle and this will be displayed with a corresponding number. These suggestions can then be placed over the relevant part of the map. For example, within a rectangle the software may have recognised the letters ‘s’ and ‘e’ but the selection boxes are placed in the centre. It is the ‘hunter’s’ job to move the selection box to sit above the letter. They then rotate and resize the box to make the selection as accurate as possible. Each time a box is placed above a letter the user must click Update Geometry to add it to the database. To add a new letter that the software hasn’t suggested, click ‘Add New’, type the letter and reposition the box. Users begin with a grid divided into 21 rectangles. The software will suggest letters, numbers or characters in each rectangle and this will be displayed by a number. These suggestions can then be placed over the relevant part of the map (pictured). Once Update Geometry is clicked, the letters are added to a database . It is hoped this database will help researchers at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at HS Weingarten to automate what the designers call ‘the planetary search for letterforms.’ A selection of letters that have been found using the tool are pictured with their respective locations and co-ordinates . Once a grid has been explored the ‘Submit Task’ button in the bottom left-hand corner becomes active and the user is taken to another location. People can search for letters either anonymously or by adding a credit name to the discoveries. And they are added to a leaderboard as soon as they find more than ten letters. The top ‘hunter’ is currently Marco Berends with 365, and more than 500 letters, numbers and characters in total have been spotted.

"From racing coats and rain macs to less practical miniature tutus, it may seem that every fashionable dog needs an impressive wardrobe. Now, there’s a coat encrusted with LEDs that can flash different colours and display scrolling messages that aims to turn any mutt into a party pooch. Disco Dog claims to be the first LED dog vest that can be controlled using a smartphone. Scroll down for video . Party pooch: A coat encrusted with LEDs that can flash different colours and display scrolling messages (pictured) aims to turn any mutt into a party pooch. A start-up firm called Party NYC, based in New York and Tokyo, is in the process of creating the final version of the vest, which has 256 LEDs on the outside, as well as a concealed microcontroller, a Bluetooth low energy chip and a 3.7V lithium ion battery. The vest displays a variety of animated patterns and text in thousands of colours. ‘You can choose an animation or type in a message using our Disco Dog application on your smartphone,’ it said on its Kickstarter page. An accompanying app (pictured) can be used to program the design on the vest and control the LEDs from a distance. There are controls for brightness and colour, including ‘two-colour gradients that flow across the vest’ as well as room to type words (right) and even a lost dog mode . ‘It's a fun way to celebrate your dog, and also keeps her visible and safe when it's dark out.’ An accompanying app will be used to program the design on the vest and control the LEDs from a distance. There will be controls for brightness and colour, including ‘two-colour gradients that flow across the vest’. As well as creating a stir on the doggie dance floor, the illuminated vest will be used to find lost dogs. ‘If your dog runs too far away and the connection is lost, the vest will show an automatic ‘Lost Dog’ message, asking bystanders to help the lost pup find her way back,’ the company said. The adjustable vest will have Velcro closures and the LED grid will be removable so it can be washed and the battery recharged. The company is raising funds on Kickstarter to put its Disco Dog vest into production. ‘We're still in beta phase, iterating our physical design, improving the mobile app, and gauging public interest,’ it said. ‘We hope the support we receive through Kickstarter will help us quickly develop Disco Dog into a product that can be manufactured on a larger scale,’ A total of 80 vests will be made at first and they will come in three sizes: small, medium and large. They can be pre-ordered for $300 (£203) for the smallest and $400 (£271) for large.","Disco Dog vest is encrusted with LEDs that flash in different colours .

"Amit Kumar was killed in September 2012 in Queensland during a fatal citizen's arrest . A chilling recording of a father-of-three crying for help has been played during a coronial inquest. Amit Kumar was killed in September 2012 during a fatal citizen's arrest in Queensland. A coroner found yesterday that six people used excessive force which contributed to Mr Kumar's death at a car park in Mooloolaba, north of Brisbane. He had earlier assaulted two people. But in a triple zero call recording posted on Sunshine Coast Daily, the 34-year-old's urgent pleas  can be heard. 'Oh my brother, I can't breathe,' he said. But a male voice responds: 'Not our problem bud.' Brisbane Coroner John Hutton delivered his findings on Wednesday, saying that those restraining Mr Kumar had failed to release pressure on him despite his appeal. 'I find that their failure to release pressure on Mr Kumar, despite Mr Kumar's continual pleading with them that he could not breathe, fell well-short of any standard of reasonableness,' he said. 'The force they used to continue to restrain Mr Kumar in the circumstances was excessive.' The triple zero call made to police by one of group members at 5.37am on September 13, 2012 was played at the coronial inquest. A coroner found yesterday that six people used excessive force which contributed to Mr Kumar's death at a car park in Mooloolaba (pictured), north of Brisbane . The triple zero call made to police by one of group members at 5.37am on September 13, 2012 was played at the coronial inquest. The following can be heard: . A male voice: 'You're not going nowhere pal'; . Mr Amit Kumar: 'Oh my brother, I can't breathe'; . A male voice: 'Not our problem bud'; . Ms Jodie Cassar: Where do you get off hitting women huh?'; . A male voice: 'You f***ing piece of sH**'; . Ms Cassar: 'It's because you know I can't fight ya, that's why'; and . A male voice: 'Are they on the line?'. The following can be heard: . A male voice: 'You're not going nowhere pal'; . Mr Kumar: 'Oh my brother, I can't breathe'; . A male voice: 'Not our problem bud'. Last month's inquest heard the self-employed truck driver assaulted two staff - including Jodie Cassar - from a fishing charter boat when he was told he couldn't join the trip because he had booked it under a false name of 'Adam Jones'. Staff and customers from the fishing charter - five men and one woman - used zip ties to restrain Mr Kumar. The coroner found he died from the combined effects of restraint, heart disease and excess weight around his stomach. A pathologist concluded that contributing factors were the position in which Mr Kumar was held, pressure on his head and neck blocking his airway, and the stress associated with his struggle. Mr Hutton said the initial decision to restrain Mr Kumar was reasonable, but the group failed to recognise the danger to his life. He singled out a doctor among the six people who, the coroner said, acted unreasonably by not taking more control over Mr Kumar's well-being. However, the coroner did not recommend anyone be prosecuted. 'I find that the actions of the people who restrained Mr Kumar contributed to his death,' he said. 'However, I am unable to quantify the level of contribution their actions had to Mr Kumar's death.' Mr Hutton did recommend that first-aid training providers consider raising awareness about the dangers of positional and restraint asphyxia.","Amit Kumar was killed in September 2012 at Mooloolaba, north of Brisbane .

"Crucial negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme stalled last night with the deadline for an international agreement due to expire at midnight tonight. Officials say they remain ‘hopeful’ of a deal but expect a day of ‘brinkmanship’ with Iran trying to win concessions on crippling UN sanctions in return for agreeing to limits that would prevent Tehran from producing enough fuel for a nuclear weapon within a year. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond stressed as he arrived in Lausanne for the talks: ‘We are here because we believe a deal can be done but it has to be a deal which puts the bomb beyond Iran's reach.’ Scroll down for video . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (right) stressed as he arrived for the talks: ‘We are here because we believe a deal can be done but it has to be a deal which puts the bomb beyond Iran's reach’ After 18-months of difficult, protracted negotiations, Britain, the US, China, Russia, France and Germany are aiming to agree a political framework that would set the stage for talks on the technical details of a comprehensive accord, due by 30 June. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has campaigned vehemently against the negotiations, said in Jerusalem that the agreement being put together in Lausanne sends the message ‘that Iran stands to gain by its aggression’. The six-nation group is offering a package of relief measures, lifting the EU oil embargo and removing banking restrictions, in moves synchronised with the suspension of corresponding US sanctions. But it insists that some UN sanctions must stay in place until Iran has convinced the international community it has no intention of pursuing a weapons programme, something that could take many years. Iran appears unwilling to compromise further, its supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has left them no negotiating space insisting yesterday : ‘Sanctions must be lifted in one go, not as a result of future Iranian actions.’ A Western diplomat warned: ‘There are still some quite important gaps,’ amid warnings that ‘an agreement is far from certain. It could all still break-up.’ .S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, gestures as he takes a walk during a break of the new round of talks on Iran's nuclear program, in Lausanne, Switzerland today . Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who has been holding talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry since last Thursday, said he believed they could ‘make the necessary progress to be able to resolve all the issues and start writing them down.’ Much appears to hinge on Iran’s willingness to sacrifice a considerable proportion of its 9,900 working centrifuges and export a large amount of its 7.9 tons of low-enriched uranium. The US and its European allies want a mechanism that would allow suspended UN sanctions to be put back into effect rapidly if Iran reneges on a deal. Russia reportedly accepts this, but wants to ensure its Security Council veto rights are protected. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov announced he was to break-off from Lausanne to meet with officials in other countries but not elaborate. His officials appeared more optimistic than many of an agreement. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov (pictured right) announced he was to break-off from Lausanne to meet with officials in other countries but not elaborate . Despite deep disagreements on several points, Western officials said the two sides had previously been closing in on a preliminary deal that could be summarized in a brief document which may or may not be released. Officials said the talks could run at least until the deadline of midnight on Tuesday or beyond. If there was a deal in Lausanne, the parties might move to Geneva for a ceremony. The six powers want more than a 10-year suspension of Iran's most sensitive nuclear work. Tehran, which denies it is trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability, demands in exchange for limits on its atomic activities a swift end to sanctions. One sticking point concerns Iran's demand to continue with research into newer generations of advanced centrifuges that can purify uranium faster and in greater quantities than those it currently operates for use in nuclear power plants or, if very highly enriched, in weapons.","Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond stressed that deal could be done .

"Three women tortured a man by pressing burning hair tongs and a cigarette lighter on to his genitals when they found he had dated three people at once, a court has heard. The trio also taunted the victim with a pizza cutter in what was described as like a scene from Reservoir Dogs. Lorraine Earles, 47, Natalie Lilley, 19, Leah White, 22, along with male defendant Brendan Teale, 27, had plotted revenge on the victim for allegedly seeing several women at a time and lured him to a flat in Scarborough before strapping him to a chair. Natalie Lilley, who appeared at York Crown Court after admitting torturing a man in a scene like the film Reservoir Dogs . The three women and one man then carried out a prolonged attack on the victim, who was also forced to drink liquid wash before having the hot curling tongs pressed to his genitals. York Crown Court heard one of his tormentors also burnt him with a cigarette lighter as the others laughed and giggled. During the torture he also had a pizza cutter pressed to his cheek and was punched, kicked and slapped repeatedly. The court heard Earles bit the man's ear, pushed his head down to his knees and used a cigarette lighter to burn the back of his neck, before threatening to suffocate him as she put a scarf around his mouth. She then ordered White to burn his genitals with hair curling tongs before pulling the chair back, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor. Leah White, who also took part in the attack, which saw the man have burning hot hair tongs pressed on his genitals . The frightening escalation of the assault prompted White and Lilley to alert Teale, who was reputedly the ringleader of the assault and took part in the beating, but had retired to a bedroom before Earles upped the ante in a scene reminiscent of the bloody Quentin Tarantino film. Teale untied the victim and picked him up off the floor, then went back to the bedroom and fell asleep, while Earles nodded off on a sofa. White then took the flat door keys out of his pocket and released the victim, whose Blackberry phone had been stolen and later pawned by Teale. The four torture suspects were later arrested after the victim's step-mother called police. York Crown Court heard each blamed one another for the sickening attack but Teale and Earles were found to be the main protagonists. The four suspects were originally charged with falsely imprisoning the man on November 10, 2013, but this was eventually dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service and they each pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. They appeared for sentence on Friday, when the court heard that Teale - who has previous convictions for assault and battery - had been smoking cannabis on the day in question. After being bailed by police, he went on to commit a burglary and was also charged with handling stolen goods taken in a separate raid. White, who had once been in a relationship with the victim, and Lilley, a mother-of-one on benefits, both had clean records up until the attack. Barrister Andrew Temple, for Teale, said the defendants had lured the man to the flat to teach him a lesson for allegedly seeing several women at the same time, but he claimed that Earles had been the 'main player' in the torture scene. Laura Addy, for Earles, said her client had severe mental health issues and was under Teale's spell. York Crown Court, pictured, heard how as the victim's burnt him with a cigarette lighter the others laughed and giggled. White's defence barrister Glen Parsons said she had acted 'wholly out of character' under orders from others.' 'Her role was to use the (curling) tongs but she insisted they weren't on full heat,' he added. Recorder Bernard Gateshill told the defendants: 'You all participated in an attack upon (the victim) which was designed to embarrass and humiliate him.' Earles, of Scarborough, was spared a jail sentence because she had spent five months on remand and was 'clearly a troubled woman with a history of psychological difficulties'. She was given a two-year community order with supervision, ordered to attend the Women's Community Project in Scarborough for a 20-day course, and made to pay a £60 victim surcharge. Teale, of Malton, was jailed for 12 months for actual bodily harm, burglary and the handling offence. Lilley, of Scarborough, was given a two-year community order with supervision and 100 hours' unpaid work. White was also given a two-year community punishment and ordered to take part in a 16-day course at the Women's Community Project.","Lorraine Earles, 47, Natalie Lilley, 19, and Leah White, 22, lured in victim .

"A 15-year-old north Florida girl who authorities say fatally shot her 16-year-old brother after years of abuse at home pleaded no contest on Thursday to felony burglary and will receive probation and counseling. The girl's probation will last until her 19th birthday, and is contingent upon her participation in counseling, and testifying truthfully in the case of her parents, who face felony child abuse charges, Third Circuit State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister said. 'This child has the best chance at a normal adult life by receiving the therapy and education she needs and residing in the setting of her current foster home,' he said. A 15-year-old girl (left) and her 11-year-old sister (right) have not been charged with murder after the eldest girl fatally shot her 16-year-old brother at their Florida home in January. The eldest will receive probation and counseling . The girl and her 11-year-old sister were initially arrested on suspicion of murder after the January 5 shooting in Lake City. No charges were filed against the younger sister. The names of the members of the family are not being released because of the girls' ages and because of abuse allegations. On January 5, the girls and their three-year-old sister were left by their parents in the care of their brother. The parents were away on a work-related truck drive. Police say the brother locked the elder sister in her room, but when he fell asleep, she persuaded the 11-year-old to let her out so she could shower. The boy, 16, was killed by his sister, 15, on January 5 after she escaped the room her brother had locked her in and shot him in the neck . The older sister asked her younger sister to keep watch as she went outside and cut out the air conditioner of her parents' locked bedroom window to retrieve a pistol. The girl asked her younger sister to take their three-year-old sister and hide in a closet before she shot her brother in the neck as he slept, police said. The two older girls fled the house, leaving the toddler behind. They were later found by police outside a Dollar General store after the younger girl called a friend saying she needed a ride. Documents show that the elder girl suffered years of abuse, including being locked in her bedroom for days regularly with only a blanket and a bucket to use the bathroom. The longest they kept the girl locked in her room was 20 consecutive days, the father told police. In the room, police found only a blanket and a bucket filled with urine in the closet, allegedly a punishment because the teenage girl was stealing and talking back. Letters from the parents asking her why she should be let out of that room were also found in the police investigation. 'It was learned that (the 15-year-old girl) has made past attempts at ending her life but neither law enforcement nor (emergency management services) was notified,' police wrote in their January report. In addition, documents showed that she had been sexually abused by her uncle, who was convicted in 2010. The uncle was arrested in December 2010 on sex charges after his wife found a USB with movie clips of him and the 15-year-old engaged in sexual acts. It had been going on for some time. According to police documents, his wife reported seeing a video clip of the girl sitting down and a man with his penis out, standing behind her. He then had oral sex with the underage girl, while she made noises, the wife told police. The victim later told investigators that she did not want it to happen. The uncle had told her to 'suck on his thingy' and that 'they were to be private and not to tell anyone no matter what'. The abuse had been going on 'for a long time', according to the police report, and the videotaping for about a year. The parents have been charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The girls' mother told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved . The uncle was convicted and is on the registered sex offender's list. Authorities also said the children's mother had discovered the siblings having sex in 2011. The mother reported to police that she heard noises coming from the bedroom and found the teenage boy having sex with his sister, who is a year younger. The mother told police that she separated the siblings and asked them what happened. The girl told her mother that she did not want to 'do it' with her brother but he put pressure on her. She also referenced the earlier abuse by her uncle. After an investigation by child welfare officials, no one was charged. Her parents had also removed her from school, documents show. Siegmeister said all of the family's history and circumstances were taken into consideration in the decision not to pursue more serious criminal charges. 'This case is a tragedy to all those involved: the deceased, the two arrested children, as well as their 3-year-old sister who has been separated from them both. Further incarceration... serves no deterrent, rehabilitative nor other societal interest,' he said.","Attorney said the girl will receive probation and counselling for four years .

"A South African university has voted to pull down a statue of a notorious British colonialist after students threw a bucket of excrement at it. Bosses at the University of Cape Town bowed to demands to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes after a series of protests on campus. UCT, the oldest university in South Africa and regularly ranked as the best on the continent, was built on land donated by Rhodes, a mining magnate who died in 1902. Scroll down for video . A statue of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes is shown covered in plastic bags as part of a protest by students and staff of the University of Cape Town . Students and staff of the University of Cape Town stage a protest against the statue of Cecil Rhodes. Excrement was launched at the statue during one protest . But the 'poo protest' was launched by a small group of students earlier this month, sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue be torn down. Many of the students involved in the protests never lived under the injustices of white minority rule, but say they still experience racial discrimination 21 years after the end of apartheid. The large statue of a notoriously racist Rhodes gazing across an Africa that he coveted for the British empire made them feel alienated on a campus still dominated by white staff, they said. On Friday, the university senate voted 181 to one to remove the statue permanently from the campus, after vice-chancellor Max Price acknowledged 'the many injustices of colonial conquest enacted under Rhodes' watch'. While the university council still has to endorse the move at a special meeting on April 8, the statue will be boarded up until it is handed over to government heritage authorities, university spokeswoman Pat Lucas said. 'It is certainly a victory for us,' said student representative council president Ramabina Mahapa. 'It means we are being heard by the larger community.' Cecil Rhodes (pictured) made his fortune with his De Beers mining company . Cecil Rhodes was born in Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire and went on to became one of Britain's most successful colonialists. He was sent to southern Africa in the late nineteenth century when he suffered bad health as a teenager. Within four decades he had established political control of Britain's Cape Colony, expanded the territory north to found Rhodesia and taken ownership of the world's richest diamond mining company De Beers. His expansionist plans were fired by a dream of securing a British corridor of power stretching from Cape Town to Cairo. But his short life was blighted by bad health and he  died of heart failure aged just 49. Following his death Rhodes' remains were transported by train from Cape Town to Bulawayo and laid to rest in the Matopo Hills south of the city, his favourite spot in the vast empire he had helped secure for Britain in southern Africa. Rhodes, famous for dreaming of a Cape-to-Cairo railway, made his fortune with his De Beers mining company during the Kimberley diamond rush, and went on to grow his wealth during the ensuing gold rush around modern-day Johannesburg. But the disappearance of Rhodes is unlikely to end the debate on racial transformation launched by the protest, which gave rise to similar demands for change at two other universities. In the east coast city of Durban, students at the University of KwaZulu Natal splattered white paint and anti-racism slogans on a statue of Britain's King George V. And at Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape, activists want the institution to be renamed. The protests have also sparked debate among academics, historians, politicians and writers of letters to newspapers. Students have dismissed the argument that Rhodes should be honoured for donating land for the campus, saying he stole it from black Africans in the first place. A 'poo protest' was launched by a group of students sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue (pictured) be torn down . Eusebius McKaiser, an author and commentator who attended Rhodes University and won a prestigious international Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University, said in the New York Times: 'South African universities remain a testament to the country's colonial heritage in terms of what they teach, who does the teaching, and the morally odious symbols that haunt our campuses or lurk in their very names. 'At Rhodes, 83 per cent of senior management staff remain white and 77 per cent of ""professionally qualified staff,"" a category that includes academic teaching staff, are white,' he said. Whites make up about eight percent of South Africa's population of some 54 million. McKaiser, who is of mixed race, defended the fact that he accepted a Rhodes scholarship, telling a radio interviewer that in moral terms the colonialist's money belonged to 'the millions of black South Africans whose rights were trampled on'. He took the scholarship to Oxford 'so that I could come back and show the middle finger to his legacy,' McKaiser said. Since the end of apartheid the names of some cities and streets deemed offensive have been changed, but monuments to South Africa's racist white-minority rule remain scattered throughout the country. Much of that can be attributed to the racial reconciliation policies of  Nelson Mandela, who became the country's first democratically-elected president in 1994. Another former Rhodes scholar, Shaun Johnson, wrote in South Africa's Times newspaper of his surprise when Mandela agreed in 2002 to have his name coupled with that of Rhodes in a new charitable organisation. The Mandela Rhodes Foundation, of which Johnson is now executive director, provides post-graduate scholarships to young Africans. Many of the students involved in the protests never lived under the injustices of white minority rule, but say they still experience racial discrimination 21 years after the end of apartheid . Students have dismissed the argument that Rhodes should be honoured for donating land for the campus, saying he stole it from black Africans in the first place . 'Mandela told us to expect controversy and embrace it, while remaining certain in the knowledge that what we were actually doing was what mattered,' Johnson wrote. 'He said... whenever possible, we had to put history to work for a better future.' Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa echoed Mandela's approach in his response to the UCT protests. 'The government's attitude and policy to all heritage sites - including statues of former imperialists like Cecil John Rhodes, among others - is based on a national policy of reconciliation, nation-building and social cohesion,' he said.","University of Cape Town bosses have bowed to demands to remove statue .

"Kathleen Wyatt has won the right to fight for a  payout from her ex-husband  energy businessman Dale Vince, 20 years after they divorced . She has taken jobs picking fruit, and since the mid-1990s has lived largely on benefits. Her current home is a former council house in Monmouth, south Wales, bought on a mortgage for £60,000 under right-to-buy laws. It was described in court as being damp and badly heated. By contrast, her former husband has founded Ecotricity, now one of the UK's biggest green energy companies, worth at least £57million. The strict vegan lives in a £3million 18th century castle near Stroud, Gloucestershire, with his second wife and their five-year-old son. Mr Vince also owns Forest Green Rovers football club where he has banned red meat for players and supporters. Mr Vince's son Dane moved in with his father in 2001 after the business began to take off. In December 2012 a judge ordered the ex-husband to pay Ms Wyatt £125,000. But he challenged the ruling and Appeal Court judges struck it out. Yesterday, Supreme Court justices ruled in favour of Ms Wyatt and said her claim should be heard by a judge in the Family Division of the High Court. She is demanding almost £2million. Lord Wilson, speaking for all five justices, said that under 1973 divorce legislation the courts should have taken into account the years Ms Wyatt looked after the couple's son. 'He was brought up by Ms Wyatt,' the judge said. 'She struggled to do so. They were 16 years of real hardship for her and her family. At times they lived in caravans. They moved home frequently. They lived from hand to mouth.' Lord Wilson said the burden had fallen on Ms Wyatt and her contribution had been unmatched by Mr Vince. Mr Vince turned from New Age traveller to the founder of a multi-million green energy firm, Ecotricity . Kathleen Wyatt (left) pictured with lawyer Barbara Reeves (right) after justices said the case could be heard . Ms Wyatt is pictured leaving the Supreme Court today (left) after judges ruled her application can be heard by the High Court and in  2003 (right) after the two New Age travellers had divorced . As a result, the case should now be reconsidered by a family court, he said. Lord Wilson added: 'Unwisely, Miss Wyatt has pitched her claim at £1.9million and it is obvious … that an award approaching that size is out of the question. Her claim may even be dismissed. Kathleen Wyatt's legal victory opens the way for divorcees to claim a pay-off from their ex-spouse decades later. Supreme Court judges – Lady Hale, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson, Lord Hughes and Lord Hodge – said Appeal judges had been wrong to throw Ms Wyatt's original case out on the basis she had no reasonable grounds, in 2013. The justices said under the 1973 Matrimonial Causes Act, a family judge in a divorce case must consider who has cared for the home and any children. Lawyers said the case would encourage copycat claims. James Brown, of firm JMW, said: 'It amounts to nothing short of a call to action … [It] underlines how there is no limit on when someone can make a claim. It doesn't matter whether you divorce in your 20s and return with a claim when you're 80.' There was no recorded financial settlement from Ms Wyatt's divorce. 'But there is … a real prospect that she will secure a comparatively modest award, perhaps of a size which would enable her to purchase a somewhat more comfortable mortgage-free home.' Ms Wyatt's solicitor, Barbara Reeves of law firm Mishcon de Reya, said: 'She looks forward to concluding the litigation as quickly as possible.' Ms Reeves added that Mishcon would try to win a costs order against Mr Vince to cover its fees, which have so far swallowed up all but £2,539 of the £125,000 awarded to Ms Wyatt in the earlier court hearing. After the ruling, Mr Vince said: 'I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has decided not to bring this case to an end now, over 30 years since the relationship ended. 'We both moved on and started families of our own. 'For my part the passing of time is extremely prejudicial, it's been so long that there are no records … it's hard to defend yourself in such circumstances. Indeed, the delay itself has enabled the claim, because there is no paperwork in existence.' He added: 'I feel that we all have a right to move on and not be looking over our shoulders. This could signal open season for people who had brief relationships a quarter of a century ago. It's mad in my opinion.' Ecotricity has earned Mr Vince considerable wealth and he spent almost £1million building his electric supercar, Nemesis, from a second hand second-hand Lotus Exige. It can reach speeds of up to 170mph . Vince lives in an 18th century fort in Stroud in Gloucestershire, which he bought for around £3million . Millionaire is the chairman of Forest Green FC and was pictured watching a match against Stockport in 201 . Mr Vince received an OBE at Buckingham Palace in 2004 for services to the environment.

"Rescue teams helping with the search for seven Marines and four soldiers feared dead after an Army helicopter crashed during a night exercise said they are remaining 'optimistic'. The UH-60 Black Hawk crashed in the Gulf of Mexico close to Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday night. Search teams have been combing the water for clues and said they are clinging to hope despite human remains being discovered. Debris from the crash has also washed up on shore, including the landing gear and the side of the helicopter with the glass from the windows missing. Scroll down for video . Missing: Seven Marines and four soldiers are presumed dead after a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed in the Gulf of Mexico during a night training mission. Above, some of the debris that washed ashore on Wednesday morning . Survivors? Pentagon officials say the 11 on board are presumed dead but local authorities stress that it is still a search and rescue mission - not search and recover. Above, a door or window from the helicopter . Other parts thought to be from the helicopter have continued to wash up on the beach, including this wheel . Washing up: A glove washed up on a stretch of military-owned beach on Wednesday morning following a Black Hawk helicopter crash around 12 hours earlier . Foggy conditions remained on Wednesday morning which forced the rescue teams to take an 'operational pause', an Eglin Air Force Base spokesman said. The spokesman told NBC News: 'There is always room for optimism. The fog has been hampering our search efforts, and more fog is continuing to roll in.' The comments came as hundreds of people attended a vigil and lit candles for the missing servicemen. Dolly Edwards, 35, said she attended the vigil, held on the end of a nearby pier, to pay her respects as the soldiers were only in the area for training. 'My heart is really hurt right now knowing these people were here just on training — knowing they went and left their family members and did not give that goodbye, you know, because they weren't going off to war,' she told UTSanDiego.com. Norman Caron, a retired airman, added: 'We just need to be here to pay respects.' While a Pentagon official said the men were presumed dead, the hunt for the crashed helicopter remains a search and rescue mission and not search and recovery. Thick fog: The are was under fog advisory when the crash took place. Military officials who spoke with Daily Mail Online says local pilots are used to the conditions but the pilot who was flying at the time was from Louisiana or North Carolina. Above, a file photo of a UH-60 Black Hawk - not the one that crashed . Hard to see: Military personnel wade in the water and search on the beach under heavy fog at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida on Wednesday . A serviceman collects debris along the beach of what might be the wreckage of the military helicopter . Evidence: A man walks the beach near where debris washed up Wednesday morning following the helicopter crash, and appears to be picking up remnants of the crash . Base officials said the Marines were part of a Camp Lejeune-based, 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion from Jacksonville, North Carolina. The soldiers were from a National Guard unit based in Hammond, Louisiana. The massive Black Hawk has been the workhorse of the U.S. Army since 1979. They are primarily used to ferry troops to and from the battlefields, and support aircraft, but adapted models carry out medical evacuations with state-of-the-art equipment, search-and-rescue, armed escort and warfare missions. Black Hawks were a central part of the U.S. military attack on Somalia capital, Mogadishu in 1993. They were also used in military operations in the Balkan region and Haiti in the 1990s; and supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The aircraft has also been used prominently by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft based in Stratford, Connecticut. It flies low to the ground to avoid detection and its twin-turbine engine can deliver a maximum speed of roughly 180mph. During an afternoon press conference, Major General Glenn Curtis of the Louisiana National Guard confirmed that all of his soldiers were male and that three had aided in the Hurricane Katrina response. He described his men as 'tremendous pilots' and 'tremendous soldiers' Two Black Hawks took off together from the base ahead of the crash on Tuesday night. It is unclear how many soldiers were on board the other aircraft. A military spokesperson told Daily Mail Online that training missions usually took off from Eglin on a daily basis and said that it was up to individual units whether to fly in adverse weather conditions such as heavy fog. Fog was common in the region, the spokesperson said, and local pilots were used to the conditions.  The pilot on the Black Hawk which crashed on Tuesday night was from either Louisiana or North Carolina. The helicopter was reported missing around 8.30pm on Tuesday and search and rescue crews found debris from the crash around 2am on Wednesday. Kim Urr, 62, who works at the nearby Navarre Beach campground, said she heard a strange sound, followed by two explosions around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. 'It sounded like something metal either being hit or falling over, that's what it sounded like. And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,' Urr said. The tail rotor of the helicopter with its ID number was found during the rescue mission, according to military officials. Names of those involved were not immediately released, pending notification of next-of-kin. But Mike Spinks from Eglin Environmental Public Affairs told WKRG: 'There is always hope.' The Army helicopter took off from a nearby airport in Destin and joined other aircraft in the training exercise. The UH-60 helicopter went down during a routine training mission off a remote stretch of beach between Pensacola and Destin. Two helicopters were flying a night training mission, but only one of the helicopters returned. Above patrol boats search the waters near the crash site on Wednesday .

Seven Marines and four soldiers aboard an Army helicopter that crashed over waters off Florida during a routine night training mission were presumed dead on Wednesday . The search for the missing Black Hawk helicopter was being hampered by heavy fog in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday morning . The beach is owned by the military and is used for test missions. The training area includes 20 miles of pristine beachfront that has been under the control of the military since before World War II. Military police keep a close watch on the area and have been known to run off private vendors who rent jet skis or paddle boards without permission. Test range manager Glenn Barndollar said in August that the beach provides an ideal training area for special operations units from all branches of the military to practice over the water, on the beach and in the bay. The military sometimes drops trainees over the water using boats or helicopters and the trainees must make their way onshore. The black helicopter that crashed was a newer model that had a black box, which could shed light on what caused the crash if located.

"U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was brutally beaten, kept chained inside a cage, blindfolded and threatened with execution during his five years in captivity, he has claimed while speaking out for the first time. The former prisoner of war, who was captured by the Taliban in 2009 and released as part of a controversial prisoner swap last year, detailed his imprisonment for the first time in a statement released by his lawyer on Wednesday. It came after the Army charged the 28-year-old with desertion and misbehavior in the face of the enemy. He could get life in prison if convicted of the latter, more serious charge. Bergdahl vanished from Combat Outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009 while on morning guard duty. He left behind his weapon, ammunition and body armor. Scroll down for videos . Imprisoned: Bowe Bergdahl, pictured two weeks after he was captured in Afghanistan in 2009, has described his brutal living conditions while held captive - including beatings, little light and shackles . Captivity: Bergdahl, pictured in December 2010, said he tried to escape on multiple occasions and once managed to hide for nine days - but he was always caught and beaten by his captors . He was later captured by the Taliban and within hours, he quickly learned the nature of the people he had met. His minders briefly left him alone in a village where he was being interrogated and beaten . for evading questions. 'After a while they put the blindfold back on and threw the . blanket over my head. Some moments after that I believed I had a . chance to run for it and did,' Bergdahl wrote in his statement. He was tackled near the outskirts of the village by a large . group of men who pummeled him with their fists and clubbed him . with the butt of an AK-47 rifle, snapping off the stock. He tried to escape again near the end of his first week as a . prisoner, eluding his captors for about 15 minutes, his statement said, but he was found and beaten . with a thick rubber hose. Swap: Footage shows a Blackhawk helicopter waiting as Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl (in white) is led from his Taliban captors to American military during his release at the Afghan border on June 4, 2014 . Heading home: Bergdahl is pictured inside a vehicle guarded by the Taliban in Afghanistan before the swap . 'After my first two escape attempts, for about three months I was chained to a bed spread-eagle and blindfolded,' he said. 'The blindfold was only taken off a few times a day to allow me to eat and use the latrine.' Bergdahl said it was not until his muscles began to atrophy . and he began to have trouble walking that his captors unchained . one of his hands from above his head and tied it to his side, . allowing him to sit up in bed. He developed sores from the chafing of the chains and they . became infected, with the infection spreading to his face and . other parts of his body, he said. After the first three months or so he was . never fully chained to a bed again, but he was forced to remain . in chains attached to unmovable objects. After a year of captivity, he was placed in a cage, where his hands were kept in chains. His feet were also chained to the cage every night for a year, he said. Charges: On Wednesday, U.S. Army Col. Daniel King spoke from Fort Bragg (pictured) about the charges against Bergdahl, who has been charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy . Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl deserted his platoon in June 2009 during morning guard duty, his comrades have said . Eventually his captors stopped chaining his feet because of 'acute pain' which developed into a 'freezing numbness that continues to the present, as both feet have neuropathy'. Bergdahl faces charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice: . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service'. It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . Maximum sentence: Five years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': Article 99 charges a service member with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy' Maximum sentence: Life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . The cage was over plumbing where he could relieve himself. He said he was fed elbow noodles or rice and very little . else. He received two bottles of water a day. The bottoms of his . feet and other parts of his body were regularly beaten with a . copper cable. 'I was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years, with little to no understanding of time, through periods of constant darkness, periods of constant light, and periods of completely random flickering of light, and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening behind the door I was held behind,' Bergdahl said in the statement. His captors would also often play mind games with him, he said. They would tell him he was about to be executed or that he was going to be released - or that he was going to be there for 30 years. Toward the end of his first year in captivity, Bergdahl said . he managed to escape again. He got away from the building where . he was being held and remained at large for about nine days in . increasingly desperate circumstances. 'Without food and only putrid water to drink, my body failed . on top of a short mountain close to evening,' he wrote. He was eventually found by a Taliban search group that brutally beat him, he said. 'One tried to rip my beard and hair out, but from what I could sense they where [sic] more worried about getting me out of that area as quickly as possible,' he said. The Taliban Five: The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . 'This is the time that my body reached the worst point of . condition and for approximately the next year and a half I would . not recover from it.' The statement was released via his attorney, Eugene Fidell, after the charges were announced. Last year, the Obama administration released five Taliban leaders in exchange for Bergdahl's return - but the celebration of his release was shortlived after his former comrades came forward and said he had deserted his post and forced them to carry out dangerous mission to try to find him. Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if . convicted of the misbehavior charge. He could also be reduced in rank to private, forfeit all salary . and be given a dishonorable discharge.","Bergdahl, 28, was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2009 and released as part of a controversial prisoner swap last May .

"Clive Betts, chairman of the Communities and Local Government committee, said Ofsted's 'credibility is on the line' Ofsted's credibility suffered a major blow yesterday when scathing MPs said the inspectorate was partly to blame for the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal. The education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs. Yesterday a Parliamentary committee probing Ofsted’s work there called for urgent inspections of every council in the country with responsibility for child protection – to ensure large-scale abuse isn’t being ignored elsewhere. Clive Betts, chairman of the Communities and Local Government committee, said Ofsted’s ‘credibility is on the line’. The Labour MP added: ‘The perpetrators bear ultimate responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children in Rotherham but the ineffectiveness of Ofsted’s inspections contributed to a failure to expose the extent of the problem.’ The fierce attack came on the day a second group of MPs found flaws in Ofsted’s handling of the Trojan Horse affair, in which Birmingham schools were accused of fostering religious extremism. The Commons education committee said little evidence of radicalisation had been found and ‘confidence in Ofsted has been undermined, and efforts should be made by the inspectorate to restore it’. Meanwhile, the Rotherham report pointed to Ofsted inspectors repeatedly labelling child protection in the town as ‘adequate’ – yet they were tied to their paperwork and had no idea what was really going on. Instead, the inspectors simply accepted what they were told by local officials, and didn’t ask searching questions. ‘Ofsted does not appear to have probed beyond what it was told, and it failed to penetrate the professional jealousy and incompetence that distorted the operation of children’s social care in Rotherham,’ stated the report. It also described Ofsted’s habit of calling the efforts of councils like Rotherham adequate as ‘ambiguous’. While Ofsted thought ‘adequate’ meant that improvement was needed, outsiders, including councillors, thought it meant ‘satisfactory’. ‘Rotherham appears to have gone a step further and interpreted it as indicating a strong performance.’ The MPs added that Ofsted was operating in a way that meant its different inspectors and departments did not discuss their findings with each other – and inspections of councils like Rotherham were ‘too short and narrowly focused’. They relied on paperwork – rather than actuality – and on what they were told by councils, who did not pass on concerns raised by whistleblowers and others. The education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town (pictured) where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs . ‘We conclude that the experience of whistleblowers at Rotherham was the antithesis of what a good whistleblowers policy should be,’ the MPs said. They called for Louise Casey – who was sent in by the Government to examine Rotherham’s failures after the scandal broke – to carry out a second inquiry to check that the town is working more effectively. A similar inquiry should be held into South Yorkshire Police, they said. And they were ‘uneasy’ about the way in which Ofsted polices itself as it ‘may not be sufficiently accountable for its performance’. Last night an Ofsted spokesman said: ‘We welcome the report and the committee’s recognition that the changes we have made since 2012 strengthen our ability to uncover where children are at risk. We know we didn’t get it right historically in Rotherham and have apologised for those mistakes.’","As many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs between 1997 and 2013 .

"The father of two who died after crashing his exotic sports-car into a power pole at high speed has been remembered by his friends as the sort of person who 'would do anything for his mates.' George Kanalis died after he crashed his Lamborghini into a power pole in Sydney's west on Thursday night. Steven Muhvich, one of Mr Kanalis' best mates, said the 42-year-old routinely helped out him and his father, according to Fairfax Media. Scroll down for video . George Kanalis (pictured) lost his life on Thursday night after slamming his dream car into a power pole . The 42-year-old father died at the scene after crashing his luxury Lamborghini into a pole in Sydney's west . 'He would do anything for me and my dad, I just don't know what happened to him,' Mr Muhvich said. 'He's got drag cars and knows what he is doing. I think he just lost control.' Terrifying footage has emerged of the moment the Lamborghini lost control and slammed into the power pole. CCTV footage has captured Mr Kanalis, from Glenhaven, north-west of Sydney driving at high speed through Hassall Street in Wetherill Park as he collided into a number of other vehicles. Massive cloud of smoke and a trail of skid marks on the road suggests he spun out of lost after overtaking another vehicle before slamming into a pole about 6pm on Thursday. Nearby workers and motorists were seen running towards the scene to help the father of two, who died at the scene after being trapped inside his dream car. Distraught family and friends have returned to the scene to pay their respects as they gathered on Friday to lay flowers while others have paid tribute on social media. One friend posted on Facebook: 'Thanks For the bourbon George. Rip mate.' Another said: 'I grew up with George since 2nd grade at school we spent most of our teenage years good mate although I haven't seen him in a few years he was always there [sic].' A third friend wrote: 'One of life's great characters, you're right, taken way too soon. RIP' While another said: 'He was a very unique person a true one of a kindRIP [sic] George my friend' Police are investigating whether speed or alcohol was a factor in the single vehicle crash, after witness reports of a car crashing into a pole. Witnesses have told police that the car was driving east when it crossed to the opposite side of the road, collided with a number of other vehicles, left the roadway and crashed into a pole. No-one else was injured in the incident. The 42-year-old father left a trail of white smoke and skid marks on the road as the wheel comes off his car . The incident happened at Wetherill Park in Sydney's west on Thursday night . The skid marks on the road suggests the father of two spun out of control after overtaking another vehicle . A number of  people who were travelling in other vehicles  were struck by the Lamborghini, but were not hurt. An investigation into the crash has commenced and report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner. Inspector Tony Mitchell, from the Fairfield local area command said that the cause of the crash is not yet known but  police are investigating whether speed and alcohol contributed to the crash. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, a NSW police spokesperson said there have been no developments in the investigation but anyone who saw the Lamborghini in the lead-up to the crash has been urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

"Dining in a social setting can be one of life's finest pleasures, where the wine flows as freely as the conversation. However, certain foods can leave you on a collision course with culinary faux pas where, at best, you're left feeling awkward and, at worst, said dish ends up covering you or your companions. Just ask Ed Miliband, who probably never wants to see a bacon sandwich again after photos of the Labour leader doing battle with a particularly gristly rasher were widely ridiculed. Scroll down for video . Gurning for change: Labour leader Ed Miliband was caught out by a bacon sandwich earlier this year . How not to do it: Nigel Farage, left, and Boris Johnson, right,  have both come unstuck while sampling foods on the political trail . With an election on the way and plenty of opportunities for the nation's politicians to make fools of themselves eating in public, William Hanson, a leading expert and consultant in etiquette and protocol tells FEMAIL everything you need to know about how to eat some of the trickiest foods without rendering yourself a culinary fool. William says: 'Nothing can put one off a fellow dining companion more than seeing them messily tackle what’s on their plate. 'We now see politicians, TV masterchefs and competing dinner guests badly eat their victuals so perhaps now, if it is not too late, I give them (and you) my guide on how to best tuck in to some of the trickiest foods to tackle.' ASPARAGUS . If served as a first course, rather than an accompaniment vegetable, these are eaten with the hands and dipped into the hollandaise sauce. Rules of etiquette: Never double-dip asparagus...unless you have your own personal pot of sauce . Brits will eat these with the left hand (leaving the right hand free of grease, ready to shake hands or pick up a wine glass, for example); there are some cultures where eating with the left hand is not the done thing, in this case, they may eat the asparagus with the right hand. (Not many know the left-hand rule today.) You may double-dip in the sauce so long as it is your own portion. BANANA . If in doubt, go for the banana, says William: the fruit is easy to unwrap with a knife and fork . Fruit is served as part of the dessert course (dessert was traditionally the fruit course at the end of the meal, whereas today people confuse it with the sweet course). At state banquets, such as the recent one for Mexico at Buckingham Palace, fruit is still served as a palate cleanser. A banana is always the easiest fruit to pick. Cut both ends off with dessert cutlery (very sharp), slice down the skin to unwrap, and then cut off slices and eat with a fork and knife. CAVIAR . The Russians tend to consume caviar from the small pad of flesh between the thumb and the forefinger (again, on the left hand). This, however, looks beyond pretentious in a social setting and is thus best avoided. Instead, scoop a small bit on to your plate and use a thin piece of toast or a blini to consume. One-way ticket to inelegance: If corn on the cob is offered, say no...if it's served, then just chow down . CORN ON THE COB . The little prongs you often get given are naff – especially the solid silver ones (a rare instance where plastic would be preferably, but not by much). Hosts really shouldn’t serve corn this way unless it’s a barbecue (and a pretty feral one at that). If you get offered it, politely decline. If you get served it, with naff prongs, then pick it up and gnaw away. Everyone else will be in the same inelegant boat as you. ESCARGOT (OR SNAILS) Special clamps are often used to hold the shell in place whilst a small, two-pronged fork is held in the right hand and used to pierce and scoop the fleshy meat from within. Tricky little fellas! William insists you use a fork to tackle a langoustine and advises against sucking... LANGOUSTINE . Using a small fork upturned in the right hand, scoop out the white fleshy meat from the tail. Your left hand can be used to secure the shell as you daintily perform your excavation (a finger bowl should be provided). You may see some people pick up the animal to suckle the head – these people are to be treated with the greatest of social caution. Moules be sorry: Use empty shells as would-be tweezers to help you pluck the flesh from other mussels, says William...and always make use of the finger bowl . MUSSELS . The most elegant method is to use a fork to loosen and consume the first mollusc within, before using the empty shell to tweeze out the other mussels, discarding redundant shells on a nearby plate. A finger bowl should also be present, to the left of the setting. Dip one hand in at a time to wash away the grease. OYSTERS . A skilled high-society habitué will know that these are really only eaten in months containing the letter R. The upmarket way to eat is to simply tip the contents into the mouth from the shell, having loosened the contents beforehand with a fork. An oyster fork is a Victorian middle-class invention and does nothing a normal fork cannot do. If an oyster fork is set, use it. If not, just use a normal small fork. Peas release me: Scooping is a no-no, spearing is really the only way to go with the little green spheres . PEAS . Good hosts will never serve these at a formal dinner party, but if you find yourself confronted by petit pois or the like resist the urge to turn your fork over and scoop. Instead, use the tines of the fork to spear a collection and transfer to the mouth. If mashed potato has been served, or something similar, use that as a ‘glue’. Eaten, never drunk: Soup should be pushed away from the diner and then gently tipped into the mouth . SOUP WITH BREAD . Soup is always ‘eaten’, never drunk. The soup spoon is held in the right hand and scoops away from you on one side, skimming the surface. Then sip from the nearside of the spoon. Tipping the bowl away from you at the end to help you catch the last few mouthfuls is perfectly fine. If bread is served with the soup (let’s hope not a slice of bread – a bit ‘try-hard gastropub’) never cut the roll. Break a bite-sized chunk off, butter if desired, and eat. It is not the done thing to divide the bread into two, slather with butter and gnaw away. Don’t be caught out as an air-butterer, either – apply the butter to the roll on the plate, not in the air. SPAGHETTI . Spaghetti can be a nightmare for diners and is best avoided in formal social situations...the one golden rule with pasta is never to cut it, an act of culinary terrorism in Italy, no less, according to William (right) This is eaten with a fork alone and never cut with a knife. The idea of using a spoon as well comes from the USA but is not practised in authentic Italian homes or upmarket British ones. Spaghetti can be messy, so avoid ordering this on a date or when dining with clients. The good news is, at a formal dinner (or even a semi-formal soiree) spaghetti will not be served. When in Italy, never cut your pasta – doing so is considered an act of culinary terrorism and insult to the cook. My thanks to one of London’s leading restaurants, L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon, for their delicious food which, with the above tips, is very easy to eat. Etiquette comes first...but if you get really stuck, then just bluff your way through, says William . Dietary requirements . It is the guests’ responsibility upon accepting an invitation to alert their hosts as to their dietary requirements. Experienced hosts may just wish to check with those who haven’t been invited to their 'casa' before that the guest doesn’t have any life-threatening allergies just to be on the safe side and to stop the impending drama that comes with a guest who suddenly says they are a vegan, rendering your osso bucco (braised veal) useless. If dining in a restaurant, staff should be well versed in what dishes are suitable for your individual needs. Funny food . Occasionally, we get served something that is so tasteless, bland or inedible that persevering is just not an option. In which case, your strategy is to eat as much of it as you can muster, push it to one side and devour everything else. Hosts should not then question you as to whether you liked it or not. If they do, reply, smiling, with ‘I enjoyed what I had, thank you’. What to do when this guide fails you . There may very well be an occasion where a food that is not on my guide is set down before you and you are flummoxed as to how best to tackle the tricky food. Your plan should be to watch what method your host, or the most learned guest, is using to eat the food and copy. Even if it is not technically correct, they will think it is and so you can bluff your way through the meal… and then get home and research the proper way to eat it so you aren’t caught out again!","Etiquette expert William Hanson explains the proper way to eat .

"The former seaside retreat of one of the UK's most controversial fashion stars has gone on sale. Five years after Alexander McQueen's death his secret two-bedroom East Sussex hideaway has been put on the market with a guide price of £695,000. From the outside the modest stone built granary appears a world away from the bright lights of the catwalk and the influential designer's flamboyant public image. But nestled down an unmade road, the centuries old property was a refuge for the star, whose private life was blighted by battles with depression, drink and drugs. McQueen hanged himself at his main home in London's Mayfair after taking a mix of cocaine, tranquillisers and sleeping pills, in February 2010. Five years after Alexander McQueen died his secret two-bedroom hideaway in Fairlight, East Sussex, has been put on the market . Through the key hole: The open plan interior was designed by the late fashion star who in private battled with depression, drink and drugs . The sale of the designer's sanctuary comes as a retrospective collection of McQueen's work has gone on display at London's Victoria and Albert Museum.The show features pieces taken from his ground-breaking 1992 MA collection shown alongside his last. The Old Granary, situated between Hastings and Rye, is being sold by Phillips & Stubbs estate agents for a guide price of £695,000. Throughout the interior of the contemporary open plan detached home the stylish influences of the celebrated designer can be seen. The stunning home, within walking distance of Fairlight beach, features an impressive open plan living room with limestone tiled flooring. Both the kitchen and dining room are fitted with bespoke units and the bathroom fixtures were imported from Italy. Upstairs the main bedroom has plenty of wardrobe space where the designer would have been able to store some of his collection. The East Sussex property was a sanctuary for the trouble star away from the bright lights of the glamourous fashion world . Both of the bedrooms have scenic sea views and on a clear night the glittering lights of France can be viewed. The garden also contains a one-bedroom detached guest annexe  where the designers host of celebrity friends, including the likes of Kate Moss, could stay. The property is being sold with planning permission for an extension. The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world McQueen came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters. After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career. McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter. Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow. From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans. The kitchen and dinning room, where the designer entertained his A-list friends, are fitted with bespoke units .

"The far right political party Britain First has told its supporters to vote Ukip and help deliver 'major gains' at the general election. In his party's newsletter, group leader Paul Golding said he would 'strongly urge our supporters to vote for UKIP as they have the best chance of making breakthroughs at the ballot box.' The endorsement from the extreme right group will come as an embarrassing blow to Nigel Farage who has been attempting to distance himself from the far right. Britain First leader Paul Golding has urged his supporters to back Ukip in the election and predicts that 2015 will be 'the year of Britain First and Ukip' Mr Golding said that he believed the election could trigger a swing to the right in British politics. 'Whatever happens in May, between UKIP and Britain First, this year could herald a resurgence of patriotic politics in Britain,' he added. But a Ukip spokesman told the Independent it was farcical that Britain First was supporting them. 'We're just not where they think we are,' he said. 'On the fringes of our politics are nutters and we don't want them anywhere near us.' Britain First has become renowned for its invasions on mosques and campaign against the alleged 'Islamification' of Britain. But Nigel Farage has previously attempted to distance himself from Britain First and other far rights parties across Europe . The party has told its supporters to ignore Ukip's attempts to distance themselves and said the party must play the 'political game.' In literature seen by the Independent, the party said its controversial activities 'in the Muslim ghettoes' will combine with 'major Ukip gains' to turn the election into a 'game changer'. Leaflets signed by Mr Golding predicted that 2015 would be 'the year of Britain First and Ukip' after the election. The election tactics echo those used for the Rochester by-election last year, when the party distributed leaflets which proclaimed: 'Ukip at the ballot box, Britain First on the streets – a winning combination.' The election went onto be won by former Conservative MP Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip. Britain First was founded by former British National Party member Jim Dowson in 2011. It hit the headlines after invading mosques in Glasgow, Bradford, Luton and London with Bibles offered to Muslim worshippers. They were also seen driving military armoured cars up and down Brick Lane to no apparent purpose. Britain First's tactics , pictured here disrupting a Unite Against Fascism (UAF) anti-racism protest, have come under criticism in the past . Last year the group conducted 'Christian patrols' in parts of East London which the group claimed  were a direct response to similar Muslim groups who, they said, wanted Sharia Law enforced in some boroughs. Britain First activists were seen outside mosques holding banners announcing: 'We are the British resistance.' The party, which received 20,000 votes in last year's European elections, wants 'assisted repatriation', a halt to further immigration, and the deportation of all asylum seekers. It also wants all foreign criminals to be deported without recourse to the law courts.","Britain First has told its supporters to get behind Ukip in the coming election .

Alice Bamford might not compare to the Kardashian-West family in terms of global fame but the JCB heiress has certainly led a fascinating life.

A fatigued Kim was in full mummy mode as North wriggled around in her high chair at the table. Meanwhile Kanye, looked transfixed by the mum-of-one appearing to grimace as he watched his wife reach under the table with a stern look on her face. After all, 37-year-old rapper Kanye had spent the afternoon pandering to their toddler as they played on the sands in Malibu. Kanye was beach-ready in a sleeveless vest - albeit in black - with practical trainers while Nori looked cute in a pair of denim shorts and a white vest. Most of Kim's most intimate moments from the last seven years - from her pregnancy to her 2013 divorce -  have been documented on her E! reality show with sisters Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie, as well as mother and manager Kris and step father Bruce Jenner. Kim is usually partial to a few photograph filters to brighten or smooth her skin and has even been accused of using Photoshop to alter the appearance of her famous figure in the pictures she's posted. But this particular moment was perhaps the most candid of them all when she and her husband of one year were captured in their most raw form. Polished as always, Kim was arguably unsuitably dressed for a day on the sand on Sunday. She had dressed up in her strappy sandals and a military green midi dress, which clung to her famous curves, deciding to watch her daddy and daughter duo from the restaurant, outside her car. Her hair was looking slightly frazzled after treating it to a third dye job this week to keep the platinum shade from revealing her brunette roots. She had her hair, which she has referred to as a 'full-time job' recently, pulled back into a low-fuss ponytail at the nape of her neck. And as if styled for a red carpet appearance, Kim was carrying a snakeskin clutch bag in her hands, which was far from a traditional baby bag used to tote everything a 21-month-old might need for a day at the beach. Kim may be a style icon to some, but her younger half sister Kylie Jenner has admitted that Nori is actually her main source of fashion inspiration. Speaking to Star! magazine recently, the youngest of the Jenner family said of her icons: 'To keep it in the family, I love Kim and Kanye’s style. 'They definitely inspire me.

"Two years after Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy to prevent the onset of breast cancer, the actress has revealed that she has since had her ovaries removed due to a second health scare. The 39-year-old Maleficent star published a lengthy opinion piece, titled Angelina Jolie Pitt: Diary Of A Surgery in the New York Times on Monday explaining her  decision. Her revelation comes as Brad Pitt was seen comforting his wife at Shiloh and Zahara's soccer match. It's now clear the couple's affection came during Angelina's agonizing wait to establish whether she had cancer - a fear which ultimately prompted her to have surgery. With her ovaries and Fallopian tubes now gone, the mother-of-six has entered early menopause and will not be able to have any more children, she writes in her candid, deeply personal essay. Scroll down for video . Tough choice: Angelina and Brad were pictured at Shiloh and Zahara's soccer match on March 15 - Angelina was weighing her surgery decision at this time . Signs of support: The famous couple shared a rare public kiss at the game - it's now clear it was a time of turmoil while Angelina feared she had cancer and was contemplating surgery . Loving: Angelina reveals in her op-ed that Brad flew from France immediately after hearing his wife was at risk of cancer . In May 2013, Brad Pitt's wife famously had her breasts surgically removed after she found out she was carrying a genetic mutation that greatly increased her risk of potentially fatal breast cancer. In the op-ed piece, Jolie explains that the mutation in the BRCA1 gene gave her an estimated 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer. The director of Unbroken and the upcoming By The Sea, starring her newlywed husband, lost her mother, grandmother and aunt to cancer. According to Jolie, she had been planning to undergo surgery to remove her ovaries and Fallopian tubes for a while now, but a call from her doctor two weeks ago made the procedure more urgent. A blood test detected potential anomalies linked to the protein CA-125, which is used to monitor ovarian cancer, Jolie's doctor told her, urging the actress to see her surgeon, who also had treated her late mother. 'I went through what I imagine thousands of other women have felt,' she writes. 'I told myself to stay calm, to be strong, and that I had no reason to think I wouldn't live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren.' Survivor: In May 2013, the star of Maleficent had a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer. Jolie is pictured left at a World War Z premiere in June of that year, just weeks after the surgery and right in Iraq in her work for the UN in January . Runs in the family: Jolie pictured with her mother Marcheline Bertrand, who died in January 2007 at the age of 56 after an eight-year battle with ovarian cancer . Brad Pitt was in France when he got the call from his wife of seven months about her new health scare, prompting him to hop on a plane and return at once to Los Angeles to be by her side. After undergoing a battery of tests and scans, Jolie got the good news that she was still cancer-free. 'To my relief, I still had the option of removing my ovaries and Fallopian tubes and I chose to do it,' she writes. Cover girl: Jolie graced the cover of the May 2013 issue of Time magazine, which featured an article about her decision to undergo a double mastectomy . Last week, Hollywood's leading lady went under the knife, undergoing what is known as a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Jolie revealed that one of her ovaries did have a small tumor on it but it turned out to be benign, and there were no signs of cancer in the tissues. She noted that she chose to keep her uterus because there is no history of uterine cancer in her family. Her mother Marcheline Bertrand died in January 2007 at the age of 56 after an eight-year battle with ovarian cancer. Jolie has previously spoken of the void in her life that her mother's death had left - a pain that led her to taking the brave decision to have a double mastectomy, so her children may not have to experience the pain she did. The actress's aunt, Debbie Martin, then died of breast cancer at the age of 61 less than two weeks after Jolie revealed she had undergone her mastectomy. To counteract the loss of her ovaries, Jolie turned to hormone replacement therapy and had a device inserted in her womb, but she says in the essay that her child-bearing years are now behind her. 'Regardless of the hormone replacements I'm taking, I am now in menopause,' she writes. 'I will not be able to have any more children, and I expect some physical changes. But I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared.' When Jolie underwent a double mastectomy two years ago, doctors have noticed an uptick in patients electing to undergo the preventive surgery - even if they did not need it. A sigh of relief: Jolie said it gives her peace of mind that her children, including (L-R) Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, Knox Jolie-Pitt, Pax Jolie-Pitt and Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, will never have to say, 'Mom died of ovarian cancer' In her op-ed piece Monday, the UN envoy made it clear that her decision to have her ovaries removed was not solely based on the BRCA1 gene mutation, adding that there are other, non-surgical options out there for women, such as birth control pills, alternative treatments and frequent checks-up. But taking into account her family's history, Jolie said undergoing the operation was the best option for her. 'There is more than one way to deal with any health issue,' she states in the Times piece. 'The most important thing is to learn about the options and choose what is right for you personally.' Mrs Jolie Pitt points out that surgery has not eliminated her natural predisposition for cancer, but it has taken at least one type of the deadly disease out of the equation. 'I know my children will never have to say, 'Mom died of ovarian cancer',"" she writes. Angelina Jolie has had her ovaries and Fallopian tubes removed to prevent the onset of cancer . Angelina Jolie has a mutation in the BRCA1 gene that gave her an estimated 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer. Her mother died from the latter at the age of just 56. Being a carrier of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene gives a woman a 45-90 per cent lifetime risk of cancer. These genes also increase breast cancer risk in men. As many as 65 per cent of women who carry the BRCA1 or 2 genes will get ovarian cancer by the age of 75. As a result of this gene mutation, Ms Jolie had her breasts surgically removed in May 2013 and has now had her ovaries removed. The procedure, called an oophorectomy, can also reduce the risk of breast cancer in these patients by up to 50 per cent. While the surgery has not eliminated her natural predisposition for cancer, it has taken ovarian cancer out of the equation. However the operation triggers menopause immediately. A woman's periods will stop after this surgery and her hormones drop quickly. She may immediately have strong menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes and reduced sexual desire. To counteract the loss of her ovaries and the symptoms of the menopause, Ms Jolie is now taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, told MailOnline that Jolie, 39, would be on two forms of hormone replacement therapy 'at least until her mid-50s'. She said: 'She will have had an IUS inserted into her womb. This is a small, T-shaped plastic device that releases the progesterone hormone. 'She will also be given the hormone oestrogen in either patch, gel or tablet form,' she added. 'Because this treatment is replacing the hormones produced by the ovaries, it staves off problems associated with the menopause.' After the menopause, the lack of the hormone oestrogen puts women at increased risk of fragile bones and heart disease. The skin also loses its elasticity and women may experience depression and/or reduced sexual desire. In the New York Times piece, she explains she had been planning to undergo the surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes for some time, but a call from her doctor two weeks ago made the procedure more urgent. A blood test detected potential anomalies linked to the protein CA-125, high levels of which can indicate ovarian cancer. She revealed that one of her ovaries did have a small tumour on it but it turned out to be benign, and there were no signs of cancer in the tissues. However Miss Hanna cautioned that while Jolie had opted for the radical surgery, it is not the solution for everyone carrying a BRCA gene. She added: 'There is a fine balance when it comes to removing the ovaries of young people. 'There are many reasons other than ovarian cancer why levels of the CA-125 protein level may be raised - such as the condition endometriosis or a benign ovarian swelling. 'Simply having a raised CA-125 is not reason enough for young women to have their ovaries removed. 'This surgery triggers immediate menopause and can result in women developing hot flashes literally overnight. 'You may reduce the risk of cancer but spark another set of health problems such as an increased risk of heart disease and fragile bones,' she explained.","Jolie, 39, wrote opinion piece in New York Times about her health crisis .

"Businesses attacked Labour last night over plans to force companies to share profits with employees. Senior party figures are said to be considering a proposal to oblige all firms with more than 50 staff to set up a profit-sharing scheme. Workers would then be handed a regular cash sum based on their employers' financial position. Senior business leaders have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country . Labour last night said the idea was not official policy, although a shadow minister said it was being considered at the top of the party. But senior business leaders warned the plan would encourage employers not to take on staff. It is the latest in a string of damaging clashes between Labour and business leaders – who have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country. Glen Cooper, chief executive of Midlands bollard makers ATG Access, said: 'We need Britain's small companies to grow bigger, not be stifled by Labour's meddling. 'This idea will make companies stop taking on employees rather than grow. I am happy to run my own scheme to motivate my employees, but I don't want to be dictated to by Labour.' The Labour policy would mirror the situation in economically feeble France, where companies with more than 50 employees have extra obligations, such as the establishment of a workers' council. It has been reported that such burdens are costing 140,000 jobs, and President Francois Hollande wants to repeal them. Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs' Simon Walker, of the Institute Of Directors, said: 'We cannot believe that the Labour leader will take such an obviously counterproductive measure seriously. 'Employee profit sharing can work well for companies who choose it, but it has to be up to them. This idea would give companies with 49 employees a very strong incentive not to grow. 'The French government is actually attempting to reduce the bureaucracy that kicks in at 50 workers because they know it is damaging job creation.' Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels . Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs. 'Small companies should be run by the people who know their culture and staff best, not by central government.' There are around 36,000 companies with 50 or more employees in Britain, employing a total of 12.9million. It means the suggested legislation would therefore affect about 53 per cent of those employed in the UK. It is being championed by Gareth Thomas, a shadow minister and has been adopted by the affiliated Co-operative Party, represented in Parliament by 31 Labour MPs – including Ed Balls. Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels. He added: 'Hard work too often doesn't lead to higher wages for the working majority, but simply gets funnelled into greater rewards for those at the very top.' A Labour source insisted last night the idea was not party policy. Tory MP Julian Smith said: 'This is another policy that will kill off jobs. Every Labour government in history has left unemployment higher.' Mr Miliband has proposed a series of ideas which have infuriated business groups – including an energy price freeze and plans for more paternity leave. Bosses have also been riled by Labour's anti-business rhetoric.","Labour may make firms with 50 or more staff set up profit sharing scheme .

"For a child, the world is a heady mix of colours, shapes and words that are constantly being learned and remembered. To make sense of many of these experiences, babies and toddlers 'map' names to objects by assessing their surroundings and associating words with the item's location. And now a new study has found that this association is not only affected by the child's proximity to the object, it can also be influenced by their specific posture. Scroll down for video . Cognitive scientists from Indiana University taught a robot (pictured) to associate the name of an object with its location, while sat with a certain posture. When the target and another object were placed in the location, and the robot was positioned in a different way, it failed to recognise the object . Cognitive scientists from Indiana University began by assessing the learning capabilities of a child-like robot called iCub. They showed the robot an object situated to its left, and a different object on its right. This was repeated so iCub learnt to associate between the objects and its two related postures. The robot consistently made a link between the object and its name - and proved this by reaching for the object - during 20 repeats of the experiment. But in subsequent tests where the target and another object were placed in both locations and the robot was positioned in a different way, it failed to recognise the  object. This experiment was replicated using children aged 12 to 18 months and the researchers noticed only 'slight differences' in the results. As with the robot, the infants failed to recognise objects if their position and posture changed, or the object was moved. In steps 1 to 4, objects are placed left or right and are given names. In step 5 of the Baldwin Task, the objects are hidden while in the Interference Task, their location is switched. The items are put back in their correct location in 6 and 7 before being moved again in step 8. The participant is then asked to identify an object . This experiment was replicated using children aged 12 to 18 months (stock image) and the researchers noticed only 'slight differences in the results.' Like with the robot, the infants failed to recognise objects if their position and posture changed, or the object was moved . The study was carried out by Linda Smith, a professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. She worked with Anthony Morse, a senior post-doctoral research fellow in the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems at the University of Plymouth and Viridiana Benitez, a post-doctoral research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 'This study shows that the body plays a role in early object name learning, and how toddlers use the body's position in space to connect ideas,' Professor Smith said. 'The creation of a robot model for infant learning has far-reaching implications for how the brains of young people work. 'A number of studies suggest that memory is tightly tied to the location of an object. 'None, however, have shown that bodily position plays a role or that, if you shift your body, you could forget.' 'This study shows  the body plays a role in early object name learning,' lead author Professor Linda Smith said. 'The creation of a robot model for infant learning (iCub pictured)) has far-reaching implications for how the brains of young people work' The humanoid called iCub has been under development for 10 years. It is motivated by goals and can express six emotions on its face, including raising its eyebrows and generating a light-up smile. It was originally created by the Italian Institute of Technology as part of the eFAA Project and has since been refined to crawl, walk and dance to music, manipulate objects in its hands, speak and express emotions. The robot's goals and emotions change constantly, based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately . A video recently posted by New Scientist shows it playing a game of paddle war – a simple game where two players each hold a paddle - or in this case a cylinder - and try to score goals using a digital ball, while stopping their rival from scoring. The robot's goals and emotions change constantly, based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately to whether it is winning or losing. When iCub concedes a goal, it frowns and furrows its light-up eyebrows, sometimes swearing like an ill-tempered human. When it scores a goal, it smiles and says phrases like 'got it,' although there is not much change in intonation whether a phrase is negative or positive. The video also shows how the robot can respond to being touched, a little bit like a slightly creepy human. When a human strokes its arms it affects iCub's reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video: 'I like when you touch me this way'. Tweaks to its software also mean that the robot is starting to understand language and can follow instructions that require reasoning, such as identifying two objects and moving them to a position, as instructed. She added that the experiments could provide a new way to investigate how cognition is connected to the body, as well as new evidence that thoughts, words and representations of objects are affected by the 'spatial relationship of the body within the surrounding world.' The research, 'Posture Affects How Robots and Infants Map Words to Objects,' is published in the journal Plos One. Professor Smith said additional research is needed to determine whether this study's results apply to just infants, or more broadly to the relationship between the brain, the body and memory. The study may also help learn more about developmental disorders, difficulties with motor coordination and cognitive development. A video shows iCub playing a game of paddle war (pictured) – a  game where two players each hold a paddle and try to score goals using a digital ball, while stopping their rival from scoring .","Babies learn the name of new objects by 'mapping' their surroundings .
This means they associate a word using the object's proximity to them .

"With mile upon mile of untouched golden beaches, corals reefs ripe for divers, ancient artifacts and a population desperate to impress. Somaliland is a country with plenty to offer tourists and it is actively encouraging visitors. But unfortunately, the much-desired tourists are not flocking to the east African outpost, neighbouring Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. For starters, the country doesn't exist at all according to the international community, which recognises it only as part of Somalia, the troubled nation where piracy is rife and terrorist organisation Al-Shabaab is based. Locals walk along some of the 528 miles of beachfront in Somaliland that the country is keen to promote . Although not officially recognised as a country, Somaliland neighbours Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia . This association with Somalia is the reason western governments such as the UK and Canada call the self-proclaimed independent entity and former British protectorate a no-go zone, claim locals, but this isn't stopping Somaliland pushing to bring in the tourist dollar. Official websites proudly proclaim they boast 850km (528 miles) of quiet beaches just waiting to be lazed upon by westerners, while historic landmarks await their long-overdue admiration. But the tourists are not flooding in, despite there being numerous means of accessing the nation through neighbouring Ethiopia and Djibouti. As far as Somaliland is concerned, the country has been independent since 1991 and the only thing holding it back is the fact that isn't being recognised globally. Abdinasir Ibrahim is the director of Somaliland Travel & Tours Agency,  is keen to add to the handful of eager travellers who defy warnings to visit. He laments the slow increase in tourists over recent years - figures differ greatly from a few hundred to more than 1000 last year - due to the 'lack of recognition,' referring to the wait for the world to acknowledge Somaliland's existence. 'I believe that as soon we get international recognition the tourists will flock to our stunning beaches.' he tells MailOnline. The unofficial nation gained independence from Britain in 1960 before joining the former Italian Somaliland but the countries encountered strife under the rule of dictator Mohammad Siad Barre, whose regime killed tens of thousands of Somalilanders due to tribal connection during a brutal civil war from 1988. When the Barre regime fell in 1991, Somaliland declared their still unrecognised independence. An unspoiled stretch of sand in Somaliland which tourism bodies are keen for westerners to explore . Tourists are welcome in the unrecognised country, but are asked to respect local customs and dress modestly . Boats stationed off the coast of Berbera, the harbour city Somaliland has long relied on for its economy . While not great in numbers, tourists do come. Mostly from the UK, USA, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Germany, says Abdinasir, who insists Somaliland has something to offer all sorts of travellers, not just those keen to get a genuinely unique stamp on their passport. 'We have something to offer for all kind of tourists,' he says. 'Somaliland have an 850 km coastline with lots of pristine beaches, beautiful coral reefs, unique archaeological sites, rare birds and mammals, fabulous mountain ranges, and a year-round sunny, warm climate, so we are offering a wide variety of tour opportunities that will allow everyone to experience Somaliland in ways that are unique.' While Foreign and Commonwealth Office warnings place the former British protectorate with Somalia in the red zone advising against all travel, most experts say the democratically government Islamic country is among the safest and most peaceful in its region. Abdinasir says emphatically that any perception that Somaliland is dangerous is 'wrong'. 'That’s actually the saddest part, Somaliland has a 0 per cent foreigners/tourists crime rate for the last 10 years,' he claims. A woman sits among her scales awaiting her next sale of vegetables in the market in Hargeisa, a city in the northwestern Woqooyi Galbeed province . The busy market in Somaliland's capital has a diverse assortment of goods from around Africa and the world . 'It seems that when you are doing things peacefully and helping yourself, then no one cares about you,' the acting Somaliland ambassador to Ethiopia, Ayanle Salad Deria, told Al Jazeera. 'Somaliland has been functioning for 24 years, and we've got lots of places to visit, including 850 kilometers (528 miles) of beaches.' The range of figures for incoming tourists in 2014 is warped by some numbers including just foreign tourists while other records include those who had previously fled violence slowly returning. Somaliland's advocates are pushing its beaches, culture and history human artifacts such as the Laas Geel cave paintings, which are estimated to date back to between 900BC and 3000BC. Companies including Somaliland Travel & Tours Agency (STTA) and Safari Travel, Tours and Culture are also increasingly eager to squire visitors around its attractions as the country looks to reduce its economy's long-standing reliance on livestock exports through the port in Berbera. 'From exploring deserts to taking unique walks through interesting attractions, such as the Laas Gaal Caves, where you will see cave paintings that are thousands of years old also relaxing on some of the finest beaches on the Horn of Africa,' says STTA's website. STTC offers city tours of the capital Hargeisa with its markets and famous money lenders, along with Zeila and Las Anod among others. Special  tours can also be taken to Laas Geel, along with the Ga'an Libah Mountain and the Somaliland desert. A western tourist takes pictures of the Laas Geel caves with artwork dating back as far as 3,000BC . The caves and other historic artifacts are considered some of the most attractive lures for tourists . A guide points out a depiction of a cow and explains its meaning on the walls of the Laas Geel rock caves . A woman displays freshly designed henna tattoos on her hands on the beach in Berbera . Berbera, the port city the national economy hinges upon, is a major draw with its quiet - meaning largely deserted - beaches and chances to snorkel and scuba dive. A lack of infrastructure, however, makes the long stretches of sand  not as equipped for tourists as competitors may be, a lure for some but it also means a sometimes unpleasant odour from waste can also be endured. Somaliland is also a strict Islamic community, which may be a turn-off for some westerners enticed by the talk of exotic, deserted stretches of sand given the rules that come with that. Tourists can fly to the capital Hargeisa through the following routes: Daily from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia with Ethiopian Airlines, twice weekly from Dubai via neighbouring Djibouti with Daallo and Juba, and on African Express Airways, who offer three weekly flights from Dubai to Berbera and from Nairobi in Kenya via Mogadishu. By road enter through Ethiopia and Djibouti, although it's cheaper to fly than drive. A tax of US$60 is charged on entry. Visas can be obtained through various means in Ethiopia and elsewhere. In the UK it's possible to get a visa on the spot in the Somaliland Liaison Office in East London. Bikinis are banned and a sundowner with alcohol in it isn't an option as it is illegal in Somaliland. 'When swimming, dressing must respect the religion and tradition and the women should dress more conservatively and wear something long,' Abdinasir says. Visitors are also warned to be careful when taking photographs, especially around military installments. On the flipside, dining out is quite cheap with a meal at one of the best restaurants costing US$10 and middling meals cost US$5. Abdinasir adds international calls on mobile phones cost US$0.20 per minute or less, 'five or six times lower than in most African countries' While the tourism companies claim the place is safe, armed guards are sometimes mandatory for tourists or offered. Many suggest this is motivated more by the fear of what a negative incident could have on the burgeoning industry than the threat of terrorism the FCO and other western governments warn of in strongly worded advisories. 'The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to Somalia, including Somaliland except for the cities of Hargeisa and Berbera to which the FCO advise against all but essential travel,' says the advisory for Brits. 'Any British nationals in areas of Somalia to which the FCO advise against all travel should leave. Any British nationals in Hargeisa or Berbera who are not on essential travel should leave.' Abdinasir and the people of Somaliland, however, are opening their arms.","Somaliland has been self-declared independent since 1991 but it is still not recognised internationally .

"They are two of the most glamorous of Europe's royals and today was no exception for the Netherlands' Queen Maxima and Denmark's Crown Princess Mary. The two royals were visiting the carbon-neutral Samsø island, a small speck of land just off Denmark's Jutland Peninsula, and just about managed to hold on to their hats during a blustery ferry ride there. Thanks to the churning Baltic waves, the two also suffered a wobbly moment as the ferry, called Kalhave, lurched beneath them. Scroll down for video . Hats off to Mary and Maxima! The Dutch and Danish royals were glamorous in matching trilbies . 70s redux: Maxima had nailed this season's 70s trend with her tailored camel coat . Maxima, 43, was resplendent in a fitted camel wool coat-dress while Australian-born Mary, also 43, opted for a chic grey cape coat. Joined by Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and King Willem-Alexander, 47, the two royals, who are long-standing friends, traded quips as they made the crossing. Glamorous though the royals looked, they looked even more so during an evening reception celebrating Dutch culture at the Royal Library in Copenhagen. Maxima, resplendent in a russet one-shoulder floor-length gown studded with rhinestones, showed no sign of fatigue, instead displaying a gorgeous golden tan. The royal kept things informal, however, by wearing her long blonde hair loose and curled while Willem-Alexander was dapper in his dinner jacket.

Not to be outdone, Crown Princess Mary was striking in a chic strapless black dress with a flattering empire-line cut. In contrast to her Dutch counterpart, the Australian-born royal had pulled her hair into a sleek low chignon and wore eye-catching diamond-shaped gold earrings. Equally glamorous was Denmark's Queen Margrethe who donned a rose-pink gown with a white lace bodice and fur shrug. The men too looked good, with Margrethe's husband Prince Henrik natty in a dark blue dinner jacket while their son Frederik scrubbed up well in a matching number.

The cultural celebration topped a busy day in which the two sets of European royalty experienced the best of Danish weather on a sunny but  blustery ferry crossing. The Dutch royals are currently in the middle of a three-day trip that began on Tuesday with a royal welcome at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport. After spending a low-key afternoon meeting students at the University of Aalborg, things took a turn for the glamorous during their first evening, courtesy of a banquet at Christiansborg Palace. With Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and the Scandinavian country's 74-year-old monarch Queen Margrethe also in the room, the dinner saw plenty of toasts - and even better fashion. All smiles: The two royal couples appeared to be in good spirits as they arrived on Samsø island . Hanging on: At one point, the Baltic breeze threatened to send both royals' hats flying . As is her wont, Maxima pulled out all the stops in royal blue, while Queen Margrethe rose to the occasion in a spectacular pale blue dress. Not to be outdone, Crown Princess Mary looked wonderful in white, while her sister-in-law, French-born Princess Marie, shimmered in lilac. On Wednesday morning, it was back to business with the two couples travelling to Samsø Island to visit a special type of Danish boarding school called an efterskole. Most Danish teenagers spend at least a year at the state boarding schools, where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music.

Chilly: Despite the sunshine, there was a stiff breeze blowing in off the Baltic . Enjoying their visit: Maxima and Willem-Alexander appeared to be enjoying their visit to Denmark . The efterskole on Samsø focuses on aquatic sports, diving, aviation and golf, with pupils giving the royal party, among them sport-mad Frederik, a tour of the school. Frederik and Mary have suffered a bumpy few months, thanks to a film about the Crown Prince's playboy past that is set to be screened later this year. A second programme, this time being made for Australia's Channel Ten, could also cause some discomfort, thanks to claims that Mary had had second thoughts in the run-up to her 2004 wedding. By contrast, Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander have enjoyed a smooth ride of late, with Maxima in particular becoming increasingly popular. One of the most glamorous royals in Europe, the Argentina-born mother-of-three has proved a hit with her Dutch subjects, thanks in no small part to her charity work. She will have plenty of opportunity to do more of that during this week's state visit, with a trip to Bispebjerg Hospital also on their itinerary today.

"Germany is bracing itself for a period of chaos and instability amid claims Greece will exit from the euro, finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (above) said . Germany is bracing itself for a period of chaos and instability amid claims Greece will exit from the euro. Finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble said he is resigned to the possibility of a Greek exit from the calamitous euro experiment. In a TV interview on Thursday evening he was asked if he could envisage it and he replied: 'Yes, because the responsibility, the ability to decide what happens, resides with the Greeks, and because we do not know what the leaders intend to do in Greece, we cannot exclude it.' Chancellor Angela Merkel has also run out of patience with the new anti-austerity government in Athens, reports suggested. Their comments represent a tectonic shift from the previous undiluted support Germany offered Greece - a country whose financial mismanagement is loathed by EU lawmakers. And in recent days tensions between Berlin and Athens have spiked even further. The new Tsipras government first threatened to seize German businesses and assets if Germany did not provide billions of pounds of compensation for damages caused during the Nazi occupation during World War II. Greece also made a threat to send refugees - terrorist suspects among them - from its shores to Germany if Berlin did not support it in ongoing debt crisis talks. 'If they deal a blow to Greece, then they should know the migrants will get papers to go to Berlin,' Panos Kammenos told a meeting of his right-wing party Independent Greeks. He also said that if some of the refugees were members of the terrorist group Isis, it would be Europe's fault because of its position on Greece's economic problems. On Thursday the Greek ambassador in Berlin made an official complaint to the foreign ministry about the behaviour of Schäuble towards his Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis. The Ambassador claimed that Schäuble had called Varoufakis naïve, a charge he denies. Schäuble said Greece can only get more funds if it sticks to the agreements with its creditors. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (left) threatened to seize German businesses and assets if Germany did not provide billions of pounds of compensation. Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) is said to have run out of patience with the new anti-austerity government in Athens . He said: 'Europe stands ready to help Greece, but Greece must be prepared to help itself. The problem will not be solved by turning others into scapegoats.' His comments were made as a new poll showed 52 per cent of Germans would be happy for Greece to quit the common currency while 80 per cent believe that Greece is not acting seriously in trying to adhere to its obligations on debt repayments and financial reforms. A Greek exit would plunge Germany's financial institutions into crisis and the impact on other countries - including the UK - could be severe. There would almost certainly be a 'flight to safety' as depositors pull euros out of other potentially vulnerable eurozone members such as Portugal, Spain and Italy to avoid taking a hit. European company share prices would also fall sharply. Experts say Britain would be hit extremely hard. Almost half of British trade is with Europe and a continental slump would translate into lost orders and jobs while the financial chaos would also hit the City.","German finance minister said he is resigned to possibility of Greek exit .

"The Prince of Wales and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, ended their second day in the U.S. with a glitzy night out with friends in Washington D.C. The couple, who will celebrate their 10th anniversary next month, put on their best dress for a dinner hosted by Barby Allbritton, the head of the prince's charity in the U.S. and the widow of Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico. The Allbrittons were so close to the British royals that they were two of a few Americans invited to the Royal Wedding between Charles' son Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. Charles and Camilla joined Mrs Allbritton, her son Robert - who now runs Politico - and his wife Elena for the black tie charity affair on Wednesday night. The event was so secretive that other guests were only given the address earlier in the day, PageSix reported.

She is the wife of the late media magnate Joe Allbritton, who owned news stations and the website Politico . The night out came in the middle of the royal couple's four-day trip to the U.S., which is largely being spent in Washington D.C. before a trip to Louisville, Kentucky on Friday. Charles and Camilla still look bright-eyed as they arrived at the party despite a whirlwind day  visiting D.C.'s landmarks and George Washington's plantation before delving into environmental policy. At a meeting of the Global Ocean Commission and the International Sustainability Unit - a charitable group established by the prince to address environmental concerns - Charles spoke about the dangers of accumulating plastic waste in the world's oceans. 'Although the evidence surrounding the links between plastic waste and human health are not yet clear, I would tentatively suggest that they are unlikely to be beneficial,'he said during his 10-minute speech at the Hay Adams hotel. Charles said that he was ‘haunted’ and ‘horrified’ by the issue which needed to be solved for the sake of future generations. Passionate: Following a day of sight-seeing on Wednesday, Prince Charles also attended an environmental event at the Hay Adams hotel, where he gave a 10-minute speech on the importance of recycling . Meeting the King: Charles and Camilla arrive at the Martin Luther King Memorial in Washington DC, where they were met by Congresswoman Terri Sewel, left, and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, right . Making friends: The royal couple drew a crowd as they arrived at the Memorial on Tuesday . Fans: Members of the public, including a middle school history class, snap photos of the royal couple . ‘Speaking as a grandfather with a new grandchild due to appear in this world in a month’s time, I think we probably owe it to everyone else’s grandchildren to grasp that solution,’ he said. His impassioned speech came after he and his wife took time out to play tourists. On Wednesday morning, the couple wrapped up against the brisk temperatures for their 20-minute tour of the Martin Luther King memorial and paused to read his quotations engraved in the stone. 'Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that,' read one quotation where the royal couple paused to see King's words from 1963. Harry Johnson, the president of the foundation that built the King memorial, said he gave the royal couple a stone from the memorial's granite as a gift. The couple then visited the Lincoln Memorial, where they were greeted by historians. Towering: The royals posed in front of the memorials with members of congress and civil rights leaders . Paying their respects: Charles and Camilla speak with Ed Jackson during their tour of the memorial .

Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis. 'To come here and have such a joyful event was just really incredible luck on our part,' she said.

It was also on a tour of the National Archives that Charles learned his uncle once developed a new polo stick.  National Archivist David Ferriero presented the prince with a patent application submitted in 1931 by his uncle, Lord Louis Mountbatten, for a new kind of polo stick. Charles, himself a polo player, laughed and said he had no idea that his uncle had designed a polo stick. He also laughed when shown a telegram from the U.S. embassy in London to the Secretary of State, sent in 1957 seeking instructions to ensure that a toy car that had been given to Charles, then 8 years old, would be working properly when he returned home to play with it.

"Vladimir Putin is 'alive' but 'neutralised' as shadowy security chiefs stage a stealthy coup in Moscow, it was claimed last night. Former FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev was behind the plot, claimed chairman of the pro-Kremlin national Islamic Committee, Geydar Dzhemal. There have been no confirmed sightings of Putin for nine days, while in the febrile atmosphere engulfing Moscow a convoy of large trucks parked outside the Kremlin fueled rumours of a flit by the president. Scroll down for video . Russian president Vladimir Putin has not been seen in public for the past nine days fueling coup rumours . Putin, left, supposedly met the chairman of the supreme court Vyacheslav Lebedev, right, on Friday, however, it is now thought the video footage released by Putin loyalists may have been several years old . In fact, the lorries close to St Basil's Cathedral were more likely connected to a nationalist celebration of the first anniversary of the return of Crimea to Russia - seen by Putin's supporters as his ultimate masterstroke. Despite this, bloggers likened it to Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovych's treasure-grab as he fled into exile just over a year ago in Kiev. 'I think that Putin is neutralised at the moment, but of course, he is alive,' said Dzhemal, seen as a Kremlin loyalist. 'He is under the control of the power-wielding agencies, who have, in my opinion, organised a coup d'etat.' Recent pictures of Putin supposedly working during a nine day absence from public sight was 'playing for time' by the plotters, he claimed. 'My information is that Patrushev met Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in Pyatigorsk on 11 March and tempted him over to his side.' He also pointed to a recent visit by Patrushev - head of Putin's security council - the US. The visit came despite sanctions barring visits by most senior Russian officials. 'I think he was offered something there that he failed to reject,' said Dzhemal on Georgian TV channel Rustavi-2. Several large trucks were parked near Kremlin Square fueling rumours connected with Putin's absence . Putin has not been seen in public for nine days which has caused certain consternation in Russia . Putin failed to reappear again on Saturday - the ninth day without a confirmed sighting - as his Chechen enforcer suggested the Russian strongman is in danger of being overthrown. Ramzan Kadyrov - a devout Muslim whose security apparatchiks are seen as being behind the brutal murder of Boris Nemtsov - said he would remain devoted to the Kremlin leader 'whether he is in his position or not'. This came amid a claim that pictures issued by the Kremlin on Friday of Putin meeting Supreme Court head Vyachevslav Lebedev may date from 2011. The images were rushed out in a bid to show Putin is still at work, and followed the release of other photographs which had been taken on or before 5 March when he was last seen in public. With feverish speculation in Moscow over Putin's health and whereabouts, and claims of a bitter power struggle in his entourage which could even trigger an attempted coup, the head of Chechnya spoke emotionally of people 'trying to harm the president of Russia - and Russia itself'. And he claimed that forces were scheming 'to break us apart', referring to him and his guarantor Putin. As startling has been the lack of shows of support in recent days from other senior Kremlin cardinals during an absence which has no obvious parallel in his 15 years as president or premier. The voices of prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, Chief of the Kremlin staff Sergei Ivanov - and Putin's intelligence tsars - have remained silent. Kadyrov has enjoyed extraordinary power and largesse under Putin as a reward for keeping an iron grip on the rebellious oil-rich Chechen region, scene of two bloody wars since the collapse of the USSR. As a result he is hated by many senior Putin loyalists. But Kadyrov's enemies claimed yesterday that the 38 year old bearded regional potentate is in 'panic' because he can no longer contact his mentor. 'He is phoning anyone he can in an attempt to arrange a talk with Putin - but he fails,' alleged a website linked to Islamic hardliners seeking to overthrow Kadyrov. One of the two men formally charged with killing opposition leader Boris Nemtsov is a personal friend of Kadyrov, who spoke out in his support for the second time yesterday. 'I'll repeat now that I knew him as a true warrior and patriot,' he said of Zaur Dadayev, who is accused of murder. There are allegations that a security official closer to Kadyrov ordered the Nemtsov murder, and that the FSB and Interior Ministry in Moscow have full proof. His slaying has triggered bitter factional infighting in the Kremlin, which includes talk of defence and security service generals seeking to replace Putin. Others believe Putin will reemerge tomorrow to stamp his authority once more on his government. There were also unverified claims last week that Putin's alleged girlfriend, Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva, 31, had given birth to a child in Switzerland. This was denied by the Kremlin. The political chaos in Moscow comes after Western sanctions and a low oil price have caused mayhem to the Russian economy, with a serious fall in the rouble. Many of the clans in Putin's entourage became hugely rich under his rule, but now face their fortunes evaporating. Software experts in Russia yesterday suggested the pictures of Putin meeting Lebedev, supposedly taken Friday, were created in 2011 and modified a year later. But Putin is shown in front of the presidential flag, though he was not head of state in 2011 .","Vladimir Putin is supposed to hold public meetings on Monday .

"Two cocaine dealers were caught after they bought so many blenders to mix the drug that supermarket staff became suspicious and notified police. Thomas Davies bought as many as 12 blenders from the Asda store, prompting employees, not convinced he was going to use the appliances for cooking, to phone police. The pair were found with £300,000 worth of the Class-A drug when officers raided the home belonging to his partner, Gavin Etchell, in Tonypandy, South Wales, last September. Jailed: Thomas Davies, left, and Gavin Etchell, right, were sentenced at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court yesterday . The two men were jailed for more than 15 years at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court yesterday after admitting to conspiracy to supply cocaine. Roger Griffiths, prosecuting, said that police searched Etchell's home in Tonypandy on September 19 after being informed by Asda store staff who were suspicious of Davies' purchases. As officers prepared to enter the property, Davies, 29, who was outside in the street, texted Etchell to try to warn him. Inside, police found four compressed blocks of cocaine with a purity of between 9 and 11 per cent and a combined weight of 1,011g and a street value of £300,000. There was also 5.8kg of benzocaine, a cutting agent used to increase profits, bags and traces of drugs on the kitchen worktop. 'It was the purchase of handheld mixers by Davies in such quantities at the Asda store that the suspicions of the staff were aroused and the police were informed,' said Mr Griffiths. Tipped off: Police were notified after Asda employees became suspicious when the pair bought as many as 12 blenders, some pictured above, from their store. Officers later carried out a raid on Etchell's home . Cash was also found at Etchell's home and a further £4,000 cash was found at Davies' home, also in Tonypandy, when arrested. 'Both defendants were involved in the significant supply of cocaine,' said Mr Griffiths. Etchell admitted further counts of possessing cannabis with intent to supply on the drug being found at his home and possessing a stun gun. He had boasted about having the gun, a court heard, but on testing it was found not to work. Alexander Greenwood, defending Etchell, 33, who has a record for possessing drugs with intent to supply, said he was aware the only sentence was one of custody. Haul: Inside Etchell's home, police found four compressed blocks of cocaine with a purity of between 9 and 11 per cent and a combined weight of 1,011g and a street value of £300,000. Above, some of the cocaine . Andrew Taylor, defending Davies, who has a record for possessing cocaine, said he was a loving father. 'He has reflected at the pain, anguish and torture he has put his children through,' he said. Judge Richard Twomlow jailed Etchell for a total of nine years and Davies for six years and eight months. After the case acting Detective Inspector Dan Michel, said: 'Thanks to information we had from the community we were able to take action and take these two drug dealers out of business. 'They were clearly dealing in large quantities of cocaine and were behind the area's supply. 'A significant amount of cash has been seized and officers will look for any assets that they suspect were funded through drug money and confiscate them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.'","Thomas Davies bought as many as 12 blenders at Asda supermarket .

"Ed Miliband has been challenged on live TV over whether he regrets 'stabbing his brother in the back' to win the Labour leadership. He insisted that although the contest was 'bruising' he thought he would make a better leader than brother David, and still does. It came as he was grilled by young voters on BBC Three, who questioned him about trust, drugs and being weird. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband has been challenged on live TV over whether he regrets 'stabbing his brother in the back' to win the Labour leadership . David Miliband had been seen as a frontrunner for the Labour leadership after Gordon Brown lost the election in 2010. The surprise decision by Ed, his less experienced younger brother, to stand against sent shock waves through Westminster and plunged their relationship into the deep freeze. Ed proved victorious, narrowly securing the leadership with the support of the trade unions. But his decision to stand against his brother has proved to be one of the most potent aspects of his leadership remembered by voters, almost five years on. Taking part in BBC Three's Free Speech programme, audience member Alex Hancock asked to applause: 'Do you think the Labour party would be in a better position if your brother was leader?' Mr Miliband replied: 'Look I thought I was the best person for the job when I ran for leader, and I think that now. Look, let me try to explain to you why I thought that. 'It was obviously really tough for me to be in a contest with my brother, tough for him as well. I thought we needed to move on from New Labour. Because I thought we'd been a good government but on issues like Iraq, inequality we got it wrong and we needed to move on. 'I thought I was the best party to move the Labour party on. And sure it was bruising and sure it was difficult but I thought that then and I think that now as well.' He was asked if he thought the Labour party would be better off if his brother David had won the leadership election . Taking part in BBC Three's Free Speech programme, audience member Alex Hancock (right) asked Mr Miliband: 'So do you regret stabbing him in the back or not?' David Miliband had been seen as a frontrunner for the Labour leadership after Gordon Brown lost the election in 2010 but was narrowly beaten by younger brother Ed . Audience member Fay asked Mr Miliband what he would do if he found cannabis in his son's bedroom . Ed Miliband would not call the police if he found cannabis in his son's bedroom. He was challenged by audience member Fay over whether he would support the decriminalisation of cannabis. He rejected the idea, insisting: 'We know that there are harmful effects. 'I think the signal government sends is important. If the government sends a signal that cannabis use is somehow OK, and we know there’s harder forms of cannabis and softer forms of cannabis, I think it’s sending the wrong signal.' Fay responded: 'In a few years’ time when your sons are teenagers and you find a bag of cannabis in your bedroom, will you be going to a doctor or will you be going to the police?' But the Labour leader insisted: 'I’ll be going to neither. I’d be discouraging from using it, absolutely I would. Challenged on the issue again, Mr Miliband replied: ‘I hope I’d stop it happening in the first place.’ But Miss Hancock hit back with the stinging question: 'So do you regret stabbing him in the back or not?' While there was laughter from some in the audience, Mr Miliband appeared stony faced. That's not the way I'd describe it,' he said. 'That's not the way I'd describe it. Look we both stood in this contest and we both offered different things to the Labour party. 'It was a narrow victory for me, but I won the election, I won the contest. It was tough at the time and it's obviously healed since then. 'But you know I think the thing people are focussed on for the next 55 days is the choice between me and David Cameron, not me and David Miliband. That's obviously the contest at this election.' During the programme Mr Miliband was also tackled about whether his policies add, the lack of women in politics, rent controls and drugs policies. An audience member called John told the Labour leader: 'You are often portrayed as a bit strange, a bit weird.' 'I hadn't heard that John,' Mr Miliband said. 'And you look like Wallace,' John added. 'I had heard that,' the Labour leader laughed. Asked if any of that matters, Mr Miliband insisted it did not. 'If you want this to be a beauty contest or a photo opp contest, then I'm not going to win it.' 'I think there are other things that matter in a leader. I think ideas matter, to change the country, decency matters, and whtehr you hear the voices of people across the country. 'I think you need someone in Downing Street who stands up for what they believe in.' Awkwardly for Mr Miliband, his comments about being against photo opportunities came after he was pistured posing with his wife Justine in his kitchen. It has since emerged that it is the couple's second kitchen in their smart North London home. Mr Miliband was cheered when he promised to abolish the bedroom tax, telling the audience: 'It is mean, its unfair, two thirds of the people it hits are disabled people.' He also warned that people were being 'totally ripped off' in the private rented sector, and promised three-year tenancies, with rents controlled so they 'can't just be jacked up by 10 per cent without warning', and letting agents will be banned from charging fees to tenants. He admitted the last Labour government did not do enough on rented housing. During the programme, Mr Miliband was grilled by young voters on BBC Three, who questioned him about trust, drugs and being weird . An audience member called John told the Labour leader: 'You are often portrayed as a bit strange, a bit weird.' Mr Miliband also admitted that a lack of trust in politics remains an issue for all parties. 'People know that politicians have broken their promises in the past. It's not just Nick Clegg. 'My mission and what I've tried to do is make sure everything i promise is funded, credible and deliverable. 'Judge me in government. I've made sure that the promises i make are the promises I'll keep. 'My manifesto will be my contract with you. You will have to judge me on how I keep those promises. 'Some people in my party say why don't you make bigger promises, and I say it's because I want to be the first politician to under-promise and over-deliver, instead of over-promise and under-deliver.'","Leader asked if Labour would be better off with brother David in charge .

Top celebrities such as Sir Tom Jones, Jonathan Ross, Jack Wilshere, Vivienne Westwood, Katie Price and over 50 more famous faces have donated their shoes to be auctioned off on the British Heart Foundation’s (BHF) eBay site as part of Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign. Shoes that have been donated include a pair of cowboy boots worn by Alison Steadman for an episode of Gavin & Stacey, stilettos worn by TV personality and epic strutter Michael Van Schoick and the wedding shoes Gemma Atkinson wore in her first scene in Emmerdale. Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign, supported by the BHF, will give every secondary school pupil in the UK the possibility to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Glamour model Katie Price supported the #Heels4Hearts campaign by donating a pair of white stilettos . Funds raised through the campaign will aim to provide every secondary school in the UK with a CPR kit so that young people can learn the life saving skill. Good Morning Britain is appealing to the public to donate their unwanted shoes to BHF shops during the campaign (23rd to 28th March) which will then go towards funding the CPR kits. In the UK, less than one in ten people survive an out of hospital cardiac arrest. Veteran singer and judge on The Voice Sir Tom Jones handed over a pair of black monk shoes to support the fundraising campaign, whilst TV presenter Jonathan Ross donated some black leather shoes . Yet in some parts of Norway, where CPR training is taught in secondary school, survival rates are one in four. If the UK achieved the same rates as Norway, we could save the lives of up to 5,000 people every year. Diane Locke, BHF Deputy Retail Director, said: 'We’re delighted that so many celebrities have donated to Good Morning Britain’s Heels 4 Hearts campaign and are very grateful for every pair. 'We’re very lucky to have been donated all types of shoes, from designer brands and high heels to sport shoes from over 50 celebrities. Arsenal player Jack Wilshere donated a signed pair of football boots in support of the British Heart Foundation's campaign . 'There really is something for everyone available, so please visit bhf.org.uk and take a look. The profit raised from each pair of shoes will help give us the chance for every secondary school pupil in the UK to learn CPR.' Last financial year, BHF stores raised over £31 million to help the BHF fight heart disease, the nation’s single biggest killer. Supporters are encouraged to get involved using the hashtag #Heels4Hearts.","Stylish celeb mums support charity campaign by taking selfies in T-shirts .

"A happily-married bearded woman is debating shaving her facial hair for her belated wedding photos, as she and her husband prepare to celebrate their five-year anniversary on tonight's episode of the TLC reality series Strange Love. When she was 13-years-old Annalisa Hackleman, from Sunnyvale, California, was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a hormonal condition that causes an increase in hair grown on her face and body. While her husband supported her decision to grow out her beard after years of shaving, Annalisa is unsure about flaunting her facial hair in their anniversary photos. 'David is super supportive and accepting of my facial hair. I don't think he loves my facial hair, but he loves me and that's all that matters,' she says in the episode, according to People. Scroll down for video . Filled with love: Annalisa Hackleman posed for a photo with her husband David, whom she says was supportive of her decision to grow out her beard after years of shaving her face . Moving on: Several years ago, Annalisa revealed to online magazine Beardspo.com that, as a child, she had been incredibly confused about why people felt she should be ashamed of her facial hair . But despite insisting she is sure of her husband's unwavering devotion to her, this evening's episode of the popular reality series will see Annalisa questioning whether she really wants to keep her facial hair – or whether she should save it off in order to improve the appearance of the couple's photos. Several years ago, Annalisa revealed to online magazine Beardspo.com that, as a child, she had been incredibly confused about why people felt she should be ashamed of her facial hair - but admitted that, as time went on, their cruel comments and jibes left her feeling terrible about herself. 'I didn’t see why it mattered that I had darker hair on my face,' she explained. 'At the time it was still peach fuzz looking. After being hounded about it, I became self conscious. My mother decided I needed laser hair removal which ultimately didn’t work and began shaving my face to look ""normal"".' She added: 'About three years ago, I was at the point of shaving my beard twice a day... It was a never ending battle. I formed agoraphobia (unable to leave my house) and would feel anxiety trying to plan outings or go anywhere. When I did leave the house after much stress, crying and worry I found the anxiety wouldn’t calm down. 'Thankfully my husband helped to get me out of my haze and demanded something be done as it was ruining our life together.' Overcoming illness: The California resident has suffered from PCOS, which causes increased hair growth, since the age of 13 . It was then that Annalisa began growing out her beard and embracing her facial hair once and for all - and ironically, at the time of the interview, she confessed that she didn't 'know if I'll ever remove my beard again', adding that it made her feel more 'free, confident and more womanly' than she had felt in years. The upcoming episode also features Nathan Hurd, a black albino comedian, who is looking for love in Los Angeles. The 36-year-old, who has albinism, an inherited condition characterized by little or no pigment in the eyes skin or hair, says he is looking for someone that he can have a conversation with now that he is getting older. 'I've liked girls a whole lot, but I don't think I've ever been in love,' he explains in a clip from the episode. Growing up, he would get teased a lot because of his condition. Nathan got into comedy because 'making people laugh was a way of diffusing the issue'. Daily struggle: The 36-year-old's albinism has caused him to become legally blind. He has to use a magnifying glass to read . New look: The comedian can be seen looking for a monocle to replace his magnifying glass . 'Laughter is the best medicine. Everybody knows that,' he says. His albinism also causes him severe problems with his vision. Nathan is legally blind and has nystagmus, a condition that causes his eyes to move back and forth as they try to find a focal point. Because of his vision problems, he uses a magnifying glass to read. 'I am more self-conscious in the dating world,' he says. 'Back in the day, when I was going on dates I didn't have the magnifying glass - or I didn't want to bring it out.' 'The couple of girlfriends I had in high school didn't start dating me because I was a black albino,' he says, before adding: 'I don't really flirt with girls because I don't know if I am flirting or they just think that I got crazy eyes.' On tonight's episode, Nathan is joined by his friend Colton as he goes shopping for a monocle to replace his magnifying glass as he gets ready to start searching for the love of his life.","Annalisa Hackleman, from Sunnyvale, California, stars on tonight's episode of Strange Love .

"A mom on a school was killed by a stray bullet after shouting at her kids to run during a gang shootout in her San Francisco Bay Area neighborhood. Chyemil Pierce, 30,  died Monday afternoon outside her home in Oakland, reports The San Francisco Chronicle. Her seven-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter, who ran around the house and hid as bullets flew, weren't hurt. A mom on a school has been killed by a stray bullet after shouting at her kids to run during a gang shootout in her San Francisco Bay Area neighborhood. Chyemil Pierce, 30, died Monday afternoon outside her home . Investigators say a gunbattle apparently broke out as Pierce, a human resources employee at Kaiser Permanente, was heading home after picking up her kids from school. Witnesses say up to 50 shots were fired. The newspaper reports that two people possibly tied to the fight, a teenage boy and a man, were wounded but expected to survive. No arrests have been made. A contractor working at Pierce's home told SFGate that he was inside working when he heard the gunfire. He said he saw Pierce's children running around the side of the home and then hide. The family was walking home on the 2800 block of Chestnut Street (pictured)  when a confrontation between two groups erupted further north.  Witnesses say up to 50 shots were fired . He said he grabbed them and tried to shield them from seeing their mom's body. 'Now they don't have their mom. That's sickening,' he said. 'That's very crazy. Who are these crazy-a** people? She wasn't involved in anything!' Pierce, who had plans to marry, also leaves behind a one-year-old son who was not there during the shootout. Lt. Roland Holmgren, with the Oakland Police Department, told Pix 11 said it was all connected to a violent gang feud in the neighborhood. 'Senseless gun violence and at the end of it a woman who has nothing to do with it, who is doing nothing more than trying to get her children to safety loses her life and the children lose their mother,' Holmgren said. No arrests have been made.","Chyemil Pierce died Monday afternoon outside her home in Oakland .

"A major Republican donor said Thursday he had heard an anti-Semitic remark made by Missouri GOP chairman against the state auditor who later killed himself believing he was being targeted for his religion. David Humphreys released a signed affidavit saying state GOP chairman John Hancock mentioned November 24, when he was still a party consultant, that Missouri Auditor Tom Schweich was Jewish. 'The meaning I took from Mr. Hancock's statement and tone of his comments was clear: He (Tom Schweich) is Jewish — in case you didn't know — and that being Jewish is a negative attribute for Tom Schweich's gubernatorial race,' Humphreys affirmed in the affidavit. Auditor Tom Schweich (left) committed suicide believing himself to be target of anti-Semitic smear campaign, which a top Republican donor said Missouri GOP chairman John Hancock (right) joined in on . Humphreys is the first person to publicly attest to hearing such comments from Hancock. Hancock said Thursday that he had met with Humpheys at the businessman's Joplin office to discuss Republican Party fundraising efforts, but he denied saying anything about Schweich's religion. 'It didn't happen,' Hancock said. Paul Mouton, a Republican Party insider who is acquainted with both Hancock and Humphreys, said he also was at the Nov. 24 meeting. His recollection backs up Hancock's account. 'I did not hear him say anything about Tom Schweich being Jewish,' Mouton told the AP. Schweich fatally shot himself February 26 at his home in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton, just a month after declaring his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. The shooting occurred minutes after Schweich told an Associated Press reporter that he was ready to go public with allegations that Hancock had made anti-Semitic remarks about him. Schweich had Jewish ancestry but attended an Episcopal church. Affirmed: David Humphreys, CEO of building products company Tamko, says he heard Hancock make a remark about Schweich's background that implied a negative view of his Jewish roots . Former US Senator John Danforth, an Episcopal minister who was Schweich's friend and political mentor, delivered the eulogy at Schweich's funeral. He suggested his friend had been driven to suicide by political bullying and an anti-Semitic whispering campaign. Danforth said Thursday that he asked Humphreys to come forward with his account, because Hancock has denied making such remarks. He said the Republican State Committee should oust Hancock from the chairmanship. 'The brand of the Republican Party in Missouri has been badly damaged, and it's very important to set the record clear,' Danforth said. 'I think it's important for Republicans to dissociate themselves from what has happened in the campaign against Tom Schweich.' Hancock has said previously that he had mistakenly believed Schweich was Jewish and, although he had no specific recollection of doing so, has said it's possible he might have mentioned that in an off-handed way while talking to prospective donors. Hancock said he learned the truth about Schweich's religion during a pair of conversations November 14 with Danforth and Schweich, and he said he certainly never mentioned Schweich was Jewish after that. 'I did meet with David Humphreys on November 24,' as Hancock was running for GOP chairman, he said. But 'I would not have said Tom Schweich was Jewish at that meeting, because I knew that he wasn't at that point.' Hancock said he also met with Humphreys on September 12, as he was raising money for a Catholic voter registration effort. He said it's possible he may have mentioned Schweich was Jewish during that meeting but he has no recollection of doing so. Hancock said he has no plans to step down as party chairman, a post to which he was elected on Feb. 21 while pledging to improve the party's fundraising. Humphreys, who had given generously to Schweich and various Republican causes, said he has no intention of giving money to Hancock for any reason. At the time of his death, Schweich was campaigning for governor against Republican Catherine Hanaway, a former Missouri House Speaker and US attorney. Hancock had done political research for Hanaway's campaign, but Hancock said his efforts were focused on the likely Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Attorney General Chris Koster, not on Schweich.","Tom Schweich fatally shot himself in February a month after announcing his candidacy for governor .

"A group of Belgian holidaymakers who were heading to the French Alps for a few days of skiing wound up being taken on a major detour thanks to their coach driver’s sat-nav mistake. The driver wasn’t familiar with the route to La Plagne, a popular destination for ski tourists, and mistakenly drove the tour group to the South of France after selecting the wrong destination on his GPS. Instead of entering La Plagne into his sat-nav, the driver entered Plagne, located in the French Pyrenees, putting the group of 50 holidaymakers on a nearly 800-mile detour, Belgian media reported. The tourists were travelling to La Plagne in the French Alps, but were driven towards the South of France . The bus driver said there were three entries for Plagne on his sat-nav and he chose the wrong one . The driver told Dutch-speaking radio station StudioBrussel: ‘There are three entries for Plagne in France and we were wrong.’ StudioBrussel is owned by public broadcaster VRT, which organised the ski holiday for its listeners. By the time the driver realised his mistake the group was already in Toulouse, nearly 425 miles south-west of La Plagne. He turned around and drove to the correct destination, and the holidaymakers arrived 24 hours behind schedule. When they arrived they were greeted by a StudioBrussel journalist, who treated them to tapas. The coach driver realised his mistake and turned around in Toulouse, nearly 425 miles from La Plagne . The ski tourists were driven towards the French Pyrenees after their driver picked the wrong destination . Despite the disruption – and lost time on the slopes – some of the tourists took it all in stride and were happy they were taken on a detour. One of the passengers, a Twitter user named Sven, tweeted that the group had ‘just seen the Mediterranean and Carcassonne’, referring to a fortified French town located between Toulouse and the Mediterranean coast. He added: ‘We had a hard time convincing the driver he was going to Spain and had a few laughs’.","Group of 50 holidaymakers were travelling to La Plagne in the French Alps .

"This is the amazing free running, skateboarding Staffordshire bull terrier Ziggy, who has amazed crowds in his home town and taken the internet by storm. Ziggy Trixx, who can also play dead, tidy up and perform martial arts stunts has been trained by his owner Adem Basharan since he was just a pup. The 26-year-old began training his canine prodigy when the staffie was just 14 weeks old. The pair now regularly showcase Ziggy's impressive array of tricks on the streets of Southend-on-Sea.

Adem explained the dog learned his name after just one day . Owner Adem says although it is hard to pick a favourite routine, Ziggy's best is probably his skateboarding . Adem, who is expecting his first child with fiancée Alice Aungier, has had Ziggy, now one and a half, since November 2013. Adem explained the dog learned his name after just one day. Over the past year Adem has dedicated his time to training the well behaved hound who has a dedicated following on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. Ziggy's Facebook page has garnered nearly 17,000 likes with an impressive 210,000 views counted on his YouTube video 'Ziggy Trixx - Play Dead - Staffy's Hilarious Reaction to Being ""Shot""'. Adem said: 'Ziggy has always picked things up really quickly - for example it only took a few days for him to learn how to ride a skateboard, but learning to say hello took much longer. 'Recently we have focused on teaching him routines rather than new tricks and we reward him with positive reinforcement - praise, love, cuddles and of course treats and toys. Surprisingly, Ziggy is actually the first dog Adem has owned or trained. The talented pooch learnt his own name in just one day . Apart from the basic commands such as sitting or shaking hands, Ziggy's first trick was playing dead which he now has down to a fine art . Ziggy and Adem have amazed crowds in Southend-on-Sea with their street performances . 'Other than general commands such as sit, lay down and paw etc, his first trick was to play dead which has become quite a crowd pleaser. 'It's impossible for me to choose a favourite trick - I think I'd have to say both his skateboarding trick and playing dead.' The street performer is also hoping Ziggy's impressive talents will help to disprove public stereotypes that Staffordshire bull terriers are a dangerous breed. The duo are now focusing on routines rather than individual tricks as they expand Ziggy's skills . The street performer is hoping Ziggy's talents will help to disprove public stereotypes that Staffordshire bull terriers are a dangerous breed . Adem said: 'A lot of people judge Staffies and think that the breed is dangerous. But this is not true, they are no more dangerous than any other breed of dog. 'Staffordshire Bull Terriers are very intelligent, loving and loyal - but sadly this doesn't stop people mistreating or abandoning them. 'Most rescue centres are filled with unwanted Staffies and they are having difficulty re-homing them. 'The breed gets a lot of negative speculation which definitely does not help the situation and people may not want to adopt them, and as a result many are being put down. If people stopped judging them and started helping them, it would really make a difference and prevent so many good dogs being put to sleep.'

"A top grammar school that was fined £10,000 after a 14-year-old pupil was hit in the head during a shot put event had to call another ambulance to the premises after a boy ran into a wall, during a 100m sprint. Governors of the Judd School in Tonbridge, Kent, admitted failing to ensure the safety of a 14 year-old boy who nearly died from head injuries after being hit with a metal shot. But less than a week after the case was heard by magistrates, paramedics returned to the school when a 12 year-old pupil reportedly ran into a wall following a 100 metre sprint. The Judd School was fined £10,000 last week after a 14-year-old pupil was hit in the head during a shot put event when too many sports were going on at the same time. Last week the school had to call an ambulance after another pupil is believed to have been injured after running into a wall during a 100m sprint event . The year eight pupil had to be treated at the scene and then taken to hospital after being injured after he ran into a wall at the prestigious school at about 1pm last Friday, headmaster Robert Masters confirmed. The boy suffered a bang to his forehead and was taken to Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells, a South East Coast Ambulance spokesman said. He is no longer in hospital. Days earlier Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court heard the school failed to follow its own safety guidelines during a PE lesson last June where a pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull during a shot put event. Pupils were taking part in six field sports on June 20 last year. The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put. But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time. After he was injured the year nine pupil was rushed to King's College Hospital in London for emergency brain surgery because parts of his skull had gone into his brain, causing swelling. He was in hospital for almost a month. A pupil was hit on the head by a shot during an athletics session on the shot put field (pictured) last year . Magistrates heard the boy had returned to the school but will have to live with 'the consequences' of the incident for the rest of his life. He was formerly a keen rugby player but has been told he will never play again. The school was charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil and pleaded guilty. Magistrates said the safety breach was 'substantial' and ordered the the school to pay £10,000 in fines and £1,375 in costs. The court heard that the boy had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. But the pupil who threw the shot says he didn't hear the whistle. The Judd School was fined £10,000 over the incident involving the shot put, after magistrates ruled they had breached their general duty to the pupil . He started the throw with his back to the landing area the victim was stood beside, and it hit him on the head. Following the incident the school said it had suspended their athletics lessons until a full audit was done and revised health and safety measures had been put in place. Speaking after the ruling head teacher Robert Masters said they expressed 'deepest regret' over the incident. He previously said: 'We have re-examined all our safety procedures in PE and are in the process of doing the same across the whole school. We have also shared the lessons from this incident with other secondary schools. 'Whilst accepting that we cannot eliminate accidents altogether, we are as confident as we can be that a similar accident will not happen again in future.' The Judd School, which is heavily oversubscribed, has more than 1,000 pupils aged 11-18 and has won numerous national sports competitions in athletics and cross country. Headmaster Robert Masters declined to comment on the latest incident.","The Judd School was fined £10,000 last week after a 14-year-old was in hospital for nearly a month after being hit in the head during shot put .

"Gaffe: Broadcaster John Inverdale, pictured, excused his foul language as a 'slip of the tongue' BBC presenter John Inverdale was forced to apologise after swearing during radio coverage of the Cheltenham Festival. Speaking on BBC 5 Live, the veteran broadcaster accidentally said 'rose-c***ed' glasses when reflecting on the career of former jockey John Francome. He quickly corrected himself and apologised before explaining it had been a 'slip of the tongue'. Inverdale made the embarrassing gaffe while interviewing Francome and rising racing star Lizzie Kelly earlier today. Francome, who became a racing pundit after retiring from the sport, said: 'You get wet, you're mucking out, and it's hard work. 'But through all of that it's a way of life that most of them wouldn't swap, a lot of people go off and do other things and then come back to it.' To which Inverdale replied: 'This is looking at it through rose-c***ed, rose-tinted glasses from the past... I apologise there for a slip of the tongue, but Lizzie your love of the sport just shines through.' Kelly, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in the last 12 months, struggled not to laugh as she said: Oh yeah, because, as I've said it's very important to love it or you wouldn't do it otherwise.' It is not the first time that Inverdale's language has landed him in trouble. He made headlines last year when he said 't**t' during an interview with former tennis World No. 1 tennis star Jim Courier during French Open coverage. Speaking to Courier about Twitter, Inverdale said: 'Did you know the past participle of tweeting was t**t?'  He quickly corrected himself, saying: 'Was twit'. On-air: Inverdale was speaking to former jockey John Francome (left) and racing star Lizzie Kelly (right) Coverage: The veteran broadcaster was covering  the Cheltenham Festival, pictured today, for BBC 5 Live . And in 2013 the broadcaster faced public criticism when he said that Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli was 'never going to be a looker' during coverage of the tournament. Inverdale sparked a furore  when he made the comment about the appearance of the French player, who had just won the  ladies' final. Speaking the following year, Inverdale said that he knew that he had committed a gaffe but that his BBC training meant that he did not say sorry. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'It was a slip of the tongue and John apologised immediately afterwards.'

"A vandal thought to be as young as four was captured on CCTV vandalising a father-of-two's Audi on Mother's Day. David Draper was horrified when footage on his home security camera showed the boy running a key along the side of his grey car. The 37-year-old from Crosby in Liverpool said the vandalism took place at around lunchtime on Mother's Day. The youngster was seen pulling a sharp object or key out of his pocket and running it along the side of the Audi . Two seemingly older children are seen walking along the street ahead of the younger boy in the video. The child is seen calmly pulling what appears to be a key from the pocket of his grey tracksuit, all the while maintaining his pace. He runs the object along Mr Draper's car, leaving a long, white scratch. The father of two claims his was not the only car on the quiet residential street to have been damaged last Sunday. 'I've lived here for five years, it’s a nice area. Nothing like this has happened before. 'This young boy scratched my car in the street and was seemingly allowed to do so. 'I don’t know who the children are. I knocked on the doors of my neighbours and have discovered their cars have also been damaged as well. 'I’m hoping I’ll be able to just paint over it but it’s still damaged. I don’t recognise the older boy or any of the children.' Mr Draper is now planning to report the incident to police after having been unable to identify the children in the video by speaking to neighbours.

"Having been almost decapitated by discarded fishing nets, these seals are being released into the wild after medics nursed them back to health. The heart-warming photographs show a four-month-old seal pup named Iron Man and a five-month-old called Beast let back in the water off Cornwall. They were badly injured by lost, discarded or abandoned fishing nets that campaigners warn can cause a devastating impact to marine life. Rescued: A four-month-old seal pup named Iron Man (above) and a five-month-old called Beast have been let back in the water . Released: The seals were badly injured by lost or abandoned fishing nets that campaigners warn can cause a devastating impact to marine life . Off you go: In the two-month period following Christmas 2014, there were five seals entangled in such nets saved by rescuers in Cornwall . Back in the water: Sue Sayer from Cornwall Seal Group said the cases of Iron Man and Beast 'are by no means unique' Iron Man in recovery: British Divers Marine Life Rescue found him near Pendeen, entangled with a net and trapped on rocks near the shore . In the two-month period following Christmas 2014, there were five seals entangled in such nets saved by marine rescuers in Cornwall alone. Iron Man was rescued last December having suffered severe injuries after a 30ft-long piece of lost fishing trawl net became caught around his neck. British Divers Marine Life Rescue found him near Pendeen, not far from Land’s End, entangled with a net and trapped on rocks near the shore. With a drowning risk posed by an incoming tide, medics freed the net from the rocks and cut it from where it had created a deep wound round his head. Sue Sayer from Cornwall Seal Group, who will monitor Iron Man’s progress back on the wild, said: ‘These cases are by no means unique. What you looking at? Having been almost decapitated by discarded fishing nets, these seals are being released back into the wild . Beast in recovery: The five-month-old was also rescued with a deep wound on his neck after a fishing net cut into his flesh . Coming to their aid: Staff from the Cornish Seal Sanctuary hospital in Gweek - near Culdrose Airfield - help the injured seals . Medical attention: This seal was helped by the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, set in the Helford Estuary, which is a national rescue centre . Nursing them back to health: Lost, discarded or abandoned fishing nets are known as 'ghost gear' - and can cause serious harm to seals . ‘Iron Man would have playfully explored the lost fishing net floating in the sea and then become hideously wrapped up in it. ‘Despite being only a few months old, he had been entangled long enough to cause a wound so deep it looked like his head was being cut off.’ After his rescue, Iron Man was immediately transported to the Cornish Seal Sanctuary hospital in Gweek for emergency veterinary treatment. He is now four months old and was released in full health back into the ocean last Thursday, where it is hoped he will thrive in his natural habitat. He was accompanied by Beast, who was also rescued with a deep wound on his neck after a fishing net cut into his flesh.","Heart-warming photos show four-month-old seal pup Iron Man and five-month-old Beast let back in water .

"One of the country's most influential evangelical leaders has apologized for saying homosexuals should be killed - 35 years after he made the comment. Bob Jones III said gay men and lesbians should be stoned to death 'as the Bible commands' in 1980. The 75-year-old, whose grandfather founded Bob Jones University in South Carolina, made the remarks during a visit to the White House to demand that President Jimmy Carter not extend protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to gay men and lesbians. Sorry: Bob Jones III (pictured left and right in 2005) has apologized for saying gay men and lesbians should be stoned 'as the Bible commands' in 1980 . Speaking to the Associated Press at the time, he said: 'I'm sure this will be greatly misquoted. But it would not be a bad idea to bring the swift justice today that was brought in Israel's day against murder and rape and homosexuality. 'I guarantee it would solve the problem post-haste if homosexuals were stoned, if murderers were immediately killed as the Bible commands.' In an apology issued on Saturday he said the comments were 'antithetical to my theology and my 50 years of preaching a redeeming Christ.' According to NBC, he added: 'I take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric. 'This reckless statement was made in the heat of a political controversy 35 years ago. Regret: In an apology issued on Saturday, Jones III (pictured in 1974) said the comments were 'antithetical to my theology and my 50 years of preaching a redeeming Christ.' 'I cannot erase them, but wish I could, because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching. Neither before, nor since, that event in 1980 have I ever advocated the stoning of sinners.' The apology has been sought for three years by BJ Unity, an LGBT group made up of alumni from the evangelical college. In a statement they accepted his apology, saying: 'We are grateful that Bob Jones III has taken responsibility for these words; words that have caused deep harm for many more people than any of us knows. 'This means a lot to us because it represents the beginning of a change in the rhetoric and conversation.'","Bob Jones III said homosexuals should be stoned 'as the Bible commands'

"With its dramatic coastline and verdant hills, Ireland’s County Cork has long been a magnet for celebrities wanting a break from the limelight. American-born Irish dancer Michael Flatley has a home there, as does London-born Hollywood star Angela Lansbury, actor Jeremy Irons and film producer Lord Puttnam. Even the hard-drinking Oliver Reed used to retreat to the area for the occasional break from hellraising. But probably the most famous star to find a hideaway in County Cork is the queen of Hollywood romance, Maureen O’Hara, who has owned a spellbinding property on the coast for more than 45 years. Spellbinding: Maureen O'Hara's house nestles in the stunning coastal scenery in County Cork, Ireland . The movie legend, 94, has taken the painful decision to put the home, called Lugdine Park, on the market . Now, at the age of 94, the movie legend has taken the painful decision to put the home, called Lugdine Park, on the market and live full-time in the States. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have so many wonderful memories over these many years at Lugdine, and now it’s time to pass her on to another lucky family who will cherish her as much as I have.’ Once considered the world’s most beautiful woman, Dublin-born O’Hara is relocating to Idaho to live with her daughter Bronwyn. Lugdine Park, which was built in 1935, boasts five bedrooms, 35 acres of land and two private islands. It has wildly romantic views of the Atlantic Ocean and looks down on the harbour of the village of Glengarriff. It also has a guest cottage, outdoor changing rooms and WCs, and a private bathing beach. ‘I have the most wonderful neighbours a person can hope for in Glengarriff,’ she said. ‘We’ve been together for so long and love each other as old friends. Everybody has always been very respectful of my privacy if I want it, but I can’t wait to see everyone whenever I arrive. ‘Of course, I always get a chuckle when “lost” tourists happen to stumble upon my house in need of directions back to the village. ‘They always have their cameras with them ready to snap.’ Lugdine Park, which was built in 1935, boasts five bedrooms, 35 acres of land and two private islands . O'Hara made five movies with John Wayne, including Wings of Eagles (pictured) O’Hara’s big break came when she auditioned for a movie role in London, after she had studied at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. Oscar-winning actor Charles Laughton happened upon her screen test and was captivated by her expressive eyes. He recommended her for the lead role in Alfred Hitchcock’s British-made 1939 film Jamaica Inn. O’Hara – who was born FitzSimons but changed her name to O’Hara as it was shorter – received rave reviews for her debut role, despite the fact that the film was a commercial flop. It paved her way to Hollywood, where, with her alluring mix of red hair, refulgent green eyes and fiercely passionate attitude, she earned the title the ‘Queen of Technicolor’. She starred in The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, How Green Was My Valley, The Black Swan, Sinbad The Sailor and Miracle On 34th Street. She also made five movies with John Wayne, including The Quiet Man, in which Wayne played an Irish-born American returning to his homeland. She has been married three times, having her daughter with her second husband, the film director William Houston-Price. One place that has been a constant for her over the past half-century is her vast home in West Cork. She has a unbreakable connection to the people in the small community of Glengarriff and has been the honorary vice president of Glengarriff Golf Club, participating in and promoting tournaments, bringing thousands to the area and putting the small fishing village on the map. There has been many a famous visitor to her home too. ‘Ed Koch was a beloved Mayor of New York City and friend who did visit me at Lugdine,’ she said. ‘We had a wonderful time in our cosy village and he delighted everyone with his wonderful wit. He spent every morning gazing out the window at that magnificent bay, sipping his coffee. Price: €2.095million (approx £1.52million) Location: Glengarriff, Co Cork . Bedrooms: Five . Unique features: Home of Hollywood legend Maureen O'Hara, two private islands and private beach, 35 acres of land . ‘He said it was the perfect view to accompany his perfect cup of coffee. Everyone who visited, famous or not, always said it took their breath away, they loved the serenity of it.’ When asked for any advice for the next owners of her home, she said: ‘Greet everyone you meet with a smile and friendly hand and they’ll wrap their loving arms around you. It’s a lovely, lovely village filled with wonderful people who are so proud of this magical piece of heaven.’","Maureen O'Hara, 94, is selling her spellbinding property in County Cork .

"The family of an 11-year-old boy are suing the Publix grocery chain, saying the child was allergic to nuts and died from a severe reaction after eating a cookie despite a worker's assurance it was safe. The lawsuit says Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville. The boy, who was visiting family in Tennessee, was allergic to tree nuts. Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville and now his family are suing the food chain . The lawsuit, which was filed on March 20, says the store bakery did not post warnings about ingredients or possible cross-contamination, and the mother bought the cookie only after a worker assured her it was safe. Derek's family filed the lawsuit on Friday in federal court in Nashville and are seeking unspecified amount of damages. They claim the grocery store should be declared liable under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act 'to raise awareness of potential fatal food allergies in American children.' The family also claims Publix was negligent for not labeling its baked goods and identifying any allergens, for not posting signs warning of potential allergens or cross-contamination and for not properly training employees to respond to questions about food allergens. A Publix spokeswoman declined to comment on the litigation but said in an email that the company posts allergen information at its bakeries. 'We were very sorry about the loss if this young man. Our prayers go out for him and his family,' a Publix Super Markets spokesperson told USA Today. The incident happened on June 3 last year when Landon, his mother, aunt, and a cousin visited the Publix Super Market in Clarksville, above . The incident happened on June 3 last year when Landon, his mother, aunt, and a cousin visited the Publix store. Landon's mom bought an unlabeled 'Chocolate Chew' cookie that he wanted. The mother specifically asked a Publix employee at the bakery counter whether the cookie contained any tree nuts. 'The Publix associate affirmatively said the Chocolate Chew contained no tree nut ingredients,' the lawsuit states. Landon ate the cookie back at his aunt's house and then went into anaphylactic shock. He died despite being immediately being given medication by his mother and efforts by emergency medical personnel and doctors at a local hospital.","Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville .

"The Conservatives were boosted by a string of economic indicators, which show UK is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006, which Chancellor George Osborne hailed as ‘a hat-trick of good news . Families are better off than when the Coalition came to power, the economy is growing faster than expected and consumers are more confident than they have been for more than 12 years, official figures revealed yesterday. On day two of the election campaign, the Conservatives were boosted by a string of economic indicators – crowned by Office for National Statistics figures showing Britain is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006. The UK is out-performing all other leading economies, including the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany and France. In seven signs that the economy is on the up following the worst slump since the 1930s: . Labour has repeatedly claimed that families are £1,600 a year worse off than they were when the Coalition came to power, but shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie last night conceded that living standards appeared to be ‘crawling back to the levels that we were at five years ago’. As David Cameron claimed the Tories would help business to create two million more jobs over the next five years if they remained in power, on top of 1.9 million since 2010, independent economists said the Government could boast a ‘remarkable’ record on employment. Car giant Honda announced a £200million investment in its Wiltshire plant - one of the many signs the economy is on the up . Chancellor George Osborne hailed ‘a hat-trick of good news about the British economy’, insisting: ‘With 37 days to go until the election, it’s another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk. Voters now face a stark choice: do we stick with a plan which is working, delivering growth and jobs, or do we put all that at risk with Ed Miliband whose policies of more spending, more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos?’ Labour had planned to use Ronald Reagan’s famous question – ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago’ – as a central plank of its election campaign, but the pressure on family finances has eased in recent months as the cost of food and fuel tumbles and wages rise. Inflation has fallen to zero – its lowest level for more than half a century – and Britain looks set for a period of deflation or falling prices. Overall, it means the average British voter now has more cash to spend than they did at the 2010 election. Household spending per head also rose by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie  conceded that living standards appeared to be ‘crawling back to the levels of five years ago’ Yesterday’s ONS figures showed the economy has grown by more than 8 per cent since the last election, having crashed by 6 per cent in the so-called ‘Great Recession’ under Labour. The UK economy is now 3.7 per cent bigger than at any time in history. Business investment rose by 7.5 per cent last year to a record £179.7billion in an indication that companies are confident enough to spend for the future. And exports rose by 4.6 per cent in the final three months of 2014 despite the ongoing crisis in the Eurozone. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘Rescuing our economy was the main reason that the Liberal Democrats formed the Coalition. This upward revision in GDP is further evidence that our recovery plan is working.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the recovery had been the slowest in 100 years. ‘A small upward revision today in the GDP figures doesn’t change that overall record. This has been a disappointing recovery and it didn’t have to be this way,’ he said. Experts said Britain was on course for another strong year in 2015. Andrew Sentance, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘We should expect GDP forecasts for this year to be revised upwards on the back of this data. It is still entirely possible that the UK will head the G7 growth league in 2015, as we did last year.’ However, in a setback for the Government, the services sector, which powers much of the economy, has slipped back. Output from services firms – which make up about 78 per cent of GDP and range from hotels to hairdressers – fell 0.2 per cent in January. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the services figures were ‘disappointing’ but described them as a ‘blip’. Labour claims... versus the reality: James Slack's analysis . Yesterday, on Day Two of the campaign, myths peddled by Ed Miliband and his shadow ministers over the past five years were exploded. Here, we examine the key facts to emerge on what could be a pivotal day in the battle for No 10... Ed Miliband and his shadow ministers have peddled myths over the past five years and on Day Two of the election campaign they exploded . LABOUR CLAIM: ‘This has been a disappointing recovery and it didn’t have to be this way.’ REALITY: In 2014, GDP grew by 2.8 per cent – revised up from 2.6 per cent yesterday and the fastest annual rate of growth since 2006. Britain had the strongest annual growth rate in the G7 in 2014. Canada, the next highest, grew at a rate of 2.5 per cent. CLAIM: ‘Living standards have fallen. Families are £1,600 worse off.’ REALITY: Real Household Disposable Income per head was up by 1.9 per cent in the final three months of 2014 compared to 12 months earlier. Living standards are now officially higher than when the Coalition took office. Disposable income – a calculation of incomings versus outgoings – now stands at £4,187 compared to £4,178 in the second quarter of 2010. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicts families will be £900 better off by the end of 2015. Labour’s £1,600 figure excludes tax changes and dates from April 2014: since then inflation has fallen sharply while pay rises have improved. CLAIM: ‘It is a complete fantasy the private sector could mop up the jobs lost during cuts to the private sector.’ REALITY: The Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday said ‘the economy has done incredibly well in terms of job creation’. Employment is up by 1.9million since the election with an average of 1,000 jobs being created every day. For every one job lost in the public sector, four have been created in the private sector. Unemployment is down 654,000 since 2010 to 1.86million. CLAIM: ‘Consumers lack confidence. They are not feeling the recovery in a tangible way.’ The number of people working full-time has risen by 1.42million - 75% of the rise in employment since the election has been in full-time jobs . REALITY: The internationally-respected GfK Consumer Confidence measure – a large-scale survey of the public’s personal finances, savings and optimism about the future – rose to +4 in March, its highest level since June 2002. Over the past year it has risen by nine points. This compares to a record low of -39 during the Labour years, recorded at the height of the financial crisis in July 2008. Real household spending after inflation rose by 0.3 per cent in the year to December 2014. It has risen by 3 per cent since the Coalition came to power. CLAIM: ‘Investment in business is woefully weak.’ REALITY: ONS figures show business investment is the fastest growing part of GDP – up by 7.8 per cent in 2014. CLAIM: ‘Hard-working people are being held back by the scourge of zero hours contracts.’ REALITY: The number of people working full-time has risen by 1.42million. Three-quarters of the rise in employment since the election has been in full-time jobs. Three-fifths of the growth in employment since 2010 has been in higher skilled occupations. ‘No matter where you may be, you are sure to get everyone and neighbouring surroundings in the picture’. VERDICT: Yesterday was a big moment for the Tories, providing them with a chance to deliver a positive message after days of negative campaigning over Labour’s tax and spending plans. It also dealt a significant blow to Ed Miliband’s ‘cost of living crisis’ line of attack. The challenge for the Tories is to find a way of hammering home their economic successes – something they have failed to consistently do so far – without sounding triumphalist. Not every family feels better-off yet. While it is of huge political significance that living standards are now higher than in May 2010, the average household has only a tenner more to spend.","Figures revealed families are better off now than when Coalition started .

"Two 15-year-olds have been charged with murdering James Stuhlman (pictured) A business owner begged for his life before he was shot dead in a botched robbery while out walking his dog, police say. Two 15-year-old boys have been charged with the murder of James Stuhlman, who was killed in Overbrook, Philadelphia at around 8.30pm on March 12. Police say the married father had pleaded for his life in vain, repeatedly saying the words 'please don't shoot me'.

Smith was already in the custody of Philadelphia police, but Hamilton turned himself in early this morning. A 14-year-old boy has also been arrested on lesser charges and is co-operating with detectives. Police say the three boys were playing basketball when they decided to rob someone. The 51-year-old, the owner of suburban landscaping company, was targeted by the three boys during his nightly walk with his labradoodle named Molly. According to police, the trio had initially targeted a different, younger man walking his dog until they saw Mr Stuhlman, whose dog looked 'weak'. Homicide Captain James Clark said it appeared the shooting occurred on the 6400 block of Woodcrest Avenue after a brief struggle. He told reporters: 'At one point, he did plead for his life.

He received his medal in a ceremony two years later from President Barack Obama, requesting that those who lost their lives and were critically injured during the attack two years earlier also be remembered.

'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club': Meyer taunted ISIS on social media last year, an action that was applauded by many in the public and armed forces . Last December, Meyer ignored requests from the FBI that individuals not taunt ISIS on social media for fear of an attack on the homeland, posting a photo of himself smoking a pipe and  reading a Marine handbook, writing; 'Wonder if any ISIS members want to drop by and join my book club.' Many members of the armed forces and public applauded his actions, and his labeling of members of the group as 'cowards.' And now, Meyer is set to become a member of the Palin family after popping the question to girlfriend Bristol exactly one week ago at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas. Meyer and Palin have been dating for a year after meeting on the set of the Sarah Palin reality show Sarah Palin's Amazing America.","In an Instagram photo posted to his account, former Marine Dakota Meyer can be seen playing with an infant as a gun sits next to them .

"Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert smiles as he waits in a court room in Jerusalem's District Court. He was convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust . Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been convicted  of unlawfully accepting money from a U.S. supporter in a retrial of corruption charges. The 69-year-old accepted around £104,000 ($153,950) from Morris Talansky while he was a cabinet minister, Jerusalem District Court heard. He could now be given five years in prison - in addition to a six-year sentence he received in 2014 for a separate bribery conviction. His lawyers said they are likely to appeal the latest ruling. Following the verdict Uri Korev, prosecuting, said: 'His behaviour constitutes a breach of trust which harms the public, harms morality and harms the public's trust in how he behaved corruptly.' Olmert gave former office manager Shula Zaken part of the money in exchange for loyalty as well as using some for personal use without reporting it, the judges concluded. He was convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust. Eyal Rozovsky, Olmert's lawyer, said their legal team was 'of course very disappointed' by the ruling. Olmert resigned in early 2009 amid corruption allegations. He was originally acquitted in 2012 of a series of charges including accepting cash-stuffed envelopes from Talansky while he was mayor of Jerusalem. He received around £406,000 ($600,000) from the U.S. businessman but there was no evidence the money had been used for unlawful person reasons or illegal campaign financing, the court said. At the time Olmert was convicted on a lesser charge of breach of trust after steering job appointments and contracts to clients of a business partner. Olmert gave former office manager Shula Zaken part of the money in exchange for loyalty as well as using some for personal use, the judges concluded. A retrial was organised after Zaken became a state witness, offering diary entries and tape recordings of conversations with Olmert about illicitly receiving cash. In a separate trial in March 2014 Olmert was convicted of bribery  and was sentenced to six years in prison. He appealed and has been allowed to stay out of jail until a verdict is delivered. The judges must now decide if Olmert should serve additional prison time for today's conviction or whether his six-year sentence is enough  for both offences, legal expert Emanuel Gross said. A decision is likely to be made in May.","Ehud Olmert accepted around £104,000 ($153,950) from Morris Talansky .

"Terrifying footage has emerged of a young tourist who encountered a near-drowning experience after leaping off a cliff and into the ocean. Patrick Orr, from Beverly, Massachusetts, posted a scary holiday video of himself struggling to keep his head above water as he desperately swims to safety off the Australian coast. The video shows a group of young men waiting to get their turn to jump off the rocks and join their friend in the water but were startled to see a giant wave heading towards Orr. Scroll down for video . Terrifying footage has emerged of a young tourist who encountered a near-drowning experience . The 27-year-old told Daily Mail Australia he was holidaying Down Under four years ago at the age of 23 when this incident happened. 'I was actually treading the water waiting for my friends to join for over a minute very comfortably before the video was shot,' he said. 'The waves were just choppy - not really particularly scary but it was very much a case of bad timing.' When he showed his mother the footage after returning home, he said the video brought tears to her eyes. 'Mum started crying, whoops,' Orr told Daily Mail Australia. 'At one point when I was in the water, I realized I was in trouble and I was like ""my mum is going to be pissed!"" Patrick Orr, from  Massachusetts, posted a video of himself being swept through the rough tides Down Under . As friends watched helplessly, a young woman, who was filming the moment through a camera phone, is heard screaming at the group of male friends: 'Don't go yet! Wait don't go!' 'Holy s***! Duck! Oh my f*****g god! Pat! Pat!' as she tells Orr to dive under the waves. 'Oh my god - you guys - now I'm freaking out!' the woman frantically said. 'Get the f*** out of there!' Struggling to escape to safety, Orr is seen being swept through the massive waves as he makes his way towards the cliff while more voices are heard  screaming and yelling out directions. As he gets closer to the cliff, Orr attempts to climb his way up the rocks but is seen being wiped out and knocked back into the water a number of times. Two male friends are seen standing at the edge of the cliff as they try to help Orr out but he gets flung back into the waves. The woman continues screaming as she says: 'Pat, oh my god, Pat. Okay that's not funny anymore' before switching off the record button. A group of male friends were waiting to get their turn to jump off the rocks and join their friend in the water . Fortunately, Orr made it clear in the caption that he managed to get to safety and escaped with minor injuries . The footage, which was filmed on a camera phone, was uploaded onto YouTube on Friday and has attracted more than 4000 views. 'Apparently it's a very common place to jump off the rocks and go swimming, but as we weren't locals we didn't realize that the water is usually completely flat and calm,' the caption said. 'Unfortunately, about thirty seconds after I jumped in while waiting for the other wimps to finally join me, a huge wave set hit.' Fortunately, Orr made it clear in the caption that he managed to get to escape safely with only minor injuries. 'Luckily, right after the video cuts out I climbed out and puked everywhere in safety. Just a few scratches.

"A divorced Spanish father has been ordered to pay nearly £300 a month to his 31-year-old daughter - because she cannot find a long-term job. Amador López, whose real name has not be released by the court, was estranged from daughter Clara until 2005, when he was told by a judge that he must support her through an undergraduate and postgraduate degree. He initially refused to pay the 500 euros (£360) a month but his bank account was frozen. Mr López, who owns several cars including a BMW, appealed the decision in 2014 but was told by Spain's Supreme Court that he must continue to support his daughter by paying 400 euros (£289) a month. A divorced Spanish father has been ordered to pay nearly £300 a month to his 31-year-old daughter - because she cannot find a long-term job. People queue outside a job centre (above) as Spain suffers from one of the highest youth unemployment rates - up to 53.5 per cent in November 2014 . Although Clara has had several short-term jobs, she has not been able to find anything permanent since graduating. Rosalia Bello, the lawyer who represents Clara, said the case was unique. 'The really unprecedented thing about this case is that the support is open-ended,' The Daily Telegraph reported her saying. The decision comes just months after a father from Cádiz, Spain, was ordered to pay his 29-year-old daughter 500 euros a month while she completed her psychology degree. The percentage of 25 to 34-year-olds living with their parents varies across Europe. In 2014 Denmark had one of the lowest rates with only two per cent of the age group neglecting to fly the nest. Mr López initially refused to pay the money but had his bank account frozen, according to his daughter's lawyer . In the UK 15 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds still lived with parents - but in southern and eastern European countries like Spain and Italy it was as high as 70 per cent. At the same time Spain suffers from one of the highest youth unemployment rates - up to 53.5 per cent in November 2014. This was in comparison to an EU average of 21.9 per cent and was well above Germany, which had the lowest rate of youth unemployment with 7.4 per cent. Sara Elder, an economist with the International Labour Organisation, said it was a 'very scary' time for young people across Europe. She said: 'These people are delaying their advance into adulthood.'","Divorced Spanish father must pay nearly £300 a month to daughter, 31 .

"THE MIDWIFE’S SISTER . by Christine Lee . (Pan £7.99) Within the very sentimental world of Sunday night television, Call The Midwife’s heroine, Jenny Lee, was played with gentle reserve by actress Jessica Raine. Call The Midwife’s heroine, Jenny Lee (left), is based on a real person . But a startling new memoir by the sister of the midwife on whom the character is based suggests the real Jenny Lee was a more fiery and difficult character. The young Jenny actually came to midwifery after being dismissed from her nursing course at the Royal Berkshire Hospital for losing her temper and smacking a small child. Then only months away from qualifying, the consultants pinned her near-perfect exam papers up on the notice board as an example to others. But she was deeply in love with a much older married man at the time, and Christine Lee now believes that her sister’s romantic frustrations were the cause of her angry outbursts. Reading the details of the sisters’ childhood, it’s obvious that Jenny had cause for anger long before her married lover refused to leave his wife. Jennifer was born in 1936, the daughter of a Post Office clerk called Elsie — a woman with ‘bedroom eyes, fabulous hour-glass figure and great legs’ — and a handsome chancer, Gordon Lee, who had whisked Elsie away on his milk float from the dance at which they met. Christine came along in 1939 as Gordon built up a successful haulage business. The first seven years of Christine’s life were idyllic — she had parents who laughed and holiday adventures on the Essex coast with her fearless older sister. Their mother flirted her way to extra luxuries during rationing. But everything changed one summer day in 1945, when Elsie came home to find her husband in bed with his secretary, Judith. Elsie had a stroke. Divorce followed. The girls were sent to a convent school run by nuns whose metal rulers left savage, red weals on dyslexic Christine’s hands as she struggled to write. Jennifer kicked back at her tormentors and got the pair expelled. Meanwhile, Gordon married Judith and the wealthy couple moved to a luxurious country home — except for the room set aside for his two girls. That boasted bare boards, a bare lightbulb and one camp bed. The real Jenny Lee (played in the BBC series by Jessica Raine, second right) ended up in midwifery after being dismissed from her nursing course at the Royal Berkshire Hospital for losing her temper . Elsie went on to marry a violent bully called Jock, who demanded the girls be out of his sight when he came home from work at 5pm. By this point, Christine claims, Jennifer had become quite violent, sometimes ‘grabbing me by the hair and repeatedly banging my head against the wall’. On one occasion, her older sister chased her around the house with a carving knife. Christine had done nothing to provoke the attacks — ‘her fury was all to do with the collapse of home life’. That collapse became total when 14-year-old Jennifer accidentally stayed downstairs playing the piano after the 5 pm curfew. Jock slammed the piano lid onto her fingers and she was thrown out of the house the next morning. A year later, she lied about her age and got a job as secretary to a headmaster her mother would come to call ‘Neville the Devil’. Jennifer fell in love with him and there was a local scandal. He was the one who eventually insisted she move away to begin a career in nursing. Jennifer adored the profession, but while her sister studied, Christine preferred to party. Marriage to an ambitious doctor seemed an easy way out, but when she needed spinal surgery shortly after the birth of her first daughter, she realised her husband was straying. She would go on to marry four times and have two more children, while Jennifer settled for a marriage with good friend Phillip Worth and had two daughters. Neville remained the love of her life. Both girls moved into the arts after having their children. While Jennifer built a career as a concert pianist then a writer, Christine became a sculptor. But they grew apart. Christine married into money, which Jennifer resented. And Jennifer’s experience working with the nuns of Poplar led her to become religious in a way that alienated her from Christine, who felt shut out by her sister’s reliable response of ‘Go with God’ to any dilemma. Christine felt she used it to justify a lack of engagement with other people’s problems. But Christine says she found peace with her ‘fierce, no-nonsense, brisk and kind’ sister at the end. Beneath the large ‘DO NOT RESUSCITATE’ notice pinned over the bed in which she died from cancer in 2011, Jennifer finally relaxed and talked openly with Christine for the first time in decades. The following year, Christine celebrated their enduring bond in an 8 ft sculpture for Exeter Cathedral — two angels, strong and loving, with a narrow but unbreachable space between them.","Jenny Lee's life was turned upside down when her parents divorced .

"Last year was the safest in the history of commercial aviation despite the loss of two high-profile Malaysia Airlines flights in which hundreds of people were killed, according to industry experts. While more people died in air accidents in 2014 than the . average in recent years, the number of fatal accidents compared . with the total number of flights was a record low, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said. The organisations said in a new report that there were 12 fatal accidents in 2014 with 641 fatalities, versus 19 fatal accidents and 517 fatalities per year in the five-year period between 2009 and 2013. The downing of MH17, in which 298 people died, was not included in the safety report because it was not technically classed as an accident . Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 takes off from Schipol airport near Amsterdam prior to being shot down as it flew over Ukraine . 'While aviation safety was in the headlines in 2014, the . data show that flying continues to improve its safety . performance,' said Tony Tyler, IATA's director general and chief . executive officer. The statistics translate into an accident rate, measured in 'hull . losses' per 1 million flights, of 0.23, or the equivalent of one . for every 4.4 million flights. IATA's 2014 statistics did not include the loss of Malaysia . Airlines Flight MH17, which was shot down by a surface-to-air . anti-aircraft missile in Ukraine last June and so not classified . as an accident. All 298 people on board were killed. 'To the flying public an air tragedy is an air tragedy, . regardless of how it is classified,' said Tyler. 'In 2014 we saw . a reduction in the number of fatal accidents - and that would be . true even if we were to include MH17 in the total.' The other high-profile event of 2014, the disappearance of . Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to . Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 passengers and crew, has . become one of the biggest mysteries in the history of aviation. An extensive search in the southern Indian Ocean, where . satellite data showed that the Boeing 777-200ER ended up after . being diverted from its original flight path, has not found any . sign of the plane.

Tyler told reporters at a briefing in Hong Kong that such a . system would be in place by November 2016. 'At the moment there's no technology that can track aircraft . everywhere in the world over time,' he said. 'These things don't . happen overnight.' New space-based technologies might make real-time tracking . possible soon, he added. 'The promise is to be able to identify aircraft wherever . they are in the world pretty much in real-time with no gaps in . coverage,' he said. 'It may well be that this is the way we . should go, however that technology won't be available for two or . three years to come.' Three of last year's 12 plane crashes involved jet aircraft and accounted for the bulk of the deaths. In December, an AirAsia jet carrying 162 people crashed into the Java Sea. In July, an Air Algerie jet went down in Mali during bad weather, killing all 116 aboard. The nine other crashes involved turboprop aircraft, including a TransAsia ATR-72 that crashed in July on the Penghu island chain in the Taiwan Strait, killing 58 people. Another TransAsia turboprop crashed in February this year, killing more than 40 people. The wreckage of AirAsia QZ8501 is removed from a rescue vessel in Jakarta, Indonesia.

"Showing no signs of slowing down, David Attenborough, has teamed up with Tourism Australia to make a three-part documentary aimed at drawing tourists to the Great Barrier Reef. Nearly 60 years after the wildlife presenter's first visit to the continent, the collaboration was announced at the Destination Australia Conference in Sydney, this week. 'The most exciting natural history experience of my life was the first time I dived on a coral reef [in 1957]. Being on the Reef is a revelatory, thrilling and unbeatable experience and with this project we're going to be able to share it with millions,' Attenborough said. David Attenborough returned to Australia filming a documentary about the world's largest coral reef system . The popular naturalist spent three weeks filming on and around the Reef and  aboard one of the world's most advanced research vessels equipped with the latest  technology. Tourism Australia Managing Director, John O'Sullivan said: 'It's wonderful to welcome David back to the Reef where he will, once again, bring to life the many amazing stories of this magnificent natural wonder in his own unique and inimitable way. 'David Attenborough is one of the world's greatest presenters of natural history content, and the Great Barrier Reef is arguably the world's most recognised natural wonder. We couldn't ask for a better match.' Knotted fan coral and soft coral in the Great Barrier Reef, Pacific Ocean, Queensland, Australia . Attenborough spent three weeks on the Reef, on a research vessel equipped with cutting-edge technology . Attenborough said diving here in 1957 was the most exciting natural history experience of his life . The Great Barrier Reef already attracts more than 1.9 million visitors each year, and 90 per cent of the economic contribution in the region is derived from tourism. 'We already know from our consumer research that Australia's biggest competitive strength is its world class nature, something which is extremely highly regarded from all our key target markets and very much a core part of our global tourism offering,' Mr O'Sullivan continued. The research also revealed that aquatic and coastal experiences were amongst the most popular tourist activities, specifically to Australia where the Great Barrier Reef ranked highly in appeal amongst international visitors. An aerial shot of Whitehaven Beach, Whitsunday Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia . Six of the world's seven species of marine turtle live in Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area . 'The Great Barrier Reef is a huge part of our destination appeal, with consumers in the UK, US, Singapore and Japan actually ranking it as their number one most appealing Australian attraction. 'It's vital that we continue to show the world why our aquatic and coastal experience are so unique, and this film will undoubtedly help tell that story to a truly global audience in an authentic and engaging way,' Mr O'Sullivan said. The Reef is at risk of becoming severely damaged due to the dumping of dredge waste in the World Heritage-listed waters, a report commissioned by conservation group WWF said last month. Divers on coral cliff admire the marine life, left; Reef fish including sea goldies swim among the coral . Reef from above: Aquatic experiences are amongst the greatest drivers of international visitor demand . In January, the Australian government ordered a ban on dumping dredge spoil in the marine park as part of a push to stop the United Nations declaring the site in danger. Conservationists say dumping waste in reef waters damages it by smothering corals and sea grasses and exposing them to poisons and high levels of nutrients. The report said port expansions within reef waters, which it noted could see 1.8 billion cubic feet of the ocean floor dug up, would have 'devastating impacts' on the natural wonder. The Great Barrier Reef is already popular, and often ranks as number one most appealing Australian attraction . The report prepared by the consultancy Dalberg Global Development Advisors said there was no need for coal port expansions along Queensland state's coast -where the reef is located - as the capacity at existing terminals was unused one-third of the time. 'These coal port expansions could increase the total coal port capacity of the region from 267 to 637 million tonnes per year', the report added. Australian authorities are very protective over the Reef. Last year,  Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, sent US President Barack Obama the 'facts' after he expressed fears it would not be there for future generations. It's hoped that combining technology with  science will help audiences understand more about the Reef . Obama voiced his worries that climate change threatened the natural wonder in a speech during the G20 summit in Brisbane. But Bishop said there was 'an issue' with his position and that he may have have overlooked Australia's commitment to preserving the coral structure which teems with marine life. She said the federal and state governments spent Aus$180 million (£105 million) a year preserving the reef. 'Australia knows better than anyone the importance of preserving the Great Barrier Reef,' the minister told Sky News.","Tourism Australia announced collaboration with the TV legend this week .

"George Osborne refused to commit to spending 2 per cent of UK national income on defence . George Osborne infuriated Tory MPs yesterday after he refused to commit to spending 2 per cent of Britain’s national income on defence – despite a steep rise in the foreign aid budget. The Chancellor dodged the question repeatedly during a post-Budget interview, even though there is growing pressure from politicians and military chiefs. Mr Osborne refused four times to guarantee that he would meet the 2 per cent target in the next Parliament, saying only: ‘We are promising to keep our country safe.’ Last night Tory MPs, who have been campaigning to have the commitment enshrined in the Tory party manifesto, were enraged by the Chancellor’s response given escalating tensions with Russia and the rise of Islamic State. They are particularly angry given that the Government has committed itself to spending at least 0.7 per cent of GDP – currently around £12billion a year – on foreign aid. Tory MP Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, said: ‘Defence of the realm is the first duty of government and in these very dangerous times it seems to be inexplicable that the Tory party is unable to commit to maintaining the defence budget at 2 per cent in accordance with the Nato commitment. ‘It doesn’t make sense, especially when we are just one miscalculation away from a possible European war.’ Tory MP Peter Bone echoed added: ‘Two per cent should be a commitment in the Conservative Party manifesto. It is a Nato target and we are now putting 0.7 per cent of national income into overseas aid. If you can do it for overseas aid then you can definitely do it for defence.’ The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that it would be impossible to meet such demands to protect defence spending without imposing huge cuts on other areas of spending such as policing, transport and energy – especially with health, schools and foreign aid already protected. Economist Soumaya Keynes said that unprotected departments are already facing real terms budget cuts averaging 9.4 per cent by 2020. Protecting defence spending at 2 per cent would mean that other departments would have to be slashed by 16.4 per cent. Yesterday Mr Osborne told Radio 4’s Today programme that the Tory party was ‘not proposing deeper cuts’ to defence spending. But he failed to say whether the party would commit to the Nato target of 2 per cent. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls (pictured with George Osborne) waded into row saying the Chancellor's desire to get an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts to police and defence forces in years . He said: ‘We are helping in Eastern Europe, training Ukrainian forces, our fighters are protecting the Baltic states, our military is doing a brilliant job in Sierra Leone, we are playing a global role.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls waded into the row yesterday, saying: ‘His (George Osborne’s) desire to get to an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts in the next three years to our police, our defence forces than we’ve seen in the last few years.’ David Cameron will give £20million to help former Communist countries fend off Russian aggression. The fund, drawn from the foreign aid budget, is based on a scheme set up by Margaret Thatcher to help Poland and Hungary move towards democracy after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Serbia, Moldova, Bosnia, Georgia and Ukraine all face Kremlin intimidation.","George Osborne dodged question four times during post-Budget interview .

While some of the dozens of songs on the service are free, most such as ‘Counting Stars’ and ‘The Gambler’ require payment of £0.80 ($0.99). Once a song is bought, it is stored in the user’s library and can be used as many times as they want. Zya also said they had plans to add more songs, with a target of 100 in the next few months. When a user loads up the app they are presented with a window to type messages in at the bottom, and a scrollable list of songs to choose from (left). After typing a message, a user can then preview what it will sound like with different songs before sending it over Facebook messenger (right) Forty different apps will be available on Messenger in the coming days, allowing users of the service to send each other sports clips and animations, Facebook said. Another feature will allow consumers to use Messenger to send a text message to make a restaurant reservation or to receive a notification that a product purchased online has shipped. The example of receiving a notification when a garage door is opened was demonstrated on-stage. ‘Everyone loves music, but making it has always divided people into two camps - those who can and those who can’t,’ the company said in a statement. ‘Ditty changes that by making the simple act of typing a musical experience.’ 'Ditty is a brand new experience that sings personal messages to the melody of famous songs and makes them shareable via Messenger. 'Users type in up to 70 characters, select a well-known track and Ditty generates a personalised lyric video to send to friends.' The release of Ditty follows news from the F8 Developer Conference in San Francisco, where Facebook announced its Messenger app would be opened to third party developers. Known as the Messenger Platform, it will allow developers to build new services into the app, which is used by 600 million users each month. Boss Mark Zuckerberg said it would give users 'more tools for expression'.

"A multi-million-pound office building just off Trafalgar Square has been taken over by anarchist squatters. Around 50 people are currently living in the former offices of the Institute of Directors on Pall Mall in central London after moving in on Friday night. The self-proclaimed 'Bourgeois Squatters' today vowed to stay put for 'as long as possible' in the building, not far from Buckingham Palace, which they targeted because it was originally opened by Tony Blair. Scroll down for video . Takeover: Squatters are living in this building on Pall Mall in central London, formerly home to the Institute of Directors . Window: The window is full of anarchist posters denouncing globalisation and the capitalist system . Inside: The interior of the empty office building now contains the squatters' personal belongings . They claim they are intending to highlight a 'housing crisis' in London - but insist that not all the squatters are political activists. Although they have already received a court summons, they ignored the document and did not attend the legal hearing. The property has ashtrays and drinks glasses strewn across the floor, while half-eaten in what appear to be Ocado and Co-op bags have been piled up in rooms. The anarchists say that they have not done any permanent damage to the building, designed by Scottish architect Alexander Peebles, apart from vandalising the plaque which records Mr Blair opening the premises in 2001. The building is currently on the market with estate agent Cluttons after being vacated several months ago by the IoD, which used it as an annexe to its main headquarters a few doors away. Food: Half-eaten meals in what appeared to be Ocado and Co-op bags were seen in a corner of the squat . Vandalised: This plaque recording the opening of the building by Tony Blair was defaced by the squatters . Posters: The Cluttons advert was defaced, while another poster showed the heads of Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and David Cameron on stakes . Hallway: A welcome table appeared to have been set up at the bottom of the stairs in the building . Mockery: One of the anti-capitalist messages painted on a poster in the window . One squatter, 28-year-old Dominic, who was previously jailed for assaulting a police officer during an anti-capitalist protester, said that the group intended to take care of the building. Referring to the mess on the floor, he said: 'We do clean up after ourselves every morning - we just haven't had the chance to do it yet. 'When we leave they will get the building back in pretty much the same condition in which we found it in. We respect the property.' He added: 'We call ourselves Bourgeois Squatters. We all have different views. Some are here to make a political point, but some are not. 'But the main point for us all is that there are million, even billion, pound properties standing empty and I think it is disgusting that these buildings are left empty when there is a housing crisis going on in London. Message: A protester known as Patrick writes out a sign to be put in the window . Cheery: One message simply said 'Have a nice day' in contrast to other more aggressive posters . Washing up: This morning the squatters claimed they had not yet had time to do the cleaning . Claim: The squatters say they have a legal right to be in the building and have ignored a court summons . Aggressive: Some posters declared 'Class war' and 'The working class strikes back' 'We have a wide range of people here - chefs, caterers, law and politics students, and even an aspiring model - with an age range from about 18 to 60.' Dominic claimed the building's link with Mr Blair was one reason the squatters moved in. 'We just saw it was empty and decided to take it,' he said. 'It is a massive building to be empty, and we could see that plaque through the door - the building was opened by Tony Blair who is a war criminal and has blood on his hands, so we decided to take it.' Some of the posters in the window proclaim an apparently violent message - one has a picture of Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg's heads on spike, with the words: 'The only cuts we want to see.' Another shows a picture of a cemetery captioned 'We have found new homes for the rich.' Defiance: One poster made a reference to the late anti-war protester Brian Haw, who lived in Parliament Square . Contraband: A police hat appeared to be hanging from a coathook in the office building . Celebration: A squatter draped in the Irish flag in an apparent homage to St Patrick's Day . The squatters say they will stay 'as long as possible', but do not yet know how long they will be able to remain. 'We took it on Friday and already by Sunday we had a notice asking us to go to court, but I don't think anybody went,' Dominic said. Although the property still has electricity and running water, the squatters insist they are not stealing the utilities. A spokesman for the IoD, which represents the interests of company directors, said that the institute has had no link to the property since moving out. He added: 'We don't mind a good strong, serious, debate - even if we don't agree with the squatters with a lot of things - and they are entitled to their opinion. 'We vacated this building six months ago, but there’s a chance there are some old Hayek or Adam Smith books left behind. Who knows, perhaps they’ll learn something.' The Metropolitan Police said they were unable to act unless they received a complaint from the landlord. A spokesman for Cluttons did not respond to a request for comment.","Squatters moved into former Institute of Directors building on Friday .

"Teachers at a college are holding emergency classes over Easter after students due to sit A-levels in a few weeks were taught the wrong syllabus. The health and social care course was taught at Solihull Sixth Form College in the West Midlands from September to 36 students whose university places depend on their grade. College bosses have apologised and written to the universities explaining the students are not to blame. The mishap, which was announced via a letter to parents, has outraged the families involved. Teachers at Solihull Sixth Form College, pictured, are holding emergency classes over Easter after health and social care students were taught the wrong syllabus . One mother, who did not wish to be named, said: 'This is a serious error and now they are expecting students to go into college to learn this extra work. 'Some students have booked to go away for Easter. 'They are asking students to forget everything they have learned for the past six months and learn something completely new. 'One student apparently ran out of the class in tears when they were told about this. This is their futures we are talking about. 'There is not enough time to learn a completely new unit of work.' College principal Paul Ashdown said: 'The college takes full responsibility for this mistake and is very sorry for any stress caused to students. 'We have written to all the students affected to apologise and reassure them that we will be working extremely hard to put this right. 'There is time to correct this and our health and social care teachers will be working over the Easter break to ensure students can catch up on the outstanding work. 'As well as delivering this additional teaching, we will also be contacting the universities that all the students affected have offers with. The college apologised for the blunder and reassured affected students . 'We think student success will not be affected, but we will be alerting universities nonetheless to ensure this is taken into account. 'Our focus is to ensure no student is penalised as a result of what has happened.' In the letter to parents, assistant principal Elizabeth Baker said: 'I am extremely sorry to inform you that a serious error has been made by our health and social care team. 'In their efforts to make a more rounded programme, the team chose a set of units which do not fit the examination board's regulations for this qualification and without remedial action none of the students will achieve their A level in health and social care. 'In order to complete the course, students need to complete a new unit. 'We are looking to use as much time as we can before the end of this term but will be seeking to use some time in the Easter holiday. 'We are also aware that many students have university places which are dependent on them achieving their predicted grades both from this qualification and others that they are studying alongside. 'We will write to the universities to explain the error that we have made and ask for them to take into consideration the upheaval and extra work needed to remedy the situation in the light of actual results achieved.' The mix-up follows controversy at the college in January, where it emerged mock exam candidates had been banned from going to the toilet alone amid fears they would use mobile phones to search for answers. Mr Ashdown admitted that decision was extreme but said it was made after students were caught cheating with phones during toilet breaks in last year's exams. The college caters for 2,140 students aged 16-18. It received a 'good' rating at its last Ofsted inspection in 2013.","Wrong syllabus taught at Solihull Sixth Form College in the West Midland .

"Workers at the U.S. government's Forest Service have been asked to use online tests to check whether they are secretly racist, or harboring other biases. The federal employees were asked to use work time to take tests, lasting some 15 minutes each, to see whether they have unconscious biases based on sexuality, nationalist, race and whether somebody is disabled. The practice was reported on by the Washington Times, which said the directive to take the Harvard quizzes came from Forest Management Director Bryan Rice. Test: Employees were asked to take assessments such as the above on race, where users alternate between sorting black and white people, then good and bad qualities. The speed with which they do it determined underlying bias, according to the study . He also reportedly asked bosses at other federal agencies to spread links to the Harvard tests, hosted at implicit.harvard.edu. Idea: Bryan Rice, pictured, sent the tests round to staff . The tests are a kind of word association game, which flashes up emotions or qualities such as 'happy', 'agony' and 'laughter', which users must sort into 'good' and 'bad' categories. These are then mixed with elements of the category being tested - for example the race test flashes up pictures of black and white faces. Participants complete several rounds of testing, first being instructed to associate all the 'good' words with one race, then the other. The more quickly and accurately they make each association - good or bad - the stronger their underlying bias is said to be. Rice asked his workers to take two tests each, and said they would be discussed in a later meeting. An unnamed congressional source suggested to the Washington Times that the tests are a waste of time, and the agency should focus on stopping forest fires. Defending himself, Rice said: 'The unconscious bias material can help us explore diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 'It was included in a discussion of diversity as part of a continuous series of collaborative discussions on a variety of topics we have on my staff that cover key Forest Service policies and values as a means of fostering continued awareness.' Federal agency: Rice urged leaders of departments other than his slice of the Forest Service to start using the tests .","Top manager of government service told workers to take Harvard tests .

"From America's Next Top Model to landing a starring role in a Diesel campaign, it seems that 2015 is the year of Winnie Harlow. The 19-year-old, who has vitiligo, a pigment condition that causes white patches to form on skin, is the star of a glamorous new shoot in Vienna - and she looks incredible. Posing in a flowing white dress with her hair styled into a voluminous blow-out, Winnie appears to be having the time of her life on set. Winnie Harlow, who was cruelly labelled 'cow' for having Michael Jackson's skin condition, is the star of a glamorous new shoot . In behind the scenes snaps, the clothes horse can be seen larking around with crew members and getting prepped in the make-up chair. Winnie, a former America's Next Top Model contestant, whose real name is Chantelle Brown-Young, was diagnosed with vitiligo around the age of four. Winnie, 19, has vitiligo, a pigment condition that causes white patches to form on skin . Posing in a flowing white dress, Winnie appears to be having the time of her life on set in Vienna . Winnie first spoke publicly about her skin condition in 2011 by posting a video to YouTube titled 'Vitiligo: A Skin Condition not a Life Changer' and now she's hugely in demand . She was cruelly nicknamed 'zebra' and 'cow' because of the white patches covering her face and body growing up. Michael Jackson famously had the same condition and explained his pale complexion was  a result of the lack of melanin in his skin. Now Winnie, who describes her self as a 'vitiligo spokesmodel' on Instagram, is being celebrated for her distinctive look. She has hundreds of thousands of followers on social media and she was recently invited back to her high school to do a motivational talk with students touching on the discrimination she faced. Winnie first spoke publicly about her skin condition in 2011 by posting a video to YouTube titled 'Vitiligo: A Skin Condition not a Life Changer'. Winnie, who describes her self as a 'vitiligo spokesmodel' on Instagram, is being celebrated for her distinctive look and was recently snapped up by Diesel . Winnie was cruelly nicknamed 'zebra' and 'cow' because of the white patches covering her face and body growing up but she's clearly having the time of her life now . In behind the scenes snaps, the clothes horse can be seen larking around with crew members . Michael Jackson famously had the same condition and explained his pale complexion was a result of the lack of melanin in his skin . Diesel is proving a point with its SS15 campaign, which aims to promote 'tolerance, equality and unconditional love' and stars the likes of Winnie Harlow, centre . Winnie, far right, was diagnosed with vitiligo around the age of four and said growing up she was cruelly nicknamed 'zebra' and 'cow' but she's launched a hugely successful career . Conceived by creative director Nicola Formichetti and styled by Anna Trevelyan, the new Diesel campaign aims to be provocative and optimistic, say the brand . Although then just 17, she eloquently told viewers: 'People have black skin, people have brown skin, I have both. 'When I got older, it got harder because when kids get older they get meaner, so I went through a lot of bullying and people calling me like zebra or cow so it was really hard growing up.' She said at certain points she was plagued with suicidal thoughts but found the strength to pull through. Moving from California to Canada with her family also provided the opportunity for a fresh start. After 'blossoming', Winnie said she found it strange when people started telling her how beautiful she was. 'I'll turn pink and say ""thank you so much,'"" the teenager giggled. Vitiligo occurs when the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that determines the color of skin, die or stop functioning. This causes slowly enlarging white patches of irregular shapes to appear on the skin over time. Vitiligo affects all races, but may be more noticeable in people with darker skin. The exact cause of the condition is unknown, although many experts believe that it is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys certain cells. There is no cure and the goal of treatment, which can include ointments and skin grafts, is to stop or slow the progression of pigment loss. She says that things have worked in her favour because she accepts her originality and has used it to her advantage. 'I loved myself. And with that, opportunities start to fall into my lap. And I thank God for all of them. Try loving yourself,' she concluded. As well as starring on America's Next Top Model, she walked in Ashish's catwalk show in London and starred in a SHOWStudio campaign. Her recent role in the new Diesel campaign is the latest string to her bow. Conceived by creative director Nicola Formichetti and styled by Anna Trevelyan, the campaign aims to be provocative and optimistic, inspiring people to live life in the moment and to enjoy the ride. Speaking about the campaign, which also stars alternative model Charlotte Free, Nicola said: 'There are so many crazy things happening now that you don’t see people just having fun any more. 'The challenge was to work with an avant-garde photographer, Nick Knight, and get him to do something he’s rarely done - which is shoot people smiling. 'It feels spontaneous, like they are selfies and he’s just the one snapping the photo.'

"A Russian stripper and lingerie model needed surgery after a manicurist she criticised filed her nails so short her fingers were left bleeding and swollen. Maria Lomovskikh, 20, visited a beauty salon to have her nails done, but told manicurist Anastasia Kretova she was disappointed about the quality of her work, calling it 'shoddy and unprofessional'.

'I was criticising the woman because she was using dirty nail files and wasn't disinfecting her instruments. 'But then she went mental, and I realised she had filed them with such ferocity that they were bleeding.' After going home to bandage her wounds in her home city of Voronezh, southern Russia, she eventually had to go to hospital where she was diagnosed with having acute purulent inflammation of two nails and had to have them removed. Igor Korotkiy, the head surgeon who carried out the operation, said that surgery was the only option because of the mutilation caused to the model's fingers. He added: 'The damage was so bad the only thing we could do was to take them off completely. It is difficult to say if they will ever grow again.'

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . A pair of suicide bombers detonated themselves near two churches in Lahore today, killing 15 and leaving nearly 80 people wounded. In the tense aftermath, an angry mob quickly turned violent, blocking a major highway, burning cars, ransacking a bus terminal and setting two people suspected of involvement in the attacks on fire. Twin blasts went off minutes apart at the Saint John Catholic church and Christ Church in the city's Youhanabad area on Sunday morning. Scroll down for video . Blasts outside two churches during Sunday services in Lahore has left 15 dead and at least 55 people injured . At least 14 people are dead and at least 80 others injured in the blasts, which went off minutes apart today . Pakistani Christians set fires in the aftermath of suicide attacks on churches in a Christian area of Lahore . An offshot of Pakistan's Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Pictured: Young Pakistanis take part in the protests today . A spokesman for the Punjab provincial government, Zaeem Qadri, condemned the attacks but said it was unfortunate the mob had killed the two suspects rather than turning them over to police. He added authorities are reinforcing security at the 481 remaining churches across the city. Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a Pakistani Taliban splinter group, claimed responsibility for the blasts and said it was the work of two suicide bombers. The Pakistani Taliban  vowed to continue their campaign for the enforcement of Sharia law. Area hospitals were flooded with casualties and scenes of mourning. Shaheen Bibi's 10-year-old son Abhishak was among those killed. Two police officers who were protecting the church were also killed in the explosions. 'My son had gone to the church to pray for a good result in his examinations,' Ms Bibi said as she cried. 'He wanted me to sew him some new clothes if he passed his examinations.' Christians took to the streets, setting fire to cars in a show of defiance in the country's second largest city . Pakistani Christians burn a cart in protest against attacks which targeted the churches at their peak period . One witness told Pakistan's Geo television that the main gate to one of the churches targeted was closed so people were using a smaller gate. 'One bomber exploded himself near that gate, that created chaos and during the course there was another blast,' he said. In the tense aftermath, the mood quickly turned violent. Local television footage showed an angry crowd beating a person they thought was connected to the attack, while others attacked buses in the city. The blasts, in a majority Christian suburb of the eastern city, went off in quick succession at a busy time when worshippers were attending Sunday morning prayers. Pastor David, a local cleric at the site, said: 'One blast took place at the entrance of one church where a congregation was going on. 'Another blast took place in the second church,' adding that the two buildings were 500 metres (1,600 feet) apart. Witnesses reported that quick action by a security guard prevented many more deaths - but the guard is also among those dead. Crowds gathered outside one of the churches hit in the suicide bombing and the mood quickly grew violent . Christians gathered to demand greater protection and grew violent after clashes with security services . Pakistani Christians chant slogans near the site of suicide bombing attack on two churches in Lahore . Violence in Lahore has been rising after the government's failed attempts to hold peace talks with the Taliban . Amir Masih told Reuters that he saw a man trying to enter the church, who then blew himself up. He said: 'I was sitting at a shop near the church when a blast jolted the area. 'I rushed towards the spot and saw the security guard scuffle with a man who was trying to enter the church, after failing, he blew himself up. 'I saw his body parts flying through the air.' Mr Masih said the security guard died in the blast, but did not know if the first blast was also a suicide bomber. Nabila Ghazanfar, a spokeswoman for the police, told AFP that a state of emergency has been imposed in the city's hospitals as the death toll was expected to rise. Meanwhile, hundreds of Christians took to the streets to protest against the police and the lack of proper security at the churches. Militants in Pakistan have attacked Christians and other religious minorities many times over the years. Much of the country is on edge after an attack on a Peshawar school in December last year killed 150 people - mostly students. Rescue workers transfer an injured man after the blast this morning, which left almost 80 people wounded . A state of emergency has been imposed in hospitals.

People rallied in protest at the lack of adequate security provided to churches in the majority Christian area . And in 2013, 80 people were killed and more than 100 others wounded after twin suicide attacks were carried out at the All Saint's Church in Peshawar, in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on the country's Christians. But Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, is generally considered peaceful. However, violence there has been increasing after the government's failed attempts to hold peace talks with the Taliban last year. After these failed, the military launched an offensive in the remote northwestern region of North Waziristan along the Afghan border to push the Taliban from the last major region they controlled. Lahore is the capital of Punjab, Pakistan's wealthiest and most populous province as well as the political heartland of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who criticised the attack. A statement carried by state media said: 'Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif ed the Lahore blasts and directed provincial governments to ensure the security of public and their properties.' Pope Francis also condemned the attacks, departing from his scripted remarks in his customary address today to decry the 'persecution' of Christians. He told crowds at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican that he prayed for peace in the country and that 'this persecution of Christians, and that the world tries to hide it, finishes'. 'These are Christian churches. Christians are persecuted, our brothers spill their blood simply because they are Christians,' he added.

"It's a piece of jewellery that symbolises a historic victory for one of NRL's most beloved teams. But the rare, custom made 2014 South Sydney Rabbitohs premiership ring has stumped Northern Territory police after it was found amidst a drug raid. Officers who conducted a search of suspected Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle gang member Anthony Orrell's home near Darwin last month, allege they found the ring alongside various illegal drugs. One of 73 custom made 2014 South Sydney Rabbitohs premiership rings was found by police during a drug raid in Darwin . Suspected Rebels Outlaw Motorcycle gang member Anthony Orrell's (left) and his housemate Asher De Rouffignac (right), lived in the home that was raided by police and will face drug possession charges later this year . The 31-year-old is understood to have denied that the ring was stolen and his lawyer told the Darwin Magistrates Court on Thursday that he would not be commenting on its origin, the ABC reports. Only 73 of the $8,000 2014 South Sydney Rabbitohs premiership rings were produced, 20 of which were presented to the team and its officials while club owner Russell Crowe bought the other 53, the ABC reports. A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that detectives had been in contact with NRL officials and the club to try and track down the owner of the ring. The NRL Integrity Unit is understood to have reported that all of the rings have been accounted for after the police request  was put forward, according to News Corp. Police allege they found him in the possession of a trafficable amount of methamphetamine, MDMA and steroids as well as a non-trafficable amount of cannabis in Mr Orrell's (pictured) home . Police have been left stumped as to who the owner of the ring is. Mr Orrell has denied that the ring was stolen and his lawyer told the Darwin Magistrates Court on Thursday that he would not be commenting on its origin . 'NT Police do not know who the ring belongs to or how it came to be in Darwin and are keen to return the ring to its owner who may be unaware even that the ring is missing,' police have said. One ring was reported missing after being lost in Sydney Harbour by player Dylan Walker, however a statement from police said, 'NT Police and their NSW counterparts are satisfied with the explanation given by the owner of that ring'. Mr Orwell plans to plead guilty to three charges relating to steroids, but will contest five other charges, according to the ABC. Twenty of the $8,000 2014 South Sydney Rabbitohs premiership rings that were produced were presented to the team and its officials . Club owner Russell Crowe bought the remainder, however only one has been reported missing and police have said they 'are satisfied with the explanation given by the owner of that ring' Police allege they found him in the possession of a trafficable amount of methamphetamine, MDMA and steroids as well as a non-trafficable amount of cannabis. His housemate, 26-year-old former model Asher De Rouffignac, will also fight the charges. She was also found in possession of a trafficable amount of methamphetamines. ‘All up 26.6 grams of methamphetamines, 11 grams of cannabis and 43mls of steroids were seized,' a police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

"Pedantic council bosses have ordered that a newly laid two-inch high edge to a bridleway be torn up - in case horses trip and fall over it. Buckinghamshire County Council officers have demanded that stud owner Emma Phillips rips up the new public horse footpath she paid for, after it deemed the granite edging to be a 'trip hazard to horses.' Ms Phillips, who paid £3,000 for the new bridleway at Quainton Stud,  in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, called the decision 'ridiculous'. Buckinghamshire County Council officers have demanded that stud owner Emma Phillips (right) rips up the new public horse footpath she paid for, after the council deemed the two inch high granite edging to be a 'trip hazard to horses' The bridleway was laid as part of a diversion order applied for by the Phillips family, as they wanted to correct an historic route error on maps of the farm dating back to the 1950s . She said: 'All they need to do to resolve this problem at no cost to the council is to certify the path, then everyone can move on and stop wasting time and money. 'They've been out on so many site visits, but they're digging their heels in. It's pathetic.' The bridleway was laid as part of a diversion order applied for by the Phillips family, as they wanted to correct an historic route error on maps of the farm dating back to the 1950s. Ms Phillips, who paid £3,000 for the new bridleway at Quainton Stud, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, called the decision 'ridiculous' Bucks County Council officials admitted they forgot to mention that particular section of bridleway in their diversion order. Ms Phillips said: 'The officials acknowledge they made a mistake and now want the order and path changed, so the blame lies with the council officials and not me.' British Horse Society access and bridleway officer Viv Lynch, added her support, saying: 'As a horse rider, I do not see their proposed changes as a problem. 'The access is good and will not provide a trip hazard for horses.' In response Lesley Clarke, county council cabinet member for planning and environment, said: 'The bridle gate Ms Phillips has built and the accompanying landscaping appear impressive and we know she has gone to some considerable effort and expense over this. 'However, these works and others were not agreed with the rights of way officers and, as a result, there are some major practical problems that have to be overcome. 'The county council, and in effect the taxpayer, will be responsible for maintaining this bridleway and we have a legal and moral responsibility and a duty of care to ensure it is totally safe before we can allow it, so to avoid it becoming a maintenance liability on the council in future years. 'I am sure we can work out an amicable compromise that will suit everyone and I have asked my officers to keep me closely apprised of the progress.'","Emma Phillips paid £3,000 for new bridleway at Quainton Stud, Aylesbury .

"Prince Charles is considering adding to his already impressive property portfolio . He is renowned for his fearless passion for preserving historic property for the nation. And with the keys to nearly a thousand bedrooms and more than 250 bathrooms – not to mention acres of gardens, forest and moorland – you might think Prince Charles had quite enough property on his plate. But now he is planning to acquire more – he is considering buying the 123-room, 16th Century Port Eliot House in Cornwall from the eccentric Earl of St Germans for a reported £10 million. Charles’s official residences are Highgrove, Clarence House, Llwynywermod and Birkhall. However, his property empire includes two ancient farmhouses in Transylvania – where his neighbours include wolves, lynxes and brown bears; more than 25 holiday cottages in the Scilly Isles, Wales and Cornwall; the 23,000-seat Oval cricket ground in London and half of Dartmoor, including its prison. And that, it seems, is just the tip of the iceberg. Of course, the properties do not technically belong to Charles, being owned by either the Queen, one of his charitable foundations, or the Duchy of Cornwall which has properties worth £763 million spread across 131,000 acres and 23 counties. But it does provide the Prince of Wales with a ‘salary’ which rose to a record £19 million last year. It’s also seen as something of a trust fund for Prince William, though Charles has voluntarily paid tax on the Duchy income – £3.4 million in 2013 – for the past 20 years. His property buying has at times raised eyebrows. While he has made canny conservation purchases, he has also spent wildly – such as when he urged his charitable foundation to borrow £20 million to help secure 18th Century Dumfries House after a deal to sell the 2,000-acre property to the Scottish National Trust fell through. Charles heard about the dilemma at a dinner at Windsor Castle and was so dismayed at the thought of the house and its Chippendale furniture going under the hammer after a local charity failed to raise more than half the purchase price that he offered to ‘make up the difference’. He did. Though he had never visited the property. Financiers warned it could prove a ‘financial banana skin’. But the loan has since been paid off and the Prince seems ready for more deals. Here we offer a glimpse into his extraordinary property empire.","Prince Charles is considering adding to his already impressive portfolio .

"David Cameron was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell-by date on his premiership yesterday as senior Tories accused him of trying to anoint George Osborne as his successor. Downing Street was struggling to contain the fallout from the Prime Minister’s extraordinary announcement that May’s general election will be his last. Friends dismissed rumours that Mr Cameron’s wife, Samantha, had asked him to make clear he would not seek a third term if re-elected, while Mr Cameron insisted he had simply given a ‘straight answer to a straight question’ and that most people would think that was a ‘sensible’ thing to do. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell-by date on his premiership yesterday as senior Tories accused him of trying to anoint George Osborne as his successor . As Labour accused him of ‘arrogance’ for discussing a third election before he wins a second, he insisted he was ‘taking absolutely nothing for granted’. ‘My entire focus is on the next 44 days and the general election that will decide which team runs the country for the next five years,’ Mr Cameron said. But senior MPs warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in No 10. It came as Mr Cameron was reminded of his comments to Tony Blair when the former premier announced he was handing over the reins to then-Chancellor Gordon Brown mid-term. ‘Your authority is draining away,’ he told Mr Blair in the Commons in January 2007. ‘The Government can’t plan. Ministers are treading water. They are all waiting for the Chancellor and not listening to you.’ One former shadow minister said that by indicating he will depart in the next Parliament, Mr Cameron appeared to be seeking to head off moves to oust him on May 8 if he falls short of a Commons majority and tries to lead another coalition or a minority government. David Cameron has revealed he will stand down as Prime Minister before 2020 if he wins the next election . Senior MPs warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in No 10. Pictured: David Cameron visits a butchers in his Oxfordshire constituency . ‘He may think it will be harder for the men in the grey suits to come knocking when he has said he won’t be going on and on,’ the MP said. ‘The truth is he won’t last five minutes, let alone five years, if he loses again.’ There was particular consternation that Mr Cameron effectively fired the starting gun on a leadership contest by naming three potential successors: Home Secretary Theresa May, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Mr Osborne, the Chancellor. Mrs May and Mr Johnson have long been seen the leading rivals to be the next Tory leader, but Mr Cameron sparked frenzied speculation at Westminster by including his name of Mr Osborne, his closest ally. Since his unpopular Budget of 2012, Mr Osborne’s leadership prospects have been discounted by many. Boris Johnson . Boris Johnson is the favourite among voters to succeed David Cameron, a poll reveals today. But the London Mayor repeatedly refused to say whether he would join a leadership contest. Chancellor George Osborne is thought to be the Prime Minister’s preference to be his successor. But in a ComRes survey for the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson was backed by 31 per cent of voters, ahead of Theresa May on 17 per cent and Mr Osborne on 12 per cent. Support for the Mayor among Tory voters was particularly strong – 36 per cent said he would make the best prime minister, Mr Osborne was on 25 per cent and Mrs May on 18 per cent. Mr Johnson’s strongest backing was among Ukip supporters, at 44 per cent – suggesting he would do the best job of regaining support from the Eurosceptic party. He was also backed by 32 per cent of Labour voters, ahead of Mrs May on 19 per cent, and the Chancellor on 7 per cent. But in an LBC Radio interview yesterday, Mr Johnson dodged questions about his ambitions more than a dozen times. He is bidding to return as an MP in May in the safe seat of Uxbridge, but claimed Mr Cameron’s intervention was ‘no big deal’. ‘All he’s saying is I think obvious and common sense … he doesn’t want to go on and on and on like Mrs Thatcher,’ the Mayor said. ‘To say he’s arrogant or presumptuous to rule [out] a third term seems to be totally bizarre because actually he’s being rather humble and rather straightforward and telling it like it is.’ Asked repeatedly if he would go for the party leadership, Mr Johnson said: ‘I can’t possibly answer that because it’s a long way off. We probably don’t even know the identity of the next leader … It is some baby, unborn.’ Mr Osborne praised Mr Cameron for giving ‘a direct answer’. Mrs May is yet to comment. But the recent turnaround in his popularity as the economy improves has led many MPs to reconsider. Polls suggest Mr Osborne has become the most popular Conservative Treasury spokesman since Nigel Lawson in 1987. ‘Cameron has propelled George Osborne into the top three, quite deliberately,’ said one senior MP. ‘Whether that helps George or not remains to be seen.’ Another former minister said: ‘It’s not what he has said about timing – it’s the list of names. The Parliamentary party doesn’t really want any of them. Theresa May is a cold loner with a following of about two. George has been a good Chancellor of the Exchequer, but people resent his coterie of apparatchiks and think he is ultimately unelectable. Boris is another Bullingdon Club boy who ignored Parliament when he was last in it and lots of people think would be too risky.’ MPs also questioned how Mr Cameron could promise to serve a ‘full second term’ when a new leader would need at least six months to establish themselves before the 2020 election. Some allies of the Prime Minister, however, suggest he could step down as party leader, allowing a contest to take place some months before, while remaining Prime Minister right up until polling day. While this would be unprecedented in modern British political history, it would mirror the American system, where a president serves a fixed second term. Former Tory minister Michael Portillo described Mr Cameron’s announcement as ‘bizarre’. He told the BBC: ‘When you play chess you have to consider the next two moves, and I don’t think he did. There is no point setting off on this wild goose chase in the middle of an election campaign.’ But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon defended the Prime Minister. ‘He made very clear he is standing for a full second term. What happens in 2020 really, I think, doesn’t bother a lot of people,’ he said. ‘If he had said exactly the opposite – that he wanted to go on and on and he wasn’t prepared to answer the question when he was likely to finish – you’d have accused him, quite rightly, of arrogance and wanting term after term.’ A snap poll by ComRes for the Daily Mail found voters are divided over Mr Cameron’s announcement. Some 70 per cent believe Mr Cameron was ‘just being honest’, while 80 per cent say ten years is long enough for any Prime Minister to achieve their plans. Four in ten said he had made himself a lame duck, but the majority – 59 per cent – disagreed. However, 70 per cent said he should be focusing on voters rather than his own job. Four in ten think the next government would be destabilised by a Tory leadership election.","David Cameron said earlier this week that he would not bid for a third term .

"A former jihadi who fought for ISIS in Syria and Iraq has revealed that he left the depraved terror group after being ordered to execute his friends and take part in the rape of Yazidi sex slaves. The 33-year-old ex-militant, who comes from the ISIS-held city of Fallujah, spoke of becoming disillusioned with jihad after seeing his commanders turn into bloodthirsty, sex-mad savages. Senior militants are said to take advantage of thousands of young foreign schoolgirls travelling to join the terror group by exploiting a legal loophole allowing them to sign a one-week marriage contract before  divorcing them and passing them on another fighter. But for Hamza, who recently managed to escape his ISIS commanders in Iraq, the final straw was his shock at the terror group's unquenchable thirst for brutal executions and his disgust at the militants' treatment of young Yazidi women who are bought, sold and  viciously raped as sex slaves. Militants: Hamza revealed that Islamic State terrorists brainwash fighters (pictured) into spending all their spare time reading the Koran  by offering cash prizes to those with the greatest religious knowledge . Horror: A young Iraqi Yazidi girl who narrowly avoided being captured by ISIS and forced in to sex slavery is pictured holding a baby. Hamza said he was invited to rape several such young women by his commanders . Speaking of his time with the terror group, Hamza told The Independent's Patrick Cockburn that he was paid 400,000 Iraqi dinars a month (equivalent to £231) - but was also rewarded with free food, fuel and access to the internet. Fighters are  brainwashed into spending all their spare time attending religious lectures and reading the Koran and ISIS ' jihadi propaganda by offering cash prizes to those with the greatest knowledge at regular competitions. He claimed that after his home city was overrun by militants, he had little choice but to join ISIS, who quickly sent him to a training camp in their de facto Syrian capital Raqqa before forcing him to take a crash course in becoming an ISIS executioner. After being forced to watch countless videos of brutal beheadings, the former militant was ordered to carry out the execution of a number of local Sunni men accused of working with the government. Recognising a number of the men as his former friends, Hamza refused to carry out the atrocity. His superiors surprisingly granted him permission to avoid the beheadings but he was warned he wouldn't be excused from similar work in the future. Brutal: Ex-militant Hamza said he was shocked at the terror group's unquenchable thirst for  executions . An eight strong volunteer unit of former British servicemen are preparing to travel to Syria to fight against militants from the Islamic State terrorist organisation, it has been claimed. The ex-soldiers - some of whom have Special Forces training - call themselves the International Volunteer Force and will fight alongside the Kurdish resistance  in the north of the country. Images posted on social media purportedly show the men taking part in special training exercises in Europe. They were taken ahead of their journey to Syria, where they join an estimated 100 other Western volunteers to have joined the Kurdish peshmerga and YPG armies in the fight against ISIS terrorists. Shortly after avoiding beheading his former friends, Hamza realised his future life as an ISIS executioner was not something he wanted. Those feelings were compounded when last December 13 kidnapped Yazidi girls were brought to the property where he was staying and he was invited to rape them. 'The commander tried to tempt us by saying that this is Halal [lawful] for you, a gift from Allah that we are allowed to satisfy ourselves without even marrying them because they are pagans,' he said. 'These scenes terrified me. I imagined myself being caught up in these shootings, executions, beheadings and raping, if I stayed where I was,' he added. Shortly afterwards Hamza plotted his escape from ISIS, despite a friend having been caught and brutally executed for doing the same thing. Using the instant messaging service Viber, Hamza contacted friends outside ISIS' self-declared caliphate before being granted permission to call his family on a mobile as a reward for his perceived 'loyalty and courage'.  He then used the phone to arrange his escape, . Hamza claims he is now entirely disillusioned with Isis, saying: 'At the beginning I thought they were fighting for Allah, but later I discovered they are far from the principles of Islam.' 'I know that some fighters were taking hallucinatory drugs; others were obsessed with sex. As for the raping, and the way different men marry by turn the same woman over a period of time, this is not humane,' he added.","Ex-militant named Hamza escaped Islamic State terrorists earlier this year .

"Terrified passengers began to 'bleed from their noses and mouths' after a plane suffered an engine failure and suddenly plunged in the skies over China, according to reports. The mid-air drama unfolded on Orient Thai Airlines flight OX682, which was forced to abort its journey from Thailand to China and make an emergency landing. By the time the captain regained control of the plane it had plunged so fast that many passengers were in need of medical attention and the oxygen masks had dropped from the ceiling. Oriental Thai Airlines flight OX682 was carrying holidaymakers from Phuket, Thailand to Chengdu, China . Passengers said the plane plummeted thousands of feet after one of its engines failed . Passenger Lixue Ku, 47, said people were screaming and crying, and they feared the plane would break apart in the sky or crash. ‘I kept thinking about that plane crash in France and I was convinced we were going to go the same way, but then the plane evened out. ‘People were still crying though, everyone was in shock, even the staff.’ The plane was carrying dozens of Chinese holidaymakers from the Thai island of Phuket to the city of Chengdu, in south-west China. A passenger said people were screaming and crying, and they feared the plane would break apart in the sky . The flight crew decided to abandon their journey to Chengdu and make an unscheduled stop in Kunming . Passengers said one of the engines had malfunctioned and people on board suffered ear congestion or nose bleeds, or fainted due to the sudden loss of altitude. Oxygen masks were deployed, with the situation shocking even the flight attendants into tears, according to the passengers. The flight crew decided to cut the two-hour journey short and land at an airport in Kunming, the capital of south-western China’s Yunnan province. Many passengers transferred to another flight to complete the trip to Chengdu, while doctors advised others against flying immediately because of their medical conditions.

"Teachers may soon be able to lecture pupils, view their work and help them with any problems without ever stepping foot in the classroom. A school in Columbus Ohio has introduced a new robo-teacher into its classrooms to allow staff in other parts of the country to teach their pupils. The 4ft (1.2 metre) tall robot features a screen that broadcasts a video of the teacher's face  and a camera allows the teacher to see what is going on in the classroom. Scroll down for video . A school in Columbus Ohio has introduced a new robo-teacher into its classrooms to allow staff in other parts of the country to teach their pupils. The 4ft (1.2 metre) tall robot features a screen that broadcasts a video of the teacher's face and a camera allows the teacher to see what is going on in the classroom . Thomas Fetch, a social studies teacher at Nexus Academy of Columbus is one of the first to trial the robot, controlling it from his computer more than 1,600 miles (2,570km) away in Arizona. In the past the school has had to rely upon video calling and conference call style lessons for its remote teachers. British academics have helped develop a robot, which is both a home help and a friend to older people who may be ill, trapped and alone. The Care-O-bot 3 is much more like a utilitarian household appliance than the action figures that featured in the futuristic film iRobot, starring Will Smith. And she - or he - is more likely to offer a Karaoke sing along and make a cup of coffee than go on a murderous rampage - or at least that is the idea. The robot is the result of a collaboration between British and European academics under the umbrella of Accompany - Acceptable Robotics Companions for Ageing Years. The hope is that it will help older people to stay in their homes and live an independent life, rather than being moved miles away from friends and family into an expensive care home. With the help of the $6,000 (£4,000) Telepresence robot, however, Mr Fetch can trundle between the desks and look at pupils work as they are doing it. Speaking to the Hechingerreport.org, Mr Fetch said: 'I like driving it around and feeling like I am in the school. It’s neat to feel like I am part of the classroom. 'I was so far away, but with the help of this body I could walk around the building.' With robots increasingly being developed for use in healthcare, care homes and around the house, it was only a matter of time before they arrived in schools. The Nexus Academy of Columbus is part of a network of seven schools in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana that uses a mix of in-school teachers and remote teachers to hold lessons. Each of the schools now have one robot. However, Mr Fetch said there can be the odd technical hiccup - with the robot occasionally driving into doors and walls. He blamed this on the depth perception and peripheral vision of the robot not being 'that great.' It means that misbehaving pupils who might normally have been caught red handed out of the corner of the teacher's eye can possibly get away with it now. The robot could be a forerunner of schools of the future, rather like this scene from the cartoon the Jetsons . The robotic teachers do encounter the odd problem as the vision isn't great meaning they do drive into walls. The school's 120 pupils have reacted well to their robot teachers and said that being able to see the teacher's face in the classroom and being able to interact made the lessons feel more personal . According to Hechingerreport.org, who went to see the robots in action, the schools 120 pupils have reacted well to their robot teachers. They said that being able to see the teacher's face in the classroom and being able to interact made the lessons feel more personal. Thomas Hatch, one of the pupils at the school said: 'It sort of grew on me. 'Seeing the teacher’s face, and they would be there, showing up in the room – it felt more personal than the just a screen.' The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair (pictured) or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example . A recent report by management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group predicted by 2025 the number of 'automatable' tasks will rise to 25 per cent. This will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in Japan. Earlier this week Riken-SRK Collaboration Centre for Human-Interactive Robot Research in Nagoya, Japan unveiled its latest Robear. The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor-level bed to a bath. It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms. And at the start of the month, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it will begin employing a humanoid called Nao in its branches from April, on a trial basis. And if the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020. Elsewhere, in China there is a hotel manned entirely by robots. From reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters, the Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen, China, has built, rather than hired, new employees. Start-up costs and robot maintenance aside, staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night's stay costs just £6.80 per night. According to Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a research fellow in UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies,  care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings within the next 50 years. Her research suggests human workers across a plethora of service sectors and caring professions could be replaced by droids within our lifetimes. She believes that as the rapid advances in technology achieved this century are projected to continue at an astonishing rate, this will allow robots to break free of science fiction and establish themselves in our everyday life. According to her research - which polled 2,000 people about which jobs they thought were most unpopular and could be among the first to be given to robots for the TC channel Syfy - traffic wardens (65 per cent), estate agents (40 per cent) and car salesman (33 per cent) could soon be lost to history.","Teachers at The Nexus Academy of Columbus, Ohio, control 4ft tall robot .

"The saying 'always the bridesmaid, never the bride' has certainly not rung true for one 35-year-old mother-of-two. Lynsey Littlefield has been a bridesmaid an astonishing seven times - and tied the knot herself in 2007. The in-demand bridesmaid from Brighton, East Sussex, has been part of a wedding party so often she has joked about advertising her services as a 'bridesmaid for hire'. The start: Lynsey Littlefield pictured the first time she was a bridesmaid in 2000 at her brother's wedding . But helping so many friends and family plan their hen parties and wedding days has come at a cost - she's spent a total of £7,000 attending other people's weddings over the past 14 years, an average of around £400 a year. Each time she's walked with a friend or relative down the aisle she's been at a different stage in her own love life. She's been a 20-something single bridesmaid, an engaged bridesmaid, a married bridesmaid, and a pregnant bridesmaid over the years. Lynsey, who married Daniel, 40, in Ibiza in 2007, said all her experiences have made her one of the best bridesmaids to have. Speaking to celebrate National Bridesmaids' Day today, Lynsey said: 'I feel that as a bridesmaid you definitely evolve and become better at it. Now I am thinking I might hire my services out. 'Each time I help organise the hen party from an 80s'-themed hen do to a Strictly Come Dancing party. I'm an expert. 2005 was a busy year: Lynsey was a bridesmaid at her sister's wedding, left, and for close friend, Nicky, right . 'The average cost of each hen party I have organised is £290 – for food, entertainment and extras. 'I worked out I had spent around £5,080 over the years attending hen parties – not including my own. 'Then there is the cost of the weddings. For each one I spend about £50 on the present, £70 on an outfit, £150 on travel and accommodation and if there is a paying bar an extra £50. I would say I spend around £200 per wedding. 'But I don't mind. I have to budget but I love watching people get married.' Lynsey was first asked to be bridesmaid in 2000 when she celebrated her brother Gary's marriage to Isabel. She recalls: 'I was honoured when I was asked by Gary and his then-fiancee Isabel to be a bridesmaid,' she said. 'I didn't know it was just the start. Lynsey pictured walking down the aisle when she tied the knot herself in Ibiza in 2007 . Lynsey had practise at planning weddings by the time she married, Daniel, pictured . 'I had no idea what to do as I hadn't been to many weddings. The wedding was lovely and the bridesmaid dresses were gorgeous. 'I was really surprised at how daunting I found walking down the aisle. I loved the party afterwards. 'Isabel's hen party was the first hen party I had ever been on, too. But not the last.' In 2005, she was a bridesmaid on two occasions - for her friend Nicky and then her twin sister Claire. Lynsey, left, with another bridesmaid at her friend Kate's wedding to Jon in 2008 . She said: '2005 was a big year as my twin sister was getting married and one of my closest friends Nicky married too. 'I was so happy for them. Claire and her fiance Rob had been together since she was 17 and were a perfect match. 'Nicky had also been with her fiance Ollie since she was 17 and it was so lovely as I had known her through the whole of their romance. Lynsey was pregnant in 2009 when she was a bridesmaid for her friend Helen . 'I was overjoyed when she announced her engagement and then asked me to be her bridesmaid. 'Both my sister and Nicky had a hen weekend abroad and then in the UK – so there was a lot of planning on my part.' She had her own wedding in 2007 - with two bridesmaids. She was then a bridesmaid for friend Kate, who was a mother-of-two in 2008 when she married Jon. 'Kate and Jon had two boys so the morning of the wedding was very different to my past bridesmaid experiences – it involved helping Kate but also entertaining two lads,' Lynsey said. Her friend Helen's wedding followed in 2009 when Lynsey was pregnant. She said: 'In 2009 my best friend Helen announced she would be getting married. I was overjoyed but also slightly worried as I was pregnant. 'I was going to be a huge bridesmaid. I felt like I ran down the aisle and cried loads. But it was nice to be sober at a wedding.' 'Then In 2010 my oldest friend Hannah asked me to be her bridesmaid. I hadn't long given birth so wasn't feeling in the best shape. 'I was a new mum so also adapting to motherhood. 'Nevertheless I took my role very seriously and attended dress shopping visits, there were quite a lot, and also organised a great hen weekend. 'I was a really calm bridesmaid this time.'

"Nigel Farage yesterday accused anti-Ukip protesters of chasing his terrified family out of a country pub – and branded them ‘scum’. He said his two daughters ran away in fear after being targeted by an 80-strong fancy dress ‘mob’ who described themselves as ‘migrants, HIV activists, gay people, disabled people and breastfeeding mums’. The bizarre protest featured several women and men clutching dolls to their chests in an apparent reference to the Ukip leader’s comments that nursing mothers should ‘sit in the corner’. Scroll down for videos . Nigel Farage has branded anti-Ukip protesters 'scum' after they stormed a pub where he was having a family lunch and 'chased his car down the road' The party leader was dining with his wife and two younger children at the Queen's Head in Downe, Kent, when the incident took place. He claimed his two youngest children were so scared by the protesters that they ran away and hid . Mr Farage said his daughters, Victoria, 15, and ten-year-old Isabelle were missing for a short time yesterday afternoon before the police returned them to the family home. After hounding him out of the Queen’s Head in Downe, Kent, protesters surrounded his car, kicking it and jumping on his bonnet as his wife, Kirsten, tried to drive him away. The Ukip leader later told the Mail: ‘We were having a pleasant Sunday and then suddenly the mob descended. There was various screaming, shouting and intimidation. ‘My children ran away and hid. The landlord called the police who came quickly and later brought them back to my home. They also attacked my car as my wife drove me off.’ He added: ‘I’m used to this – it happens every day. But I am utterly appalled by these disgusting people for bringing my family into it. It was an unpleasant ordeal for them.These people are scum.’ The protest’s organisers denied Mr Farage’s children were scared and ran away. Pictures posted on Twitter as Mrs Farage tried to drive off showed a woman lying on the car bonnet as others banged the roof and windows. Neighbour Sheila Jenkins, 76, said she heard ‘chanting’ outside her house and looked out of the window to see demonstrators in fancy dress. Demonstrators had previously descended on the George & Dragon, where Mr Farage has previously been pictured having a drink, before realising he was in the other pub nearby . The group was in fancy dress and included migrants, HIV activists, gay people, disabled people and breastfeeding mothers . She said: ‘There were lots of them and I saw a big placard saying “Ukip not in my backyard”. There was a man dressed as an Arab, with big dark glasses and a turban, and one with a big beard in a blonde lady’s wig. I don’t know what they were trying to prove.’ Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said he stepped out to see what the commotion was. ‘They were singing “We are family” and then I saw someone trying to stop a car getting through,’ he said. ‘Someone kicked the back of the car as it went past. I think they went a bit too far.’ Photos taken in the pub showed demonstrators apparently holding a ‘Muslim call to prayer’ and organising ‘Polish language lessons’. Protester Chris Baugh, assistant general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, boasted on Twitter: ‘I just chased Farage from his local, few others with us & very funny. Solidarity.’ Customer James Beer, owner of a web design company, tweeted: ‘Just saw Nigel Farage being hounded out of a pub I was in by fancy dressed protesters harassing him and kicking his car in. Priceless.’ Staff at the Queen's Head refused to comment on the episode, while the George & Dragon said protesters had initially claimed they were there for a birthday party . The party leader was dining with his wife and two younger children at the Queen's Head in Downe, Kent, when the incident took place. He is pictured at the pub last June . But many were shocked, even those who oppose Ukip. Kevin Maguire, a left-wing columnist, tweeted: ‘No fan of Ukip and also no fan of hounding people out of pubs, frightening kids and jumping on cars.’ Dan Glass, another of the protest leaders, denied Mr Farage’s children had been scared off, saying: ‘He was sitting on his own and left on his own. We didn’t see any kids.’ The organisers later released a statement attributed to ‘photographer’ Mike Kear. It said: ‘As some protesters and the press entered the rear of the pub, I saw a blonde haired woman leaving with two children. At no time were any children seen to be scared or running away. Could this be that Farage is manipulating the truth for his own ends?’ Ukip is understood to have requested taxpayer-funded security for Mr Farage during the election campaign amid fears that he is regularly being targeted by protesters.","Party leader was with wife and two children at Queen's Head in Downe .

"You may have experienced the eye-watering pain of an ingrown toenails, but imagine if you weighed 15,000 lbs (7,000 kg). Scientists are working to prevent painful and potentially deadly foot diseases in captive elephants by finding the best way to trim their feet. Wild elephants benefit from walking long distances on different surfaces and rubbing their feet in abrasive dirt, but their captive peers can experience problems without these ‘natural pedicures’. Scroll down for video . Scientists are working to prevent painful and potentially deadly foot diseases in captive elephants by finding the best way to trim their feet (a stock image is shown) Captive elephants’ feet are routinely trimmed to counter the effects of walking on unnatural ground in restricted spaces, but experts are trying to perfect the most functional pachyderm pedicure. Dr Olga Panagiotopoulou, from the University of Queensland’s School of Biomedical Sciences, is working with collaborators around the world to understand how captivity influences elephant foot form and function, as well as identifying the best method of preventative foot trimming. ‘Elephants are the largest terrestrial mammals alive today and can weigh up to eight tonnes, with their whole body mass supported by their tiny feet,’ Dr Panagiotopoulou said. Wild elephants (a stock image is shown) benefit from walking long distances on various surfaces and rubbing their feet in dirt, but their captive peers can experience problems without these ‘natural pedicures’ Pressure plates were  transported to the Adventures with Elephants safari park in South Africa (pictured) to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains . ‘We know that when these large animals walk, a huge amount of pressure is applied to their feet. Earlier this month, researchers found that elephants excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. Three elephants passed smell tests conducted on a game reserve in South Africa. Sniffing at buckets, they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of TNT by raising a front leg. The elephants detected TNT samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets, according to Ashadee Kay Miller, a zoology student at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. They only got this wrong 3.6 per cent of the time over 502 buckets that contained the explosive, which was dissolved in acetone on filter paper. In a second set of tests, the elephants scored 100 percent, detecting TNT in 23 out of 23 buckets when ‘distractor odours’ such as tea, bleach, soap and gasoline were placed in the other buckets, she said. It's been suggested that unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant, which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives. ‘Preliminary data has indicated that foot pressure is more evenly distributed across the sole of the foot when the animals walk on natural grounds, but when they are walking on surfaces such as concrete the pressure is concentrated around parts of the foot that are more prone to disease, such as the lateral toes.’ She said that while a range of foot-trimming procedures are followed and typically involve filing the nails and rough skin, none have been tested. Elephants' toenails typically grow between five and seven millimetetres a month. ‘Our research involves testing different techniques to see which one will be most beneficial for the animal,’ Dr Panagiotopoulou said. Working with Zebris Biomechanix in Germany, she has developed pressure platforms to measure the pressure and forces applied to elephants’ feet while they are walking. ‘The plates were recently transported to the Adventures with Elephants safari park in South Africa to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains,’ she said. ‘The elephants were trained to walk over the pressure platforms and the individual footsteps were processed using a state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique called statistical parametric mapping, which, in simple words, gives us a high-resolution image of foot pressure changes over the foot. ‘We hope to develop smaller versions of these pressure platforms for zoo keepers and managers to use as diagnostic tools. ‘If a captive elephant walks over a pad and a different digital pressure pattern from normal is seen, this can be investigated further.’ Dr Panagiotopoulou said that early diagnosis is important because elephant foot diseases such as osteoarthritis and osteomyelitis are often diagnosed too late for treatment, meaning elephants have to be euthanized.

"Inhaling the delicate bouquet of a glass of wine can leave most of us at a loss for words to describe what we are smelling. But it turns out it may be our language that is hampering our sense of smell. Scientists have found that English speakers struggle to identify and describe odours compared to other languages. I'm getting blackberries and thistles: The English language is not the best for describing odours say scientists . Researchers found those who use English as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour. However, native speakers from the Jahai tribe in Perak, Malaysia, described odours far more consistently and in less time than they can a colour. Looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant, scientists have found. Researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free. The scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese. Surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher BMI themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating. This suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat. The Jahai have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the Maniq, a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern Thailand, have 15 words. These abstract words describe smells in the same way as we use blue, red and yellow to describe colours. The findings suggest English speakers appear to have lost the ability to accurately describe smells. Professor Asifa Majid, who led the work at the centre for language studies at Radboud University in Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, said: 'Our findings show that the long-held assumption that people are bad at naming smells is not universally true. 'Odours are expressible in language, as long as you speak the right language.' Professor Majid has found that the English language has few specific words that are capable of describing smells. One of the few that is used is the term 'musty', which describes a stuffy and dusty odour of an old book or room that has been unused for a long time. Most of the time English speakers have to rely upon the source of the smell as a description - using words like fruity or lemon. In a study published in the journal Cognition, Professor Majid asked 10 American English speakers and 10 native speakers of the Jahai to describe colours and odours. They were presented with 12 odours, including cinnamon, turpentine, lemon, smoke, chocolate, rose, onion and gasoline, and 80 different colours. They found that when describing the odours, there was little agreement among English speakers when describing the odours. The Jahai use 12 abstract words to describe odours (shown, left) in the same way they do colours (right) In many western societies, smell has become a largely under-used sense. In many cases odours have become something undesirable and to be avoided, according to Professor Majid (picture posed by a model) They also used far longer descriptions when identifying the smells. For example when presented with a cinnamon odour, English speakers described it as spicy, sweet, candy, smoky, wine and pot pourri. However, the Jahai were found to use a series of succinct terms to describe the smells, such words that mean to 'smell edible' and 'to have a bloody smell that attracts tigers'. These works were predominantly abstract words, much like those they used for colour. However, while abstract words were dominant among the English speakers when describing colour, they used source based descriptions. In a later study in the journal of Cognition, Professor Majid and her colleagues looked at the language of the Maniq, a 300 strong nomadic tribe in southern Thailand, and found they use words for smell that have complex meanings. They wrote: 'Smell is particularly important in the lives of the Maniq, and lies at the core of the indigenous ideology. The table above shows the specific abstract words used by the Maniq tribes to describe different odours . 'The Maniq surround themselves with odors believed to be beneficial for health and that repel danger. They stay constantly alert for potentially harmful odors. 'The Maniq system is remarkable because there are dedicated terms for olfaction and these are part of everyday talk. Western languages simply lack this. When describing smells, English speakers, for example, most often resort to source-descriptors, such as like a banana or fruity, but even these descriptors are not applied accurately.' It is unclear exactly why English speakers have lost the ability to describe smells accurately, but vision has become the predominant sense in almost all human cultures. In a recent study published in the journal of Cognitive Linguistics, Professor Majid and her colleagues found that English speakers use specific words for vision and hearing but have few for the other senses like touch, smell and taste. There is a similar pattern in other western languages. However, smell plays a far greater role in the language of the Semai of Malaysia, for example. Speaking to New Scientist, Professor Majid said: 'There seems to be something culturally different too. 'People in the West seem to do everything they can to get rid of smells, and in many contexts odour is a taboo topic. 'This might be linked to changes in our smell environment since the industrial revolution. 'If you read stories from the UK or France from before the revolution, there's sewage in the streets and people are using perfume to cover up body odour. 'These days, we do everything we can to sanitise our environment.'","English speakers  take five times longer to describe an odour than a colour .

"A woman who was pushed down a flight of stairs as an overweight schoolgirl has lost seven stone so she can finally have an operation on the knee which cruel school bullies left seriously damaged. Lynzee Harper, 25, was bullied for being fat from a very young age but on her second day at secondary school the taunting took a dangerous turn. Miss Harper was pushed down the school stairs by bullies who joked they wanted to 'see if she would bounce'. Miss Harper was rushed to hospital with a twisted knee. Lynzee was bullied for her weight at school and even pushed down the stairs by a classmate, but she has now lost seven stone and put the cruel taunts behind her . Lindsay is now considerably slimmer having beaten her demons and her school bullies by slimming down by seven stone . Years later her weight peaked at 19st 3lbs, which put huge pressure on her weakened knee, compounding her discomfort. Today, Miss Harper has had the last laugh, losing an impressive 7st through dieting, allowing her to feel the full benefit of a knee operation to repair the damage she sustained as a child. . She said: 'I worked hard to lose my weight so I could have the operation to correct my busted knee which has blighted me since childhood. I managed it and now I look and feel fantastic. 'The cruel school bullies tried to break me when they pushed me down those stairs - but they failed. I bounced back and now I've had the last laugh.' At school Lynzee was bullied for her weight and was pushed down the stairs by one of the prefects . Lynzee is now happy to pose for photos having lost weight, but before she said her confidence was crushed by bullies . Miss Harper, who lives with her fiance David McKie, 46, has struggled with her weight since childhood. She was bullied at school due to her large size. She said: 'I got bullied at primary school even at that young age, cruel kids called me 'fatty' and stole my packed lunch. 'I thought things would change when I left primary school but by the time I reached high school, I was an easy target for school bullies.' While at school in Rutland in the east Midlands, 11-year-old Miss Harper was pushed down the stairs by a prefect. She said: 'On my second day, I was walking down a flight of stairs on my way to a music class when I heard a prefect whisper behind me 'I wonder if she'd bounce if she fell to the bottom.' 'Before I knew it, I felt an almighty push and I was sent tumbling down the stairs, landing with a crunch.' After school Lynzee continued to put on weight as an adult which made her injured knee more painful . She signed up to her local Scottish Slimmers club. Within 20 months she had shed a staggering seven stone. In agony she was rushed to hospital where she was told by medics that the fall had twisted her knee so it was facing the wrong way. Miss Harper was forced to use a wheelchair and crutches while she recovered. The bullying she faced while in school was so severe Miss Harper and her family moved up to Scotland for a fresh start. She said: 'At my new school people accepted me for who I am, not what I looked like. I took up kickboxing and tentatively rebuilt my confidence. I started to have some self-esteem.' Despite her increased confidence Miss Harper, of Lockerbie, Dumfries, Scotland, still struggled with her weight. Her weight skyrocketed after giving birth to her daughter Sarah, now five, and her son Aaron, two. Juggling responsibilities as a parent with work commitments Miss Harper ate takeaway and snacked on chocolate bars and crisps. Soon she weighed in at 19st 3lbs and hid her hulking frame under size 26 clothes. She said: 'Life as a busy mother was hectic and I'd scoff convenience processed foods like chicken kievs and oven chips.' Eventually doctors told her that her extreme weight gain was creating unnecessary strain on her weakened knee, which was regularly dislocating. Breakfast: . Nothing . Lunch: . Two cheese toasties and a bottle of fizzy drink . Dinner: . Indian takeaway with chicken tikka masala, rice, a cheese naan and chicken pakoras . Snacks: . Chocolate and crisps . Breakfast: . Toast with a poached egg and a yoghurt . Lunch: . Homemade veg soup and a brown roll . Dinner: . Tagliatelle with a creamy paprika and chicken sauce . Snacks: . Nothing . Miss Harper, a chef, was told she needed to lose weight so she could have an operation to fix the injury which had plagued her since high school. She said: 'The a surgeon offered me a way out - reconstructive surgery. But there was a catch. To qualify for the op I'd need to lose weight to make sure I would recover properly afterwards.' Determined to change Miss Harper swapped greasy takeaways and fatty snacks for lean meat and fresh vegetables. Lynzee is now a size 12 and here she proudly shows off the difference whilst holding up an old pair of her size 26 jeans . She signed up to her local Scottish Slimmers club. Within 20 months she had shed a staggering seven stone. Lynzee now weighs 12st 3lbs and wears size 12 clothes. She said: 'I was eating healthily and exercising. I walked everywhere and joined the gym. 'Since the operation and my drastic weight loss my knee no longer gives me any trouble. I feel fantastic and love flaunting my new size 12 figure in flattering outfits.' It took her seven months to recover from the operation. Lynzee and David, a maintenance worker, are getting married in September this year. She said: 'I'm looking forward to my wedding - I can't wait to show off my new figure in front of friends and family. 'I look back at those bullies and it reminds me to always be kind to people. Nobody should go through what I had to go through and I never want my kids to go through anything like that.'","Lynzee Harper was bullied at school for her weight .

"I'm 33 and have been single for nearly four years. Most of my friends hint, imply or say it's my fault for being too shallow, picky and prone to falling for bad boys. I use Tinder, the dating app synonymous with casual sex, to meet attractive men who meet my high standards. Yvette Caster, 33, had been single for four years, before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on Tinder for a week . It's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they can't even message you. If you like them you swipe right and, if they feel the same, you can chat. Most of the time I swipe right to one in 50 - many are too old (over 35), too young (under 25), too dull (into sport), too much of a party animal or simply too ugly. But, after another friend accused me of being picky, I decided to see what would happen if I swiped right to ALL men on Tinder for a week. Here's what happened. Sunday . The first day is the worst. Within a few minutes I've swiped right to someone with head to foot tattoos, a man with his three children and lots of frowning blokes in their pants. After an hour I'm exhausted, depressed and have opened the flood gates for 80, mostly unsuitable, suitors. Monday . I get up at 6.30am to swipe right to man who looks like a serial killer, a Ricky Gervais double and a range of football logos (you can put any image as your profile picture). Then a message from Tinder appears. They've noticed my promiscuous swiping and I can't 'like' another man for another 24 hours. Why would I want to? I've already received 43 matches and seven messages before 9am. After the first day of swiping right to all men, the London-based journalist was met with 43 matches and seven messages, all before 9am . Tuesday . I have messages from 22 men and am chatting to all of them to avoid being 'too picky'. The fact they want to talk to me is a revelation. I usually have messages from two men a week, tops. Of the 22, a couple are lascivious but the majority are from nice, down to earth guys. It's just a shame so few of them can spell. I haven't messaged any of them first, either, as I prefer them to do the chasing. Wednesday . It's only just dawning on me how much admin is involved in being promiscuous. Keeping 22 different chats going is hard work and confusing, especially when so many men are called Dave. At times I copy and paste the same message to all the guys, which is rude but it's either that or no reply. I can't quite believe so many of them are being so polite. My normal Tinder experience, picking only the hot guys, is sleazy pick up lines followed by unsolicited pictures or their penis or even indecent videos. Maybe I really could find a boyfriend this way after all. Tinder clocked on to Yvette's promiscuous swiping and sent her a message banning her from 'liking' anyone else for 24 hours . Thursday . The chats have gone so well that I've given my number to three men, although I'm still doubtful about whether I could be physically attracted to them. On the one hand, this whole thing feels slightly immoral, or at least an exercise in leading men on. But on the other, if I think about my exes, I'd probably have swiped left to at least a couple as they won me over with charm and humour, not looks. Friday . I've been asked on three dates - nice dinner dates, not hook ups. One guy has outright asked to be my boyfriend. Another, who is far too young really, has been keeping me entertained with perfect flirty texts. I'm starting to think this is the way forward. The 33-year-old found that attractive men were more likely to message sleazy pick-up lines (left), whereas less attractive men tended to be more polite and seek relationships . Saturday . Just because I can, I go back to swiping right on all men again - men with big beards (yuk), men pictured with their much better looking friend and men who think women are attracted to Star Wars screen grabs. I also have 69 matches and those dates to prepare for. In the end, none of them prove to be The One, but I did have some lovely evenings - good company and intelligent conversation. Would I do it again? Why not? Some men need a chance to win your heart while others, well, they're just very bad at choosing profile pics.","London-based journalist, Yvette Caster, has been single for four years .

"As any man will tell you, there's nothing worse than 'splash back'. And in a move that could slash arrests for public urination in Surfers Paradise, Gold Coast council are considering applying a coat of waterproof paint to walls there. It'll be spray-back time for drunken revellers as the council is copying the German party city of Hamburg which has painted the walls of its entertainment district with the same sort of paint used on ships to deter party-goers from peeing in public. The Gold Coast Bulletin reported that the local council will look into introducing the move where the paint bounces the offending stream off the wall and back onto the offending person. Scroll down for video . Open-air urinals may have given some people a laugh but they proved unpopular in Surfers Paradise . A neon animation shows how easy it was to pee without payback before (left) compared to after (right) due to the application of hydrophobic paint to walls in St Pauli, Hamburg . Public urination ouside Surfers Paradise's nightspots has caused problems for the Gold Coast council . Open-air ­urinals had been used on a trial basis in Surfers Paradise but they were panned by the public. 'It was PR disaster but in keeping urine off the footpaths, it worked really well,' Surfers councillor Lex Bell said. He said the waterproof paint idea was 'very interesting' and that he would take it to council officers for consideration. Nightclub and bar owners in Surfer's Paradise said the council would be better off just providing public toilets. This local resident registered his displeasure with the situation in the St Pauli Interest Community video . Liquid poured on one half of a breeze block coated with water-repellent paint runs off in this demonstration . St Pauli Interest Community members have put up warning signs - put not every painted wall has them . Hollywood Showgirls strip club owner Craig Duffy offered to pay for the installation of public toilets in a disused basement underneath his Surfers Paradise nightspot. Mr Duffy wrote to council in January offering 600sqm of underground space for public loos which he’d rent back to council at a market rate - but he’s yet to hear a response, the Gold Coast Bulletin said. 'That doesn’t make any sense to me at all. It’s utterly insane. $116 a square metre? Pardon the pun but it’s money down the toilet,' he said of the pee-proof paint. 'It’s not dealing with the underlying problem at all which is that there are no toilets.' But using waterproof paint on walls in Hamburg has worked. Here residents of the pub-heavy area at the heart of the party town made a stand against so-called 'Wildpinkler', which literally means 'free pee-ers' in German. Members of the St Pauli Interest Community (IG St Pauli) fed up with drinkers weeing everywhere from back alleys to underpasses to childrens' playgrounds used a special paint to give them a nasty surprise. Water droplets bounce right off the hydrophobic paint with which the residents have coated dozens of walls across a district which welcomes 20 million often heavy-drinking party guests every year. A man relieving himself in the street jumps back in horror when he gets splash back from the special paint . So-called 'Wildpinkler', or 'free pee-ers', have even been caught urinating in playgrounds in St Pauli . Now public urinators will get splash back on their shoes and clothes if they decide to empty their bladders in the street. IG St Pauli board member and owner of several local bars Uwe Christiansen told The Local: 'It was a real annoyance that was growing and growing. 'We wanted to bring people to reason.'

"Schools should enlist men to help stem the 'epidemic' rise in eating disorders among girls, according to a child health expert. Dr Aric Sigman believes men are an 'untapped army' in the fight against body dissatisfaction who could offer a different perspective on the issue. He argues that contrary to popular views, men tended to have a 'much kinder take' on female body fat, eating and sex appeal than many women. And instead of regarding men as 'the cause of the problem', they should be allowed to counteract the view that 'female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males'. Male pupils should be encouraged to tell their female counterparts that curves (which Kim Kardashian is famous for) and body fat are attractive, a child health expert has said . Dr Sigman, a specialist who advises schools, will address a closed gathering of PSHE teachers as part of a HMC Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference professional development programme. He will tell them that men are crucial to addressing the problem in schools. He will say: 'Addressing this problem must extend beyond the 'learn to love your body' and 'media literacy' lessons in the classroom to include more input from the men in a girl's life. 'Men are an untapped army who need to become aggressively vocal about the culture and messages bearing down on their daughters, partners, sisters and female friends. 'Men have a very different and much kinder take on female body fat, sex appeal, eating and weight loss. 'Knowing what men think can actually serve as an antidote to the prevailing assumptions that feed body dissatisfaction.' Last year, the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) found hospitals were dealing with a rising number of eating disorder cases, with the biggest rise among youngsters aged ten to 19. Dr Aric Sigman believes men are crucial in the fight against negative body image and should be used to counteract the view that ‘female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males’ Body image is already routinely tackled in schools as part of personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) classes. Dr Sigman argues men are sometimes slow to become involved in this delicate subject because they were traditionally seen as the cause of the problem. He will say: 'Today men are in a position to countercheck the prevailing highly damaging generalisation that female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males. 'This is not replacing one prescriptive view of the ideal female form with another. 'Whether we consider it politically incorrect or not, how men - meaning in this case fathers, brothers, grandfathers and partners - see women's bodies is a real part of life.' Dr Sigman, the author of The Body Wars1, has compiled researching suggesting men do not find body fat or the 'pear shape' aversive. According to him, fathers can play an especially important role in preventing and helping their daughters to overcome body image pressures. He will say: 'Men are often surprised to discover how even the most intelligent, capable, rational and empowered women can be laid low by body dissatisfaction. Many of us just don't get it. 'When made aware, men can be protective and aggressive if they believe their daughters or partners are being made unhappy in this way. It's time we harness this different perspective and ensure it's put to good use.' Dr Sigman, a chartered biologist and chartered psychologist, worked on health education campaigns with the Department of Health. Last year, he argued that even television news was damaging to young girls because the news readers were 'on a permanent diet'.","Dr Aric Sigman believes men are crucial in halting rise in eating disorders .

"An artist has created the world's smallest sculpture only for it to be accidentally crushed by a finger while being photographed. Jonty Hurwitz's creations are so tiny they can rest on a human hair and are the same size of an ant's head. Having spent months working on the pieces, the 45-year-old from Chichester, West Sussex, took them to a photographer to have them pictured under a microscope. But within minutes his work had been destroyed by the stroke of the lab technician's finger. Scroll down for video . The world's smallest sculpture (seen in the eye of a needle, above) was accidentally destroyed by a photographer hired to help its creator capture it in pictures . The artwork, seen here on a human hair, was produced using 3D printing technolog by Jonty Hurwitz . 'I went off to have the original sculptures photographed so I found a laboratory with an electron microscope and the photographic technology,' said Mr Hurwitz. 'The technician went to change the orientation and then for the next half an hour we were looking for the piece through the lens. 'Eventually I noticed there was a fingerprint exactly where the sculpture used to be and I was like ""man you have just destroyed the smallest art pieces"" ever made - I slightly freaked out.' The sculptures are less than 1mm tall and are produced via a process called nano-painting. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye so must be viewed and photographed under a microscope. Mr Hurwitz uses a 3D printing technology to produce them. Describing the process on his website, he said: 'The structure is created using a ground-breaking new 3D printing technology and a technique called Multiphoton Lithography. Mr Hurwitz has produced a number of nano sculptures using the same technology though the naked woman above is believed to have been the smallest . The artist from Chichester, West Sussex, described his work as a combination of 'art and Quantum Physics' 'Ultimately these works are created using the physical phenomenon of two photon absorption. Art, literally created with Quantum Physics. 'This two photon absorption occurs only at the tiny focal point - basically a tiny 3D pixel (called a Voxel). 'The sculpture is then moved along fractionally by a computer controlled process and the next pixel is created. Slowly, over hours and hours the entire sculpture is assembled pixel by pixel and layer by layer.' The sculptures are believed to be the smallest representation of the human form ever created by man.","Jonty Hurwitz produced the tiny sculpture which was less than 1mm tall .

"Poundland founder Steve Smith has slashed £750,000 off the asking price of his sprawling country home in a bid to sell the 15,000 sq ft luxury property. Mr Smith's house, located in Bridgnorth, Shrophshire, is a seven-bedroom mansion featuring five grand reception rooms, a dance floor, bar and swimming pool. The home has been for sale on and off since 2011 with an initial asking price of £6.5million, but in its online sale listing he has now cut it down to £5.75m. Poundland founder Steve Smith pictured outside his Shropshire home, for which he is asking for £5.75million . The property boasts seven bedrooms, five grand reception rooms, a dancefloor, bar and swimming pool . It also features a lavish pool room with a full size heated pool and hot tub . Pictured is one of the mansion's living rooms, adorned with expensive rugs . He bought the property a decade ago for £2.2million, but recently said with only one child left at home, he and his wife Tracey hope to downsize. Only 16-year-old Joe still lives at home, while Katie, 26, lives with her husband and two children in a converted barn on the 28-acre estate. He said: 'The house is very special to us and it will be a real wrench for us to leave. We began refurbishing the home in 2000 and finally finished it in 2007. 'It was a real labour of love and no expense was spared. I especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar. It’s really unique and we’ve had some great parties there.' When he bought Hammer Hill House in 2004, Mr Smith set about doubling the property in size, turning the quaint country house into a sprawling estate. The property listing boasts of the space afforded by the 28-acre estate  Country Life magazine once mooted as a possible base for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Mr Smith added: 'We've had the place for 11 - 12 years and I suppose I like projects, I get itchy feet and want to build something else. 'I'm looking for a site where I can create my own house and build the kids' houses. So I'm looking for a plot of land where I can build four houses and keep the family together. 'We've reduced the price because at that level the stamp duty is pretty high, so at that price I've more or less knocked the stamp duty off it.' Advertised on his own website estatesdirect.com, the listing reads: 'The house is approached through magnificent wrought iron electric gates opening to a sweeping tree lined driveway to the turning circle to the front of the house and into the walled coach yard to one side. 'The gardens and grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained with sweeping lawns, glasshouses, stocked borders and hidden pathways through wooded vistas. 'The house has extensive grazing land with four paddocks partially surrounded by mature woodland.' Mr Smith founded the cut-price discount store Poundland in 1990 before selling it a decade later for £50million. The property listing boasts the 'sweeping walnut staircase' (pictured) leads to a 'galleried landing' Mr Smith bought the property a decade ago for £2.2million but with only one of his children left at home, wants to move on . Earlier this week the budget chain made headlines when the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that it must drop its claim that everything costs £1 because it sells CDs and DVDs for £2. It was a major blow for the company which has built an empire on the boast that just £1 can buy anything in its stores. The decision even calls into question whether the budget chain can legitimately continue to call itself ‘Poundland’. Before the advertising watchdog’s ruling, Poundland's website boasted: ‘Everything for £1 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we’re still true to that vision today.’ Under a heading ‘Our Values’, it added: ‘We’ve grown to be the largest single price value retailer in the UK...We are very proud to offer you a single £1 price, that hasn’t changed since we opened our first store.’ However, people complained to the ASA that these claims were no longer accurate because it was stocking DVDs of blockbuster films in a concession partnership with another firm for £2 each. Poundland defended the breaking of its normal £1 price barrier saying the £2 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold.

"Ion Jinga (pictured), the Romanian ambassador in London, accusing the producers of reinforcing negative stereotypes . Controversial documentary The Romanians Are Coming has been condemned by Romanian MPs  for inciting 'hatred and discrimination' of migrants. Ion Jinga, the Romanian ambassador in London, wrote to Channel 4 accusing the producers of reinforcing negative stereotypes. Three members of the Romanian parliament also wrote to the British ambassador in Bucharest asking what the reaction would be if they made a programme saying all Brits were alcoholics and paedophiles. In a letter seen by the Observer, they said: 'We kindly ask you to consider what your reaction would be if TVR, the Romanian public television channel, would launch a campaign of denigration pointed towards the British citizens in our country, generalising cases of alcoholism and paedophilia displayed by some British citizens (cases we are sure you are aware of), and turning them into the general image of all British citizens in Romania. 'The documentary broadcast by Channel 4 does the exact same thing.' The letter sent by President of United Romania Party, MP Bogdan Diaconu, his vice president MP Virgil Guran, and MP Paul Dumbrăvanu, also said the documentary is wrong in 'every respect' about the Romanian. 'The affront brought to the Romanians living in the United Kingdom must stop immediately, as it will encourage xenophobia and will prejudice our citizens in a direct manner,' it said. Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta and his foreign minister also expressed unhappiness over the show which could 'negatively and unfairly' affect the Romanian community in the UK. Channel 4 said the documentary, which ended on Tuesday, explored the lives of Romanians 'trying to make a new life in Britain' and seeking out the truth behind the headlines about immigration'. The first programme followed Alex, who lived in a car park next to Victoria station in London, and a Romany man who struggled to settle in Liverpool. The second and third episodes examined the motivation driving migrants to the UK. Around 200 people held a silent demonstration in front of Channel 4's studios protesting against what they said was the unfair portrayal of Romanians as criminals. Two petitions demanding for the show to be cancelled appeared on Change.org after the first episode aired and they have attracted almost 10,000 signatures. One said: 'The Romanians Are Coming is purposely dehumanising and through its misleading nature it is used to promote a false image of Romania and it's people in the mind of others.' Controversial documentary The Romanians Are Coming has been condemned by the Romanian embassy, pictured is homeless Stefan who featured in the show . Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta (pictured) expressed solidarity with those protesting over the show . The Romanian Prime Minister  expressed solidarity with the protesters and people who signed the petitions. Romanian Foreign minister Bogdan Aurescu wrote a letter to his British counterpart Philip Hammond saying he regrets the resurfacing of 'incorrect stereotypes'. 'We deeply regret the resurfacing of incorrect stereotypes of the Romanian community in the UK as reported in the Channel 4 documentary, by presenting only cases which are not entirely representative,' he said. 'Such documentaries could negatively and unfairly affect the image of the Romanian community in the UK,' he added.

A spokesman for C4 said: 'This sensitively handled series confronts, head on, many of the stereotypes and widely held prejudices about Romanians coming to the UK by providing an honest account of the experience of different individuals attempting to make a life in Britain.

"Women with vaginal piercings are to be classed as victims of female genital mutilation (FGM), health chiefs have said . Women with vaginal piercings are to be classed as victims of female genital mutilation (FGM), health chiefs have said. Under new NHS rules to be introduced next month, any woman whose labia or clitoris has been pierced must be recorded as suffering FGM, a procedure which is illegal in the UK. The mandatory reporting regulations were sent to medical staff by the Department of Health, which said it is would start classifying the piercings 'within an abusive context'. It means that even women who have consented to the piercing for cosmetic reasons will be deemed as a potential victim of crime. Those responsible for carrying out the piercing could also be implicated for committing a criminal offence. The new rules are in line with guidance from the World Health Organisation, which last year classified piercing as 'harmful procedures' that are considered under the bracket of FGM. There is already much debate about whether genital surgery procedures such as so-called 'designer vagina' operations should be treated by as FGM. Last week, MPs released a report which said police, midwives and campaigners remain confused over whether the operations fall within FGM laws. Under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, it is illegal to cut girls' genitals unless there is a genuine justification. The exemptions in the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 refer to operations carried out on the grounds of physical or mental health and do not cover cosmetic surgery. The Home Affairs Select Committee said the act should be amended to reiterate that female genital cosmetic surgery on those who do not have a physical or mental health justification is potentially illegal. The Government has previously said it has no plans to make these changes. Some 170,000 women and girls are estimated to be living with FGM in the UK. More than 2,600 women and girls who went through FGM have been treated by the NHS since last September, with 499 women and girls with FGM seen in acute NHS trusts in England in January alone. More than 200 FGM-related cases were investigated by the police nationally in the past five years. A Department of Health man said: 'While there are challenges in this area and adult women may have genital piercings, in some communities girls are forced to have them. The World Health Organisation has quite rightly defined this as a form of FGM. 'We are taking every precaution to record genital piercings that have been done within an abusive context. 'The new data collection will help build a picture of the scale and the nature of the problem we are facing. We are continually working on ways to improve and develop the NHS response to this terrible practice.'","New NHS rules will apply to any woman whose labia or clitoris is pierced .

"Ukip leader Nigel Farage said an Indian NHS doctor almost killed him by failing to diagnose his cancer . Nigel Farage has launched an astonishing attack on the National Health Service accusing doctors of 'incompetence and negligence' over their failure to diagnose his cancer. The controversial politician developed cancer in his 20s and said an Indian doctor tried to convince him he had an infection even though his left testicle had swollen to the size of a rock hard lemon. The Ukip leader claimed he was 'fobbed off by one NHS doctor to the next', and, without private health insurance, he would 'probably be dead'. Writing in his memoir, The Purple Revolution, which is being serialised in the Telegraph, Farage wrote: 'Several doctors examined me - registrars, locums, all that lot - and they came to the conclusion that I had a twisted testicle. I would need an immediate operation, they said. I was taken by ambulance to hospital in Farnborough, Hampshire, where I was re-examined by another four doctors. It was pretty painful. 'An Indian doctor told me that the Bromley doctors had got it all wrong: I had an infection. I was to go home and take a heavy dose of antibiotics. I did not need an operation after all. A few weeks went by and the pain was just as bad. All the time, my left testicle was getting markedly larger.' Mr Farage said that six weeks later he was having difficulty walking and his 'left testicle was as large as a lemon and rock hard'. But despite being in a 'terrible state' a consultant directed him to ''keep taking the antibiotics' and sent him away. Eventually Mr Farage said he sought an opinion from a private consultant who diagnosed cancer. Scroll down for video . After being told he was covered by company health insurance he went for private treatment and was swiftly informed he had a tumour and would need to have a testicle removed. Mr Farage told how he was 'terrified' when doctors told him he may have secondary tumours in his stomach and lungs. More than 30 years on, recounting the period 'makes  me upset', he added. On the day of the 2010 general election, Mr Farage said a plane crash during a publicity stunt and an earlier car crash has left him with the body of a 70-year-old.d. Mr Farage, pictured, revealed that one of his testicles had swollen up to the size of  large rock hard lemon . Mr Farage, pictured after a plane crash on election day in 2010 admitted the NHS was good in emergencies . After the air accident Mr Farage was told that he could be  signed off as partially  disabled but having a blue badge would be ' conceding  defeat'. ' I remember thinking, 'so this is it, this is how it ends',' he said of the air crash. 'When people say that their life flashed before them when they thought they were about to die, it is rubbish. 'All I could think of was how much there was I still wanted to do and the impact my death would have on others - my girls were still so little and the boys were only just finding their way in the world.' He added: ' Having nearly died three times has made me a much bigger risk-taker. When you think your life is about to be taken away and you are given it back, you just want to get on and do things. 'There's no time to waste: children to bring up, elections to win, pheasants to pluck, wine to drink.' The Ukip leader accused other political parties of being afraid of criticising the NHS . He has also taken the opportunity in his memoir to attack the other major Westminster political parties over their fear of criticising the NHS. He said that he is 'better qualified to criticise and defend our health care system than most politicians'. Mr Farage praised the NHS for being 'astonishingly good' at emergency critical care but claims the NHS will 'probably let you down' over screening and a fast diagnosis. He said the system is 'so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care, you should take it' and warned that the NHS ' is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks'. 'There are huge problems with the NHS, deep structural ones, but, as I have said, I know more than most what that means on a personal level,' he wrote. 'When I had cancer, the incompetence and negligence of the NHS almost killed me, but it has also saved my life. I am certainly not taking any flak from gutless politicians who claim that I am no fan or supporter of the NHS.'","Nigel Farage has revealed he had testicular cancer at the age of 21 .

"Ed Miliband was ridiculed yesterday for his plan to pass a law guaranteeing that television debates will take place in the run-up to future elections. The Labour leader claimed the move would ensure ‘once and for all, that these debates belong to the people’. But the plan was criticised by all sides, with former SNP leader Alex Salmond asking whether David Cameron would be jailed at Wandsworth prison for failing to take part. Ed Miliband was ridiculed yesterday for his plan to pass a law guaranteeing that television debates will take place in the run-up to future elections . He told BBC Radio 4: ‘Could you actually pass a law which says that somebody has to turn up at a TV debate? ‘What do you do when David Cameron doesn’t turn up? Shall we stick him in the clink, do we put him in Wandsworth?’ Labour’s launch of the proposed law was designed to keep up pressure on Mr Cameron over his refusal to comply with broadcasters’ plans for three TV debates during the election campaign. Last week Downing Street said he would attend only one, before the start of the formal campaign at the end of March. This would avoid the debates dominating the entire campaign, something Mr Cameron has been warning about for several years. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘Frankly I think the broadcasters have made a real hash of this because the processes and discussions have been going on for months.’ She told Sky’s Murnaghan show: ‘They invited this party and that party. The Prime Minister has made a very clear offer – get seven parties in the same place, have a 90-minute debate before the campaign starts. The plan was criticised by all sides, with former SNP leader Alex Salmond asking whether David Cameron would be jailed at Wandsworth prison for failing to take part . ‘Otherwise, all we are doing all the way through the campaign itself is talking about the debates.’ Labour said putting the debates on a statutory footing would prevent the recent rows about when they should take place and which parties would be involved. The system would work on similar lines to the current rules for planning the number, length and timing of party political broadcasts, Labour officials said. This means that parties would be consulted but not given the right to veto. The Broadcasters’ Liaison Group would become a recognised legal body for deciding the debates’ dates, format, volume and who was attending. Mr Miliband said: ‘In recent days the British public has been treated to the unedifying and tawdry spectacle of a prime minister seeking to duck out of the TV debates he once claimed to support with great enthusiasm.’ On BBC Radio 4, Mr Salmond, right, asked: ‘What do you do when David Cameron doesn’t turn up? Shall we stick him in the clink, do we put him in Wandsworth?’ He told the Observer that the broadcasters had ‘made it clear they would not be cowed by his tactics but it is wrong for them and the British public to have governing parties use this kind of pressure in campaign periods. It is time to ensure, once and for all, that these debates belong to the people, not the prime minister of the day.’ Labour said it would set a deadline of 2017 for changes to be put in place ahead of the proposed 2020 election. The party’s deputy leader Harriet Harman told Sky News that Labour would bring in a legal framework ‘like there is for the party election broadcasts, like there is for the rules on election spending and the election campaign’. She added that this would avoid ‘the broadcasters working together on an ad-hoc basis and David Cameron just ducking and weaving’.","Labour leader claimed move would ensure 'debates belong to the people’

"They've been madly in love since they laid eyes on each other as children, but it hasn't always been a smooth ride for this couple. Kirstie and Lyle Fisher were forced to keep their feelings secret for a number of years as they battled their biggest dilemma - the fact they happened to be first cousins. The Perth couple, who  are busy raising their three children, are now unashamed of their romance after finally going public with their relationship seven years ago. 'We're happy, we aren't hurting anyone by being together and our kids are fine and healthy... We were meant to be together,' Ms Fisher told Daily Mail Australia. Lyle and Kirstie Fisher from Perth in Western Australia have been together for seven years and are raising three children together - they also happen to be first cousins . 'People are allowed their opinions but we don't care what anyone else thinks.' Kirstie, 29, says it took a long time to realise not everyone would be accepting of their partnership after they dealt with disapproving family members and friends who abandoned them. 'The worst comment I've had is that our kids will grow two heads and we should go to Tasmania,' she said. 'Even last week I had a confrontation with a woman at my children's school. She told me I should be shot and my kids taken away from us. 'If what everybody said bothered us, we wouldn't be together. The fact is without Lyle, I am not a complete person. 'I love Lyle and I won't stop loving him.' Kirstie and Lyle, whose father's are brothers and grew up in different states, first met at a family wedding in Perth when she was nine years old. 'I thought he was cute, I didn't care that he was my cousin,' she said. 'But then he had to go back to Melbourne with his family and we didn't really talk again until I was 15. He got my mobile number off my brother and we started texting and chatting over MSN.' Lyle and Kirstie whose father's are brothers first met at a family wedding in Perth when she was nine years old because they lived in different states . The couple tried to suppress their feelings when they were teenagers and eventually kept their feelings secret from their family for a number of years . Kirstie said she constantly pushed her feelings for Lyle aside because she knew they were related. 'Growing up you're always told they are your cousins, so you automatically assume if they're family then it is illegal to be together,' she said. When Kirstie turned 17, their aunty passed away and Lyle spent a week in Perth for the funeral. 'Up until my aunt's funeral there was the occasional time where I wished we weren't cousins. But we grew closer and by then I knew he wasn't just a cousin. 'I had really strong feelings for him.' Their first kiss was in Kirstie's bedroom while they were watching TV one night. 'I'm the only girl of three boys so they were very protective, but they didn't think anything of him being in my room because he was my cousin. 'From then on when we met up there were kisses and cuddles when no one was watching.' They talked several times about becoming a couple, but Kirstie often got cold feet because she was worried what people would think. Kirstie and Lyle went their separate ways for several years and she gave birth to her daughter Matilda (right) in a different relationship. They went public with their romance in 2008 and have two children together . Apart from Kirstie's father, who called the pair disgusting and hasn't spoken to them since, the couple say most people have been understanding . 'Eventually we went our separate ways and both went through relationships. I even had my first daughter with another guy,' she said. 'That relationship ended and Lyle was just at that point where he wanted to be together. 'I took my daughter to visit him in Queensland - he'd moved there a few years before. That's when we just gave up trying to ignore everything.' Lyle's mother sensed something was going on between the pair and confronted them with a stack of papers showing it wasn't illegal for them to be together and research on whether their children would be affected. 'He bought me a ring that day and we got engaged,' Kirstie said. They then had to bravely tell their immediate and extended families and admit it was a long process before people accepted it. Kirstie's daughter Miranda (left) has a different father, but the couple have two children together - Alex, 5, and Zachary, 2. Their daughter Danica died from complications during birth three years ago . Apart from Kirstie's father, who called the pair disgusting and hasn't spoken to them since, the couple say most people have been understanding. 'After a while my mum understood that I was happy and so she is happy for me. My two brothers are okay with it and so is Lyle's sister,' she said. 'We lost a few friends over it though. Lyle's best friend from primary school no longer talks to him and I stopped speaking to my best friend about a year ago.' Kirstie and Lyle have two children together - Alex, 5, and Zachary, 2. Their daughter Danica died from complications during birth three years ago. 'My oldest daughter, Miranda, is 10 and she goes around telling everyone - she doesn't care. We don't hide anything from our kids. 'All the kids are perfectly fine and healthy. We love them to death.'","The pair first met when Kirstie was nine years old at a family wedding .

"The world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change, scientists have warned. US researchers claim that the fast onset of global warming is set to alter the way people live, even over short time scales. This is according to new evidence which suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25°C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years. New evidence suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25°C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years. The Arctic (purple) will be have the most dramatic increase, followed by North America (brown), Europe (black) and Asia (red) The analysis, based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world, looked at the rate of change in 40-year long time spans. 'We focused on changes over 40-year periods, which is similar to the lifetime of houses and human-built infrastructure such as buildings and roads,' said lead scientist Dr Steve Smith, from the  Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington. 'In the near term, we're going to have to adapt to these changes.' Overall, the world is getting warmer due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions that trap the sun's heat. But, given natural climate variability over short times scales, the likely effect of global warming over humanly relevant periods such as the length of a person's life is not so well understood. 'We focused on changes over 40-year periods, which is similar to the lifetime of houses and human-built infrastructure,' said lead scientist Dr Steve Smith, from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington. The graph shows the predicted changes under different scenarios of climate change . The new study started off by calculating how fast temperatures changed between 1850 and 1930, a period when the amount of fossil fuel gases collecting in the atmosphere was low. This was compared with temperature data for the past 2,000 years obtained by studying tree rings, corals and ice cores and predicted 40-year rates of change between 1971 and 2020. Over the 900 years preceding the 20th century, 40-year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1°C per decade, the study found. But by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25°C per decade, give or take 0.05°C. Different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years. Dr Smith added: 'In these climate model simulations, the world is just now starting to enter into a new place, where rates of temperature change are consistently larger than historical values over 40-year time spans. 'We need to better understand what the effects of this will be and how to prepare for them.' The findings are published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The US National Oceanic and Atmosopheric Administration has detected warmer than average water temperatures around the equator of the Pacific Ocean (shown above) which indicates the arrival of El Niño . The world is finally in the grip of a long-awaited El Niño event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected. El Niño is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the Pacific Ocean around the equator. Scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central Pacific Ocean and have started to alter wind patterns. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Niño will continue through the summer. However, they say that the El Niño conditions are currently 'extremely weak' and come at a time of the year when the influence of El Niño on weather patterns usually declines. The NOAA said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three-year record-breaking drought that is currently affecting California. Some meteorologists, however, have warned this El Niño could combine with another slow movement of water in the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Decadal Osciallation (PDO). The PDO reached record levels in December last year and January this year, and should it stay strong, it may combine with El Niño to increase global temperatures.","Rate in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25°C per decade by 2020 .

"Workers rights advocates have called for industrial relations commissioners to spend two weeks in their shoes, amid renewed calls for cuts to penalty rates. United Voice, a union representing more than 120,000 Australian workers across hospitality, health, aged care and manufacturing industries, has said penalty rates are crucial to the workers it represents. 'When workers talk about penalty rates they talk about economic survival,' United Voice ACT secretary Lyndal Ryan told the Canberra Times.

Ms Ryan's comments come as the union made its submission to the upcoming Productivity Commission review. The submission called for commissioners to spend two weekends working in industries such as aged care or hospitality, rule out considering income from tips in its findings and to study the economic benefits of penalty rates. However, industry representatives have said penalty rates have to be up for discussion if a major review of workplace relations is to take place. Australian Hotels Association chief executive Stephen Ferguson said omitting them from the conversation would be 'ridiculous'. 'The current structure of paying 275 per cent [of ordinary wage rates] on these public holidays - our research says this doesn't stack up,' Mr Ferguson said. 'We don't step away from the fact that a Sunday is different from a Monday, for example, all we're talking about is the quantum.' Mr Ferguson said the AHA's submission to this year's Productivity Commission will be lodged on Monday, and will push for changes that would see unsociable work hours instead called 'additional rates' and make the wages mark-up less generous. Hospitality worker and United Voice delegate Nicolette Marks said her hourly rate was about one- third higher during night hours but was well earned. Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell (pictured: left) and ACTU president Ged Kearney (pictured: right)  will debate workplace relations at the National Press Club next week . 'Working in an industry that has alcohol, we have people at the bar talking to us to 4am, then you have the people who are rude and abuse you,' she said. 'It's kind of like collateral damage pay.'

"Scientists have discovered a frog in Ecuador that can rapidly change its skin patterns to mimic the texture it sits on. Spotted in the western Andean cloud forest, the creature is believed to be the first known amphibian to have this shape-shifting capability. Researchers claim the ability to change skin texture to reflect its surroundings may enable the frog to camouflage itself from birds and other predators – but say this has yet to be proven. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered a frog in Ecuador that can rapidly change its skin patterns to mimic the texture it sits on.Spotted in the western Andean cloud forest, the creature is believed to be the first known amphibian to have this shape-shifting capability . The new species, called Pristimantis mutabilis was discovered by a Case Western Reserve University PhD student and her husband at Reserva Las Gralarias. Katherine Krynak spotted the spiny frog, which nearly the width of a marble, sitting on a moss-covered leaf. The Krynaks captured the frog, and nicknamed it 'punk rocker' because of the thorn-like spines covering its body. The next day, Ms Krynak pulled the frog from the cup and set it on a smooth white sheet of plastic. It wasn't 'punk ' - it was smooth-skinned. The new species, called Pristimantis mutabilis - or mutable rainfrog - was discovered by a Case Western Reserve University PhD student and her husband at Reserva Las Gralarias. This image shows how the frog changes from spiky to almost smooth in just over 300 seconds . They assumed that, much to her dismay, she must have picked up the wrong frog. 'I then put the frog back in the cup and added some moss,' she said. 'The spines came back... we simply couldn't believe our eyes, our frog changed skin texture. 'I put the frog back on the smooth white background. Its skin became smooth.' 'The spines and colouration help them blend into mossy habitats, making it hard for us to see them,' she said. 'But whether the texture really helps them elude predators still needs to be tested.' In this image, one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs, where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside . This is the astonishing 'glass' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible. The Fleischmann's Glass Frog looks as if it is changing colour as it moves, as the background shows through its transparent flesh. The bizarre camouflage means you can still see its heart, intestines, and red blood vessels. Photographer Thomas Marent snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in Choco, Colombia. In this image, one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs, where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside. During the next three years, a team of fellow biologists studied the frogs. They found the animals shift skin texture in a little more than three minutes. A separate research them at Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica, Ecuador, discovered that Primates sobetes, a relative with similar markings but about twice the size of P. mutabilis, has the same trait. Because the appearance of animals has long been one of the keys to identifying them as a certain species, the researchers believe could mean many species have been missed.","Pristimantis mutabilis was spotted in Ecuador's Andean cloud forest .

"Human trafficking victims from Vietnam were rescued after police swooped on nail bars across the UK, arresting ten people. Around 150 officers from three forces across were involved in the raids carried out across 17 shops and residential addresses in London and Berkshire. Ten men and women were arrested as a result of the operation on Tuesday morning which followed 18 months of investigation. All but one have been bailed pending further police inquiries. Police swooped on 17 nail bars and residential addresses across the UK on Tuesday including one salon in Reading (above). Six victims of human trafficking were rescued as a result of the operation . Thames Valley Police Officers raided three nail bars in Reading, two in Wokingham and one in York in addition to a number of residential addresses. They were supported by Metropolitan Police and North Yorkshire Police as part of the operation known as Rehoboam. Investigating officer said the effort was part of an ongoing police effort to curb human trafficking in the UK. 'It is a criminal offence to traffic people into the UK. It is an offence to force people, by threats or coercion, to work unpaid or to pay off a debt. It is an offence to make people carry out acts against their will. 'The key aim of this operation is to protect vulnerable people. The victims in this investigation have been taken to rest centres where they are being supported by Thames Valley Police, the British Red Cross and the Salvation Army. 'Extra police community support officers will be out on patrol today speaking to residents and businesses to inform them of today’s operation and provide reassurance.' Ten people were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking offences as a result of the raids. Among the nail bars that were raided as part of the operation was this one in the centre of Reading (above) More than 150 officers from three different police forces were involved in the operation which saw 10 people arrested after 18 months of investigation . They are a 33-year-old woman from Berkshire; a 40-year-old man from London; a man and a woman from Wokingham aged 39 and 32 and two men and two women aged 31, 20, 33 and 24 from Reading. A 19-year-old man of no fixed address was also arrested as part of the operation. It comes after a Sunday Times report estimated around 15,000 nail bars in Britain were controlled by criminals involved in human trafficking. Between 2008 and 2013, 100 salons in England and Wales were fined a total of £700,000 for employing illegal immigrants. Some of the victims, the majority of which were Vietnamese, said they had been trafficked into the UK and forced into prostitution before taking up work in the salons. Speaking of the reported figures, Chloe Setter,  head of advocacy at ECPAT, an anti-exploitation charity, said often workers were trafficked into the salons having been involved in other illegal scenarios. 'Sometimes nail bars serve as a cover for other types of crime and some times they are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to illegality. 'But with victims working in a public facing role it's important people understand the reality of the trafficking. 'It's important for people to know this is happening on high streets and not just in murky sub-worlds. 'People are, in some cases, unwittingly using forced labour  and I think they'd be shocked to know the truth.'

Original posters for the Holden Sandman appealed to Australian's love of surf and the great outdoors . 'Built for new horizons:' The original Sandman panelvan  as it first appeared in Holden adverts . 'Make yours a Vroom:' The Freedom Machine as it was originally advertised by Holden . The Holden Sandman was advertised as care for the 'fun folk' with a little 'gypsy' in them . Peter Keley, Holden’s  Director of Sales,  says the opportunity to bring back the Sandman was irresistible. 'The Holden Sandman has been synonymous with the great Australian surf safari for decades and perfectly reflects our country’s laid back, yet adventurous attitude to life. When the opportunity came to revive Sandman, we jumped at it,' Mr Keley said. 'The reborn Sandman is a statement and reflection of the Australian way of life. Most importantly, it’s about having fun.' Kate Burling, a long-time fan of the Holden wagon, says she can't wait to see the new model. 'My  first love at 17 was my Holden Kingswood, then it was the pano,' Ms Burling told Daily Mail Australia. 'I never owned a Sandman but I just love it, it's such a classic car for the ultimate  aussie road trip, I can't wait to see what the new one looks like.' The HX Sandman panelvan was the ultimate surf mobile . After more than twenty years in the darkness, Holden reinvented the Sandman as a concept ute at the Sydney International Motor Show, 2000. But the ute was discontinued in 2006 due to slow sales. The 2015 Sandman launches on the heels of other recently revived Holden classics like the Collingwood Dore and Craig Lowndes, as the company tries to boost Commodore sales before it ends local production in 2017. Holden reinvented the Sandman as a concept van at the Sydney International Motor Show in 2000,  pictured here with Mambo artwork.

"A couple have told how they were left fighting for their lives after being repeatedly stabbed in the head by a  guest at their own house-warming party as they slept, . Today Rob Plevin and Sally Roythorne, from Cumbria, look like any other healthy couple happily posing with their new baby, Poppy. But in May 2010 the pair were left with catastrophic injuries after friend Matthew Lucas crept into their room while they were sleeping and stabbed them both in the head. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Ms Roythorne suffered 18 wounds to her head and face and had a punctured lung. The ligaments in her hands had been so badly damaged while she was trying to protect herself from the blows of Lucas' knife that she spent three months with them in plaster casts. Doctors did not expect them to survive the horrific ordeal. Ms Roythorne suffered 18 wounds to her head and face and had a punctured lung, while Mr Plevin was stabbed twice through the neck. His life was only saved by the quick thinking of other guests who tried to stem the bleeding, but after emerging from a two day coma, he lost so much blood that he had a full blood transfusion and required seven hours in surgery. The ligaments in Ms Roythorne's hands had been so badly damaged while she was trying to protect herself from the blows of Lucas' knife that she spent three months with them in plaster casts. At the time, a court heard that the couple had been celebrating their move from Newcastle to Cumbria, with a party of 30 friends on May 23 2010. The couple and a few guests who were staying over headed to bed not long after midnight once the party was over. But chef Lucas, 39 at the time, went into their kitchen, took a knife and crept up to their bedroom to attack them, with absolutely no warning or apparent reason. The court heard at the time that he had approached several different women at the party but his advances had been turned down each time. Mr Plevin was stabbed twice through the neck. His life was only saved by the quick thinking of other guests who tried to stem the bleeding . After emerging from a two day coma, he lost so much blood that he had a full blood transfusion and required seven hours in surgery . Mr Plevin had known Lucas for around 10 years. They had first met through a friend and had seen each other intermittently over the years, mainly on canoeing trips in Scotland with mutual friends. He said: 'In the run up to the party he had checked with us if any single women were going to be there - he was frustrated that he was still single. 'We knew that he was also pretty stressed out at work and that money was a bit of an issue for him, but we'd thought that our party would just be a chance to relax.' 'But the thought never crossed my mind that he would be violent.' When the case finally came to an end and Lucas was given an indeterminate jail sentence with a 13-year minimum tariff. Ms Roythorne said: 'We'd moved from Newcastle to Cumbria to be closer to Rob's parents, who were unwell, and had invited lots of friends to celebrate the new chapter in our lives. Today Rob Plevin and Sally Roythorne, from Cumbria, look like any other couple happily posing with their new baby, Poppy. But in May, 2010, the pair were left with catastrophic injuries after friend Matthew Lucas crept into their room while they were sleeping and stabbed them both in the head . 'The house was a stunning four-bedroom detached former Police superintendent's home with a huge garden so we'd had a barbeque and been playing games all afternoon - we even played rounders on the village green.' She added: 'Our physical injuries were only a fraction of what we experienced. It was the mental horror, the post-traumatic stress which caused us the most pain and anguish. 'When we woke up in hospital after the attack we were shocked that we were even alive - the doctors hadn't expected us to make it. 'We came round and just looked at each other with tears streaming down our faces. Matthew Lucas (left and right), 39 at the time and a chef, went into their kitchen, took a knife and crept up to their bedroom to attack them, with absolutely no warning or apparent reason. The court heard he had approached several different women at the party but his advances had been turned down each time . 'One thing that gave us relief in the very tough times was the idea of us both floating on a raft, letting go of all the anxiety and things we couldn't control - just 'going with the flow'. The couple have since set up The Life Raft, an organisation to share what they had learnt overcoming their experience and to help others. Ms Roythorne said: 'Before the attack, Rob and I were both very career-driven. We both had older children from previous relationships and we'd never even considered having a child together. 'But our long road to recovery made us re-evaluate our lives. 'We started meditating and we realised we wanted to refocus our lives around our family instead of our careers, and we had Poppy in 2014. 'She has been a little angel that arrived to finish of the healing process. 'If we hadn't have nearly died that night, we wouldn't be nearly as happy as we are today.' 'It's been a long, long road to recovery but we're proud to say that our lives are better now than they were before that evening.

"The implantation of memories is a common feature in sci-fi films, such as Inception and Total Recall. But now, for the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept. The feat  gives hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories, which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds. For the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while the sleep. The technique could one day be used to change human memories, such in in films like Total Recall and Inception ( a still from the film is shown) The brain typically replays the day’s activities when people or animals sleep, which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity, for example. Experts have found that when this replay process is disrupted in rodents, so too is their ability to remember what they learned – for example, a new area that they explored – the previous day, New Scientist reported. Scientists from the Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution in Paris, France, used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept. The team, led by Karim Benchenane, focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about, or being in, a specific place – and help animals and humans form internal maps. The brain typically replays the day’s activities when people or animals sleep, which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity, for example. Scientists used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept - and say it could one day be used in humans while they sleep (stock image) In the same way that humans sometimes remember things that didn’t actually occur, researchers have found that bees also misremember. It’s the first time that false memories have been observed in non-human animals. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) tested to see if bumblebees would confuse merged versions of patterns that had previously rewarded them with food, with the ones they had actually seen. They found that if they’d previously been shown a flower with black rings and then a yellow one, that they would later seek food rewards from a flower with yellow rings on it. This incorrect merging of long-term memories in bumblebees is similar to some types of misremembering information that have previously only been observed in humans. The researchers think that such memory errors are probably common in animals whose lifestyle involves regularly juggling multiple memories. Professor Lars Chittka, from QMUL’s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: ‘That people form false memories is well understood but it has never been seen in other animals before. ‘There are a lot of similarities between our own memories and those of other animals. ‘The more we know about the way that memory works in the animal kingdom the more we’ll be able to understand our own memory and the problems we have with it.’ He monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an ‘arena’ using electrodes, isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location. While the mice slept, they monitored the creature’s brain activity and when the specific place cell fired, an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward. When the mice woke up, they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling, showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists. While this is the first time a conscious memory has been implanted during sleep, experts have already managed to create subconscious associations in the minds of sleeping people – so that smokers associate cigarettes with the smell of rotten eggs, for example. Experts think that if subconscious learning has been forced on the mice while they slept, they would have explored the area in a more random way, instead of heading straight to the place they associated with reward. ‘The mouse develops a goal-directed behaviour to go towards the place,’ Dr Benchenane said. ‘It proves that it's not an automatic behaviour. What we create is an association between a particular place and a reward that can be consciously accessed by the mouse.’ He thinks it could take years for the technique to be adapted to implant different kinds of memories such as skills, for example, but hopes that it could be developed to alter traumatic memories in people. He believes that positive thoughts could be attached to negative memories to stop people having nightmares or dwelling on upsetting events. ‘If you can identify where in the brain a person is reactivating a phobia-associated experience, you might be able to create a positive association,’ he said. The study was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.","Scientists from the Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution in Paris, France implanted a new memory in the brains of mice .

"Scientists claim they are one step closer to creating a drug that can cure HIV. A team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognise the HIV virus. In their tests, they found that the technique could completely remove up to 72 per cent of cells that had been infected with HIV. A team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor-like machinery to recognise the HIV virus (pictured) CRISPR technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code . Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. The DNA cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure. But unlike UV rays that can result in genetic alterations, the Crispr system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome. When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. 'Evolution has led to some of the most astonishing mechanisms for protecting organisms against their natural pathogens,' says Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor of Salk's Gene Expression Laboratory in California. 'Understanding the immune responses by which bacteria protect themselves against viral infections has allowed us to engineer novel platforms for the targeting of devastating viruses, such as HIV, in human patients.' When a copy of the HIV virus sneaks into a human cell, it can cause havoc. It takes control of the cell's own molecular machinery to made copies of the virus's genetic material and then buries these copies in the cell's own genes. From there, the host's cell becomes an HIV factory, making new copies of the virus to spread throughout the body. Existing HIV drugs target individual steps of this lifecycle; some stop the virus from integrating into cells' DNA, for instance, while others try to stop the affected cells from producing more virus. The problem with these drugs, explains Hsin-Kai Liao, a research associate in the Izpisua Belmonte lab, is that they don't actually remove the copies of the virus that are hidden within cells' DNA. These copies can remain dormant for years and then activate again. 'Patients normally need to take drugs every day or every week for their whole lives, because of the HIV that can be latent,' says Professor Liao. 'This costs money, time and effort.' To combat this problem, the team turned to a molecular defence system called CRISPR that bacteria use to cut up foreign DNA at specified spots. Since its recent discovery, scientists have started using CRISPR to edit genes. But the researchers were also intrigued by its defensive ability and wondered if CRISPR could be programmed to slice and destroy viruses inside human cells. The new Salk study showed that the method is effective against active, full-length HIV rather than a shortened, inactive version of the virus. Pictured are the study team, from left: John Martlett, Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, Hsin-Kai Liao, Yuta Takahashi, Concepcion Rodriguez Esteban, Tomoaki Hishida and Mo Li . CRISPR uses bits of genetic material called guide RNAs to dictate its cuts, so the scientists developed guide RNAs that bound to unique spots on the HIV virus. They added CRISPR, the guide RNAs and other molecules needed for the system to work to immune cells that had been infected with HIV. They found that CRISPR successfully cut the right spots in HIV's genes, inactivating the virus. This resulted in the virus being completely removed from up to 72 per cent of cells. Not only did CRISPR chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell, but it also cut up HIV that was hidden and dormant within the cells' DNA. While other research groups have taken similar approaches in targeting CRISPR to HIV, the new Salk study showed that the method is effective against active, full-length HIV rather than a shortened, inactive version of the virus. The Salk team also illustrated in a more complete way how CRISPR targets HIV in living human cells, verifying that it works both before and after the virus is embedded in the genome. Not only did CRISPR chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell, but it also cut up HIV that was hidden and dormant within the cells' DNA . 'CRISPR can actually excise the virus out of the human genome,' Liao says. Next, Liao and his colleagues tried adding the CRISPR system to human cells before they becoming infected with HIV. 'Having the system in place, they showed, prevented an infection–CRISPR chopped up any copies of the virus before they could start replicating. More research is needed to determine how the technology could be used in human patients and whether HIV will quickly evolve to escape CRISPR. With that in mind, the team is studying the effectiveness of adding more guiding RNAs to the CRISPR mix so that the defence simultaneously recognizes more areas of the virus. 'The HIV virus can mutate very quickly,' says Liao. 'If we target multiple regions at the same time, we reduce the chance that the virus can develop resistance.'","Scientists trained scissor-like machinery of bacteria to recognise HIV .

"The FBI must continue to improve intelligence gathering efforts as national security threats are outpacing the agency's ability to counter them, according to a report released Wednesday. An audit of the agency requested by Congress noted the headway made since the September 11 attacks, which brought criticism that law enforcement agencies were not sharing information. The report said in many ways the agency still came up short, as worries continue that groups such as ISIS are exerting their influence on Americans and could strike on US soil. Criticized: A report requested by Congress noted the FBI's improvement since the September 11 terrorist attacks but knocked the agency failing to properly gather and analyze human intelligence. Pictured: FBI Director James Comey testifies . 'These threats are not just knocking on the door. They're in the room,' said former Representative Timothy Roemer. Roemer was a member of the original commission that prepared a report in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks, faulting the FBI and CIA for intelligence shortcomings. The newly commissioned report was tasked with reviewing how the FBI had responded to recommendations laid out in the original investigation and how it has handled counterterrorism over the last decade. It's release coincides with FBI Director James Comey's visit to Washington, where he has asked for $8.48billion to boost funding for new initiatives, including cyber activities. The report called for the agency to further integrate intelligence gathering and analysis, and tasked it with 'professionalizing' its intelligence analysts, strategically using analysts in specialized roles. The report emphasized the agency's development of human intelligence is not improving along with efforts to share intelligence among agencies. Scrutiny: The report coincided with Comey's trip to Washington to defend an $8.48billion request for extra funding in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee . 'This imbalance needs urgently to be addressed to meet growing and increasingly complex national security threats, including from adaptive and increasingly tech-savvy terrorists, more brazen computer hackers, and more technically capable, global cyber syndicates,' the report stated. The report also faulted leadership changes for slowing improvement. It recommended the FBI coordinate with private sector entities as a way to counter cyber threats. The report covered five terror plots that had occurred over the last several years, which includes the 2009 Fort Hood shooting and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Though it found communication and coordination hiccups between branches of the FBI, the report said there was no certainty the attacks could have been averted if these metrics were improved. It cited some cases where information that could have been leveraged to forecast attacks was not gathered or analyzed by the FBI. A 2012 rant at a mosque from Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnev wasn't caught by the FBI at the time, and Afghan-American cab driver Najibullah Zazi was not identified until his plan to blow up the New York City subway was thwarted, according to the report. 'What's written in there is not a surprise to anybody in the FBI `cause we have squeezed those cases trying to understand what could we do better,' Comey said.","An audit of the agency followed up on recommendations made in the wake of the September 11 attacks .

"Forget sanding in a clearing and squinting through the clouds for a glimpse of the eclipse, passengers on flights en route to Iceland got the view of a lifetime of the natural phenomenon. The flight path taken by the pilot of EasyJet's flight 6747 from Belfast on Friday shows an amusing squiggle as it approaches the Faroe Islands, one of just two places on Earth along with Norway's Svalbard archipelago where a total eclipse could be observed. With a cluster of planes appearing to linger around the archipelago between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, EZY6747's pilot gave those on board the Airbus A319 the best possible chance to capture the moment after taking off at 8.05am. The view from the flight deck of easyJet flight EZY1805 from Manchester to Reykjavik on Friday . A squiggly line marks the flight path of EasyJet's flight 6747 as it circled to get a view of the total eclipse . For some eclipse chasers, a final destination wasn't required as a number of private charters set off for the sole purpose of seeing the phenomenon which won't happen again in northern Europe until 2026. On Jet2.com, 57 passengers booking through Omega Holidays each had their own row of seats from which to view the solar eclipse after flying out of Glasgow Airport at 7.30am. They flew north of the Faroes at 38,000ft to ensure a cloud-free view of the eclipse with live commentary from astronomer Lee Sproats. The plane's pilot Captain Christopher Pollock said: 'I can honestly say that was one of the most amazing flights of my life. The total eclipse as viewed from 38,000ft north of the Faroe Islands from a chartered Jet2.com flight . 'What a special moment to witness and the view was just breathtaking. For the full impact of a total eclipse, you have to be inside the ""path of totality"", which is quite narrow, but also fast-moving because the planet is rotating. So you really have to be in the right place at the right time to get the best view – and thanks to Omega Holidays we were! I’ll definitely be putting my name down for any return flights in 11 years time!' Jet2.com say passengers came from as far as the United States for the unique round trip. It was a particularly special day for Daniel Bailey from Leicestershire, who was celebrating his 10th birthday. 'It was just amazing, makes me want to be an astronomer,' he said. 'This was the best birthday present in the world!' Daniel Bailey from Leicestershire said the eclipse flight through Omega Holidays was the best 10th birthday present he could have enjoyed . Passengers on flights EZY2295 from London Luton and EZY1805 from Manchester were given the same treat. 'Thanks for circling round the #SolarEclipse. Amazing views from the skies above the Atlantic,' posted the Twitter account for school tour group Rayburn Education with images of the view from flight 1805 from Manchester. A spokesman for EasyJet said the plane's circling was planned and entirely safe. 'The flight crews on our EasyJet flights to Reykjavik this morning performed a controlled and safe manoeuvre in order to allow passengers on both sides of the planes to have a grandstand view of one of nature's greatest events, a solar eclipse,' the EasyJet spokesman said. All of EasyJets flights into Keflavik International near Reyjavik that coincided with the eclipse were significantly later than their scheduled arrival times, not that the passengers seemed to mind. Flight EZY2295 from London Luton was 38 minutes late, EZY1805 from Manchester was 29 minutes late and EZY6747 from Belfast Aldergrove arrived one hour and five minutes later than planned in 'order to allow passengers on both sides of the planes to have a grandstand view of the solar eclipse'. ‘We have had a tide of extremely positive reactions from passengers, commending our crews. For some passengers this may be a once in a generation experience,' said a spokesman for the airline. ‘We’d like to apologise for any delay this might have caused.' Before the flights EasyJet claimed the view would be 'one of the closest and unobstructed views of a total eclipse anywhere in the world' and they delivered while people around Britain viewed a partial eclipse if they were lucky to see it through the forecast cloud cover. A Greek tourist in Torshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands, looks skywards as she awaits the eclipse . 'It's great that easyJet passengers will be in the right place at the right time on Friday and are set to be rewarded the best view anywhere in the world from 37,000 feet. 'We would encourage passengers to bring eclipse viewing specs with them and keep their window blinds open for the safest but most spectacular way to view it.' Dutch experimental astrophysicist Christoph Keller posted an image he said was taken through 'Polaroid sunglasses and a polarizer on the flight from Sao Paulo to Amsterdam.' The French Air Force's precision demonstation team  also saw it as a perfect time to take to the skies posting a series of images with the comment: 'Follow us in flight during the eclipse.' precision demonstration team .","Pilots performed a 'controlled and safe manoeuvre' to view total eclipse .

Wife: Al-Jumaili, his wife, Zahara (photographed), and Al-Jumaili's brother went outside of his Dallas apartment to take pictures of the snow around 11.30pm when tragedy struck . In a detailed account of the incident posted on Facebook by Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in the Dallas and Fort Worth area, described the attack. Salem writes that Al-Jumaili took cover behind a pickup truck when a group of five or six young African Americans opened fire. A bullet pierced through the truck and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest, Salem said. 'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.' Residents reported seeing two to four men entering the Walnut Blend Apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate prior to the shooting, CNN reported. An investigation is ongoing and police say it is unknown whether the incident was a hate crime. Al-Jumaili: Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, was fatally shot outside of his Texas apartment while taking pictures of his first snowfall . Refuge: Al-Jumaili (right) and Zahara (left) married just 16 months ago, and the two planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State . A LaunchGood fundraising page tells the touching story of Al-Jumaili and Zahara. The two married just 16 months ago, and planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State. Zahara relocated to Texas to be with family and Al-Jumaili stayed behind in Baghdad to save enough money to follow his wife. After a year of separation, the two reunited three weeks ago, ready to begin a new chapter in their lives, away from the horrors of ISIS and other terrorist groups, only to experience tragedy in America. Salem wrote on Facebook that only Al-Jumaili's stepfather, who lives in Dallas, is working and Al-Jumaili's death has left Zahara with not only an emotional burden, but a financial one as well. The fundraiser has raised more than $9,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund. Truck: Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when shots rang out, but a bullet pierced straight through the truck (photographed) and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest . Police say they have very little to go on in the investigation and are enlisting the help of the public to solve the crime. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment. The attack has some Muslim activists shaken up, the Los Angeles Times reports, with some pointing to the recent murder of three Muslim students in North Carolina. The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population, according to the Times, and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees.","Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, was shot dead outside his Texas apartment while taking pictures of his first snowfall on Wednesday night .

"A bus station which was dubbed the 'mouth of hell' by Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud will be demolished tomorrow. Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, East Midlands, opened nearly 40 years ago but after a new terminal was opened in the town last year the 'infamously ugly' building has lain redundant. It faced criticism soon after it opened in 1976 after mineral stalactites began forming inside and in 2005 it was voted third in a list of 12 buildings that should be demolished for a Channel 4 series. Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, East Midlands, opened in 1976 but will be reduced to rubble tomorrow . The programme, titled Demolition, was fronted by broadcaster McCloud when he compared the building to the 'mouth of hell'. It was described in the Lonely Planet guide as 'infamously ugly'. There were also concerns for the safety of the bus station after two people died when they were hit by buses inside the station in the 2000s. Kevin McCloud once described the building as the 'mouth of hell' on Channel 4's Demolition show . The three-storey building, which includes a car park and offices which have not been used for years, will be reduced to rubble tomorrow by demolition specialist DSM, which will 'blow it down'. David Macintosh, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said: 'It's funny because in the last couple of months, people have said ""We will miss it."" 'It's not very well-liked, and is now redundant. ""The mouth of hell' sums it up perfectly."" Alan Carr, who spent some of his childhood in Northampton, wrote on Twitter: 'Is that smelly cafe still there in the basement in Greyfriars bus station? You'd see people dry heaving before they got on their buses.' The four-acre site takes up a large part of the town centre, and the council has set up an exclusion zone - and is evacuating 414 nearby homes as a precaution. Northampton Borough Council is live-streaming the demolition of the building, and urged spectators to watch it online rather than in person. The council said the structure is costing taxpayers £500,000 in repairs every year, and it would take almost £30 million to renovate. Its demolition is part of Northampton's regeneration programme and plans for new retail and leisure schemes are being considered. The town's new bus station has also had its problems with police being called in to direct traffic after queues of buses formed.","Greyfriars bus station opened in 1976 but has lain redundant in last year .

"When Kim Kardashian unveiled those platinum blonde locks yesterday, her new style was met with mixed reviews. But the 34-year-old’s decision to hit the bleach bottle again is one I can understand. Kanye West says he prefers the reality star’s lighter locks and who can blame him, from Marilyn Monroe to Brigitte Bardot, we’re a society obsessed with iconic blonde bombshells. Hailed as the beauty idol of the 2010s, it’s no wonder Kim Kardashian decided to re-join the ranks of famous blonde stars. Scroll down for video . Rosy said changing her hair colour has made her feel as though she stands out from the crowd . Rosy, pictured left before dyeing her hair, says Kim Kardashian's new look 'takes a lot of guts' While her fashion sense is often questionable, there’s no denying Kim’s influence in the beauty stakes - she’s the woman that turned the world on to contouring, after all. A study last year by hair-care brand Schwarzkopf showed that blondes make up 30 per cent of the retail hair dye market and contribute to 60 per cent of salon business - those numbers are surely set to rise with Kim’s look sparking a wave of women going over to the lighter side. Hairdressers may say a drastic hair change like Kim’s is a sign of something dramatic going on in a person’s life, but that wasn’t the case for me when I decided to take the plunge from brunette to blonde last November. While I’ve been known to reach for reach for the hair dye immediately after a break up, going blonde wasn’t a spur of the moment decision but more a reflection of my realisation that life’s too short not to have fun. And do blondes have more fun? In my experience, definitely. Extreme new look: Rosy had her hair dyed at the Bleach London salon in Dalston by hairstylist Naoya . Rosy, pictured before, left, and after, right, said was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak . Rosy said she now gets lots more attention from men after going platinum . My hair was bleached at the Bleach London salon in Dalston by hairstylist Naoya. The whole process, including blow dry, took three and a half hours in total. As I had previously coloured my hair, it was treated as a colour correction rather than a virgin bleach. Naoya first applied a pre-lightener mixed with peroxide to the ends of my hair to lift the colour out, then after applied the mixture to my roots (as they process faster) to ensure it was all an even colour. The bleach was then washed off and a golden toner was applied to banish any brassy tones. I now get my roots done every 6-8 weeks to maintain the look. As a brunette I often felt mousey, invisible and way older than my 25 years. Sometimes I could even feel myself slowly blending into the background in social situations and no change of outfit or make-up seemed to make a difference. When my hairdresser Naoya at Bleach London suggested I’d suit a light blonde tone, I first balked at the idea, worried it would ruin the condition. Platinum seemed like a big step from the subtle tints, golden tones and buttery highlights I was used to. But when a friend of a friend dyed her natural brown locks a stunning bright blonde and I saw how happy she looked, I knew it was just what I needed. An extreme colour change takes a lot of guts and I applaud women like Kim for taking risks and not sticking to the same look. I don’t agree that she’s lost her signature style, if anything she stands out from the crowd even more. The first thing I noticed when I left the hairdressers was the amount of people suddenly staring at me, it was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak. Rosy says the most noticeable difference after her new look was how she was treated by men . Rosy said she went from 'mousey' (left) to being served first at a bar after going blonde (right) Kim Kardashian unveiled her new look with husband Kanye West at Paris Fashion Week yesterday . If you fancy having light locks, get ready for a lot of stares from strangers - bright hair is more uncommon so people tend to unconsciously let their gaze linger. My friends and family loved my new look but all agreed I looked like a completely different person - a sentiment shared by my colleagues at work who didn’t even recognise me when I walked into the office the next day. The most noticeable difference of all was the way men treated me. They say that gentlemen prefer blondes, and whether that’s true or not, they most certainly prefer me as one. While I would never base my self-worth on how appealing I am to the opposite sex, I must admit I now find it flattering to get served first at a bar or walk into a room to a flurry of turning heads. Rosy said she met her current partner - and found herself inundated with offers - after changing her hair colour . Rosy said there are downsides to being a blonde, left, but says she would never go back to being brunette . 1. Avoid daily shampooing to help hair retain moisture. 2. Get a trim every 8 weeks to refresh the cuticle. 3. Sleep on a silk pillowcase to reduce friction. 4. Keep heat styling for special occasions only. 5. Brush hair using a Tangle Teezer or Mason Pearson brush. After being single for six months, I also suddenly found myself inundated with offers and it’s no coincidence that the day after my blonde transformation I ended up meeting my current partner. But what I appreciate the most is how members of both sexes listen to me more in conversation. When I speak as a platinum blonde, people pay attention. Why? It’s more than my hair colour, it’s because I finally feel confident. It may be even more of a stereotype than the out-dated ‘dumb blonde’ jokes, but confidence really is the most attractive quality to possess. I didn’t just look like a different person, I felt like one. It was as if overnight I had become more outgoing, sociable and self-assured. Of course, there are downsides. Like the memes of Kim Kardashian circulating the internet, people have stopped me to ask if I’m wearing Daenerys’ wig from Game of Thrones or tell me I remind them of Legolas. Overall, it’s a small price to pay for feeling this great. I’ve gone blonde and I’m not going back.","Rosy Cherrington, 25, says changing hair colour made her more confident .

"A museum for gangster John Dillinger has residents of a small Indiana town choosing sides over the infamous gangster 80 years after his death. On one side are the citizens of Crown Point, pop. 28,000, who see tourism dollars in the collection of Dillinger artifacts that recently moved from the town of Hammond to the Historic Lake County Courthouse in Crown Point. On the other side are the town's supporters of Sheriff Lillian Holley, the first woman to carry the title in Indiana who became a national pariah after Dillinger duped her into setting him free using a piece of wood meant to look like a gun. Scroll down for video . Taking sides: A new John Dillinger museum in Crown Point, Indiana has the town taking sides. On one are the residents who applaud a potentially money-making new attraction. Opponents say it is a slap in the face to justice and to the state's first female sheriff who was duped into letting Dillinger escape . Infamous extradition: Seen here, in an infamous photo that would one day prevent Prosecuting Attorney Robert G. Estell from running for governor of Indiana, the state's first female sheriff Lillian Holley stands to the attorney's left with John Dillinger at the right after the gangster's extradition back to Indiana in 1934 . Holley died in 1994 at 103 after spending her life being protected by the people of Crown Point, writes the IndyStar. Her supporters maintain that a Dillinger museum is not only a slap in the face of justice but also an affront to women and an embarrassment to the town that was, for a time, infamous for having let Public Enemy No. 1 walk free. 'Here was this young widow who'd been embarrassed and humiliated,' local historian and director of the Old Sheriff's House and Jail museum Deborah Thill said of Holley, whose sheriff husband had died and left the position to her. 'Lillian was a kind person, and the town formed a human cocoon around her.' People like Thill are helping make sure that continues. Years ago, a local investor helped the town acquire some Dillinger artifacts expecting to place them in the Old Sheriff's House and Jail museum. But the museum said no. Now, the new Dillinger museum is located in the historic courthouse, instead of the actual site of the Dillinger escape. 'Our goal,' says Thill, 'is to turn this into a law enforcement museum, not a Dillinger museum.' Meanwhile, the South Shore Convention and Visitors Authority, the Courthouse Foundation and the city held the first of what will be two openings for the museum Tuesday. Dillinger escaped from the Old Sheriff's House and Jail, pictured here . John Dillinger was placed in the prison at Crown Point, Indiana while awaiting trial for the murder of East Chicago, Indiana police officer William Patrick O'Malley. At the helm of the town's sheriff's department was Sheriff Lillian Holley, who'd been appointed to serve out the term of her late sheriff husband after he died in the line of duty. The jail at the time had been deemed inescapable and became the command center for throngs of national press there to document Public Enemy Number 1's long-awaited trial. However, those plans were put on hold when Dillinger managed to escape the jail--and get away in Sheriff Holley's car, no less--without firing a single bullet. Some say Dillinger did it by fashioning a fake gun out of wood smeared with shoe polish. The supposed gun is housed in the Crown Point museum to this day. 'Sticking a fake wooden gun into the back of one guard after another, he locked each one up, then moved on,' a placard at the museum reads. 'At a nearby garage, a mechanic was taken hostage and the four drove off in the fastest car available — Sheriff Holley's Ford V-8.' Another theory asserts that someone corrupt within the prison helped Dillinger get a real gun. Dillinger remained free until July of 1934, when he was tracked down to Chicago and killed in a hail of police bullets while walking out of a movie. Source . Sheriff Holley (left), Prosecuting Attorney Robert G. Estell (center) and infamous gangster John Dilinger (right) Dillinger would evade police for only a few more months following his escape from Holley's jail, but in those months the widow sheriff was the butt of ridicule nationwide . It coincided with the 81st anniversary of the day the Depression-era bank robber escaped from the old Lake County jail, the Munster Times reported. 'We are pleased to bring you a small taste of what the museum will be in a few months,' SSCVA President and CEO Speros Batistatos told the crowd that filled the hall outside the museum. He said the grand opening for the finished product will be July 22, the anniversary of Dillinger's infamous end outside the Biograph Theater in Chicago. 'We are not here to glorify or say John Dillinger was a hero,' Crown Point Mayor David Uran said. 'There are a multitude of stories to tell in Crown Point, and this is a story we want to share with our residents and those who come to visit the city.' Marty Wheeler, chairman of the Courthouse Foundation board, said, 'I'm very excited about having all of you here. I think you will be very surprised at what you see. And remember there are stores at the other end of the hall, and that's the reason we brought the museum here.' The end of the Dillinger story is all that's depicted so far with diagrams of the layout planned for the future depicting the rest of his life. The museum, previously in the SSCVA Visitors Center in Hammond, will occupy 2,000 square feet on the lower level of the courthouse. The displays offered Tuesday included the wooden gun Dillinger used in his escape from the jail and descriptions of how he and many other bandits of that era met their deaths. Tool of his escape? The famous Dillinger escape gun  is displayed next to a photograph of John Dillinger posing with the wooden weapon at an exhibit at the new Dillinger Museum that will open in July at the old Lake County Courthouse in Crown Point, Indiana. Some say he duped Crown Point prison guards with the fake gun, others say he was slipped a real one by a crooked jail insider . Partially completed was a representation of a jail cell from that era with a wooden bucket prisoners had to use as a bathroom. 'If anyone thinks we are glamorizing a life, look at what we have here,' Batistatos said. Batistatos said painters will begin work soon on the rest of the project. The SSCVA is deciding whether to contract out remaining work or do it with staff assisted by union workers for the parts requiring more skilled labor as has been done so far. 'We have new space to fill at the visitors center (vacated by the museum's departure), so we have to be budget-conscious,' he said. While the new museum will have items not previously seen at the visitors center location, one item that will not be making the transition to new quarters is the black 1933 Essex Terraplane 8, which was used in the movie 'Public Enemies' starring Johnny Depp as Dillinger. The car, known as the preferred model for Dillinger to steal and own, will be auctioned off May 2 in front of the north entrance to the courthouse. Its value is estimated between $20,000 and $27,000. Instead of at the Old Sheriff's House and Jail--where the escape actually occurred--the Dillinger museum is housed here, at the Lake County Historic Courthouse. The folks at the jail believe the museum dishonors Sheriff Holley's memory and good deeds outside letting Dillinger free .","Crown Point, Indiana's historic county courthouse now houses a museum for the infamous gangster, who escaped from jail in the town in 1934 .

"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry  delivered a highly cautious assessment on Saturday ahead of the next round of nuclear talks with Iran, citing 'important gaps' in the way of a deal before an end of March deadline. At a news conference in Egypt, where he attended an economic discussion, Kerry also said a U.S. decision would come shortly on unblocking hundreds of millions in suspended military assistance for the Egyptian government. Three days before Israel's election, America's top diplomat expressed hope that any government voted into power 'meets the hopes for peace' in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaks at a news conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on Saturday. He said he's returning to nuclear negotiations with Iran with 'important gaps' standing in the way of a deal . But on the Obama administration's most important foreign policy priority - talks with Iran to curb its nuclear program - Kerry was circumspect. He said only a negotiated agreement could provide long-term assurance that Tehran would not develop nuclear weapons. But with a deadline just two weeks away, he could not say whether the United States and other world powers would be able to reach a framework accord with the Iranians or even were close. 'We have made some progress but there are still gaps, important gaps, and important choices that need to be made by Iran in order to move forward,' Kerry told reporters in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. 'The purpose of these negotiations is not just to get any deal,' he said. 'It is to get the right deal.' Speaking after a week of U.S. political fighting over the diplomatic outreach to Iran, Kerry lambasted Senate Republicans who signed an open letter to Iran's leaders suggesting any deal they reach with the administration could expire the day President Barack Obama leaves office. Such tactics, which Kerry called unprecedented, will inevitably raise questions among Iran and America's allies in the talks, he said. He said that in order to provide long-term assurance that Tehran would not develop nuclear weapons, more negotiations need to occur . The conflict between the administration and mainly Republicans in Congress has emerged as among the tensest subplots to the diplomatic effort. Because U.S. lawmakers can block the lifting of some penalties against Iran and potentially pass additional trade or financial restrictions, they hold the power to undermine an accord. They are pressing for at least a say in whether any deal the U.S. and its partners reach is acceptable. Negotiators are talking about freezing Iran's uranium and plutonium programs for at least a decade in exchange for a gradual easing of economic pressure on the Iranians. Many in Congress say the U.S. should hold out for greater dismantlement of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. But opponents of a deal have been vague about what types of continued nuclear activity - if any - they would deem acceptable. 'What's the alternative?' Kerry asked. 'In previous years when U.S. policy was not to talk to Iran and insist at the same time that they can have no nuclear program, whatsoever, the number of centrifuges skyrocketed. Every time negotiations have broken down in the past, Iran's nuclear program has advanced.' Negotiators are talking about freezing Iran's uranium and plutonium programs for at least a decade in exchange for a gradual easing of economic pressure on the Iranians . Kerry, who was schedule to travel Sunday to Lausanne, Switzerland, for several days of discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, noted the Islamic Republic's longstanding claims that it has no interest in assembling a nuclear arsenal. Its leaders have issued a fatwa, or formal religious ruling, against such weapons. The United States, he said, has 'great respect for the religious importance of a fatwa'. But negotiators need an agreement that translates that commitment into an agreement that can 'guarantee that Iran's program will be peaceful now and peaceful forever'. 'We still don't know whether or not we will get there,' Kerry said. 'It may be that Iran simply can't say yes to the type of deal that the international community is looking for, but owe it to the future of everybody in the world to try to find out.' On Egypt, Kerry said a decision would come 'very soon' on F-16 fighter jets, tanks and other materiel the Egyptians say the need to combat an extremist threat operating in the Sinai Peninsula and spilling over from lawless Libya. Kerry said at the conference that negotiations with Iran can not stop, because 'every time negotiations have broken down in the past, Iran's nuclear program has advanced' The aid was suspended after the military's 2013 takeover of the government. The U.S. administration considers its resumption critical for Mideast stability, but must first certify Egyptian progress on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, or issue a declaration that such aid is in the interests of U.S. national security. Ahead of Israel's national election Tuesday, Kerry emphasized how Democrats and Republicans alike have sought peace between Israelis and Palestinians for decades. The United States is hopeful that 'whatever the choice the people of Israel make,' peace efforts can resume. Kerry said he did not want anyone to misconstrue his comments as interference with the vote. Obama's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached a new low earlier this month when the Israeli leader sharply criticized American policy on Iran in an address before the U.S. Congress. Kerry said he could only repeat U.S. 'hopes that the choice that the people of Israel make will not only meet their needs domestically and their hopes in their country, but obviously meet the hopes for peace which I think everybody shares.'","U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said only a negotiated agreement could provide long-term assurance that Tehran wouldn't develop nuclear weapons .

Last week, Thomas McCormick, Chief of Detectives at the Sussex County Prosecutor's Office, said the alleged abduction may have been an attempt by Dohm to gain custody of the two youngsters. He added that authorities have uncovered information that suggests the kidnapping was planned - and that the two victims could be at risk 'based on their father's dependence on insulin', according to ABC.

'We believe that their [the boys'] safety could be at risk.' According to prosecutor Francis Koch, Dohm had allegedly asked his former wife for a few extra days with his sons so that he could fly them to Reno, Nevada, to visit 'his dying father', NJ.com reported. However, investigators later found that Parker and Jaxon's grandfather was not dying, while no legitimate travel plans were made, Ms Koch said. Arrest warrants were quickly issued. On February 20, a federal warrant for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution was put out for Dohm. Nine days earlier, a state arrest warrant had been issued for interference with custody, it is said. A vehicle matching the description of Dohm's Nissan Pathfinder was seen in the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, Maryland, early on February 6. There have been no further sightings. According to police, Dohm has changed the license plates on his vehicle a number of times. He has used the New Jersey license plate characters: K15DXS, ZKL24F, and S17CKV, it is reported.

"It used to be a landmark age when women crossed over from being youthful and desirable to being over-the-hill. But today turning 40, is no longer a harbinger of middle age but for many it's just another phase of our ever extending youth with all the anxieties of opportunities not taken and plans left undone. Here three generations of women discuss how they felt about the big 4-0, and how society's view of women as they age has changed for the better over their lifetimes. Sarah (top right) with her mother Helen (left), grandmother Mollie (centre) and one-year-old daughter Matilda, pose for a family selfie. The 39-year-old says talking to her mother and grandmother about turning 40 has helped her feel less downhearted about ageing, going grey and being more critical of her appearance . Sarah, right, with her mother Helen Ivens and one-year-old daughter Matilda . THE GRANDMOTHER . Mollie Guillaume, 87, is retired and lives in Chigwell, Essex with her sister, Joan, 84. She says: . 'Back then, once a woman turned 40 she was expected to dress in a more subdued way, get a shorter haircut and generally become quite staid in appearance. 'Nowadays of course it seems like anything goes on the wardrobe front until you die - I see some old biddies these days who look ridiculous, showing off their scrawny legs in clothes meant for teenagers and coated in thick, gaudy make-up. 'I've always liked wearing tailored, comfortable clothes in flattering colours so my appearance hasn't changed too much from birthday to birthday. 'I don't like the idea of getting older; I don't feel 87. But I've always eaten carefully, kept active, travelled the world and spent quality time with my family and friends - and I have my health after getting cancer in my 50s - so instead of moaning about it I just feel very, very lucky I'm still here. 'My daughter Helen looks in the mirror and can't believe there's an old woman staring back at her, but I'm used to it so it's not a shock for me any more. 'As my granddaughter hits 40, she should really be thinking ""I'm halfway done now, if I'm lucky, so let's enjoy this life!"" Four generations together: From left to right, Helen Ivens, mum Mollie Guillaume and Sarah with her son William, who's now three . THE MOTHER . Helen Ivens, 65, is retired and lives in Chigwell, Essex, with her husband Keith, 66. 'I didn't want a big party for my 40th birthday, so my husband took me for a romantic weekend in a Paris, without the children, who were 14, eight and two at the time. 'But I wasn't depressed. In fact I remember feeling happier than I ever had in my life. Turning 40 coincided with a great sense of relief that my life was stable and on an even keel after a difficult first half. 'In fact 40 was a great turning point for me, and it's been good ever since. 'The catchphrase at the time - on cards, badges and banners - was Forty and Over the Hill, so I was quite surprised, as the big day loomed, how not elderly I felt. 'When I was a teen, when someone turned 40 I considered them very much past it and on the verge of old age. But physically I looked and felt okay. 'I had a big Charlie's Angels perm and a penchant for shoulder pads and fuschia, but that was the style of the time. My daughter thinks I look better now. 'In the 1980s, when I turned 40, I was definitely the oldest mum at the school gates. The other fortysomethings waiting there were grandmas. Helen Ivens, now 65, with her daughter Sarah, who is about to turn 40, on holiday in the Cotswolds last year. Helen says that when she turned 40 in the 1980s, it felt like a new phase of her life was beginning, 'If you have good health and enough money to be comfortable, it can be a great phase of your life' Helen Ivens, centre, aged 40 with her children, from left:  James, William (sitting on her lap) and Sarah . 'But of course this is all different now, and my daughter Sarah is not unusual that she is turning 40 with a one-year-old daughter. 'Having a daughter who is turning 40 is quite a milestone for me. In fact, it's a bigger shock to the system than when I turned 40. 'In my head I still feel about 38, so to have a child of 40 is a startling reality check. But I'm excited for her to reach this landmark age. 'If you have good health and enough money to be comfortable, it can be a great phase of your life. In fact, in a way, life begins at 40. Helen Ivens holds her new granddaughter, Sarah's second child Matilda . THE DAUGHTER . Sarah Ivens, 39, lives in London with her husband Russell and children William, three, and Matilda, one. 'My dad recently told me that 60 is the new 40, so 40 must be the new 20. I think he was trying to cheer me up but I just thought ""Oh please no, I haven't got the energy to live my 20s again!"" 'But I think that has more to do with having two young children than the amount of candles I'm about to blow out on my birthday cake. 'It's been very reassuring to talk to my mother and grandmother about turning 40 though because I have been surprised at how downhearted it's made me feel. 'I feel a real sense of loss, about things gone by, opportunities not taken. I feel like I get to turn a giant egg timer over once more and then that's it. I'm half way done. 'But as my sensible grandma said to me ""darling, the alternative to turning 40 is much worse so just get on with it."" Mollie (second from right), with her daughter Helen (far left), sister Joan and granddaughter Sarah (far right) says when she turned 40 in 1968 women were expected to dress conservatively and become quite staid in appearance with a shorter haircut, despite the women's liberation movement sweeping across Britain . 'I've never paid much attention to my appearance but suddenly I'm studying everything in cruel, minute detail. 'In the last year I've gone quite grey and I've started to notice wrinkles and lines that I don't think were there before. They may have been of course, but I just wasn't looking for them. And I just don't feel as bouncy. 'My body definitely takes longer to recover after exercise, and that extra slice of pizza will now puff out the tummy that once stayed resolutely flat. 'Most of my friends have already turned 40 and I've noticed the trend to throw parties as big as weddings in a giant celebration of yourself. 'I love going to these things because you really see how far people have come. I normally get quite overwhelmed with emotion. 'My mum said she thinks me and all my friends, many of whom she's known for over 20 years, look better now than we ever have. I don't think she's just saying that. 'I think along with added wrinkles, we've added confidence - and certainly we're making better make-up and hairstyle choices.'","Mollie Guillaume, 87, turned 40 in 1968 as women's lib swept Britain .

"It may not look nearly as good as Pamela Anderson in a bikini on Baywatch, but a new type of drone could save your life if you get into trouble in the water. Ryptide is a lifeguard drone that can carry an inflatable life ring to a swimmer in under a minute, according to the developers. The system uses a specially adapted carrying device that can rush a life ring out over the water and drop it close to a swimmer in distress. Scroll down for video . The Ryptide drone (above) delivers a life ring that automatically inflates in the water to help swimmers in trouble. The device is being built by students at a school in Stamford, Connecticut . The rings are designed to automatically inflate as soon as they hit the water, helping swimmers to stay afloat until rescuers arrive. The engineers behind the project, who are based in Stamford, Connecticut, say the drone would be particularly useful for helping swimmers who stray into rip tide currents. Drones could prove invaluable in search and rescue operations as well as disaster scenarios where it is dangerous for relief workers to enter buildings. But currently quadcopters risk injuring humans with their blades and break easily upon light collisions because of their delicate, exposed parts. Now engineers have created the ‘world’s first collision-proof drone’ that has a spherical 'rollcage', meaning it can bounce around buildings like a ball. The Gimball drone uses obstacles to find its way around buildings, instead of avoiding them, so it could roll along a row of windows before locating an opening. Scientists from Switzerland’s Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne have won $1 million in a drone competition sponsored by the United Arab Emirates. ‘Gimball can safely fly indoors and in complex environments, is easy to fly, and can be operated close to humans,’ they claim on their website. Lifeguards rescue more than 10,000 swimmers from rip tide currents - strong currents of water that can drag swimmers out to sea. However they often carry a great deal of danger for the lifeguards themselves and account for 80 per cent of rescues they perform. Bill Piedra, a teacher at King Low Heywood Thomas school in Stamford and founder of Flying Robots LLC, began developing the Ryptide system with students in 2014. He said: 'Ryptide is a life saving drone accessory that can carry an automatically inflating life ring to a swimmer in distress in less than 30 seconds. 'The system can be attached to any drone capable of carrying a GoPro camera and brushless gimbal.' Mr Piedra and his team already have a working prototype of their system and are now running a crowdfunding campaign in an attempt to build commercial products. They say the final model of Ryptide will be able to carry up to four inflatable rings that can be dropped one at a time at the press of a button. It would allow life-guards to get help out to swimmers in trouble almost immediately while waiting for rescue boats or other vehicles to arrive. While it may not carry the glamour of a beachwear clad lifeguard running across the sand like in the popular TV series, it could mean response times are quicker. The system (shown in action above) can be attached to any drone capable of carrying a GoPro camera and brushless gimba . The drone is able to fly over a swimmer in distress and drop an inflatable life ring to help keep them afloat . Pamela Anderson (right) in Baywatch only had a boyancy aid and the odd speed boat to help rescue swimmers . Nick Smith, one of the students involved in the project, said: 'Currently the only solution to this problem is another human being risking their life to venture into the rip tide to save the swimmer in crisis. 'We plan to use drone technology to add to the arsenal of the lifeguard.' A ring can be attached to the drone assembly using vinyl loops which then release when hovering over the swimmer in distress. It is the latest in a number of drones being developed to help save people's lives in emergency situations. Students at Delft University of Technology in Holland have developed an Ambulance Drone to deliver a defibrillator to the scene of a heart attack. Mr Piedra and the Ryptide team have already tested their system in swimming pools, on the beach, lakes and even in a frozen river. They insist, however, they are not looking to replace lifeguards. They said: 'We're not proposing that this product could ever replace a trained lifeguard or take the place of other safety equipment. 'We're just hoping that our simple device can augment the water safety tools that are in use today.' They said as drones become more popular, the Ryptide system could also be installed along beaches so that drone users can quickly attach them to their machines in the event of an emergency.","Ryptide converts existing drones into a flying life-guard to help swimmers .

Milstein's Cruise Ships series gives a bird's-eye view of the huge floating holiday vessels. The New York-based photographer uses high-resolution camera equipment to capture views from a helicopter with an open door. They include the Disney Dream, which features a nine-hole mini-golf course, 11 nightclubs and lounges and the first 'water roller coaster': a 765-foot long winding waterslide called the AquaDuck that goes through the ship's funnel.

And this is how the majestic cruise ships look from the side as they force their way through the sea, the Majesty of the Seas on the left, and the Freedom of the Seas on the right . Milstein also shot the fourth largest cruise ship in the world in the form of the Royal Caribbean Freedom of the Seas. The $800 million vessel can accommodate 3,634 passengers and 1,300 crew on 15 passenger decks. Mr Milstein said: 'Giant cruise ships, over three football fields long, have become unique floating cities. Photographed symmetrically from directly above in very high resolution, the large gallery prints, up to 74 inches, show the viewer a detailed view not commonly seen. 'The ships can be seen with their passengers lounging on deck chairs, playing on water park slides, putting greens, running tracks, and basketball courts. They have a curious beauty and tell us something about how we as a culture form instant communities for shared recreation and relaxation.

"A remote island in the Pacific whose residents are descendants of the swashbuckling British sailors and Tahitian women immortalised in the Mutiny on the Bounty movies is set to lose its right to self-rule. Norfolk Island, 900 miles east of the Australian coast and settled by the relatives of Fletcher Christian and other HMS Bounty mutineers in 1856, has about 1,800 residents and has governed itself since 1979. But it is effectively bankrupt and on Thursday, Canberra said it would introduce legislation next week to scrap the Australian territory's parliament. The former military barracks in Kingston, the capital of Norfolk Island, which is set to lose its right to self-rule . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has come under fire for the move - with the descendants of the mutineers leading the opposition. If it passes, the island's legislative assembly will be temporarily replaced by an advisory council, before local government elections in 2016. Personal and business tax will be introduced from July 2016 and residents will in return be able to access social security, healthcare benefits and services enjoyed by Australians. The island, which has it's own native dialect called Norfuk, will no longer run its own immigration, customs, quarantine, education, police and social services, according to The Telegraph. Australia's assistant regional development minister, Jamie Briggs, said the changes were long overdue and it was not sustainable to ask a community of just 1,800 to deliver local, state and federal services. He said the infrastructure on Norfolk Island was run down, the health system is not up to standard and the laws are out of date. 'The community overwhelmingly supports reform and is of the view that the current governance arrangements are not suitable,' he said, adding that Norfolk Island was effectively in administration and reliant on Australian bailouts. 'It is diabolical -- it is quite concerning that it's been left for so long,' he added. Norfolk Island: It is 900 miles east of the Australian coast and settled by the relatives of Fletcher Christian and other HMS Bounty mutineers in 1856 . Romanticised: Actor Mel Gibson played Fletcher Christian in the 1984 film The Bounty, based on the true story . Norfolk Island Chief Minister Lisle Snell said it was unfair to impose such a decision on the tiny outcrop, just five miles long by three miles wide. 'Norfolk Islanders will lose their identity, they will lose their way of life,' Mr Snell told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Most of the population are descendants of the mutineers who set Captain William Bligh adrift from British Royal Navy ship HMS Bounty in 1789. The mutiny gained such a romantic gloss that chief mutineer Christian has been portrayed by a series of Hollywood heartthrobs over the years, including Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, Marlon Brando and Mel Gibson. The mutineers settled in Tahiti but later fled, along with their Tahitian women, to remote Pitcairn Island to escape arrest. Some 60 years after arriving on Pitcairn, almost 200 descendents of the original mutineers relocated to Norfolk Island to avoid famine. Queen Victoria granted them the right to settle in the abandoned former penal colony. Forefather: The bulk of the island's ancestors arrived in the late 1700s when the HMS Bounty - the British naval vessel on which a mutiny occurred in 1790 - washed up on the isle, led by Fletcher Christian (pictured)","Residents of Norfolk Island are the descendants of HMS Bounty mutineers .

"Australian teenage jihadist Jake Bilardi was expressing anti-Western sentiments years before he fled to the Middle East . Australian teenage jihadist Jake Bilardi was expressing anti-Western sentiments years before he fled to the Middle East to fight with terror group Islamic State. In comments posted about news stories and opinion pieces, Bilardi pointed out the evils of Australia and the United States. Earlier this week, Fairfax Media revealed a 'Jonathan Edwards', who was thought to be a Briton when he appeared in a photo brandishing a rifle between two bearded men in front of a black IS flag last year, was in fact an 18-year-old from Melbourne. Bilardi is a high school drop-out who attended Craigieburn Secondary College - in the Victorian capital's north. A collection of his comments seen on the website, Disqus, showed the teenager was an avid reader of Al Jazeera. They date back up to four years ago and most of them showed him weighing in on Islamic issues. In response to another commenter, Bilardi tells them to 'get a better education on the real teachings of Islam' before airing their opinion in May 2011. 'I am not a muslim [sic] but you see I am not a pathetic loser who doesn't know anything outside of their own home and I actually have a life I don't just go on the internet to abuse people and their beliefs,' the 18-year-old wrote. This came a year before the teenager, who has been dubbed the 'White Jihadist', converted to Islam and started worshipping at Melbourne mosques, according to Fairfax Media. Later in the year, Bilardi hit out at an American who he accused of Islamophobic behaviour. 'The CIA funded Al-Qaeda, the US government funded the Taliban. They brought this on themselves. You are a prime example of an Islamophobe,' Bilardi said. 'Saying ""maybe if Muslims didn't attack America"", you do realise that less than 1% of Muslims are terrorists and that Islamic terrorism only makes up 6% of global terrorism.' Bilardi added Americans were being influenced by local media, saying the same happened to Australians. 'If you're smart enough and can think for yourself you can actually realise that most of the stuff you are told are lies,' he said. Earlier this week,  a youthful Islamic State fighter posing with a rifle was identified as Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi . Jake Bilardi's aunt said the entire family was devastated by her 18-year-old nephew joining ISIS . A Craigieburn schoolmate was shocked because Bilardi 'really kept to himself and didn't cause trouble' 'America is supposed to be a land of freedom, but... the CIA can listen in on phone calls from anyone in the country, cameras have been set up on every street, people have been arrested just for being Muslim, just shows what scum are running the country.' The teenager was an avid reader of Al Jazeera and weighed in on Islamic issues in the comments section . Bilardi also accused American soldiers of 'always killing innocent civilians' in Afghanistan and Iraq, saying they were bombing and shooting them 'just for fun'. 'They are sick twisted mental patients who don't deserve to be allowed outside ever again,' he wrote. 'Then everyone gets angry when another boat full of Asylum Seekers comes into Australian waters. 'They are not only fleeing the brutality of militias and the Taliban, they are also fleeing the brutality of the Western forces.' These comment emerge as the family of Bilardi reveal they are devastated by revelations he is now fighting with the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Iraq. Speaking outside her Melbourne home, Bilardi's aunt said they were struggling with the news the skinny 18-year-old had joined the terrorist organisation and had issued threats against his homeland. She was joined by former schoolmates, who are still in shock at the teenager's transformation from awkward teenager to radical, gun-totting terrorist. ‘How are we supposed to feel? It is devastating, just devastating,’ Bilardi's aunt told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I mean, it’s my brother’s son, you are talking about.' Bilardi's aunt said the family feels like they are being harassed as a result of her nephew's radical move . Asked how the young man's father was coping with the news and his auntie's emotional response was: ‘well, he’s not’. ‘We feel like we are being harassed because of this. It’s not about me, it’s my brother’s son.' Bilardi's former schoolmates at Craigieburn Secondary College also described their shock at describing the awkward's teen conversion to terrorism. A schoolmate, who asked not to be named, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Mate, I’m shocked at what he’s done. ‘No one at school saw this coming, we can’t believe it, he was quiet, really kept to himself and didn't cause trouble there - our parents are upset too.' In a series of tweets around Christmas time, Bilardi purportedly threatened more attacks following the Martin Place siege . In this message, Bilardi is referring to a call by an Islamic State religious leaders to commit graphic crimes against Americans, Frenchmen or their allies, including Australians . Neighbours too have been caught by surprise, with one admitting that ‘I had no idea that sort of thing could happen, not here – it’s terribly sad but I’ll keep my eyes open from now on, that’s for sure’. The 18-year-old sent a series of sick tweets to federal police gloating about future terror attacks on Australia. In one of the messages, Bilardi threatened that the Sydney Lindt café siege was ‘just the beginning for your dogs’. Bilardi described himself as a 'revert' to Islam who was 'tall, white, skinny, long hair' In August, Bilardi reported that he had arrived in the Iraqi city of Ramadi after 'making jihra' (or departing) The tweets, which were first revealed by Daily Mail Australia in December, also showed he was considering returning home to follow an Islamic State leader’s order to kill disbelievers, including Australians, by any means possible. ‘That’s twice now I’ve seriously considered coming back and following Sheikh Adnani’s fatwa in Australia,’ he wrote. In October, al-Adnani released an audio message where he implored his followers to commit graphic crimes against 'disbelieving American (sic), Frenchman or any of their allies. 'Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,' al-Adnani said. And in another Twitter message, reportedly written this week, he said he would another attack would 'make 9/11 look like child's play.'","Jake Bilardi made anti-Western comments years before he went to Iraq .

Mr Greste addressed the minister, thanking her for her involvement in his case and her constant pioneering for his release. 'Your personal involvement and the involvement of a lot of Australia's politicians really made a difference to all of us in prison because it meant that our cause wasn't personal. 'It wasn't just about us against the Egyptian government - we had the backing of the entire Australian government and indeed the Australian people and that meant more than you can possibly imagine,' he said. The 49-year-old Al Jazeera journalist landed back on Australian soil in early February after spending 400 days in jail. He was convicted in 2013 after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi. The 49-year-old Al Jazeera journalist landed back on Australian soil in early February after spending 400 days in jail . Greste was released from prison and deported after a presidential 'approval,' according to an Egyptian prison official and the nation's official news agency. The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year. During his speech, Mr Greste  brought up his ongoing trial and that of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed. 'The way that this trial seems to be going  is encouraging' Mr Greste said. 'We've learned to take nothing for granted. Things are positive, we know we've done nothing wrong and we've broken no law.' He also said that his ethnicity played a huge role in his release and it is a fact that cannot be ignored. Mr Greste was released from an Egyptian prison in early February . Ms Bishop stood up when the audience applauded her efforts to secure Mr Greste's release . However he said he is coping well following his release and is settling back into his normal life. 'What's become evident since I got out is the scale of the campaign,' he said. 'I'm not sure that I have coped. I feel a little bit like the rabbit in the headlights' 'This hasn't damaged me. I'm going to stick my neck out and guess one of you had imagined what it would be like for you in prison. 'Every single one of us is far stronger than we give ourselves credit for. 'I discovered my limits are further than I ever thought they would be' Mr Greste also thanked Griffith College for delivering 'around 13kg' of academic work to the embassy so he could complete his Masters in International Relations.

"A 28-year-old man has been indicted in the murders of an elderly couple who believed they were meeting him to buy their dream car. Ronnie 'Jay' Towns, who was arrested on January 26, was formally charged with multiple counts, including malice murder, felony murder and armed robbery, in Telfair County, Georgia on Monday. Towns allegedly shot Marietta couple, Elrey 'Bud' Runion, 69, and his wife June, 66, after he responded to Mr Runion's Craigslist post seeking his dream car. The grandfather was looking for someone willing to sell their 1966 Ford Mustang convertible; he had bought the same model after returning from the Vietnam War decades ago. Scroll down for video . Indicted: Ronnie 'Jay' Towns, pictured in court in January, has been indicted in the deaths of an elderly Georgia couple. They were killed after Towns allegedly told them he had a car they were interested in buying . After receiving a response from a potential seller, the couple set out for Telfair County to check out the car. They were last seen taking their evening trip on January 22. According to the indictment, Towns met the couple and, brandishing a weapon, stole their phones, Mr Runion's wallet, his wife's purse and  the couple's SUV, the Macon Telegraph reported. Their SUV was found submerged in a pond near Towns' home  several days later, and the couple's bodies were found along a nearby dirt road. They had been shot in their heads. Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson has previously said that robbery appears to be the motive for the killings. He said investigators found no evidence he had the sort of car the couple had been seeking. On Monday, Towns' attorney, Franklin J. Hogue, told the Macon Telegraph that his client, who worked in construction and has a wife and a two-year-old daughter, had not confessed to anything. Killed: Bud and June Runion, who had been married for 38 years, were found shot dead along a dirt road in Georgia in January, several days after they left their home to meet a potential car seller . Beloved: The couple, who ran their own charity, left behind three daughters and three grandchildren . Hogue called Towns, who has no prior criminal record, 'very courteous and polite'. Towns will return to court on April 9 for a bond hearing and on June 25, he will appear at an arraignment, where he will plead guilty or not guilty to the charges. At that hearing, prosecutors will also reveal if they plan to seek the death penalty. The beloved couple, who had been married 38 years, left behind three daughters and three grandchildren, according to their obituaries. They ran a charity called Bud's Bicycles which had helped people in need from storm-damaged Alabama towns and impoverished pockets of West Virginia to their hometown in suburban Atlanta. 'He said, ""You can't take money with you when you're gone,""' the couple's daughter, Brittany Patterson, told the Associated Press in January. 'You might as well spend and enjoy it.' Dream car: Mr Runion had posted an advert on Craigslist looking for a 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible - a car he had bought after returning from Vietnam decades earlier. Towns allegedly told them he had one . Found: The couple's SUV, pictured, was found submerged in a pond near Towns' home several days later . She recalled how, years ago, Runion drove past two young girls sorting through a Dumpster on Christmas Eve. He fixed up two bicycles belonging to his own girls and delivered them as gifts. It was the beginning of 'Bud's Bicycles,' a charity run loosely out of Mount Paran Church of God in Marietta. Runion met his wife, a teacher, at the church in the 1970s. Neighbors said the Runions built a shed in their backyard to house the bikes. Their donations eventually expanded to include food, household and school supplies, coats and blankets. 'Basically, he had a food pantry in the basement of their house,' Patterson said. She added that her father had served in Army's 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam, though he never talked to her about the experience in detail. 'He's a survivor and fighter, and I know he wouldn't have gone out without fighting and trying to protect my mother,' she said. Charged: Towns, a married father, has not admitted to the murders and will enter a plea this summer .","Ronnie 'Jay' Towns was formally charged with malice murder and armed robbery, among other counts, in Telfair County, Georgia on Monday .

"The NHS is helping launch a new generation of apps to help people cope with stress, anxiety and depression – just by using their mobile phones. GPs will be able to prescribe the apps to patients put off by the prospect of talking to a counsellor. Health chiefs believe they will also help millions of people unwilling to go to a doctor in the first place. Tim Kelsey, the Government’s ‘digital health tsar’, said he wanted to produce ‘a sort of NHS-endorsed app store for mental health’, hosted on the NHS Choices website. A new generation of apps has been launched to help people cope with stress, anxiety and depression – just by using their mobile phones . But he admitted many would question whether screens could ever be as effective as face-to-face therapy, and stressed it was not a question of one or the other. He said: ‘If people want and need one-to-one counselling, then that’s absolutely what they will get. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression worldwide. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease, it said. GPs will be able to prescribe the apps for mobile phones to patients put off by the prospect of talking to a counsellor . At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. Suicide results in an estimated 1 million deaths every year, the WHO warns. In recent studies, depression has also been found to affect the way that people experience time. Research found that time seems to pass extremely slowly or even stand still when a person suffers from depression. Dr Daniel Oberfeld-Twistel, of  Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, said: 'Psychiatrists and psychologists in hospitals and private practices repeatedly report that depressed patients feel that time only creeps forward slowly or is passing in slow motion. 'We found strong indicators that in depressed individuals the subjective feeling of the passage of time differs from the ability to assess the actual duration of external events.' His team looked at the results from 16 individual studies in which 433 depressed people and 485 non-depressed people participated. In the studies, the participants were asked to estimate the duration of periods of time. The results obtained for the depressed subjects were exactly the same as those for the healthy ones without any relevant statistical difference. 'We found strong indicators that in depressed individuals the subjective feeling of the passage of time differs from the ability to assess the actual duration of external events,' concluded Dr Oberfeld-Twistel. He added his team identified several aspects of the relation between depression and time perception that have not yet been investigated adequately. Little is actually known about the effects of antidepressants and psychotherapy, or how patients with bipolar disorders compared to non-bipolar depression assess the passing of time. Future studies need to clearly differentiate between the subjective perception of the passage of time, and a person's ability to estimate the precisely defined lengths of time, he added. Flintoff, once almost as well known for his partying ways as he was for his cricketing skills, spoke candidly about his battles with mental illness and alcohol earlier this month on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! The 37-year-old also casually mentioned he no longer indulges with alcohol, and when asked why explained: 'I genuinely thought I had enough of it... I suffer with depression and it doesn't help at all, [you] just hit rock bottom afterwards.' Moment of realisation: The athlete and media personality revealed that he realised he struggled with the mental illness when he did a documentary on depression in sports . Freddie said that he still goes out on the town but that there's no alcohol involved when he does, telling that after one drink, 'you kind of drink to change how you feel and it's just bad.' 'Life's so much easier with not having any... the things that tend to go wrong are drink fuelled.' The athlete and media personality revealed that he realised he struggled with the mental illness when he did a documentary on depression in sports. 'I never knew what it was and I've always never said anything, and speaking to other people I identified with how I felt and I could sort it out, treat it.'","The NHS is launching phone apps to help people cope with depression .

"As holiday companies cancel trips to Tunisia’s capital following this week’s massacre of 20 foreign tourists at a museum, the threat Islamic State could pose to British holidaymakers has been brought sharply into focus. The harrowing revelation that a Shropshire woman died in the attack in what is regarded as a moderate Islamic nation has raised the possibility that the influence of these hate-filled terrorists has spread to other African and Mediterranean countries popular with UK holidaymakers. With the Easter holidays near, many British people must now question whether once apparently safe destinations have been infected by the barbaric Islamic State ideology. Gun guard: Egypt (security forces pictured) has high security at its prime tourist resorts and at the Pyramids . A spokeswoman for travel watchdog ABTA said that while British tourists tend to be quite resilient and have a ‘level-headed’ view of terrorist threats, holidaymakers should consult the Foreign Office before travelling. But how safe are traditional destinations for British travellers? TUNISIA . The shootings in Tunisia, which has a fledgling democracy, could severely damage the country’s tourism trade. Its holiday industry had made an impressive recovery since the Arab Spring in 2011. That year, 408,000 British nationals visited, rising to about 420,000 last year. After Wednesday’s attack, the Foreign Office issued advice not to go to the area surrounding the museum ‘until further notice’. While 6,500 UK tourists in Tunisia are mainly in the coastal resorts (where security is higher), holiday operators such as Thomson and First Choice have stopped day excursions to the capital. The Foreign Office classifies the threat of terrorism as ‘high’ across all of Turkey, advising against all travel to borders with Syria (pictured, Turkish soldiers stand guard on the Turkish-Syrian border) TURKEY . More than two-and-half million Brits fly to Turkey each year. While most visit Mediterranean resorts, many head for Istanbul, its cultural and historical heart. In recent months it has emerged that British youngsters infatuated with Islamic State have flown there and travelled south to slip into war-torn Syria. While most popular resorts are hundreds of miles from the Syrian border, there are still active terrorist groups in the whole country, some inspired by IS. The Foreign Office classifies the threat of terrorism as ‘high’ across all of Turkey (the same as in France following the Charlie Hebdo shootings), advising against all travel to borders with Syria. Last year, a car bomb at a petrol station near a border-crossing killed dozens of people. In January, a banned Marxist group used a suicide bomber to kill a policeman in Istanbul’s Sultanahmet, near the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia museum, the city’s most famous attractions. EGYPT . Resorts such as Sharm el Sheikh on the Red Sea have made Egypt a top winter sun destination for British families. At one point 9,000 UK visitors were at that resort on any single day during peak season. But the country has been rocked by political turmoil since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011. After the country descended into military rule after the overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood, the number of tourists visiting dropped by 25 per cent. Political demonstrations, sometimes leading to violence, are commonplace. An Egyptian soldier stands guard in Cairo's Tahrir Square. The Foreign Office says that terrorist attacks continue to be planned throughout Egypt, although they are aimed at security forces in Cairo and Alexandria . The political instability has led to a series of deadly bomb attacks in the capital, Cairo, usually targeting soldiers, police and businesses. But, the influence of Islamic State in the country is increasing. Last September, an IS spokesman issued a chilling online call to arms to Egyptian radicals saying: ‘If you can kill a disbelieving American or European . . . including the citizens of the countries that entered into a coalition against the Islamic State, kill him.’ In November the Sinai-based, Al Qaeda-inspired Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (ABM) group pledged allegiance to IS. And last year, a suicide bomber blew up a bus killing three South Korean pilgrims on a trip to St Catherine’s Monastery near the Egypt-Israeli border crossing. Tour operators halted excursions to the monastery. The Foreign Office advises against all travel to North Sinai, and only essential travel to much of South Sinai. However, holiday resorts including Sharm el Sheikh, Sharm el Maya, Hadab, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq are deemed safe because of the high security patrols and vehicle checks. Anyone landing at Sharm el Sheikh or Hurghada airports cannot fail to spot the armed military presence. The advice adds that terrorist attacks continue to be planned throughout Egypt, although aimed at security forces in Cairo and Alexandria. You are also advised not to go near the Libyan border or anywhere remote in case of kidnapping. Jordan (pictured, Jordanian security forces outside the Iraqi embassy in Amman) has borders with Syria and Iraq. Recently, there has been growing concern that Islamic State is garnering support there . The Kenyan cities of Nairobi and Mombasa have seen grenade attacks and shootings at public gatherings . MOROCCO . In 2011, Morocco’s reputation as a country relatively free from extremism was shattered when an explosion ripped through a Marrakesh restaurant in a popular tourist spot. In total, 17 people perished and 20 were injured when a bomb hidden in a handbag detonated at the Argana café. Most of those killed were tourists, including one Briton and a group of French students — one only ten. It was the first major terror attack in the country for eight years. About 400,000 Britons visit the country each year, often to see Marrakech, as well as Fez and Casablanca. While the Foreign Office warns of a ‘general threat’ from terrorism — the same it gives for America and Canada — it says the government there has recently raised its level of vigilance due to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Concern about the possible influence of IS was compounded last year when it released a video featuring eight Moroccan IS members who said they ‘intend to bring jihad to Moroccan soil’. DUBAI . This emirate on the south-east coast of the Persian Gulf is the financial and tourist hub of the United Arab Emirates. Holidaymakers who have booked to go to Tunisia will likely be feeling nervous, but experts advise checking your travel insurance small print before changing or cancelling you booking. Most tour operators take their advice from the Government’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It offers travel guidance for all countries, and flags up when areas are too dangerous. Green means all is fine amber means all but essential travel should be avoided, and red means you shouldn’t travel there under any circumstances. While this week’s horror in the Tunisian capital Tunis is unsettling, Bob Atkinson, of Moneysupermarket, points out that the country’s beach resorts will still be considered safe. Tunisia’s coast is shown in green — except in the far south east towards the border with Libya. The west of the country bordering Algeria and the south neighbouring Libya are amber or red. Situations such as these highlight why it’s so important to take out your travel insurance as soon as you book your trip, instead of waiting until the last minute. Unfortunately, if an area is still classed as safe to travel then your insurance policy won’t cover you if you incur fees for changing or cancelling your booking. Conversely, if you travel to a destination which has been flagged as unsafe you’ll invalidate your insurance. ■ Find FCO travel information at www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice . About a million UK tourists visit every year. While Islamic terrorists have largely left it alone, the government said it foiled a plot in 2012. The Foreign Office again says there is a ‘general’ threat of terrorism which could target ‘British interests’, adding that ‘attacks can’t be ruled out and could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners’. JORDAN . For more adventurous travellers, Jordan has become increasingly popular. Even no-frills airline flights travel there, taking people to see ancient sites such as Aqaba, Amman and Petra, as well as the Dead Sea. The country does, however, share borders with Syria and Iraq. Recently, there has been growing concern that Islamic State is garnering support there. In February, the U.S. Embassy published a warning after receiving information that up-market shopping malls in Amman would be targeted, probably in a terrorist attack similar to the shooting in the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya. Although, the Jordanian government stepped up security patrols, American embassy staff and their citizens were advised to avoid shopping centres. The Foreign Office says there is only a ‘general’ threat of terrorism in Jordan. KENYA . The capital Nairobi and Mombasa have had spates of grenade attacks and shootings at public gatherings. Six British nationals were among those killed in the Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi in 2013. The Foreign Office says there is a ‘high’ risk of terrorism, advising against travelling near borders with Somalia, where the Al Shabaab militant group is based and kidnappings of Westerners are more likely. Referring to the Westgate shootings it says ‘further attacks are likely’, adding that coastal areas where many beach resorts are have also been targeted.","Holiday companies cancel trips to Tunisia after 20 foreign tourists killed .

"A selfless daughter who surprised her ailing father with the gift of life after offering to donate him her kidney is desperately trying to raise the $30,000 the family needs to pay for the procedure. Felicia Mulero, who lives in Kansas with her young son, knew her father Herminio Mulero, 50, was battling stage-five kidney disease in Florida. But instead of letting him wait for a kidney on the transplant list, the 24-year-old quietly underwent tests to see if she could be a viable match for his much-needed organ donation. 'It's so amazing to me that I can help save my dad; I can help save a life - and it's my dad's,' Felicia explained in a video on the GoFundMe page her family created to raise money for the costs surrounding the surgery. Priceless gift: Felicia can be seen cuddling up with her father Herminio Mulero. The 24-year-old secretly planned on giving him her kidney but waited to see if she was a match before sharing the life-saving news . Family ties: Felicia and Herminio shared a special moment on the beach. The 50-year-old dad has been battling stage-five kidney disease in Florida and was awaiting an organ donation on the transplant list . Herminio, who has been suffering from kidney problems for the past seven years, has been relying on daily dialysis to keep him alive as he awaits an organ donation. 'The waiting list could take months, years you really don’t know they have to find a match,' he told Bay News 9. He had no idea that his daughter was secretly going through the process to give him her kidney. Herminio's wife Kathleen explained to the outlet that Felicia matches four markers when most children only match three out of six. The father-daughter duo are currently going through the final stages of testing to make sure that she can proceed with the organ donation. 'I’m very thankful to have a beautiful daughter who has very compassionate heart,' Herminio said. While Felicia's selfless donation will most likely save her father's life, the family also has financial worries to consider. Say cheese: The father-daughter duo happily smiled for this family photo. The family is currently trying to raise $30,000 on their GoFundMe page to pay for the costs associated with the surgery . Close ties: Herminio and Felicia posed on a bench during one of their visits. She is determined to be the one to save her dad's life . Last month, the family created their GoFundMe page in hopes of raising $30,000 for the expenses not covered by Herminio's insurance, in addition to the cost of Felicia's travel and recovery. The page states that Herminio needs at least $8,000 worth of emergency medications before they will schedule the surgery. He will also require expensive medications after the procedure. Meanwhile, Felicia, who is also parent, will need money to travel, pay her bills and find childcare for her son while she recovers. Although the family has reached nearly $5,000, they are still far from their original goal. On the page, Felicia noted that she and her father have always been close, even after she moved to the Midwest when she was 13 years old. She added that the distance between them has been become especially difficult because of his illness. 'I cannot wait to get through the rest of these tests to know for sure that I can do this and I can save him and I won’t be crushed because he’s not going to get the transplant,' she said. 'I’m going to be the one who’s going to do it, and I’m going all the way in - 100per cent, full force, it’s going to happen.'","Felicia Mulero, 24, from Kansas, secretly went through the testing process to see if she would be a viable match for her dad .

"A British woman has spoken of her shock at discovering her mother is an influential jihadist who helps suicide bombers and is known as Mama Shabab. Amal Farah was stunned when police knocked on her door to tell her that Faduma Jama had become a pivotal member of Al Shabab, the Somali jihadists behind the Westgate mall massacre in Nairobi. Mother-of-two Ms Farah had cut off all contact from her strict Muslim family five years earlier and fearful for her life, had changed her number, her name and hidden her whereabouts. Scroll down for video . Shocking discovery: Amal Farah (left) was stunned when police knocked on her door to tell her that her mother Faduma Jama (right) had become a pivotal member of Al Shabab . Describing the moment she was told, Ms Farah told The Sunday People: 'The man and the woman were from the anti-terror unit. It was utterly devastating.' Known as Mama Shabab, Faduma Jama allegedly ran a safe house for suicide bombers and Western fighters recruited into the militant Islamic organisation. The police officers told Ms Farah, 34, to Google her mother's name if she wanted to know why she was in trouble. She said: 'It was not until I got to work that I could Google her name. There were all these pictures of people injured by suicide bombs. 'As I read about what she'd done I felt so alone. I couldn't just turn to my colleagues and say, ""Guess what? My mum's a wanted terrorist."" 'I couldn't believe my own mother was involved. I cried non-stop for days after that.' Loving: Amal, pictured left with her mother, was born in the Somalian capital Mogadishu but now lives in Britain. Pictured right, Faduma Jama, now known as Mama Shabab, meets a soldier in Syria in 1984 . In the three years since that earth-shattering day in July 2012, Ms Farah said: 'I've grieved for her. It's brought closure to any romantic idea about one day things being better with my mum. 'I've accepted I'll never see her again. How could she ever explain that she'd joined Al Shabab? 'It's too terrible. I fear that one day I will see her on TV or I'll get a knock on the door to say she's been killed. But despite all the terrible things she's done, she is still my mother.' For her own protection, we are not disclosing the details of Ms Farah's current location or that of her family. But using contacts she has from Somalia, where she was born, she discovered her mother married one of Al Shabab's leaders. She added: 'I don't know about my mother's involvement with Western recruits like Samantha Lewthwaite but I know it's alleged. I think Mama Shabab is a horrible name.' Oddly, though, Ms Farah can see how her mother might have earned the chillingly affectionate title. She explained: 'She could be very kind and charming. I can see how natural it would be for her to be that motherly figure. 'She is utterly devoted to what she believes in and being a wife of a jihadist is a way she can help as a woman.' TV appearance: Mother-of-two Amal Farah was recently interviewed about her ordeal on ITV's Lorraine . But the image of her mother as Mama Shabab is a long way from the woman of Ms Farah's earliest memories. She said: 'When I was little my mum loved fashion. She had these fantastic hairstyles. Her brother lived in Geneva and she would visit him and bring back all these amazing clothes. 'Mum was an independent, educated woman. She even divorced my dad because she wanted to travel.' Ms Farah's father was a colonel in the Somali army under military dictator Siad Barre. When she was two he went into exile in Ethiopia to campaign for democracy and a  year later he was killed by a landmine. By then Ms Farah's mother had become more religious and her childhood more restrictive - being forced to wear the hijab at the age of six. When she was ten her family fled Somalia after being granted refugee status in Canada. But any hope of a Western upbringing was quashed after she was enrolled in a strict Islamic school. She said: 'Suddenly I was wasn't allowed to play with my male cousins. We weren't allowed to listen to music. 'Anything that was deemed frivolous, anything that took you away from the importance of Allah, was forbidden.' When she was 15 her mother split from her latest husband and took her and her five younger siblings to live in Leicester. It was only when she began studying for a degree in molecular biology that a new world opened up. 'It was a revelation,' she said. 'I met atheists, Christians, Jews, Hindus - they challenged me about my views, and I about theirs. It was an incredible sensation to be able to discuss ideas without fear.' She felt in her heart that to be true to herself she could no longer call herself a Muslim. Recalling the day she broached the subject with her family, Ms Farah said: 'My mum's first words were, ""You're going to hell!"" Then my uncle flew over from Saudi Arabia and for three days I was locked in the house and forced to listen to him.' When she failed to change her mind, her mother cut off all contact with her. She even left Britain and took the family to Dubai. She explained: 'She was petrified that the rest of my siblings would leave Islam like I had. I was a sheep lost to the wolves and she had to protect the rest of the flock.' Ms Farah (pictured right, with her father in Somalia) cut off all contact with her family several years ago . Ms Farah got an evening job in a call centre and with the support of friends built a new life for herself. She stopped wearing a headscarf and started listening to music. The last time Amal saw her mother was at Leicester train station in 2005, shortly before she left. She said: 'It was my dream to get out and finally I had escaped. 'It was a haze. I didn't know it would be the last time I would see her. We hugged but she made it clear I was putting her through a lot of pain. She was genuinely worried for my soul.' At that time her younger sister Asia was also leading a double life. 'She'd had a secret part-time job as a waitress and had a wardrobe of shorts and miniskirts. Mum found them and I knew Asia was in trouble', Ms Farah adds. 'I panicked and emailed her, saying no matter what, she must not to go to Somalia. I knew she'd never leave if she did. 'I was told to butt out if I knew what was good for me. A few weeks later my mother called me to say Asia was getting married in two days' time. Just like that. I was heartbroken.' The last time Ms Farah spoke to her mother was in 2007. She said: 'She was preaching to me to over the phone. She kept saying ""Are you praying?"" She couldn't accept that I had left Islam. 'I asked where she was and she said, ""I can't tell you, I'm being pursued by your infidel uncle."" She meant a friend of my father's who was then president of Somalia. I realise she must have been in the thick of Al Shabab even then.' By then Ms Farah had met her husband, a Jewish lawyer, at university but she had a sense of dread. She explained: 'I knew they would do what they could to prevent us being together. 'I knew I would never be safe, that I was a thorn in my family's side. So I changed my number and made sure they didn't know where I was living.' The white widow: Ms Farah says she is uncertain of her mother's involvement with Samantha Lewthwaite, a British woman who is one of the world's most wanted female terror suspects . At their wedding in 2010 none of her family were present. Ms Farah said: 'It was tinged with sadness. I would have loved to have seen my mother there but there was no way she would ever have approved, especially of someone Jewish.' Since finding out about her mother Amal has become a member of the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain, speaking against radical Islam, and of One Law For All, a campaign group. Her life now is one that she never thought she would have as a child. She says: 'All my dreams have come true. I have a wonderful family, an incredible husband and I just feel so fortunate. Sometimes I pinch myself. It's the life I never thought I'd have. 'But I miss my siblings, especially my sister. I hope wherever they are that they are happy. I love my mum but I will never be able to make sense of the terrible things she has done. 'It hurts knowing I won't see her again but she has made her choice.'","Amal Farah was born in Somalia and moved to UK with her family aged 18 .

"The human eye is optimised to have good colour vision at day and high sensitivity at night. But until recently it seemed as if the cells in the retina were wired the wrong way round, with light travelling through a mass of neurons before it reaches the light-detecting rod and cone cells. New research presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society has uncovered a remarkable vision-enhancing function for this puzzling structure. Israel Institute of Technology researchers studied human retinas (image of an eye interior shown). They looked at why cells in our retinas are wired the wrong way round. Light travels through a mass of neurons before it reaches the 'back'. The research suggests the structure appears to enhance our vision . About a century ago, the fine structure of the retina was discovered. The retina is the light-sensitive part of the eye, lining the inside of the eyeball. The back of the retina contains cones to sense the colours red, green and blue. Spread among the cones are rods, which are much more light-sensitive than cones, but which are colour-blind. Before arriving at the cones and rods, light must traverse the full thickness of the retina, with its layers of neurons and cell nuclei. These neurons process the image information and transmit it to the brain, but until recently it has not been clear why these cells lie in front of the cones and rods, not behind them. The human eye can see more that we thought, researchers said in December. It had previously been believed the human eye cannot see infrared light, in the same way we can't see X-Rays and radio waves. However, researchers have revealed that under certain conditions, the retina can sense infrared light after all. An international team of researchers co-led by scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis used cells from the retinas of mice and people. By firing powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light, the researchers found that when laser light pulses rapidly, light-sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy. When that happens, the eye is able to detect light that falls outside the visible spectrum. This is a long-standing puzzle, even more so since the same structure, of neurons before light detectors, exists in all vertebrates, showing evolutionary stability. Researchers in Leipzig found that glial cells, which also span the retinal depth and connect to the cones, have an interesting attribute. These cells are essential for metabolism, but they are also denser than other cells in the retina. In the transparent retina, this higher density (and corresponding refractive index) means that glial cells can guide light, just like fibre-optic cables. In view of this, my colleague Amichai Labin and I built a model of the retina, and showed that the directional of glial cells helps increase the clarity of human vision.But we also noticed something rather curious: the colours that best passed through the glial cells were green to red, which the eye needs most for daytime vision. The eye usually receives too much blue - and thus has fewer blue-sensitive cones. Further computer simulations showed that green and red are concentrated five to ten times more by the glial cells, and into their respective cones, than blue light. Instead, excess blue light gets scattered to the surrounding rods. This surprising result of the simulation now needed an experimental proof. With colleagues at the Technion Medical School, we tested how light crosses guinea pig retinas. The back of the retina contains cones to sense the colours red, green and blue. Spread among the cones are rods, which are much more light-sensitive than cones, but which are colour-blind. Before arriving at the cones and rods, light must traverse the full thickness of the retina, with its layers of neurons and cell nuclei . Like humans, these animals are active during the day and their retinal structure has been well-characterised, which allowed us to simulate their eyes just as we had done for humans. Then we passed light through their retinas and, at the same time, scanned them with a microscope in three dimensions. This we did for 27 colours in the visible spectrum. The result was easy to notice: in each layer of the retina we saw that the light was not scattered evenly, but concentrated in a few spots. These spots were continued from layer to layer, thus creating elongated columns of light leading from the entrance of the retina down to the cones at the detection layer. Light was concentrated in these columns up to ten times, compared to the average intensity. Even more interesting was the fact that the colours that were best guided by the glial cells matched nicely with the colours of the cones. The cones are not as sensitive as the rods, so this additional light allowed them to function better – even under lower light levels. Meanwhile, the bluer light, that was not well-captured in the glial cells, was scattered onto the rods in its vicinity. These results mean that the retina of the eye has been optimised so that the sizes and densities of glial cells match the colours to which the eye is sensitive (which is in itself an optimisation process suited to our needs). This optimisation is such that colour vision during the day is enhanced, while night-time vision suffers very little. The effect also works best when the pupils are contracted at high illumination, further adding to the clarity of our colour vision.","Israel Institute of Technology researchers studied human retinas .

"The full extent of the impact of good schools on house prices around England is laid bare by research released today. A map produced by Savills estate agents shows the cost of homes near the best performing schools can be more than 25% higher than in other areas. Each dot on the map represents a school, with the darker coloured dots representing better performing schools and the size of the dot showing the 'house price premium' around that school. Scroll down for video . The fact that the darker dots are often the largest in each area shows just how much parents are willing to pay to live near a good school. Savills say the map shows that certain areas can be classed as 'educational hotspots', in which a choice of good schools leads to a spike in property prices. The company say the best examples of these are Northwood in Middlesex, Brighton in West Sussex, Shrewsbury in Shropshire and Ascot in Berkshire. The map also shows how selective grammar schools, such those in Kent and Buckinghamshire, drive up house prices in the surrounding area. Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said: 'What it shows is there are clear house price premiums around high performing state schools. These are not uniform, there are exceptions where people can still get access to a well-performing school, but generally, there is a premium. 'That said, I suppose there is a bit of a chicken and an egg situation of where you have to ask whether affluent families cluster around a high performing school, or are schools high performing because of the families who live nearby.' A graph produced by estate agents shows that house prices are higher than the regional average in places where pupils perform well at school . The report states: 'For many [house buyers], rather than pinning their hope on a single school, a choice of good schools will determine whether they will look to buy. 'In locations such as Northwood, Brighton, Shrewsbury and Ascot that will be driven entirely by a cluster of high performing independent schools. 'In others such as Dorking, Malvern, Borehamwood, Warwick, Oxford and Guildford these will be supplemented by one or two high performing state school alternatives. 'In other areas, such as Wallington, Altrincham, Orpington it might be exclusively a function of the grammar school system. 'In others, such as Bath Winchester, York, Colchester, Tunbridge Wells, Chelmsford and Cambridge the a network of a range of high performing schools underpins a high value family housing market.' The research comes after a study last year found a top state secondary adds an average of £21,000 to surrounding house prices - with one school in Buckinghamshire adding nearly £500,000 to the price of nearby homes. The research shows how parents are willing to pay much more in order to live close to a good school .","Research by estate agents shows house prices in areas with good schools are up to 28% more than local average .

"Banks including Lloyds and RBS have come under fire for their treatment of small businesses . Banks including RBS and Lloyds have again come under fire over their treatment of small businesses. It has emerged many put firms into high-interest fixed-rate loans then charged them huge fees to switch when interest rates plummeted. MPs are stepping up pressure on high street lenders, urging them to review their sales of the loans, which have trapped thousands of businesses in poor deals. Members of the Treasury Committee are said to be 'furious' the City watchdog failed to protect these small firms. Banks have already paid £1.8billion in compensation for mis-sold 'interest rate swaps', meant to protect firms if interest rates rose. When rates fell to record lows many companies were hit with huge 'breakage' penalties if they wanted to switch deals. More than 14,000 small businesses received compensation. But fixed-rate loans and tailored business loans – the centre of the latest row – are not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, meaning customers mis-sold them are not eligible for compensation. The FCA says such loans can also saddle businesses with huge switching fees. Some have an interest rate swap buried in the contract, but even the more basic loans can come with huge unpredictable break penalties. According to the Treasury Committee, fixed-rate loans and tailored business loans can be just as dangerous as interest rate swaps. It has emerged 60,000 firms were sold these loans – about half by Lloyds, around 11,000 from RBS, and 11,272 by Clydesdale Bank. In a damning report earlier this month into the treatment of small firms by banks, the Treasury Committee said it had received evidence Clydesdale Bank mis-sold tailored business loans. It said the lender engineered the products so the interest rate swap was buried in the loan – meaning it fell outside the FCA's remit. Firms were hit with penalties of up to 40 per cent of the value of the loan if they wanted to terminate their contract. Last night Mark Garnier, a Conservative member of the Treasury Committee, said: 'We are furious with the regulator for not picking this up. The FCA is walking away from its moral responsibility, if not its legal duty, to protect consumers.' He added: 'Banks need to demonstrate they have changed – and voluntarily resolving this issue would help to resolve that.' RBS said it is trawling through its sales of fixed-rate loans. Lloyds said its fixed-rate loans were 'fundamentally different' to the tailored business loans sold by Clydesdale Bank, with lower break costs.","Banks including Lloyds and RBS under fire for treatment of  businesses .

"A girl who was pictured naked surrounded by a group of men during spring break has been identified as a 17-year-old. The image which surfaced online on March 11 caused concern among law enforcement who feared she could be danger. But when the girl, who has not been identified, returned home from Panama Beach and saw the snap online, she came forward to the Bay County Sheriff's Office and insisted she was safe. According to officers she told them the interaction between the crowd was consensual and and she didn't realize her picture was being taken. Scroll down for video . Police in Bay County, Florida were searching for a young woman on Spring Break earlier this month who caused concern after being pictured naked wearing only sunglasses and strings of colorful beads while surrounded by men . It has also been revealed she wasn't enrolled in a college. Sheriff Frank McKeithen releases a statement on the department's website on Friday evening saying:  'The Bay County Sheriff’s Office has identified the female in a photo the agency released on March 17, 2015. 'The photo was posted on Twitter on March 11, 2015, when it came to the attention of law enforcement who became concerned for her safety. The female was on the sand on what was believed to be Panama City Beach. 'She was surrounded by a crowd of men in bathing suits. She was wearing no clothing and appeared to be underage. The Bay County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) provided a breakdown of criminal activity between March 5 - 15 this year, with three weeks of Spring Break still to go: . 'The female in the photo became aware through the media that her identity was sought, and contacted the BCSO today and spoke with investigators. 'The BCSO requested law enforcement in the same city the girl lives in to make contact with her. 'They verified her claim to be the girl in the photo. She lives in the southern part of the United States and told investigators she visited Panama City Beach for spring break, although she does not attend college. 'She is seventeen years of age and although she stated her behavior and interaction with the crowd was consensual and she is safe, she did not realize that someone was taking her picture. Sheriff McKethithen told the Daily Mail Online earlier on Friday that the photos had been deeply concerning to law enforcement because of how young the girl looked, and their main priority was to find out if she was safe. 'She isn't in trouble,' Sheriff McKeithen said. 'We want to be proactive about her safety.' An investigation is still underway into the photographs, but the extent of that is not yet known. Bay County officials were alerted to the photos after they were posted to Twitter on March 11. In one of the pictures, the young woman was bent over and dancing naked at the water's edge on a beach in the Gulf of Mexico. In a separate shot, she appeared to be trying to cover her body while a group of men gathered around her. In another picture, the scene was more aggressive. The girl appeared to be trying to escape the frame but was surrounded by shirtless men. One of the men was grabbing the necklaces at her throat. Panama City Beach in Bay County is the country's top destination for students on Spring Break. Sheriff McKeithen told Daily Mail Online on Friday that his officers, along with the Panama City Beach Police, face an overwhelming wave of criminal activity during the five weeks of Spring Break, when their community swells from 12,000 people to an estimated 100-300,000. 'We have a mess here... this is not the traditional Spring Break of the past,' the sheriff said. 'The kids themselves are posting videos of them having sex on the beach and getting into fights.' He called Spring Break an 'emotional roller coaster' both for the students who end up victims of violence and sexual assault and for his officers, who work double shifts to cope with the influx. 'The majority of sexual assaults are not reported, because they feel shame, are embarrassed, have never likely been this intoxicated before and are far from home,' the police chief said. 'But our message is this - no matter how intoxicated you are, if you are violated, we take that very seriously.' Although the sheriff offered no exact figures on the cost of policing Spring Break, he said that the $150,000 given in assistance by the Tourist Development Council 'barely scratched the surface'. The crowd packed the beach during Spring Break festivities in Panama City Beach, Florida on March 12. Bay County authorities believe that the naked, young woman was on a beach somewhere in this area . Along with hundreds of thousands of drunk, college kids pouring into the town, there was also the dangerous elements that a group this large, with money to burn and wanting to experiment, attraced. 'Build it and they will come,' the sheriff said. Among 22 people arrested at a local bar this weekend in a narcotics sting, was a 39-year-old man from Nashville, Tennessee, who was selling the synthetic party drug, known as 'molly'. Heroin and prescription drugs have also been seized. Weapons were also a growing problem - arrests had uncovered a Glock and an AK-47 during Spring Break. McKeithen said earlier this week that the number of incidents so far this year showed the changes designed to tone down Spring Break haven't worked. These included a 2am closing time for alcohol sales. Sheriff McKeithen said: 'We can't ''police it'' away, that's not going to fix the problem. We are doing the best we can. At some point, someone has to decide whether this is what we want or don't want. 'I am trying to keep people and our officers safe.'

"A centuries-old secret  letter has been discovered under the floorboards of a former boarding school which featured in the works of Charles Dickens. The 200-year-old note was uncovered as part of renovation works at the 16th century Eastgate House in Rochester, Kent. Written in copper-plate handwriting, it is thought to have been sent by a former pupil at the Victorian girl's boarding school. The 200-year-old note was uncovered as part of renovation works at the 16th century Eastgate House in Rochester, Kent . Written in copper-plate handwriting, it is thought to have been written by a former pupil at the Victorian girl's boarding school . Addressing 'my dear little girl', the author- who signs their name simply as N Brunenell- appears to forgive the recipient for some long-forgotten upset. It was then stashed under the floorboards and forgotten for more than 200 years. Built in the 16th century as a private home, the building has since been used as a Victorian boarding school, a young men's hostel, a restaurant and a museum. My Dear little Girl, . I am very willing to excuse you. no my dear Girl I bear no Malice I will come present-ly and kiss you if that will do any good. Allow me to remain, my dear . Your Friend that you are . N Brunenell . Other theories surrounding the letter suggest it may be a love note from a resident to his sweetheart during the building's use as a  hostel. But the Grade I listed building is most notable for its association with celebrated English writer Charles Dickens. The Victorian social critic is likely to have visited the building which he featured as Westgate in The Pickwick Papers and as the Nun's House in The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Most recently the historic property was used as a Dickens Museum and the famous Swiss chalet, where the writer penned several of his novels, was relocated from Gad's Hill in the 1960s. A multi-million pound conservation project is under way to bring the building back into public use and create a community space with improved visitor facilities and access. The secret letter was discovered under the floorboards of Eastgate, the  former boarding school which featured in the works of Charles Dickens . The note was uncovered during a multi-million pound conservation project which is under way to bring the building back into public use . The letter is just one of many finds uncovered by contractors who are renovating town house in Rochester High Street. Others include a toothbrush made of bone, a farthing dated 1923, a thimble and a gentleman's collar pin. Site manager Jay Westwood, said everyday they were finding new historical treasures and described it as 'an honour to work on it.' Lawrence Best, contracts manager at Fairhurst Ward Abbotts added: 'This has already proved to be a fascinating project which will no doubt result in the discovery of further artefacts offering a glimpse into the building's rich history. The letter is just one of many finds uncovered by contractors who are renovating the Grade I listed town house in Rochester High Street . 'Our experience of the heritage sector will ensure that any discoveries are protected and that Eastgate House is sympathetically conserved. 'This will include restoring many of the property's original historic features, such as decorative plaster ceilings, which will be returned to the way they were in the 16th century. 'We're proud to be involved in such an important project and look forward to providing a fantastic new community space and leading tourist attraction that will ensure Eastgate House remains a much loved part of the local community.' Once work is complete at the historic house, it will re-open to the public in 2016 for the first time in more than 30 years, with exhibitions and displays telling the story of the building and those who have lived and worked there for more than 400 years. The 16th century Eastgate House was built for Sir Peter Buck, Mayor of Medway . Eastgate House was built in the 1590s for Sir Peter Buck, Mayor of Medway and Clerk of the Cheque at Chatham Dockyard. Five generations of the Buck family were associated with the house until 1687 where it passed into the hands of the Parkers, and later the Bartholomews. In 1761 the house was held by Annabel Darwin, but possibly let to tenants. It passed to James Reed in 1791 who is thought to have originally founded the school. By 1841 it was under the governorship of Rebecca Norton and there were 14 boarders. It was in this guise that Charles Dickens incorporated it - as 'The Nuns' House' - into his last, unfinished, novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Eastgate House also features as The Westgate Seminary for Young Ladies in The Pickwick Papers. Eastgate House once again became a private dwelling in the 1870s, being the home of Samuel Shaw, a wholesale coal merchant. Its transition to a young men's hostel in 1890 appears to have been fairly brief as it had become a temperance restaurant by 1897 when Rochester City Council resolved to turn it into a municipal library and museum in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. In 1923 an extension to the museum, a new formal garden and a caretaker's cottage - 'Eastgate Cottage' - were added. The Dickens Chalet was relocated here from Cobham Hall in 1961. In 1979 the museum was moved to the Guildhall, and Eastgate House became the Dickens Centre, with displays devoted to the author's life and works. The Dickens Centre closed on 31st October 2004. Work is now underway, with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to transform the house into an exhibition centre for art and history events.","Letter is thought to have been written by a former pupil at Eastgate House .

"Baked: Jennifer Becker, 49, from Maine, has been charged with furnishing marijuana-laced brownies and endangering the welfare of a child . A Maine woman has been arrested for allegedly giving her 13-year-old daughter brownies laced with marijuana. Jennifer Becker, 49, from Edgecomb, was arrested Monday and charged with furnishing marijuana and endangering the welfare of a child. The woman was taken into custody after the Maine Department of Health and Human Services received a complaint claiming that Becker gave her underage daughter baked goods containing cannabis. The divorced mother of one was taken to the Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset and later released on bail. A judge has ordered Becker to avoid contact with her 13-year-old daughter, who is now staying with her father in Florida. The mother is due back in court in April, reported Portland Herald Press. On her Facebook page, Becker listed her occupation as a hemp farmer; hemp is a commonly used term for high-growing varieties of the Cannabis plant and its related products. She is also a member of the New England HempCrete - a company that offers environmentally friendly building materials made out of hemp. Blame game: Becker said her daughter, who 'has issues' told her therapist about the pot-laced brownies, which eventually resulted in her arrest . In an interview with the local station WGME, Becker said her teenage daughter ‘has issues’ and that everything is ‘being blown out of proportion.’ ‘She confided to her therapist that she took some [pot brownies] and now here we are,’ the 49-year-old suspect stated. Maine legalized medical marijuana in 1999, and a decade later the state decriminalized cannabis when Governor John Baldacci signed a bill which made possession of 2.5 ounces or less a civil infraction. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form.

"Former American Apparel CEO Dov Charney has broken his silence on being at war with the company he built where he accused of sexual misconduct and mismanagement of funds. Since being ousted in December, Charney, 46, has claimed he's broke, even though he still lives in a ten-bedroom mansion in Los Angeles where he says he plans to return to power. 'I want everyone to know I'm not ""The Sleaze King"",' Charney told ABC News's 20/20. '""The Sleaze King"" is another guy.' Scroll down for video . Dov Charney has spoken out for the first time since being ousted from American Apparel in December 2014, saying he wants to reclaim the company he founded . Charney has dubbed his master bedroom suite his 'war room' where he has covered the walls and mirrors with a collage of notes and newspaper clippings. 'I've had a minute being on the outside to re-strategize how I want to take the company, you know, control the company again. And I intend to,' the American Apparel founder told ABC. He has become infamous for his limit-pushing advertisements in which he's been criticized for using young models in provocative ads. Charney claims the models just look younger than they truly are. 'I'm sure we pushed the envelope too far a couple times,' he said. 'That's why you make the next ad right away.' The Los Angeles-based company's board voted to oust Mr Charney as CEO in June, citing allegations of a long list of offenses, including violation of sexual harassment and anti-discrimination policies and misuse of company funds. It also claimed Mr Charney had repeatedly engaged in conduct which had led to former employees making claims of harassment, discrimination and assault. American Apparel said in December that it had terminated his position 'for cause' after an internal investigation. American Apparel, which  Charney founded in 1989, manufactures clothes and sells them in 245 of its own retail stores in 20 countries and has about 10,000 employees. Charney live in a ten-bedroom mansion in Los Angeles, but claims he's been broke since being ousted from his company . Since then, the Montreal-born Charney has been the subject of lawsuits that allege he had inappropriate sexual conduct with female employees. He has said he had consensual sexual relationships with workers. In 2011, a former employee accused Charney of keeping her as a teenage sex slave, fearing she could lose her job otherwise. She also sued American Apparel and its directors for failing to stop him from acting as a 'sexual predator.' Charney denied these claims and the lawsuit was dismissed. In 2012, Charney once again came under fire when Michael Bumblis, a former store manager in Malibu, California, accused the CEO of rubbing dirt in his face and choking him. Charney also allegedly called the man 'a wannabe Jew' and used a derogatory term for homosexuals. Bumblis was later fired from his job. The former executive denies Bumblis’s allegations and the case was settled in 2015 with a confidential filing. Some employees, however, believe that Charney is a hero within the company. Garment workers have held rallies claiming that he could save the company. Since the company was founded it made a name for itself by manufacturing clothing within the United States and paying workers about minimum wage. Charney said a 'good worker can make $13, $14 bucks and hour' while at American Apparel. Inside his master bedroom suite, Charney has created a 'war room', where he has covered the walls with notes and newspaper clippings as a way to strategize his method of taking back American Apparel . But as profits began to rise at the company, allegations that Charney created a sexually charged and hostile work environment were brought to the table. 'I've never engaged in any activities that could be characterized as sexual harassment,' he said. Charney admits that he slept with employees but claims that everything was consensual. 'All those accusations against me are crap,' he said. 'There's allegations... we resolved them. None of it - none of these allegations - were ever proven.' He said that he'd been sued 'maybe a dozen, maybe less' times for sexual harassment, and that some of the lawsuits were settled while others were dropped. Charney has said that the accusations that led to his firing in December 2014 'are completely false' and that his termination was 'ridiculous'. 'I had been working 365 for 10 years solid, OK? Built a massive brand that captured the imagination of the world,' he told ABC. 'Then to treat me like that, to throw me on the street... shame on them, shame on them, that's my message to them.' ABC was able to speak to an American Apparel employee only named as 'Sam', who told them that Charney was 'cruel and vindictive'. Charney was fired after allegations emerged over his course as CEO, including sexual harassment, misuse of company funds and racist comments . 'When you work at American Apparel closely with Dov, you're pretty much scared all the time,' she said. 'He will yell at you, call you names, humiliate you until you feel down, broken.' Though Sam's statements echoed human resources reports from other employees, Charney said that it was just 'one person's point of view'. 'I'm not going to get along with everybody. This is a tough environment,' he said, adding that he pushes his 'white collar workers harder'. 'I was combative, I was a pushy boss. I was a hammer on my white collar staff, that's for sure,' he said. After Charney's ousting, Paula Schneider took over as CEO for American Apparel with goals to restore profitability within the company, save jobs and distance the company from its founder. Despite Charney's spirited plan to return to the company, Schneider said he will never be brought back. 'He is not allowed to be an employee, or an officer or CEO of the company. Period. There's no option there,' she said. The new CEO of American Apparel, Paula Schneider, said that Charney will never be reinstated with the company as an employee, officer or CEO .","Dov Charney was fired from American Apparel in December 2014 .

"Labour grandee Peter Mandelson today insisted broadcasters could not empty chair David Cameron if he refused to take part in TV debates. The former cabinet minister said the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel Four were not entitled to ‘impose what they want  on the political parties’ and the Prime Minister was within his rights to ignore them. The former BBC chair Michael Grade accused the broadcasters of using 'bullying' tactics to force the Prime Minister into the debates and said they were in danger of breaching strict rules on impartiality. Labour grandee Peter Mandelson today insisted broadcasters could not empty chair David Cameron if he refused to take part in TV debates . Lord Mandelson, speaking at a business conference organised by the trade magazine Retail Week, suggested that the broadcasters were acting as if they had more power than they did. But he said Labour leader Ed Miliband was also perfectly entitled to score political points over Mr Cameron’s refusal to take part in the debates. The Labour peer asked if he would advise Mr Cameron not to show up for the TV debates. He said: ‘I wouldn’t tell him to do that. I would say that there’s an expectation that you will debate properly with others. Voters feel they are entitled to have that sort of debate and comparison directly in front of them.' However, Lord Mandelson added: ‘I think David Cameron is entitled not to do that debate in the particular way that the broadcasters have described and the Labour Party is entitled to make him look and appear completely frit and chicken and force him to take a hit for not doing the debates. ‘What I don’t think is that the broadcasters are entitled to impose what they want on the political parties and empty chair party leaders. ‘I don’t think the broadcasters have that entitlement. They are at the end of the day broadcasters – they are not the House of Commons. Who elected them?’ Tory peer Michael Grade accused the broadcasters of using 'bullying' tactics to force the Prime Minister into the debates and said they were in danger of breaching strict rules on impartiality . The Labour peer's remarks come after Lord Grade, who served as chairman of the BBC board of governors between 2004 and 2006, defended Mr Cameron for refusing to take part in any debates during the election campaign. Mr Cameron has agreed to take part in one debate with six other party leaders – but has insisted it takes place before the official start of the election campaign on March 30. The broadcasters however have insisted the debates must take place in April – just weeks before the election – and insisted they would go ahead with or without Mr Cameron. But the threat to empty chair the Prime Minister in the proposed head-to-head against Mr Miliband on 30 April – a week before polling day – was attacked by Lord Grade. The Tory peer told Radio 4's Today programme it was right that the broadcasters should organise debates – but insisted it was up to political leaders if they wanted to take part. He said: 'The idea that broadcasters can threaten politicians with empty chairs, real or imaginary, is completely unacceptable and against the statutory requirement for impartiality. 'It is not for the broadcasters to threaten the prime minister and risk breaching their duty of impartiality. 'The BBC should stand up today and say that they are not going to empty-chair anybody or to threaten anybody. 'These debates are fun to have, maybe nice to have. The benefits or the dis-benefits you can argue it either way. But there is no requirement that they should be done. And there is a requirement on the broadcasters for impartiality.' The Conservatives believe Mr Cameron's election chances suffered by his decision to take part in TV election debates . Lord Grade, who left the BBC to become executive chairman of ITV, was scathing about the broadcasters' handling of the debate negotiations. He said: 'I don't think the broadcasters have covered themselves in glory in the way that they have campaigned for these debates, the way they have gone public early on, the way they have messed it up by missing out various parties. The thing is a shambles. It is embarrassing, frankly.' In an article in the Times, Lord Grade accused the broadcasters of trying to bully the prime minister by threatening to signal his absence from the debates with an empty chair. He wrote: 'It is bullying, a case of the broadcast media getting way ahead of itself.' Lord Grade added: 'Who do the broadcasters think they are? Their behaviour over the election debates leads me to believe they suddenly have grossly inflated and misguided ideas of their own importance.'","Labour peer said Cameron was entitled not to show up to debates .

"It’s a privilege reserved for a lucky few but now experts have revealed exactly who is getting on board when it comes to private jets. The spotlight has been shone on the industry's latest marketing statistics - identifying Americans as the most frequent flyers while the busiest route is between Moscow and Nice. Billionaire entrepreneurs, chief executives and A-list celebrities are amongst the exclusive clientele, found to be 80 per cent men. Top ten: Aviation experts NetJets, which has the largest private jet fleet in the world, has listed its top ten routes with passengers . High flyers: A NetJets Europe Phenom Jet 300 comes in to land at London City Airport. London features in three of the top 10 flights . Aviation provider NetJets - which has the largest private jet fleet in the world - announced the findings of the annual report for 2013. Users of the luxury crafts, which often boast private bedrooms, fine-dining facilities and the odd cinema, are typically private entrepreneurs, aged between 40 and 55. The aircraft provider said the United States remains the world’s leading private jet market with 60 per cent of global traffic starting and ending there. Popular routes include Moscow to Côte d’Azur, Miami to New York, New York to Los Angeles, New York to West Palm Beach and London to New York in the most recent data. Typical passengers: American tycoon Donald Trump with daughter Ivanka Trump onboard his private jet as they arrive at Aberdeen Airport last year. Aviation data found flyers are often private entrepreneurs . Lap of luxury: The inside a Global 6000 reveals why those who can afford it are increasingly turning to the pricey form of transport . Europe has the second-largest market for those wanting to avoid the queues, with about a quarter of the US, with Russia representing a significant portion of overall European demand. But Marine Eugene, executive director for NetJets Europe, said the United States was way out in front when it came to private air traffic. 1. Moscow - Nice/Côte d’Azur . 2. Miami - New York . 3. New York - Los Angeles . 4. New York - West Palm Beach . 5. London - New York . 6. London – Moscow . 7. London - Nice/Côte d’Azur . 8. Chicago - New York . 9. Houston - New York . 10.

Houston – Midland (Texas) 8. Lagos - London . 9. Austin - Houston . 10. Houston – Washington . She said US businessman were more inclined to use the private transportation as they were 'driven by access' with huge expanses to be covered, often requiring more than one connection. 'If you are a very busy businessman having to connect between flights for meetings, it can be difficult to get where you need to go and at a time you need to be there,' she said. 'In the US there are no business flights and you really don't have the service that you would expect if you are a very busy person. 'With private flights, you can decide what time you want to set off and arrive, at a time that suits the individual and their business needs.' Moscow was among the top 10 routes with highest hours flown in 2013, although the political crisis of late has seen numbers fall by 15 per cent in recent months. No toy: Often seen as a play thing of the rich and the famous like John Travolta pictured, private jets are now regarded as vital business tool . Popular destination: London ranks highly with private jet passengers, according to research by aviation experts NetJets . Elsewhere, private air traffic between London and New York continues to increase year on year with the UK capital accounting for a third of the most frequented routes. Within London, London City Airport has seen significant increases traffic over the last year. The airport is seen as an important hub, particularly for those that work in the financial sector, given its close proximity to Canary Wharf and the city in general. Dubai and the broader UAE are seeing growing traffic although the Middle East’s position as the world’s third-largest market is being challenged by the rise of traffic in China and Brazil. The data showed traffic from Brazil to Europe has grown by a fifth each year since 2010 with the UK, France, Spain and Portugal amongst the most popular destinations. The total business jet market in China still below Europe, estimated at 20,000 flights per year, with potential for significant growth predicted in its domestic flights. Nigeria has also become one of the fastest growing hubs with private departures to and from Lagos. Experts have put the steady global rise down to more travelers rating the plush transport as a vital business tool. Industry figures claim the flights are often cost effective for businessmen, giving them the swift access needed to close deals, often worth huge sums of money. The ability to get anywhere, at any time, can be priceless when it comes to the limited leisure time most customers experience. 'It can be invaluable when you work really hard and want to spend time with family within a tight schedule,' said Ms Eugene. 'Businessmen are the ones that have the needs and the means to make it possible.'","More than eight in 10 passengers are men with most aged 40 to 55 .

"Seven tourists died today when they were struck by huge rocks tumbling down a mountain in one of China's most popular beauty spots, according to the People's Daily Online. The rocks - including a three-metre wide (10ft) boulder - hit the group of travellers as they waited to board boats on Li River in the Diecai Mountain scenic area in Guilin. Twenty-five people were also injured in the accident, who are receiving medical treatment at Guilin People's Hospital and Guilin No. 2 People's Hospital. Among them 13 have left the hospitals. Tragedy: The boulders hit a group of tourists as they waited to board a boat on the Li River, in Guilin . Pictures from the scene showed a large rock resting on a slope by the lake, with other fragments resting on shattered pavements, and pools of blood on the ground close to handbags, shoes and other personal items. People who claimed to have witnessed the tragedy wrote on a local internet forum that the tourists were hit on the heads and abdomens. Some tourists were pushed down the river by rocks, said the same source. Death: Seven of the tourists were killed when the boulders fell, while 25 more were injured . Devastation: One boulder was three metres wide, but appears to have shattered into many smaller ones . Officials said four people in the group - believed to be a mix of mainland Chinese and Taiwanese tourists - were killed at the scene, while three others died later at hospital. Among the injured tourists, eight have been confirmed to be Taiwanese. Local authorities are currently identifying the victims.

"Furious parents have attacked a school's 'ridiculous' uniform policy after dozens of pupils were put in isolation for refusing to remove charity ribbons and badges. Students at The Grange School, in Runcorn, Cheshire, were kept out of lessons today after they refused to remove yellow ribbons and daffodils supporting the Marie Curie cancer charity. Head Barry Carney defended the decision, saying the school selected one charity to support each year and couldn't be seen to prefer one cause over another, but parents branded it 'pathetic'. Student Lily Gaynor, 16, said that up to 70 students from The Grange School, Cheshire, had been taken out of lessons ahead of their GCSEs for refusing to remove the charity pins . Pupil Lily Gaynor alerted a local newspaper to the student's plight by calling them from isolation. She estimated that between 60 and 70 students had been removed from classes. The 16-year-old said: 'We have been taken out of lessons before our GCSEs because we won’t take off our charity badges. 'We’ve got cancer badges and ribbons on our blazers and they’re saying it isn’t part of school uniform and it’s singling out some charities over others. 'We’ve been here about an hour. They’re planning on keeping us here all day. It jeopardises our learning and we’ve got exams soon.' Corinne Versleys, whose daughter Caitlin Mulchrane is among those in isolation, said: 'The school is putting children in the isolation unit for wearing those flowers. 'I think it’s absolutely ridiculous - all it is is a little flower. 'The majority of kids wearing them are dealing with family members with cancer and they’re being told to remove them. I think it’s absolutely pathetic.' The Marie Curie daffodil appeal has been running every March since 1986. Supporters are encouraged to donate in return for a daffodil badge or ribbon which they can wear. Support: Pupils were wearing these flowers and yellow ribbons given out by the Marie Curie cancer charity during March as part of a fundraising drive which last year raised £8.26million . Last year the campaign, which is supported by the likes of actors Olivia Coleman and Dominic West, helped to raise £8.26 million, funding 413,000 hours of nursing care. Despite criticism, Barry Carney, the head of Grange School, said he was simply applying the school's uniform policy, which was available online 'for all to see'. He told the Liverpool Echo: 'Each year we have a nominated charity which we call the head boy and the head girl’s charity. This year it happens to be the Teenage Cancer Trust. 'A number of students have been wearing some badges which are not permitted according to the rules of the school, which are pretty clear. 'When we asked students to remove these badges there has been a small number who have dragged their heels and said because of personal circumstances they want to show their support.' He said he has spoken to these pupils and suggested organising a fundraising event to support the charity, rather than wearing a ribbon or badge. He added that the school holds plenty of charity events, and has raised £1,000 for the Teenage Cancer Charity in the past year, with an open door cafe planned next Thursday. He said the school was contemplating having more than one nominated charity next year.","Pupils had ribbons and daffodils supporting Marie Curie cancer charity .

"Scottish Nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon vowed yesterday to ‘frighten the life out of Westminster’ if her party storms to victory north of the border on May 7. She demanded the abolition of the ‘undemocratic’ House of Lords and pledged to put the ‘backbone and guts’ into a Labour government led by Ed Miliband. And Miss Sturgeon repeated her party’s promise to overthrow a Tory minority administration even if the Conservatives have more seats than any other party after the Election. Nicola Sturgeon, whose critics have compared her to President Putin in attempting to divide the UK like Russia did Ukraine, has vowed to shake up the Westminster system . The SNP is on course for huge gains on May 7, with Miss Sturgeon boasting it can win all 58 of Scotland’s Commons seats. In a speech to SNP activists, she said a party that ‘frightens the life out of the Westminster establishment’ was ‘good news for ordinary people in Scotland and right across these islands’. Miss Sturgeon, who is also the Scottish First Minister, said: ‘The House of Lords has no place in a democratic society. ‘Its members are paid £300 a day for just showing up, and it’s totally tax-free. That’s got to stop. It is now time to abolish the House of Lords. ‘So, yes, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, if you are worried that a strong SNP is a threat to all that is deeply undemocratic and unfair about the Westminster notion of democracy, then all I can say to you is this: you had better believe we are.’ Miss Sturgeon’s uncompromising message came after Tory whip Ben Wallace accused her of aping the tactics of Russian president Vladimir Putin in her bid to break up the UK. Ms Sturgeon (far right) also repeated the pledge of Alex Salmond (near left) to vote with Labour to lock the Tories out of government, even if neither of their parties hold the biggest number of seats . He said: ‘Nicola Sturgeon is intent on stoking division in England in the same way Putin used it to break apart Ukraine.’ The SNP leader also faces accusations of trying to exert ‘Stalinist’ discipline over proposed new rules banning her MPs from speaking out against party policy. Yesterday, Miss Sturgeon also echoed former party leader Alex Salmond, now bidding to return to Westminster as an MP, by insisting that the SNP would vote down a minority Conservative Government, despite the long-standing tradition that the party with the most MPs should have an opportunity to form a Government. ‘The SNP will never put the Tories into government – not now, not ever,’ she said. ‘As long as there are more anti-Tory MPs – Labour or SNP – than there are Tory MPs in the House of Commons, we can keep them out of government.’ Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said last night: ‘It is clearer than ever that the prospect of Ed Miliband, in Downing Street and dancing to Alex Salmond’s tune, would mean chaos for Britain.’","SNP leader also vowed to abolish the 'undemocratic' House of Lords .

"The 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on ‘middle incomes’, David Cameron said yesterday – as he hinted at fresh action on the issue in next week’s Budget. The Prime Minister said it was wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was ‘only ever meant for the better off’. Mr Cameron announced last year that a future Conservative government would raise the threshold for paying 40p tax from £41,865 to £50,000 by 2020. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said the 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on ‘middle incomes’ as he hinted at fresh action in the upcoming Budget during a visit to The Green School For Girls in west London yesterday (above) The move is opposed by the Liberal Democrats, so cannot be brought in immediately. But Chancellor George Osborne is expected to set out the aspiration during next week’s Budget, including laying out the timetable for raising the threshold. Senior Tories are pushing for the first significant rise in the threshold to be made next year if the party wins the election. The number of people paying 40p tax has risen by about two million to five million since 2010, as a result of coalition decisions to cut the threshold to help pay off the huge budget deficit left by Labour. In a speech at a school in West London yesterday, the Prime Minister yesterday pledged to start easing the pressure on middle class families. He said: ‘We will raise the threshold at which people start paying the 40p rate of tax. This rate was only ever meant for the better off. But over the years it’s dragged more and more people into its reach - police officers, teachers, people on middle incomes. ‘That’s why we will move that threshold to £50,000 – so more hardworking people can keep more of the money they earn.’ The Prime Minister made the comments during a visit to The Green School For Girls in west London (above) Mr Cameron (pictured during his trip to west London) also confirmed that the Tories will press ahead with plans to raise the starting threshold for paying income tax to £12,500 – an ambition shared by the Lib Dems . Despite the pledge, the number of people paying 40p tax is expected to rise, albeit at a slower rate. Many Tory MPs are pushing Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne to go further and faster on the issue. Mr Cameron also confirmed that the Tories will press ahead with plans to raise the starting threshold for paying income tax to £12,500 – an ambition that is shared by the Lib Dems. The threshold is already due to rise to £10,500 next month, and Mr Osborne is expected to announce it will rise to £11,000 in the Budget. Mr Cameron said the move would be ‘a tax cut for 30 million people.’ He added: ‘It will take everyone on the Minimum Wage working 30 hours a week out of income tax altogether.'","David Cameron hinted at fresh action in upcoming Budget over 40p tax rate .

"One is a multimillionaire glamour model with a talent for controversy and a penchant for of plastic surgery. The other is the Duchess of Cornwall. Yet despite their very different lives, Camilla and Katie appeared to get along famously when they bumped into each other on day two of the Cheltenham Festival. Ms Price, who is an equine enthusiast herself, looked very much at ease during her brush with royalty and wore an unusually toned-down ensemble of white jeans and a neat navy jacket. Scroll down for video . Striking a pose: The Duchess of Cornwall happily posed for a photo with Katie Price and a gaggle of fellow racegoers . Unlikely trio: Camilla with Katie Price and her daughter Laura Lopes (centre) Camilla, meanwhile, was on cheerful form and looked wonderful in a Scottish Balmoral tweed suit by couturier Roy Allan and a matching hat by milliner Lock. The Duchess had been making her way back from the paddock, where she presented jockey Sam Twiston-Davies with his trophy after he won the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase on Dodging Bullets, when she bumped into Ms Price and her friends. When asked by  for a picture, the Duchess was all smiles and gamely obliged, with daughter Laura Lopes also getting into the frame. Camilla's foray into the paddock also resulted in a second celebrity encounter, when the Duchess found herself enjoying a chat with Gloucestershire local, Jilly Cooper. Ms Cooper, who is famous for novels documenting country life, is no stranger to the world of racing having made it the subject of her most recent book, Jump! Another of her equine-themed page turners, horse box-trembling bonkbuster Riders, celebrated its 30th birthday this week and remains one of the UK's favourite novels. Camilla and her two children, Laura, left, and Tom, right, appear overjoyed as they catch one of the races .

Sibling rivalry: Mr Parker-Bowles mischievously taunts his sister Laura Lopes following his win . Indeed, the Duchess is no stranger to Cooper's oeuvre, with the author once admitting that showjumping cad Rupert Campbell-Black is partially based on Camilla's ex-husband, Andrew Parker-Bowles. Until her star-studded encounters in the paddock, Camilla had been enjoying a family day out in the royal box with her two children, Tom and Laura, and their spouses Harry Lopes and Sara Parker-Bowles. Also at the races was Zara Tindall who returned to the racecourse for a second day and looked lovely in black and white coat and matching black cocktail hat by milliner Rosie Olivia. The Parker-Bowles quartet had arrived at the racecourse together and happily posed for photos before Mail On Sunday food critic Tom got to work sampling the stout sold at a nearby stall. Camilla, meanwhile, had arrived alone and was at the racecourse with work to do, having been asked to present the prize to the winner of the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase - Mr Twiston-Davies and Dodging Bullets. Still celebrating: Mr Parker-Bowles was still going even after his relations conceded defeat . Watching the action: Laura Lopes and the Duchess of Cornwall react as they watch the first race . Round of applause: The group applaud as Windsor Park gallops home to win the first race . Sharing a joke: The family appeared to be enjoying their day out at the races . The Duchess also did the honours last year and was asked to return by Cheltenham chairman, Robert Waley-Cohen. 'I am delighted that The Duchess of Cornwall will again be attending this year's Festival on Ladies Day,' he said. 'The scenes in the Winner's Enclosure after Sire De Grugy won the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase were some of the best of the week and this year's race is shaping up to be as competitive as ever.' Camilla, who has long loved horses, was also there to promote her six equestrian charities, among them The British Equestrian Federation, The Brooke Hospital for Animals and Ebony Horse Club.

The Duchess has been having a busy week, which began with a trip to Westminster Abbey for the Commonwealth Day Observance service with Prince Charles. Yesterday, she helped to launch the Big Lunch 2015 campaign with a reception at her London home, Clarence House. The campaign, which is run by the Eden Project, aims to encourage people to 'do lunch' and get to know their neighbours. During the reception, Camilla was introduced to campaign workers and, much to her delight, was presented with a bunch of Welsh daffodils and a gift of Welsh cakes by 11-year-old Marcus Aitken.

But while all eyes might have been on the unlikely pairing of Camilla and Katie Price, the royals weren't the only ones to look glamorous on Ladies Day at Cheltenham. With a £15,000 prize to win, scores of women turned up in their finest frocks for the event, with many topping off their look with some out-of-this world millinery. Everything from huge floppy fedoras to glamorous little cocktail numbers adorned the tops of perfectly-coiffed heads, while shoes ranged from sky-high platforms to comfortable country boots. Not everyone opted for brights, however, with several ladies also following Camilla's example and opting for cosy tweed ensembles topped with brushed fur cossack hats.

Introduced by the champagne brand to make sipping from the bottle less hazardous to clothes, the funnels also dispensed with the need for plastic glasses, leaving the racecourse staff with less work to do once the crowds departed. Some, however, couldn't resist doing things the traditional way and nipped back to the car park to plunder the supermarket-bought bottles of prosecco that they had been storing in the boot.

"American explorer Theodore Morde (pictured) claimed to have found the lost city in 1940 . The headline in the New York Times was tantalisingly mysterious: ‘City of the Monkey God is believed located: Expedition reports success in Honduras exploration’. If readers were a little puzzled as to the huge significance of this announcement, they were soon put right by the man who had made it. The date was July 12, 1940, and American explorer Theodore Morde had just emerged from the darkest jungles of Central America with an incredible story about what he’d found there. Morde, a real-life Indiana Jones who later became a wartime U.S. spy, had been recruited by the founder of New York’s prestigious Museum of the American Indian to try to find a mythical lost ‘White City’ dripping in gold that had been founded by a mysterious civilisation as great as the Aztecs and the Mayans. Adventurers had been searching for La Ciudad Blanca for centuries, ever since Spanish conquistador and explorer Hernando Cortes conquered Central America in the early 16th century and heard rumours of its riches. But it remained hidden for hundreds of years until Morde insisted he had found it deep in the rain forests of Mosquitia, more than 32,000 square miles of hellishly inhospitable wilderness in Honduras and Nicaragua. He described how, armed only with a revolver and a machete, he and a companion named Lawrence Brown had spent four months hacking their way through ‘almost inaccessible’ jungle, swamps, rivers and mountains before coming upon a hidden valley that contained the remains of a white-stoned, walled city. There, the local Indians told him, a long-vanished people, who were contemporaries of the Ancient Mayans, had once worshipped a strange Monkey God whose giant statue was still buried under centuries of vegetation. They made bloody human sacrifices to their simian deity, then ate the victims in an act of ritualised cannibalism. Morde said that on his own brief visit he had himself seen a disturbing rite in which local natives ritually slaughtered and ate monkeys in a twisted hangover from the cult. To back his astonishing claims, Morde — who was only 29 but had already sailed around the world five times — brought back several thousand artefacts to America such as stone utensils and tiny carved monkey masks. A team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists have announced that they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the City of the Monkey God, in a crater-shaped rainforest valley . He never revealed the precise location of the ruined city for fear it would be looted before he could go back. However, he never returned and died mysteriously in 1954, taking the secret of its location with him. It remained a compelling mystery, seemingly lifted from the pages of H. Rider Haggard. Generations of adventurers plunged into the jungle to search for the city, and experts dismissed Morde’s discovery as a self-promoting fantasy. Explorers who reported glimpsing the tops of white buildings peeking through the forest canopy were told they were just limestone cliffs. But now the sceptics may have to eat their words. A team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists have just returned from La Mosquitia. They have announced that — like Morde — they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the City of the Monkey God, in a crater-shaped rainforest valley encircled by steep mountains. According to the National Geographic magazine, which accompanied the expedition, the archaeologists have surveyed and mapped ‘extensive plazas, earthworks, mounds and an earthen pyramid belonging to a culture that thrived 1,000 years ago, and then vanished’. The team also discovered a breathtaking collection of stone sculptures that had lain untouched since the city was abandoned. Christopher Fisher, an archaeologist from Colorado State University and team member, believes the sculptures — found at the base of the pyramid — may have been offerings to the Monkey God. The team first found the ruins nearly three years ago during an aerial survey using a high-tech scanner that was able to pierce the jungle canopy with laser light and reveal archaeological features. The city had been a shrine to the monkey God akin to Hindu's Hanuman who is pictured hiding Rama and Sita, two Hindu deities, in his heart to protect them. But the Honduran monkey God is more menacing . It showed ruins that stretched for more than a mile along a river through the valley. The remote, rugged area is a major cocaine smuggling route and the scientists, who were ferried to the site by helicopter, were accompanied by Honduran special forces and former members of Britain’s SAS. Wild animals routinely wandered through their camp, clearly never having encountered humans before. Even without excavation, the scientists found 52 artefacts sticking out from the ground with many more clearly lying in the earth and vegetation beneath. They included stone ceremonial seats, and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes, vultures and animal-like figures. The most arresting find was a viciously fanged stone head, part-man and part-beast. Fisher believes it to be not a ‘were-wolf’ but a spirit-like ‘were-jaguar’— the giant cat still prowls the jungles — representing a priest in a transformed state. The ancient culture that created the city, say the scientists, is so little known that it doesn’t even have a proper name — although Morde called its people the Chorotegans. He was just one of many men to search for the ruins after the aviator Charles Lindbergh reportedly claimed that he saw the expansive white remains of an ‘amazing ancient metropolis’ when he flew over the region in 1927. In the Thirties, George Heye, multi-millionaire founder of New York’s Museum of the American Indian, paid for two expeditions to find it led by a pith-helmeted Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society named Capt R. Stuart Murray. He found nothing except dark rumours that the natives were ‘devil worshippers’ who spoke of a lost ‘City of the Monkey God’. The University of Houston and National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping team produced this 3D digital topological map which when examined shows a man-made plaza ringed in red . And there was another myth — that the Monkey God had produced offspring, a half-man and half-simian race dubbed the ‘hairy people’. Locals believed apes from the jungle had long ago stolen virgins from their villages to produce the mongrel offspring; they also insisted the ruins were cursed. Theodore Morde was the leader of Mr Heye’s third expedition and, as he explained later, after months of starvation, sickness and exhaustion, they were about to give up when he saw something from the top of a small cliff. It was the stone ruins of a walled ‘great city . . . that at its height must have held many thousands of inhabitants’, he wrote. The jungle-choked city walls originally would have risen, he estimated, to 30ft and on almost everything he found, said Morde, was carved the likeness of a monkey. While they were there, he said, real spider monkeys peered curiously at the expedition’s team from the trees above. Although the vegetation was too thick to see much, local guides showed him a huge mound they said lay at the centre of the city. Buried deep within was an enormous temple with a vast staircase leading to a ‘high stone dais on which was the statue of the Monkey God himself’. This, they claimed, had been ‘the place of sacrifice’. Locals believed apes from the jungle had stolen virgins from their villages to produce mongrel offspring . As to what had been sacrificed, Morde and ethnologists he consulted were convinced the people had practised a barbaric tradition that was later adopted by the warlike Aztecs to the north in Mexico. Every year, a physically perfect young man, usually a priest, would be selected to be the Monkey God for that year. He would be worshipped, pampered and given the most beautiful girls. But after 12 months, he would be ritually slaughtered at the top of the pyramid temple, his heart torn out and his body thrown down the steps where it would be cut into pieces. Priests would distribute it among the worshippers who would each take a small piece home to eat. One night Morde watched a group of natives perform a morbid ritual dance in which each of them brandished a spear on which were impaled three spider monkeys. The monkeys were roasted over a fire in such a way that their limbs contracted and writhed in the flames as if still alive, and the whole tribe settled down later to eat them. Officiating was the local head medicine man or shaman — the Dama Suk-ya Tara. Naked except for a loincloth and his body painted with white chalk, he made a blood-curdling spectacle with a necklace laced with the minute skulls of unborn monkeys, yellow human teeth and the poison sacks of lethal jungle snakes. Adventurers had been searching for La Ciudad Blanca for centuries, ever since Spanish conquistador and explorer Hernando Cortes conquered Central America in the early 16th century and heard rumours of it . To his fingertips he had fixed the fangs of huge alligators. At one point he brandished a long arrow on which was impaled a large spider monkey. At another, he stuck a hollow bamboo rod into the eye socket of each roasted monkey, ritually sucking out their brain fluid. Was this monstrous man the spiritual successor to the chief priest of the Monkey God? The natives said the ceremony was a dance of revenge for the theft by monkeys of their virgins all those years ago. Morde spent just two days at the ruins because the monsoon season started suddenly, forcing him to leave the place before conducting any excavations which might have enabled him to prove his theories. Only now, with this new expedition, does it look like his discovery may finally be verified. And if The White City really is cursed, as the natives had warned Morde, he may have belatedly paid the price. He committed suicide in circumstances that have never been satisfactorily explained.","American explorer Theodore Morde claimed he had found mythical lost city .

"The discovery of an underground bunker  in a 41-year-old cold case where two young girls went missing from Adelaide Oval, may provide a breakthrough for investigators. Joanne Ratcliffe, 11, and Kirste Gordon, 4, disappeared from the sporting field during a match between Norwood and North Adelaide on August 25, 1973. Police have chased more than 2000 leads of inquiry since the girls disappeared 41 years ago, and the case shocked the country and became one of the nation's most infamous murder mysteries. Fresh leads have now been uncovered that place the case's key suspect - Stanley Arthur Hart - at the ground when the two young girls went missing, according to the Adelaide Advertiser. Joanne Ratcliffe, 11, (left) and Kirste Gordon, 4, (right) went missing from Adelaide Oval on August 25, 1973 . In addition to this detectives have found an underground bunker at Hart's childhood home, which was deserted for a year from March 1973. Hart, who was a known paedophile, died in 1999. Former properties of the man have previously been extensively searched as part of the investigation into the abduction of the two children. Stanley Arthur Hart was named by his grandson, convicted paedophile Mark Trevor Marshall, in a 2007 confession provided to the Mullighan Inquiry into abuse of children in state care. Now Hart's childhood home in Prospect, about 8 kilometres from the Adelaide CBD, has now come under scrutiny after officers excavated two wells at another of his former homes in Yatina last year. An old underground bunker found at Hart's Prospect home, which had two entrances and could fit at least four adults, is believed to have been filled in some time before 1975, but after the disappearance of the girls. Police released this sketch at the time of the girls' disappearance appealing for information about this man, who is said to closely resemble what Hart looked like at the time . Joanna Ratcliffe's (pictured) sister Suzanne has urged police to take recent leads in the case seriously . It has also been revealed by The Adelaide Advertiser that from March 1973, no one besides Hart had any access to the home. The current owners of the home said although there has never been any police interest in the property in the 40 years they have lived there, they would cooperate should the bunker need to be excavated. Major Crime police are currently investigating the link, and the case has been revisited as part of SA Police's State's Most Wanted Cold Case Unit move to solve all 110 unsolved murders. 'Major Crime detectives are assessing information recently received in relation to a Prospect address,' police confirmed. Joannae's sister Suzanne has urged police to take recently leads into the case seriously. Officers excavated two wells at on of Hart's former homes in Yatina last year . Suzie, who was born a year after her sister Joanne disappeared, made an impassioned plea for information via a social media campaign in 2012. 'While people are talking about the case, there is always hope,' Ms Ratcliffe said. 'It's time Joanne came home. We are over wanting to know who did it, how they did it and why they did it.' 'We want to be able to lay (Joanne) to rest and lay my dad's soul to rest also.' Hart's family have said while he was not with them at Adelaide Oval on the day in question, he would have 'almost certainly' been somewhere at the field. Joanne and Kirste were last seen around 5pm on the day they were abducted, in North Adelaide with their abductor. Last year Hart was still the key suspect in the chilling case, and officers knocked down walls and dug up the backyard of his property in Yatina.","Joanne Ratcliffe, 11,  and Kirste Gordon, 4,  went missing  August 25, 1973 .

"Passengers aboard a SkyWest flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, were stunned Tuesday when an hour from reaching their sunny vacation destination, their pilot turned the plane around due to 'paperwork issues.' Flight 4507 departed Salt Lake City International Airport just after noon Tuesday, carrying 57 travelers en route to the popular resort town on the Pacific Ocean. But less than two hours into the three-hour flight, a pilot's voice came over the intercom to announce that the small Canadair jet will be returning back to Utah. Scroll down for video . Clerical snafu: SkyWest Flight 4507 carrying 57 passengers to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Tuesday was forced to turn around and return to Utah due to a paperwork issue . Unpleasant surprise: The plane was about an hour from reaching its destination when a pilot announced the bad news . 'It's something that we wouldn't have known what to do as pilots as far as this airplane not being allowed to land in Mexico,' the crew member uttered over the PA system, according to a cellphone video obtained by KSL. The pilot explained to passengers that he could not land in Puerto Vallarta. Instead, he said the plane will be diverted to Tucson, Arizona, to be refueled before returning to Salt Lake City. 'Again, we do apologize,' the pilot said over the intercom to the 57 disappointed passengers. Casey Boyd, from Denver, was flying to Mexico on vacation with his wife and child when their plans were unexpectedly derailed by an unspecified clerical error. ‘No, it sounds pretty unbelievable,’ Boyd said. ‘It doesn't sound like maybe the whole story.’ A spokeswoman for SkyWest Airlines stated that Flight 4507 landed in Salt Lake City at around 6pm to correct a 'paperwork issue.’ Pit stop: Instead of landing at Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport in Puerto Vallarta, the SkyWest jet headed to Arizona to be refueled . Back to square one: At around 6pm, the plane landed in Salt Lake City, where passengers were offered hotel rooms and food vouchers for the night . The unfortunate travelers were offered free hotel rooms for the night, issued vouchers for food and other expenses, and rebooked on another flight departing Wednesday morning. ‘We apologize to those customers we've inconvenienced and are working to get them on their way as quickly as possible,’ the statement read. The airline representative did not specify the paperwork issue that kept the SkyWest plane from landing in Mexico Tuesday. Casey Boyd said that before takeoff Tuesday, the gate agent said the flight was overbooked because they were using a smaller plane that originally planned . It has been suggested that perhaps the replacement plane did not have the right documentation to touch down in Puerto Vallarta, but no one noticed the mistake until it was too late.","SkyWest Flight 4507 departed Salt Lake City International Airport Tuesday afternoon, carrying 57 vacationers to Puerto Vallarta .

"Oral Bryan denies murdering his ex-partner and the mother of two of his children, Nicola McKenzie, (pictured) with a hockey stick during a row last year . A father-of-five murdered his ex-partner in front of their children by hitting her across the head with a hockey stick 'like an axe', a court has heard. Nicola McKenzie, 37, was allegedly killed by her ex-partner Oral Bryan during a row in the street on September 17 last year. She suffered serious head injuries after he swung the hockey stick 'like an axe' and hit her with 'severe force' - she died two days later. Bryan, 44, of Moss Side, Manchester, denies murder and told police he acted in self-defence. Manchester Crown Court heard yesterday that the fatal incident took place after Ms McKenzie turned up at Mr Bryan's home, where she was allegedly 'abusive and aggressive' to another woman with whom he had three children. All five children were present when 'devoted mother' Ms McKenzie was knocked unconscious by Bryan. Opening the case, prosecutor Mark Kellet described how in the moments before she was hit, a passing postman heard Ms McKenzie say to Bryan: 'These are your kids, go on, show them what you're like.' The court heard Bryan then turned around and walked back to his house before returning with the hockey stick. Mr Kellet said: 'The witness could hear the lady who must be Nicola shouting, ""go on, hit me, I want you to hit me."" 'That's exactly what the defendant did, striking a single blow across the head, causing her to fall to the floor on the road.' Following his arrest, Bryan told police 'I didn't mean to hurt her'. He said that Ms McKenzie attacked him with a knife and that he struck the fatal blow accidentally as he tried to disarm her with the hockey stick. But Mr Kellet said no knife was recovered from the scene and that none of the witnesses saw one. Mr Kellet told the jury: 'You will be sure that rather than jabbing or flicking at Nicola to disarm her, Nicola wasn't in possession of a knife and there wasn't a jab or flick - this was a hockey stick raised, brought down with severe force, knocking her unconscious. Ms McKenzie was knocked unconscious by Bryan in front of their daughter Teja and son Amahri (pictured) 'The location, the nature of the laceration, swelling, bleeding, bruising and nerve damage to the brain is all consistent with a blow of severe force, as described by all the witnesses. 'This was an unlawful assault striking a violent blow and at the time of striking this blow the defendant must have intended to cause at the very least really serious harm. 'Consequently, the Crown say having heard the evidence you will be sure the defendant is guilty of murder.' Following her death last year daughter Teja and son Amahri described Ms McKenzie as a 'devoted mother'. The case continues. The incident occurred on this quiet residential street in Moss Side, Manchester on September 14, 2014 . Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard  the fatal incident took place after Ms McKenzie turned up at Mr Bryan's home where she was 'abusive and aggressive' to another woman with whom he had three children .

"A new study suggests tall rooms (stock image pictured) encourage people to explore space as well as think freely, as previously discovered . When choosing the perfect house, many people opt for high ceilings and a sense of space, despite premium price tags and the higher cost of heating airy expanses in the winter. Now a new study suggests that tall rooms excite the brain and encourage people to explore space, building on previous research that high ceilings are linked to a sense of freedom. A psychologist thinks that the combination of a room that promotes free thinking and is stimulating to the senses, explains why people choose airy homes. Dr Oshin Vartanian of the University of Toronto-Scarborough, told Fast Co Design: ‘On the one hand, rooms [with high ceilings] promote visuospatial exploration, while at the same time they prompt us to think more freely. ‘This could be a rather potent combination for inducing positive feelings.’ An international study, led by Dr Vartanian scanned the brains of volunteers while they looked at images of 200 rooms, half of which had high ceilings. Participants indicated whether each image was beautiful or not while in the fMRI scanner and the experts found that people were more likely to find spaces with high ceilings attractive, than those with low ceilings. Studying levels of brain activity, they also discovered heightened activity triggered by high ceilings in two areas of the brain associated with visual exploration – the left precuneus and left middle frontal gyrus. Scientists studied volunteers' reactions to rooms with high and low ceilings using an fMRI scanner and found that airy rooms activated areas of the brain associated with visual exploration, while more enclosed spaces (stock image is shown) did not catch people's attention and stimulate their senses . This suggests that high ceilings capture people’s attention and stimulate the senses, encouraging people to explore the space they are in. But because the fMRI results didn’t show any difference in brain regions linked to pleasure or emotion, the study, published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, hints that high ceilings don’t instantly put people in a good mood. Interestingly, enclosed rooms were more likely to ‘elicit exit decisions’ and activity in brain regions such as the anterior mid cingulate cortex, suggested enclosed spaces might trigger an emotional response. Studying levels of brain activity, theydiscovered heightened activity triggered by high ceilings in two areas of the brain associated with visual exploration – the left precuneus (marked in red on this stock image) and left middle frontal gyrus . Last year, a study of 2,000 homeowners revealed that in 68 per cent of cases, the majority of the decision of where to live was made by women. It was commissioned by online estate agent Quick Move Now. Seven out of ten men said they were happy for their wife or partner to take the lead when it came to choosing their dream home. It also emerged one in five men have agreed to buy a property on their wife's say-so - without even seeing it. The research  showed 73 per cent of women admitted they took the lead visiting estate agents, looking at ads and organising viewings of potential homes - compared to just 51 per cent of men. In 2007, another study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, revealed that the height of ceilings affects how people think. Marketing experts Joan Meyers-Levy and Rui Zhu modified the height of ceilings in rooms to study how participants responded. They discovered that high ceilings seem to cause people to think more freely, encouraging creativity and abstraction, while lower ceilings promoted confined thinking. For example, one experiment placed volunteers in a room with a high 10ft (3 metre) ceiling, while asking them to solve anagrams. They were able to complete work puzzles for ‘liberated’ and ‘unlimited’ faster than those in a room with a lower eight ft (2.4 metre) ceiling. However, when the words related to feelings of entrapment, like ‘restricted’, the findings were reversed and those in the more confined space out performed those in the room with the higher ceiling. Dr Vartanian said: ‘Knowing that people's preference for rooms with higher ceilings might be driven by the ability of those spaces to promote visuospatial exploration helps partly explain why people opt to live in such spaces, despite the fact that they cost more to purchase and maintain.’","Study found high ceilings stimulate the senses and explore space .

"Australian teen suicide bomber Jake Bilardi  was sitting on the couch of his Melbourne home, across from one of his brothers, when he panicked. The future jihadist, then 16-years-old, started shaking with anxiety, his heart pounding, trying to avoid eye contact with his sibling, 'too scared to move'. 'I had begun to believe he was a complete stranger out to kill me... I just looked around the room, wondering if there were hidden cameras some where (sic),' he purportedly writes in an online post. 'I realised what was happening after about 10 minutes however I didn't sleep that night because I was really scared for hours after.' A series of questions posted to Yahoo! Answers, seen by Daily Mail Australia and purportedly belonging to Bilardi, provide a troubling insight into the warped mind of the troubled young Melbourne man, who this week reportedly blew himself up in Ramadi, Iraq, 110km west of Baghdad. In this post titled 'I don't feel like this is my home?' two years ago, 'Jake' asked Yahoo! users what could be wrong with him as he had never had an episode 'as serious as this'. Jake Bilardi in a school photo from Year 10 (left) - the year he converted to Islam, according to school friends - and in Year 11 (right) before dropping out of school . 'My biggest problem is that it's a bad photo of me, hahaha': The photograph of Melbourne teen Jake Bilardi which was first released to show his allegiance to Islamic State . Extract: This one of 60 questions an account believed to belong to Jake Bilardi posted on Yahoo! Answers . On Thursday, an image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter . He said 'since I was about 11 or 12 years old I have felt sometimes like my home wasn't really my home and that it was all a set up. 'I am now 16 years old and it has gotten to the point where I it feels like I am on a movie set, I live with two older siblings and I sometimes even start to question who they are and believe that they are plotting to kill me'. Users advised he see a psychiatrist, or a doctor. Jake asked 60 questions on the service, sometimes seeking advice on serious matters such as this one. Sometimes they are the studious, perhaps school-related questions of an intelligent teenager, for instance asking whether Russia is a part of Asia or Europe. At other times, he shows typical teenage insecurity. Jake asked Yahoo! users if 'appearance is important in journalism' and said he had unsuccessfully applied for a job at one of his local newspapers. 'I am looking for a job in journalism and I was wondering if good looks are important. I will admit now that I am ugly although I really want to do journalism and was wondering if there is any importance toward appearance in order to be employed,' he said. In interviews with six of his stunned former classmates at Craigieburn Secondary College on Thursday, Daily Mail Australia was told the former maths whiz and founder of a children's soccer charity had harboured ambitions of becoming a political journalist. Other questions reveal his increasingly devout pursuit of the Islamic and parts of his ultimately successful plan to join the fighting in the Middle East. One of 60 Yahoo! Answers questions asked by an account believed to belong to Jake Bilardi, the Australian jihadist who purportedly blew himself up on Wednesday . Charity founder: Bilardi co-founded the Soccer For Hope Organisation (SHO) which removes youths from the streets of Uganda and uses soccer as a tool to improve their lives . Suicide bomber: ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up while driving it . Over the years, he sought advice on how to correctly follow his Islamic faith, requesting help on how he could pray at school and at his job, at a Safeway supermarket. Around a year ago, he even asked if he could still celebrate Christmas as a Muslim. 'Is it alright for me to continue taking part because some people in my family still aren't happy with my decision and I have been trying to make things as normal as possible, so it would be really awkward and weird if I wasn't taking part,' he asked. His final four questions to the online community betray his decision to leave the country, asking about Australian immigration processes, including his concerns about how he had made a mistake on his application for an Australian passport ten months ago. Seven months ago, he asked about the 'outgoing passenger cards' that Australians generally sign at the airport. 'I need an outgoing passenger card to leave Australia and I don't know where I can get one. 'People have told me I can get it at the check-in counters but I am going to check in online so I can avoid the lines. 'Does anyone know where I can get one?' The Federal Government is investigating the reports of Bilardi's suicide mission. A third photo published on social media by IS, no doubt specifically chosen for Bilardi's westernised appearance in it, showed the teen wearing a blue Chelsea Football Club shirt . A Craigieburn schoolmate was shocked because Bilali 'really kept to himself and didn't cause trouble' The bullying tactic sees a group of people slap their victim and film it on a camera phone before uploading it online in order to humiliate them .

"A high school student who suffers from autism and Down Syndrome was given a varsity letter by his mother to celebrate that he had begun playing special needs basketball at his high school, and then shockingly told he had no right to wear that letter. Michael Kelley, who attends East High School in Wichita, Kansas, wore the letter, which his mother purchased for him, on a jacket, until he was told to remove it and never wear it again at school. Now though, many are coming out to show their support for Michael - including the Chicago Bulls. Scroll down for video . The mother of Michael Kelley (above) purchased him a varsity letter to celebrate his participation in a special needs basketball program . East High School (above) in Wichita, Kansas told the boy, who has autism and Down Syndrome, he could not wear a varsity letter . Chicago Bulls assistant coach and former player Adrian Griffin (above), has donated items to raise money for uniforms for Michael's team . 'Teachers told the parents they would prefer he not wear the letter on his jacket,' East High Principal Ken Thiessen told KSN. When asked if that policy might change however, given the situation, he said; 'We have considered it, and our decision was no. We decided that is not appropriate in our situation because it is not a varsity level competition.' Wanting more answers, Mrs. Kelley turned to the district, who said there was no official rule about who could and cold not wear a varsity letter. As for how this all happened, Mrs. Kelley said; 'Another parent, from what I am told, was upset that my son was wearing his letter jacket.' Michael however is getting a lot of support in the aftermath on this decision however, and a Change.org petition to change this rule already has over 30,000 signatures. In addition, many are voicing their support for Michael using the hashtag #GiveThemLetters on Twitter. Also, Adrian Griffin, the assistant coach of the Bulls, has donated an autographed jersey, basketball, and a Derek Rose bobble head to the Kelley family which he says they can auction off and use to buy uniforms for the special needs basketball team Michael plays on. 'Supporting Michael, East High and all special needs student-athletes who share the passion and drive for the game I love. We are All Blue Aces!' wrote Griffin, who attended East High Sxchool. Mrs. Kelley (above) said; 'Another parent, from what I am told, was upset that my son was wearing his letter jacket.' 'Teachers told the parents they would prefer he not wear the letter on his jacket,' said East High Principal Ken Thiessen . What's more, Mark Calvin, the principal and athletic director at Santana High School in Santana, Kansas has sent one of their varsity letter for Michael to wear. 'Before he got the letter he was one of the biggest cheerleaders in the school it was incredible, after he got the letter jacket it just sky rocketed him to another level,' said Calvin of Michael. He then said of the situation; 'We can’t be cookie cutter. We have all kinds of kids with all kinds of different needs and we need to be able to make our rules adjust to meet those needs.' He added; 'It’s a message to Michael that you can be a part of something anywhere you want to.' As for Mrs. Kelley, she is not just fighting for her adopted son Michael, but all the kids, saying; 'It’s not just my son. It’s every student that was out there last night. It’s every student that’s there on Fridays that plays their hardest and to the best of their capability regardless what that is.'","East High School in Wichita, Kansas told student Michael Kelley, who has autism and Down Syndrome, he could not wear a varsity letter .

So what does a woman need to know to bag one of the world’s richest men? Lady Lara gives us her guide to bagging a millionaire… . DON’T play hard to get: . Lady Lara says: ‘Women have been conditioned to believe that men will approach them because they do in other countries. ‘You go abroad and you say, ""Ignore the man, follow the rule book - play hard to get and he will approach you,"" but in the UK, women have to be more gentle and not overestimate male confidence. ‘Men here need a lot more encouragement than elsewhere, because Sloanes have developed as polite men. ‘It started in the 19th century with the debutante balls, where women would be escorted and presented to society – they had to be cherished.’ DON’T ask the man out: . Lara says: ‘Whilst I have said that British men are rubbish and the rule book shouldn't apply, I do think that women shouldn't go out there and ask a man out. ‘What you should really do is encourage them a lot more - smile, use body language, use your eyebrows, uncross your legs and play with your hair.’ Would you like to date a Sloane like the cast of Made In Chelsea (pictured)? Lady Lara tells you how . DO learn how to be funny: . Lady Lara says: ‘[Posh people] are terribly polite and often very well educated, mild mannered and self-deprecating, so they tend to rely on banter.

Lady Lara says: ‘If you go on a date, the most important thing looks wise is being elegant over sexy. ‘In order to find an eligible chap, you have to embody eligibility. ‘So it isn't about showing cleavage, leg and everything - so less is more. ‘It's about being elegant with your clothing - dress just a little bit better than you would normally. ‘Also, accessorise for the season and have a good handbag, good scarf and use of colour.’ There is a different way to date millionaires (picture posed by model) DO appear knowledgeable: . Lady Lara says: ‘Show you are well-read and have a brain - don't ask what they think of Chekhov on first date, but be well read on current affairs, . ‘Know what is going on in the news that day and have an opinion on things.’ DON’T pay for the first three dates: . Lady Lara says: ‘On the first three dates, the chap should pay, just because it’s good manners - he's inviting you and you are going out with him. ‘You can offer to buy a drink at the bar or something, but if you go for dinner then he should be the one to pay.’ And if it’s a celebrity you have your eye on? ALWAYS be discreet and DON’T pretend like you don’t know who they are: .

"Julie Andrews has revealed how the spectacular hilltop opening scene of the Sound of Music took a week to shoot because it was filmed with a helicopter before filmmakers had drones at their disposal. The famous scene sees the actress throw herself into a full-bodied twirl with her arms outstretched and sing the film’s opening words: ‘The hills are alive...’ And as part of a 50th anniversary special, Diane Sawyer and her film crew recreated the famous scene, but with a drone - it took them about four takes in just half an hour. Julie Andrew revealed that it took a week to shoot the famous scene where she throws herself into a full-bodied twirl with her arms outstretched and singing the film’s opening words: ‘The hills are alive...’ Diane Sawyer and her film crew recreated the scene with a drone in Germany (pictured) The drone flew over the top of the trees and captured Sawyer as she span around. It took her film crew about four takes in just half an hour . The 79-year-old told Diane Sawyer in the upcoming '20/20' special that although the shot looked perfect it required a great deal of effort . Although the film was set in Austria, the filming of the movie’s title song was carried out in Mehlweg in southern Bavaria. The 79-year-old actress told ABC's Diane Sawyer in the upcoming  '20/20' special that although the shot looked perfect it required a great deal of effort. 'This giant helicopter came at me sideways with a very brave cameraman hanging out the side of … where the door would be normally … the helicopter would shoot me, and I'd come from one end of the field and he'd come from the other,' Andrews recalled. 'I'd make the big turn, and then he'd go around me to go back and start again, and I'd run to the other end. Pictured left, the helicopter that filmed the opening scene to The Sound of Music fifty years ago and right, the drone that Diane Sawyer's team used . 'This giant helicopter came at me sideways with a very brave cameraman hanging out the side of … where the door would be normally … the helicopter would shoot me, and I'd come from one end of the field and he'd come from the other,' Andrews recalled . 'Every time he went around me, the downdraft from the jets would fling me down into the grass,' she said . Julie Andrews filming as Maria in The Sound Of Music which opened 50 years ago and quickly became the most popular film on the planet . 'But every time he went around me, the downdraft from the jets would fling me down into the grass.' Andrews, who was signed to play Maria for a fee of $225,000 (£150,000), without any share of the profits, had to have her hair and clothes  refreshed after each of the nine takes it took to get the scene completed. In his book ‘The Sound of Music Story’ Tom Santopietro details how having been knocked down on half of the ten takes, even the placid actress ‘finally got so angry I yelled, “That’s enough!”’ But she couldn’t be heard over the sound of the helicopter, and the pilot interpreted his star’s hand signals as a thumbs-up gesture of, ‘You’re doing great – let’s go for one more.’ Andrews, who was 28 during the filming, told Sawyer said that the brook, which was actually plastic filled with water, was also brought in by the movie studio and the birch trees were also brought in. In his book Santopietro writes how helicopter rentals were very expensive, and the budget was so slim on the film that With only the first half of the number requiring the use of the helicopter, as soon as the shot was captured, the pilot would instantly fly to Obersalzberg for the filming of the movie’s finale: the von Trapp family’s escape over the Alps into Switzerland. There was no money for even one more day’s helicopter rental. The story – based on fact – of Maria von Trapp, an Austrian nun turned governess who married into a musical family and defied the Nazis, inspired devotion and ardent fervour. On every continent where it played it set one box office record after another. It ranks as the fifth highest-grossing film of all time (when gross is adjusted for inflation) and is, arguably, the most beloved film ever.

"Early human ancestors may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago, a new study has suggested. Scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans. A study of fossils of Homo erectus, an extinct human ancestor, shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. Scroll down for video . A study of fossils of Homo erectus, an extinct human ancestor, shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. The above skeletons of Homo erectus were reconstructed from fossils that the researchers used in their study . This would have enabled Homo erectus to become a proficient hunter, able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey. Dr Neil Roach, an anthropologist at The George Washington University in Washington, said: 'The combination of inferiorly rotated, human-like shoulders with a tall, mobile waist and low humeral torsion, support Homo erectus as the first known hominin possessing the full anatomical complex associated with proficient throwing. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.8 million years ago - LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . 'While direct evidence of early throwing behavior remains elusive, evidence for the intensification of hominin carnivory and hunting behavior dating back two million years is increasing. 'We propose that this increased carnivory was facilitated by a flexible, situation-dependent hunting and scavenging strategy that included high-speed throwing.' In the study, which is published in the Journal of Human Evolution, compared the shoulder and collar bone sizes with modern humans and other species. They also examined the throwing ability of boys and men from the Daasanach tribes living around Lake Rukrana in north west Kenya and south western Ethiopia. Daasanach boys use bent throwing sticks called 'shar' to hunt small game and herd lifestock while adults will also hunt with spears. The researchers asked 27 Daasanach to hurl throwing sticks as far as they could, measuring the speed with radar guns and the distance. They compared their throwing ability to the dimensions of their collarbones and the humerous bone. The researchers found that the Daasanch were able to throw at speeds of up to 80mph (128km/h) - comparable to skilled athletes. They were able to hurl their sticks more than 328ft (100 metres) in many cases, with none throwing less than 196ft (60 metres). The world record for throwing the javelin, for example, is 321ft (98 metres) for men. The study showed that differences in collar bone size did not alter the length or speed of the throw. By comparing the results to fossils of Homo erectus, they conclude that this species of early human would have had similar throwing abilities. Homo erectus, shown in the reconstruction on the left and the skull on the right, is an extinct ancestor of modern humans that may have shared may of our abilities to throw and hunt, according to the latest research . It suggests that the ability to throw spears and other objects for hunting evolved long before our own species, Homo sapiens, appeared on the planet. The ability to throw powerfully and accurately has long been thought of as being a uniquely human trait. Chimpanzees, by comparison can only throw at speeds of around 20mph. The study builds on earlier work by Dr Roach that compared the throwing action of college baseball players with the skeletons of chimpanzees. They identified key change to the shoulder, arm and torso of humans that allowed them to store elastic energy in their ligaments and tendons to help power a throw forward with great accuracy. Homo erectus could have been able to throw further than many modern athletes, according to the research . Tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution, scientists say. The high-quality diet allowed mothers to wean babies earlier and have more children, meaning that human communities grew faster, according to researchers from Lund University in Sweden. The research compared 67 species of mammals, including humans, apes, mice and killer whales, and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning. They found young of all species stop suckling when their brains have developed to a particular stage, but that carnivores reached this point more quickly than herbivores or omnivores. Eating meat enabled the breast-feeding periods and thereby the time between births to be shortened, according tot he researchers. Among natural fertility societies, the average duration of breast-feeding is 2 years and 4 months. This is not much in relation to the maximum lifespan of our species, around 120 years. It is even less if compared to our closest relatives: female chimpanzees suckle their young for 4 to 5 years, whereas the maximum lifespan for chimpanzees is only 60 years. This was a crucial step towards evolving how to throw and led our ancestors to be able to hunt large prey. However, archaeological evidence of weapons like spears have yet to be found. Dr Roach said: 'A number of changes occurred in our evolutionary past to the shoulder, arm and torso make this elastic energy storage possible. 'They first occurred two million years ago in the species Homo erectus. That allowed us to throw with incredible velocity at around that time. 'We see hunting behaviour to emerge around that time. We think that throwing was important early on in terms of hunting behavoiur to allow our ancestors to kill big game and get more calories in their diet.'","Scientists compared the shoulders of Homo erectus with modern humans .
The researchers from The George Washington University measured the throwing ability of people from the Daasanach tribe in Kenya and Ethiopia .
Daasanach people could throw sticks at 80mph over more than 100 metres .

This young boy has a regal air in London as he poses up for a picture to show off his splendid fur-trimmed cape . The Jewish holiday Purim commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in the ancient Persian Empire from a plot intended to wipe them out. The story, which is recorded in the Biblical Book of Esther, tells the tale of how an advisor to King Ahasuerus named Haman planned to kill all the Jews, only for his wicked plot to be thwarted by the king's wife Esther and her adoptive father Mordecai. Haman had selected a day on which he would annihilate the entire Jewish population and had sent out a decree bearing the King's seal, ordering that every Jewish man, woman and child. But Esther - who had been chosen as Ahasuerus's wife by taking part in a beauty contest and concealing the fact she was Jewish - later convinced the King to send out a new decree allowing the Jews to rise up and defend themselves - thus saving their lives. 'It is commemorated with a day of feasting with presents of food and charity given to the poor,' a member of staff at The Board of Deputies of British Jews told MailOnline. 'The story is read out in synagogues and it really is a carnival. It's a very happy time. 'Children traditionally get dressed up as Esther, or the King but they can wear anything they like really. And in the synagogue they are given football rattles and noisemakers to drown out Haman's name so it's great fun. 'People go from house to house to give presents of food, such as cake or biscuits and something to drink like wine or juice. 'It's the best time for children because they can go to the synagogue, get dressed up and have lots of fun.'

"Roger Clemens will not have to pay Brian McNamee a dime after a settlement was reached in the defamation lawsuit that was brought against the former MLB pitcher by his ex-trainer in 2008. The terms of the settlement call for an undisclosed amount of money to be paid by the former Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees pitcher's insurer AIG. The deal will not require the seven-time Cy Young Award winner to contribute any money or release any claims against McNamee, attorneys for both men said on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Roger Clemens' insurer AIG will pay his ex-trainer Brian McNamee an undisclosed sum after a court settlement . The deal that that was reached in the defamation lawsuit will not require Clemens, 52, to contribute any money . The 2008 lawsuit alleged Clemens pursued a public relations attack against McNamee (pictured above) McNamee sued Clemens, 52, for defamation in 2008 after the pitcher said McNamee lied and manufactured evidence when he accused the pitcher of using banned performance-enhancing drugs . That lawsuit alleged Clemens pursued a public relations attack against McNamee after the onetime strength coach told federal agents and Congress he routinely injected the hard-throwing right-hander with steroids and human growth hormone from 1998 through 2001. Clemens, who pitched until he was 45, has denied the charges and told ESPN McNamee's case was an example of 'somebody out there that is really crawling up your back to make a buck.' Clemens won seven Cy Young Awards in his career . The resolution to the long-running dispute was reached after closed-door negotiations before US Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak in Brooklyn. The case was moved to federal court in 2009. Clemens didn't attend the settlement talks. His lawyer, Chip Babcock, said AIG negotiated the settlement with McNamee, according to the New York Daily News. Babcock said last month: 'If the insurance company wants to pay Mr McNamee, there is not much I can do about that.' McNamee's attorney Richard Emery said the agreement was fair and allowed everyone involved to move on. He said: 'At this point it's water over the dam. 'It's high time. This is old news these days.' Clemens, who also plitched for the Toronto Blue Jays and the Houston Astros in his two-decade-long career, was found not guilty in 2012 of charges of obstructing Congress, making false statements in a deposition and committing perjury when he denied using steroids or human growth hormone injected by McNamee. After the deal was reached, McNamee told reporters it hadn't sunk in yet. He said: 'I got to digest this. 'I got to go home and have a good meal. Let me sit with it.' Clemens has a homeowner's insurance policy with AIG. A spokesman the insurer declined to comment.","McNamee sued Clemens in 2008 after pitcher said old trainer lied in court .

"Oz is an award-winning oriental long haired cat who captured the attention of spectators at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney for the distinctive markings on her nose that bear a striking resemblance to a map of Australia. ‘Oz was on display yesterday and we all just thought ‘Wow, this is the most amazing cat we have ever seen,’ Anne Fawcett, a volunteer vet who spotted Oz at the show, told Daily Mail Australia. Oz was born with black markings on her nose but it was only as she started to get older that she realised the remarkable likeness they had to a map of Australia . Oz is owned by cat breeder Deborah Nugent who told Daily Mail Australia the Sydney show was the young cat's debut on the show circuit. She said Oz was born with a 'black splotch' on her nose but it was only as she started to get older ti developed the remarkable likeness to a map of Australia. Oz is due to mark her first birthday this week and Ms Nugent said she had intended to take her home in time to celebrate. But Oz's popularity at the show has meant Ms Nugent is now considering bringing the cat back to the show on Thursday so her fans can get the chance to meet her. Oz at ten weeks when her black marking was looking more like a 'splotch' than her namesake . Judging from the pictures, it looks like the map is missing one very important feature, the southern island of Tasmania. Dr Fawcett said if you look closely you can see a small black marking on the bottom of Oz’s chin. ‘There’s definitely a little Tassie under her chin. It’s a bit more central and probably a bit bigger than the real Tassie but it’s definitely there,’ she said. ‘There’s definitely a little Tassie under her chin.

"The skills that come with lumberjack sports are traditionally left to big, burly men wielding axes and monstrous saws. But this is changing with women donning their 'lumberjill' boots and proving their place in the male dominated sports. Erin LaVoie from Washington has two world records and a multitude of wins under her belt but she insists her win  at Sydney's Royal Easter show is one of the biggest. Scroll down for video . Erin LaVoie from Washington has won the Ladies Single Handed Sawing Championship at Royal Easter Show . The 32-year-old competes in single handed sawing that sees competitors cut through 300 millimetre logs . Erin already has two world records under her belt and owns a CrossFit gym in Washington . On Sunday she won the Ladies Single Handed Sawing Championship that sees competitors slice through 300 milimetre logs with huge cross cut saws. 'The Easter show is one of the biggest competitions so it was a huge deal for me,' Erin told Daily Mail Australia. The 32-year-old also competed in the wood chop category which is usually her forte, but she says that she did not have a prime block of wood and this makes it much more difficult to carve up the log. Erin also competes in the wood chopping category . 'My fastest chop is 24 seconds and I have two world records in the underhand chop which are around 30 seconds,' she said. Whilst the quality of the piece of wood quality is the luck of the draw, the technique and equipment are not with top of the line axes costing up to $600. 'The axes and saws are not cheap, but they have to be top notch if you want to win,' Erin said. 'The maintenance of them is expensive too and you need to know where to go.' Women's prevalence in the sport is still scarce and many females must compete against males in order to be involved at all. 'I still compete against men in many competitions,' Erin said. 'It's obviously really tough as they can deliver so much power, but this means it's so much more rewarding when you win.' Women's involvement largely started with the Jack and Jill sawing division that sees a man and a woman working as a team to slice through the log. 'Mostly women get into it because their husbands need a partner for Jack and Jill so they train up their wives,' Erin said. 'But I do it because I love it and it's my thing.' Erin grew up with brothers and loved to do male things so when she noticed the lumberjack team training down the hall at her school, she signed up. After a short amount of time she was travelling and competing in various chopping and sawing competitions - and winning. Erin also competes against men and admits she loves the feeling of pride when she beats them . Her fastest woodchop is 24 seconds and she holds two world records in the underhand chop of 30 seconds . Although she owns a CrossFit gym in Washington, her training regime mostly consists of chopping and sawing logs in her backyard. 'I have a friend who is a logger, so that's super handy!' She said. The Royal Easter Show also contains a Junior Development Program for aspiring Lumberjacks to get involved. According to the ABC, 16-year-old Lucy Backhouse and her 13-year-old sister Kate are the only two females competing in this program. The sisters from New South Wales have gained quite a following and always get a large applause no matter how they place. 'It doesn't matter who comes first, we always get the biggest cheer because no girls do this sport,' Lucy said. It their mother, Wendy, three years battling with the Human Rights Commission for the sisters to be allowed to compete. 'A lot of people don't consider it a sport. But I like it because it is so different, it's a challenge and it takes stamina and technique,' Lucy said.","Erin LaVoie from Washington has taken out the Ladies Single Handed Sawing Championship at Sydney's Royal Easter Show .

"A GM ‘super spud’ claimed by scientists to be healthier to eat, cheaper to grow and better for the environment could be field tested in Britain next year. But plans for the trials were condemned last night by critics who argue that genetically modifying crops to create ‘Frankenfoods’ could threaten natural ecosystems and human health. Scientists at the publicly funded Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich are hoping to develop the potato using eight genes from other varieties. Scientists claim to have be close to engineering a GM ‘super spud’ which is healthier to eat, cheaper to grow and better for the environment. A stock image of non GM potatoes is pictured . They claim this will reduce the risk of potentially harmful acrylamide chemicals forming when potatoes are fried – a problem that has been linked to cancer. The added genes will also protect against potato blight, which costs UK farmers £60million a year in losses and use of fungicides, and nematode worms. Professor Jonathan Jones, who is leading the project and is already in negotiations with the US firm Simplot to commercialise the potato, said GM technology is the only way to achieve such results. But field trials, which the scientists hope to begin in 12 months’ time, will first have to be approved under tough EU regulations and are likely to attract protesters, requiring them to be conducted behind high fences. Anti-GM groups said last night the project was a waste of taxpayers’ money and even if the scientists’ claims were proven, consumers would never want to buy the resulting food. Critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ‘Frankenstein foods’ could damage natural ecosystems. A stock image of a protester is shown . Professor Jones and his team have previously developed a potato which, after three years of trials, was shown to ward off blight and increase yields. They sold the results of that research to Simplot and are looking to develop the idea by introducing further genes. Peter Melchett, of the Soil Association, said: ‘A previous GM potato, launched in 2009, was claimed to be the answer to the blight disease common in the UK potato crop. ‘Now we’re told that won’t work, and a GM potato needs up to eight different GM characteristics to be useful. ‘As with other GM research, this is a complete waste of time, money and scientific expertise.’ Liz O’Neill, of the campaign group GM Freeze, said: ‘Blight is very good at evolving – this might just force a faster evolution of the disease.’ Although there have been field trials in the past, no GM food has ever been commercially grown in Britain because of European regulations that make it difficult to get licences. It means that although British researchers are leading the way in developing GM technology, the end results are usually snapped up by foreign firms. Professor Jones said GM ‘has been shown to be safe’, and before the potato could be sold, it would need extensive testing and authorisation from EU bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority. He added: ‘Some people have concerns about us partnering with industry, but as research scientists we… need commercial partners if the public are to gain the benefits of our research.’ Professor Jonathan Jones, who is leading the project said the new potato ‘aims to be better for the environment, reduce production costs, reduce waste and also be healthier’. He hopes to conduct field trials in just 12 months time. A stock image of a field of potatoes is shown . Suspicious research: Professor Gilles-Eric Seralini, who authored a study claiming GM gives you cancer, is backed by a homeopathy group . The myth: Food that has been genetically modified may be harmful to humans. And that doesn’t include many more made with milk or meat from animals given GM feed. There has yet to be one case of any ill-effect. The myth: Trials show GM feed may cause cancer or stomach problems in animals. The truth: . The author behind the ‘bogus’ research fuelling this claim, Prof . Gilles-Eric Seralini, is closely linked to and funded  by leading . members of a homeopathy group which believes bone cancer can be cured . with water and minute quantities of magnesium. The research has been attacked by every major scientific institution in the field, including the European Food Standards Agency. The myth: GM strains will cross-pollinate and so ‘contaminate’ other crops and . man will have irrecoverably interfered with the stuff of life. Others like potatoes are cultivated . via tubers, so pollen is not an issue for them either. As for rice, it’s . also mostly self-pollinating. The myth: Organic food is safer. The truth: . The Food Standards Agency says there’s no evidence – and furthermore, . germs from manure create risks of their own: an E. coli outbreak in . organic beansprouts in Germany killed 50 people in 2011 and last month . in the US 100 people contracted the serious liver disease hepatitis A . from organic berry yohurt. The myth: GM will lead to a stranglehold by multinationals like Monsanto. The truth: Many GM crops have been developed by universities and are not patented. The full cost of developing Golden . Rice, which will remedy the vitamin A deficiency which kills and blinds . millions of children per year, is being met by the charitable project . behind it.","British team has agreed government funding to develop a GM potato .

"A college student has been cleared following allegations he sexually assaulted a 19-year-old woman while trying to recreate Fifty Shades of Grey. Mohammad Hossain, 19, was accused of tying up his victim, a fellow student, whipping and punching her before raping her in his dormitory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. But judge Peggy Chiampas found no probable cause during a preliminary hearing during the alleged victim's testimony. Charged: Mohammad Hossain, 19, is accused of tying up a fellow student, also 19, whipping and punching her before raping her in his dormitory at the University of Illinois at Chicago . According to the Chicago Tribune the woman spoke for 90 minutes about the encounter with Hossain on February 21. She described how it started out as consensual, but she then asked him to stop. She said: 'I was saying, 'No, stop,' shaking my head from side to side. 'He said, 'I want to see how much you can take,'' she added. 'He said, 'I want to see you cry'.' She told the court she had met Hossain last year and became 'friends with benefits'. They started to experiment with bondage . When she had finished being questioned by Hossain's lawyers and prosecutors, the judge asked her whether she said anything to Hossain when he bound her wrists or while he allegedly sexually assaulted her. She said no to both. Joshua Kutnick, Hossain's lawyer, told reporters after his client was 'happy that the truth is coming out.' 'It was clearly shown that this incident was consensual,' he said. 'It was two college students who were having a sexual encounter and that's all that it was. The engineering student had admitted to police that he assaulted the woman, but explained to them that it was because they were 're-enacting scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey'. During her testimony the woman denied they were recreating scenes from the film. Mr Hossain, a college freshman and student ambassador to the alumni association, and the woman went to his room on Saturday afternoon. Hossain is said to have asked her to remove her clothing, which she consented to but kept her bra and underwear on, before tying her hands and legs with belts, the Chicago Tribune reports. He used a necktie to cover her mouth and pulled a knit cap over her eyes, before removing her underwear, Assistant State's Attorney Sarah Karr told the Cook County court. Mr Hossain then struck her several times with a belt before she told him to stop as he was hurting her, the court heard. The woman 'began shaking her head and crying', but Mr Hossain is said to have continued to hit her with the belt and also punched her several times. Copy cat: The engineering student allegedly admitted to university police that he assaulted the woman, but explained to them that it was because they were 're-enacting scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey' Assault: The victim, also a University of Illinois at Chicago student, said Mr Hossain continued to whip and punch her with his fists after she began crying and telling him to stop, before proceeding to rape her . Despite the victim crying and continuing to beg him to stop, Mr Hossein held her arms behind her back and sexually assaulted her, an arrest warrant claims. The woman left Mr Hossain's dorm after the alleged assault and reported the incident to the police. Mr Hossain was arrested by campus police, and after admitting to 'doing something wrong' and assaulting the woman, he told officers they had been 're-enacting scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey', Ms Karr said according to the newspaper. The hit film Fifty Shades of Grey is an adaptation of the adaptation of the best-selling novel by British author E.L. James. The film, which stars James Dornan as BDSM-loving billionaire Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as innocent college student Anastasia 'Ana' Steele, spent a second weekend at the top of the U.S. and Canadian box office charts. Fifty Shades, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, has already racked up $410 million in global sales in less than two weeks, according to Universal Pictures.","Mohammad Hossain, 19, was accused of assaulting the woman in February .

And the lady who lives in that house - she and her husband are the two nicest people in the world, and they deserve to be treated well. 'And what's going on is - and this has been okay with her for a long time, that people come by and visit and get their picture taken in front of the house - just so long as they do so within reason and they do it in a respectful manner. 'But lately, we're hearing from her that folks are wandering onto her property and they are being rude to her when she comes out and basically says ""You're on my property,"" and they're throwing pizzas on roofs and stuff like that. 'Let me tell ya, there is nothing original or funny or cool about throwing a pizza on this lady's roof. She is [...] it is just not funny. It's been done before. You're not the first.' Actor Jonathan Banks, who played Mike Ehrmantraut in 'Breaking Bad' and reprises his role in 'Better Call Saul,' chimed in, saying 'And if I catch you doing it, I will hunt you down.'

"These are the amazing scenes as a giraffe was born in front of dozens of people at a South African game reserve.

Park co-owner Ayesha Cantor told The Herald: 'We don’t know the sex of the calf yet and no, it has not been named. However, it was born in full view of dozens of visitors, who were mostly locals, which is great because these are the folk that support this park very well. 'They certainly did not have to go all the way to the Serengeti to see this. What was also great was that I got to see the entire birthing process for the first time,” she said, adding that the gestation period for a giraffe was about 16 months. 'What was interesting was that it came out with a gel-like covering on its hooves. During the birth, the dominant male went over to the mother periodically to check how she was doing.' It is believed there are some 80,000 giraffes in the wild, down from 140,000 in 1999. During the birth, the dominant male approached the female to offer some prenatal support .

"To his adoring sons, Jonathan Weekes was the perfect dad - lavishing them with attention, treating them to trips away and spending every weekend caring for them. But behind Weekes’ fatherly devotion lay a dark obsession: he was hooked on trawling the web for vile child pornography. And when Weekes’ hapless family stumbled across his secret, he turned on them in the most cowardly way imaginable – he blamed the stash of obscene images on his own sons. Traumatised sons (Thomas, 25, left, and Adam, 22, right) had no choice but to confide in mother, Nicola Lewis, 47 (centre) after they made the shocking discovery . Devastated Adam – who has now disowned his dad and even changed his name by deed poll - said: ‘He may have brought me into this world, but he’s not my father. I hate him for what he’s put me through – and for what he is.’ Angry ex Nicola Lewis, 47, said: ‘Jonathan denied his guilt to the bitter end and tried to blame anyone and everyone around him – including his own family. It’s cost him everything and every person he was close to.’ Nicola was already a mum to two young boys – Thomas, 25, and his older brother, who has asked not to be named – when she met Weekes more than 20 years ago. Weekes treated the boys as his own and cemented his role as dedicated dad when Nicola fell pregnant with Adam, now 22. When their relationship fell apart, Weekes insisted on staying in touch with the children, and the pair agreed the boys would spend weekends with him. Nicola, from Aberdare in Rhondda, South Wales, added: ‘I had no complaints about Jonathan as a father and no qualms about the boys going to stay with him. 'When they were younger, they'd sleep over at Jonathan's house and they talked on the phone with him all the time. Jonathan pictured with his sons Adam (front) and Thomas when they were children . ‘As they got older, they had their own social lives but they always wanted to spend time with Jonathan. ‘They were great lads and I could see they really benefited from having a father-figure.' Adam’s happy memories of weekends at his dad’s in nearby Merthyr Vale include learning to shoot an air rifle, trips to the cinema and theme park outings. ‘Nothing was too much trouble,’ he remembers. ‘I’d stay with dad every weekend until I was about 16 or 17, and then every couple of weeks after that. I’d go over there after school on Friday and come home Sunday night. ‘I loved him, and I wouldn’t have done half the things I’ve done if it hadn’t been for him.’ But that love was destroyed one night two years ago when Adam was confronted by the awful truth that his dad hoarded sick images of child pornography downloaded from the internet. Adam recalls: ‘It was late at night and dad had already gone to bed. The weather had been rotten all day so we’d just been chilling at home. ‘I was still sat up. I’d downloaded some music and went to burn it onto a CD, but opened the wrong folder by mistake. ‘There were hundreds, maybe thousands of images of children in there – nasty stuff, too horrible to describe. Adam was too horrified to tell his family, carrying the burden of what he had found,  and endured three weeks of torment before he finally broke down . ‘I was in total shock, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I felt sick, angry and confused. ‘I logged off the computer and tried to sleep – but I couldn’t get what I’d seen out of my head. I barely slept a wink that night.’ The next morning, Adam concealed his horror and spent the rest of the day with his dad before returning home. Wrestling with his emotions, Adam knew he had to share his discovery – but couldn’t bring himself to tell his mum what he’d found. And bearing the dreaded burden alone came at an awful cost. ‘He was suddenly full of rage,’ says Nicola. ‘He had violent outbursts and fought with his brothers all the time. 'He refused to talk to me about what was going on and I didn't know what to do.' Adam admits: ‘My head was wrecked. I just couldn’t cope with what I’d seen, what I’d found out about my dad, and I went completely off the rails. ‘My temper went through the roof, I was horrible to everyone around me – friends, family and colleagues. I nearly lost my job because I was so awful to people at work.’ After three weeks of torment, Adam could no longer bear his secret alone and he finally broke down, revealing all to Nicola. ‘I was reading in bed,’ she says. ‘He came in and plonked himself down – he obviously had something he wanted to get off his chest. He told me he'd found things on his dad's computer, things that weren't very nice. 'Sitting bolt upright, I asked him what he meant, and then he admitted he'd found pornographic images of children.' The conversation was overheard by Thomas who revealed he, too, had been wrestling with the discovery of vile photos on his dad’s computer for the past six weeks. ‘I was furious he hadn’t said anything before, but at the same time relieved I wasn’t alone,’ Adam says. ‘He’d felt the same as me – neither of us had been able to tell the other because we didn’t want to believe what we’d seen with our own eyes.’ Nicola told the boys it was their decision whether to involve the police. ‘They wouldn't tell me exactly what they'd seen,’ she remembers. They were completely traumatised and refused to talk about it. ‘And I had to ask the question no mum ever wants to ask her children: “Were you abused by your dad?” ‘They insisted he’d never laid a finger on them. It was a massive relief but I still felt guilty. I wished I hadn't let them spend time alone at Jonathan's house. I blamed myself for what they'd been exposed to. 'Hearing the boys give their evidence, finally hearing in awful detail about the vile images they'd seen, tore me apart' - Nicola Lewis and the two boys were forced to give evidence in a painful week-long trial . ‘We all knew that reporting the crime would destroy their relationship with their dad forever, and would likely mean both of them having to give evidence against him. ‘But they’re both adults and I had no doubt they’d make the right choice – it was inevitable that they’d ask me to call the police.’ The boys gave statements and Weekes, 48, was arrested. Computer equipment was seized in a raid on his new home in Tredegar, Gwent. The family didn’t think the situation could get any worse – until Weekes betrayed his sons by blaming them for his vile horde of downloads. Nicola said: 'I couldn’t believe he'd sunk so low. The ridiculous accusations destroyed the boys. They were both in pieces. 'I sat down with them and told them that if it came to it, we'd prove they were telling the truth.' Adam commented: ‘The police told us he was trying to pin it on us, and also his own brother. I was white with rage when I found out. ‘The police looked into his allegations, but they were nonsense – he’d made some of the files years ago, when I was about nine years old. The police knew he was lying.’ Weekes denied all but the family hoped he would face up to what he’d done and change his plea to guilty. Instead, he played the legal system for two-and-a-half years before his case finally came to court. Finally facing justice last month, he forced Nicola and his sons to give evidence in a week-long trial. In a bizarre twist - Weekes was also prosecuted for impersonating a police officer after trying to pull over a real cop for speeding. Adam explained: ‘When we were young, dad had this odd obsession with the police. He had bits of uniform, stab vests, handcuffs and a baton. He even had a flashing blue light he’d stick on the car. ‘As kids, we thought it was kind of cool. As we got older, we knew it was odd – but as far as we knew he wasn’t doing anyone any harm. It’s chilling now to think what he might have been capable of.’ Weekes has since admitted the ruse and received a 12-month community order . The jury heard how nearly 6,000 indecent images were found on a computer and equipment seized from Weekes’ home, going back as far as 2003. Over 22,000 references to the phrase 'pre-teen' were found on his laptop. Nicola said: 'I thought he'd at least be man enough to own up to what he'd done. I never thought he'd make me or the boys take the stand in court. 'Taking the witness stand was the worst thing I've ever had to do. I was shaking like a leaf. 'And hearing the boys give their evidence, finally hearing in awful detail about the vile images they'd seen, tore me apart.' He was convicted unanimously on one count of possessing thousands of indecent images, another of possessing prohibited images of a child and one of possessing extreme pornographic images. He is awaiting sentence at Merthyr Crown Court. Adam changed his surname from Weekes to Lewis last year – and now wants nothing more to do with his father. ‘I want everyone to know what he is,’ says Adam. ‘The more people who know the better. He’s paedophile – and a coward.’","Jonathan Weekes, 48, from Tredegar, South Wales, was arrested after sons found thousands of 'nasty images' of children on laptop .

"Dramatic 911 calls have been released of fisherman telling police about a deadly car crash that resulted in a toddler being pulled alive from the wreckage . Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck died when she lost control of the car she was driving in Spanish Forks, Utah,  crashing into a river on Saturday. The 25-year-old was travelling in the car with her 18-month-old daughter Lily, who was miraculously pulled alive from the submerged vehicle despite being inside for 14 hours. Scroll down for video . Lone survivor: 25-year-old Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck (left) and her 18-month-old daughter, Lily (right), were found inside a crashed car in Utah's Spanish Fork river on Saturday. Groesbeck pictured above in a photo posted to Facebook . Spanish Fork Police Officers Tyler Beddoes, left, and Jared Warner, right, and Spanish Fork City Firefighters Lee Mecham, second from left, and Paul Tomadakis, second from right, answered questions Monday night regarding be the first responders on scene . Submerged: The temperature in the river was near freezing throughout the night after the car hit the river. Water flowed into the car through broken windows and rushed just below Lily's head . Rescuers say they used all their strength to right the red Dodge sedan, when they heard desperate pleas coming from a woman inside. Lily was then pulled from the wreckage with officers then discovering that her mother had been dead for hours. Now Spanish Forks police have released a transcript of the 911 calls made by an angler who saw the car submerged in the water. According to the Deseret News, the first call was made to a non-emergency line, with the caller saying: 'Are you guys aware there's a car in the river on the south end of Spanish Fork, Main Street, over the bridge? 'I didn't see anybody when I came in here and I can't see in the car.' Then four minutes later, the same caller dials 911 directly saying: 'There's a car in the river. It's upside down off of Main Street and there is a person inside. I can see a hand.' Car crash: Police believe that Lynn Groesbeck struck a cement barrier on a bridge before landing in the river upside down on Friday . Devastating: A fisherman found car the next day, partially submerged in the river. Groesbeck was found dead in driver's seat of vehicle, while her baby girl was alive in the back seat, above the frigid river waters . Since the dramatic rescue, police officers have spoke of how Miss Groesbeck, could not have possibly called out to rescuers because she was already dead. Officer Tyler Beddoes said: 'For two nights I've laid awake trying to figure out exactly what it could be. All I know is it was there, we all heard it. was extra motivation.' Mr Beddoes said that he and the other three people on scene responded to the voice calling for help when they approached the car. Officers then formed a line in the river and handed the cold girl to one another until she was on the shoreline and in emergency workers' arms. They rushed her to an ambulance and performed CPR. She is now in a stable condition in hospital and improving. It is still unclear how she managed to survive hanging upside down in her car seat for 14 hours with no food or water. Rescue mission: When Lily was retreived from the car, police officers handed the cold girl to one another until she reached the shore and emergency workers could rush her to the hospital . Aspiring dreams: Jill Sanderson, Lynn's sister, said Groesbeck was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life . Night drive: Police said that Lynn Groesbeck was driving home from her parents' house in Salem on Friday when the accident occurred . Unknown cause: Investigators are still unsure as to what caused the crash. There were no skid marks on the road and no signs of mechanical errors in the car . As she dangled, icy water rushed just below her head through broken car windows as the Dodge Caliber sat perched on the bank and rocks. The temperatures were near freezing throughout the night and through the morning. Mr Beddoes added: 'It's heartbreaking. Was she crying most the night?' 'It's a miracle... She was needed for sure elsewhere.' We can't explain the voice, but have no doubt we heard it. 'That's the part that really sends me for a whirl. I'm not really religious, but that's what you think of.' Police believe the accident occurred when the Miss Groesbeck, struck a cement barrier on a bridge and careened into the river late Friday in Spanish Fork, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City. She was driving to her home in Springville after visiting her parents in Salem. Mystery: A neighbor reported hearing a loud noise on Friday just after the car crash, but when they checked the area around Provo, no cause of sound could be located . Frigid: The waters of the river, just 50 miles outside Salt Lake City were near freezing. Multiple emergency responders were treated for hypothermia . Obstruction: Police said the car likely sat in the river for so long because the scene of the accident shielded by cement barriers on the side of the road . Investigators are still unsure of what caused the crash as there are no skid marks or signs of mechanical failures in the car. Police don't suspect drugs or alcohol as a factor but are awaiting toxicology test results. Paying tribute, Miss Grosebeck's sister Jill Sanderson said she had a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life, according to KSL . She said: 'She was very compassionate and a very loving person and always willing to bend over backwards for her loved ones. 'Her baby was the love of her life. She was an amazing mother.'

"George Osborne received a treble boost yesterday – as shares hit a record high, government borrowing tumbled, and the Tories saw a modest 'Budget bounce' in the polls. In the latest sign that a feel-good factor is returning to the economy, shares in Britain's biggest blue chip companies went through the 7,000 barrier for the first time. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares rose 60.19 points to 7022.51, giving a confidence boost to millions of savers and people with pensions. All smiles: George Osborne, at Old Trafford today, received a treble boost - as hares hit a record high, government borrowing tumbled, and the Tories saw a modest 'Budget bounce' in the polls . Taking it in: The Chancellor, with former England and Manchester United midfielder Sir Bobby Charlton, can take satisfaction from a YouGov Poll that showed the Budget had been well received by voters . The Chancellor was also cheered by a YouGov poll showing Wednesday's Budget has gone down well with voters. The survey gave the Tories a two-point lead over Labour – reversing a one-point Labour lead in a similar poll carried out just before the Budget. It put the Conservatives on 35 points, with Labour on 33. There was further good news for the Conservatives when official figures revealed that government borrowing fell by a third in February to £6.9billion, £3.5billion lower than it was in February last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Annual borrowing for the year to February stood at £81.8billion, 9.7 per cent lower than last year, leaving the Chancellor well on course to meet his updated target for cutting the huge deficit left by Labour. However the ONS was also forced to revise up the national debt after admitting an embarrassing £5.5billion miscalculation over the Government's bailed-out bank assets. In safe hands: Official figures revealed that government borrowing fell by a third in February to £6.9billion, £3.5billion lower than it was in February last year . Mr Osborne also went on the offensive, publishing Treasury figures which suggest Labour would borrow a staggering £138billion more than the Tories if they seize power in May. He told the Federation of Small Businesses conference in Birmingham that Labour's plans were a 'clear and present danger' to the economy. He later told LBC radio that – unlike Labour – the Tories would start to pay down Britain's £1.5trillion national debt. Pushing forward: Mr Osborne told the Federation of Small Businesses conference in Birmingham that Labour's plans were a 'clear and present danger' to the economy . He said: 'It sounds like an abstract concept, the national debt. But it means this country has to spend billions on interest repayments that could be spent on services like the NHS – and it harms growth. If the Labour Party get in then the national debt will start to rise again. We would be sliding back into economic chaos.' Yesterday marked the first time Britain's index of blue chip companies has breached 7,000 points since it was launched on January 3, 1984. This is good news for investors and those with a pension.","Shares in UK's biggest blue chip companies through 7,000 for first time .

"They are two of the nation's most famous scientists, famed for their ground-breaking work in the world of physics. But now, Professors Stephen Hawking and Brian Cox also share the honour of becoming fully fledged brands by turning their names into trademarks. Hawking, 73, whose life was played out in the successful biopic The Theory of Everything released this year, has applied to the Intellectual Property Office to have his name formally registered. Cox, 47, the Human Universe presenter, has already made the move. Professor Hawking has turned his name into a brand to prevent inappropriate retailers exploiting it . Online retailers, such as the site Redbubble, sell T shirts featuring a zombie Stephen Hawking above the words 'Hawking Dead' There is a wide range of Stephen Hawking memorabilia online, many of which include corny catchphrases . This will enable the pair to sell their brands for anything from greetings cards to disability aids to set up an educational charity. The principle reason behind Professor Hawking's move to trademark his name is for charitable purposes. It will give him the option of setting up a foundation, such as one promoting physics or for research into motor neurone disease, which has left him paralysed since he was diagnosed aged 21, in 1963. The move will also prevent others from exploiting his name with inappropriate products and sees him join the ranks of celebrities who have turned their names into brands, such as JK Rowling and David Beckham. There is a wide range of Professor Hawking memorabilia available on the internet, including a thong with his quote 'while there may be primitive life in our region of the galaxy, there don't seem to be any advanced intelligent beings', inked on the front. There is also a pair of boxer shorts, available for £8, with a cartoon sketch of the scientist on and T shirts featuring a zombie Professor Hawking above the words 'Hawking Dead'. A spokesman for Cambridge University, where he is a director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, told the Sunday Times: 'It's a personal matter, it is not a university issue, but he has taken measures to protect his name and the success it has brought.' TV science presenter Brian Cox has also turned his name into a trademark to prevent retailers cashing in on it . This Brian Cox doll is selling for £12.99 on Amazon (left), while the 'I love Brian Cox' badges are available for £1 . Mr Cox, who was also a keyboard player in the band D:Ream that produced the hit record Things Can Only Get Better (later used as a New Labour election anthem), may have also branded his name to protect his reputation. Amazon is selling a Brian Cox doll, at £12.99, which is described as being as 'cuddly as the brilliant Professor Brian Cox himself'. Retailers also offer coffee mugs bearing his face and T shirts with slogans such as 'I will do science to you', 'I am the master of the universe', and simply 'I love Cox'.","Professors hired lawyers to turn their names into trademarks to sell brand .

"Indonesia's president Joko Widodo has said abolishing the death penalty is possible, but this provides no hope for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera, Widodo shared his views on Indonesia's drug problem, executions, religion and economy. He democratically confirmed that if the people of Indonesia wished to abolish the death penalty, then it was more than possible. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Widodo shared his views on Indonesia's drug problem, executions, religion and economy . Sukuraman (left) and Chan (right) were sentenced to death after they were caught trying to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali into Australia . 'I think we are heading there,' he said. 'We want to hear what the people want, their opinion and it's a long process.' When asked on whether he had any remorse for the current 64 drug traffickers inevitably facing death row, including Chan and Sukumaran, Widodo defended his decision on denying them clemency. 'We want to send a strong message to drug smugglers that Indonesia is firm and serious in tackling the drug problem and one of the consequences is execution,' he said. 'We want to send a strong message to drug smugglers that Indonesia is firm and serious in tackling the drug problem and one of the consequences is execution,' Widodo said . Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in Central Java . Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Kerobokan prison . 'The court has sentenced them and we cannot discriminate between countries.' The Indonesian president justified his hard stance on the issue by stating that there are 4.5 million people in the country affected by drugs and this paints a grim picture for the future generations of Indonesia. However, he would not comment on whether he is a personal supporter of the death penalty. Al Jazeera's Step Vassen asked Widodo if he believes he is portraying a double standard by trying to free Indonesian drug traffickers who are facing the death penalty in other countries. 'No... As head of state of course I am going to try and save my citizens from execution,' he said. 'That's my obligation as a president, to protect my citizens.' Scroll down for video .

Tony Abbott revealed that he had again reached out to Joko Widodo to directly speak to him regarding the fate of Chan and Sukumaran. He is still waiting for a response. 'At this stage, it hasn't been able to be arranged,' he told reporters in Sydney. The executions of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were due as early as the weekend but have been delayed until all legal avenues have been exhausted, prompting fresh hope of a 'change of mind' from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. A spokesperson from the office of  Muhammad Prasetyo, Indonesia's attorney-general, confirmed on Friday afternoon that the government had placed the executions on hold. The planned executions of Australians Myuran Sukumaran, 33, and Andrew Chan, 31, have ramped up diplomatic tension between Australia and Indonesia .

Spokesman Tony Spontana said that no time frame could be placed on the legal processes, which may include a challenge to court decisions and further appeals. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that the delay may be the result of 'other reasons', but that she hoped the postponement showed a 'change of mind' by the Indonesian government, reported The ABC. Despite the postponement, Chan and Sukumaran will not be able to see their families until next week, with the earliest opportunity for visiting hours coming on Monday and Wednesday. After planning for weeks to execute 10 prisoners at once and keep them on Nusakambangan for as little time as possible, he now won't say how many will go to the firing squad and has speculated about a 10-day delay. Australia's Consul General to Bali Majell Hind  talks to officials at the entrance of Nusakambang island prison . Labor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said the uncertainty around the date of the executions was undoubtedly causing the condemned men anguish, but that the delays had also brought hope of a reprieve .

"The British Museum has announced it is to open a major new gallery dedicated to the Islamic world in the wake of fundamentalists destroying historical sites across the Middle East. The museum revealed it will open the new Albukhary Foundation Gallery of the Islamic World at the end of October 2018, which will bring together a collection showcasing ceramics, jewellery and paintings - some of which are not currently on display. The decision to open the new space, which will be created in two unused galleries on the first floor at the heart of the world-famous museum, comes at a particularly sensitive time for Islamic art and heritage. In recent years, it has come under threat from fundamentalists - with pictures of ISIS militants destroying some of the religion's most important historical sites shocking the world. The British museum is to open a major new gallery dedicated to the Islamic world including works such as this copy of a painted jar in response to fundamentalists destroying historical sites across the Middle East . Disappeared: These pieces by artist Michael Rakowitz represent items lost when museums in the Middle East were ransacked. This one is called Headless Female Figure, and will be included in the new gallery . In February, thugs used power drills and sledgehammers to smash invaluable ancient items which were housed in a museum in Mosul, while this month they destroyed 3,000-year-old Nimrud and 2,000-year old Hatra - both Unesco world heritage sites. Two years earlier, extremists linked to Al Qaeda torched the £16-million Ahmed Baba Institute, home to some 20,000 ancient documents on culture, science and geography, in Timbuktu. The destruction - the most recent of which was described as a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon -  has left experts and history lovers heartbroken. The project's lead curator Venetia Porter told the Evening Standard: 'What’s been destroyed in Iraq belongs to all of us.' Headless Female Figure Wearing Dress by Michael Rakowitz, left,  and Who is this Hossein the world is crazy about? by Iranian artist Hossein Zenderoudi, right . Another of Michael Rakowitz's works -  Cylinder Seal with Herd,  The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist . History: Rakovitz's works - like this Cylinder Seal with Lion - are displayed with information about the original . Ms Porter told the London newspaper the new, permanent space will provide a contrast to the modern Middle Eastern art collection the museum has been building up for a couple of years. The first of the two gallery spaces will look at the region from the beginning of Islam to about 1500, highlighting the arts of the great medieval dynasties. The second will focus on objects representing the pinnacle of creativity under the three major dynasties that dominated the Islamic world from the 16th century: the Ottomans, Safavids and Mughals. Contrast: The new gallery will complement the collection of modern Middle Eastern artwork, like Manal Dowayan's I am a Saudi Citizen, which the British Museum has been gathering for a number of years . A portrait of Abdo Ali Sheikh from  2013 is among the works that will be displayed in the new Albukhary Foundation Gallery . Both promise to 'radically' redisplay the museum's important collections, using dark areas to show off light-sensitive materials which can currently not be displayed. But the gallery will also look at the importance of the role of non-Muslim communities on impacting history. 'This new gallery we hope will enable people to look at the cultures of Islam from Spain to China in a deep and different way,' said Ms Porter. Destruction: The announcement came as valuable artifacts in the Middle East are destroyed . Gone: This man helped destroy Nineveh, the capital of Assyria in its final years of greatness . New: The Albukhary Foundation Gallery of the Islamic World will open in the heart of the British Museum (pictured) at the end of October 2018 - bringing back into use to old spaces on the first floor . When the space opens, it will be the first new permanent gallery created in almost a decade - thanks to a 'generous' donation from the Malaysia-based Albukhary Foundation. Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, said: 'This generous gift from The Albukhary Foundation makes it possible for us to completely redisplay one of the world's most important Islamic collections. 'These new galleries will allow us to present our collection in the context of world cultures exploring the history, complexity and diversity of Islamic cultures across the world from Sub Saharan Africa to Malaysia and Indonesia.'","New permanent exhibition will open in the heart of the museum in 2018 .

An Ohio State athlete (Kosta Karageorge pictured above) who killed himself has had his death ruled a suicide after a neuropathologist found he had suffered from concussions but did not show evidence of chronic brain damage . Wrestler and football player Karageorge, 22, had been missing for several days when his body was found in a trash bin with a handgun near his right hand in Columbus on November 30 (pictured above with his family) Coroner Dr Anahi Ortiz waited for neuropathology reports about Karageorge's (pictured right) brain before reaffirming in a final report on Friday that he died from a gunshot wound to the head . Neuropathologist Dr Norman Lehman from Ohio State University said there was evidence of prior concussive injury, according to The Columbus Dispatch. However, Karageorge was not found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition which results from continuous head trauma. CTE can only be diagnosed after death and symptoms include depression, confusion and anger issues, according to Cleveland.com . In January, Ortiz had ruled the athlete's death a suicide. Neuropathologist Dr Norman Lehman from Ohio State University said there was evidence of prior concussive injury. However, Karageorge was not found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which results from continuous head trauma . Investigators concluded that Karageorge and his girlfriend broke up around the time he disappeared on November 26 . Investigators concluded that Karageorge and his girlfriend broke up around the time he disappeared on November 26. The senior defensive tackle was last been seen at his apartment in Columbus, when his roommates said he left to go on a walk. Karageorge texted his girlfriend after 1am that day, saying he loved her and wanted to talk, according to text records released by police this year. When he received responses asking him not to speak again to her, he replied, 'I am gonna kill myself,' and he said that she should not go to his funeral, according to records. Texts sent to his mother, Susan Karageorge moments later said concussions were affecting his mind and he hoped he was not an embarrassment. Texts sent to his mother, Susan Karageorge moments later said concussions were affecting his mind and he hoped he was not an embarrassment (above scenes near the dumpster where Karageorge's body was found last November) Karageorge's body was discovered not far from his campus-area apartment by a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body . She told police she received a text from her son around 1.30am on that said: 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment but these concussions have my head all f***ed up.' Karageorge's mother told police he had had several concussions and a few spells of extreme confusion. He was discovered not far from his campus-area apartment by a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body. Dr Tom McAllister, chairman of psychiatry at Indiana University, who has studied concussions in college athletes, said that brain injuries seem to increase the likelihood of depression. If the person had depression or an anxiety disorder in the past, 'it often is the case that the concussion seems to exacerbate it,' he said. 'These injuries don't occur in a vacuum. People bring their own past history...into the injury.'","Kosta Karageorge, 22, had been missing for days before body was found in bin with handgun near his right hand in Columbus, Ohio in November .

"Adam Bojelian, 15, won international fame after writing poems through blinking, has died . A paralysed schoolboy who won international fame after he painstakingly composed poems letter by letter through blinking has died at the age of 15. Adam Bojelian from Edinburgh was born with cerebral palsy and lost all ability to move his body at just ten months old, leaving blinking as his only form of communication. His mother Zoe, 54, would watch as he used his eyelids to indicate the correct letter while she went through the alphabet, before publishing his compositions online. Fans from all over the world were touched by the schoolboy's poetry and even celebrities, including Hollywood star Ewan McGregor, have championed his work. One of his poems about Christmas was even turned into an iTunes hit by a professional composer in 2012 and he won a Brit Writers' Award and a Blue Peter Gold Badge for his poetry. Mrs Bojelian, who announced Adam's death on social media this week, previously explained how she noticed his special way of communicating when he was a toddler. She said: 'Adam was about one when he went to a playgroup for children with disabilities. They used to sing ""If You're Happy and You Know It Clap Your Hands"". 'Adam couldn't clap his hands, but I noticed every time they said ""clap your hands"" he blinked. 'As time went on it became clearer he was blinking when we asked him questions, and as he got older he counted by blinking. Over time it became obvious that's what he was doing.' Just a day before he died, Adam had been given an Inspirational Champion award by charity group Young Epilepsy for his work representing young people with the condition. Adam, pictured left with his mother Zoe, had cerebral palsy and lost all ability to move his body at just ten months old. His mother realised he could communicate by blinking when he was at playschool . Mrs Bojelian posted a photo of the award being presented to him at his hospital bed on social media. This rhyme is a puzzle, as you will see, . This rhyme tells what a good leader should be, . A good leader respects the young and the old, . A good leader observes and is prepared to be bold, .

Since announcing his death tributes have poured in from NHS staff, politicians and charity workers who had come to know his story. Dr Umesh Prabhu said: 'Simply can't stop crying. Learnt so much and touched so many hearts. #respect #humanity #love.' Louise Macdonald, chief executive of youth charity YoungScot, said: 'Everyone who met [Adam] was so inspired by his amazing poetry & spirit - a privilege to honour him. Shine bright #braveadam.' Scottish Government minister Humza Yousaf wrote: 'Deeply saddened hear passing of [Adam] love to all family & friends. Today world is a little bleaker having lost a true inspiration.' MSP Mark McDonald said: 'Such sad news, an inspirational young man who touched many directly & indirectly & will not be forgotten.' Ex-MSP Hugh O'Donnell paid tribute and posted: 'God Bless young sir. RIP.' Over six years, he spent much of his time at the Sick Kids's Hospital in Edinburgh where Mrs Bojelian said staff had treated him with 'neglect and indifference'. She wrote to former First Minister Alex Salmond to complain about the standard of care he was receiving and the attitude of staff members. She said: 'We are constantly reminded of his physical impairment. 'Staff at Sick Kids seem to start with the presumption that parents of a child with severe physical impairment will not want their child resuscitated.'","Adam Bojelian was born with cerebral palsy and couldn't physically speak .

"Britain's first dedicated hedgehog conservation area is launched today in an attempt to slow the species’ dramatic decline. The number of hedgehogs in the country are estimated to have dropped 40 per cent in the last two decades. Conservationists have created a ‘hedgehog improvement area’ which opens today in Solihull, the West Midlands. Scroll down for video . Britain's first dedicated hedgehog conservation area is launched today in attempt to slow the species’ dramatic decline (file picture) The Warwickshire Wildlife Trust project includes a 220-acre haven for the prickly mammals. A group of volunteers will manage the green space, helping to establish a central sanctuary from which it is hoped the hedgehog population will be able to disperse and inhabit the surrounding countryside. But Simon Thompson, hedgehog officer for Warwickshire Wildlife Trust, said people across the country can do far more to help by taking simple measures in their own back gardens. Part of the reason that hedgehogs have decline so far is thought to be linked to the widespread loss of bushes and hedges, which have been replaced in many back gardens by hard wooden or metal fences. Hard barriers make it impossible for hedgehogs to move from place to place - if they are isolated in smaller and smaller areas of greenery, they cannot feed or mate. Mr Thompson said: ‘Something as basic as linking up a series of small isolated green patches with a hole no bigger than the size of a CD is a remarkably powerful and positive action for hedgehog conservation. The number of hedgehogs in the country are estimated to have dropped 40 per cent in the last two decades (file picture) ‘Making these connections between our own fenced-in islands of green spaces creates a continuous habitat corridor through which hedgehogs can forage, seek shelter and even rendezvous with potential mates.’ Fay Vass, chief executive of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, which is backing the project, said: ‘We are delighted to be funding such an exciting and important project in Warwickshire that will hopefully benefit many hedgehogs. ‘Simple measures such as ensuring there is a five inch square gap in boundary walls and fences make a massive difference to local hedgehog populations. ‘There are many ways people can assist this declining species and we hope this project will complement our work to highlight the plight of the hedgehog.’","Britain's first dedicated hedgehog conservation area launches today .

"Ella Draper (pictured) and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture . An evil mother tortured her children to make up sickening allegations about a satanic cult based at a primary school in the midst of a seething child contact dispute, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Ella Draper and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in Hampstead, North London, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. She named and shamed the pair in a written ruling on care proceedings brought by a local council and said their internet campaign about the cult was ‘evil’ and ‘baseless’. The judge suggested the couple may have fed the two youngsters, aged eight and nine, cannabis soup to gain their compliance. More than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material and police had to protect worried parents at the gates of Christchurch Primary School where the ‘main action’ was alleged to have happened, the ruling said. The ‘grotesque’ claims against ‘blameless’ people included drugged babies being sent from abroad by courier services such as TNT and DHL to London and then sacrificed. Cult members were said to have drunk their victims’ blood and danced around with the babies’ skulls. At least seven other schools were named, a swimming pool identified as a meeting place and ‘rituals’ were alleged to have been performed at a McDonald’s fast food restaurant. The children’s father Ricky Dearman, whose three-year relationship with Draper ended acrimoniously in 2006, was falsely said to be the leader of the cult, and teachers, police and a priest to be among its more than 100 members. The judge said: ‘Many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers, home and email addresses have been published. ‘Several of those implicated have received malicious, intimidating phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world. For example – “We’re coming for you. You paedo scum”.’ The two children, who are now in care, were repeatedly named in the internet campaign and films of them uploaded to the internet ‘with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests’. Mrs Justice Pauffley was asked to investigate by social services bosses in care proceedings brought by Barnet council after the two children were said to be at the centre of the cult’s abuse. But the judge said they were in fact forced by Draper and Christie to ‘provide concocted accounts of horrific events’ in filmed mobile phone recordings and to lie to police when interviewed after the allegations were brought to the attention of officers in September last year. The children’s stories came about as the result of ‘relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse’. Internet campaign: More than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material . ‘Torture is a strong word but is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by Christie in collaboration with Draper,’ the judge said. ‘Both P and Q have suffered significantly. Their innocence was invaded. Their minds were scrambled. Their grip on reality was imperilled.’ Tests showed they had both also ingested cannabis in the three months before being taken into care. It was impossible for analysts to say if this was via passive smoking or oral ingestion, but both children had described in interview how hemp was made into soup at their home using the juicer, the judge said. Draper took no part in the court proceedings and has ‘not been seen by anyone in authority since February 12’. There are ‘rumours that she has fled abroad’ because she fears being arrested, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. The judge completely cleared Mr Dearman and all others named in the campaign of any abuse and called the material published on the internet ‘nothing more than utter nonsense’. ‘I am entirely certain that everything Ms Draper, her partner Abraham Christie and the children said about those matters was fabricated,’ she said. ‘The claims are baseless. Those who have sought to perpetrate them are evil and or foolish. ‘All the signs are that those responsible for posting material derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from attracting interest to their spiteful work from many thousands of people. ‘It’s akin to the sensation, I imagine, of a Facebook user receiving an indication that some posting or other has been liked.’","Mother forced children to lie about sexual abuse and torture, judge rules .

"Plummeting: Sterling rose above 1.40 euros yesterday to a level not seen since December 2007 – giving British families more ‘bang for their buck’ on the Continent . British holidaymakers look set for cheaper European holidays after the pound hit its highest level against the euro for more than seven years. Sterling rose above 1.40 euros yesterday to a level not seen since December 2007 – giving British families more ‘bang for their buck’ on the Continent. The latest surge was seen as a vote of confidence in the British economy at a time when the euro is tumbling on global currency markets. The deepening crisis in Greece and the prospect of hundreds of billions of euros being created through a massive money-printing programme have sent the single currency crashing. A British family now changing £500 would get 70 euros more than they would have done just six months ago and more than 120 euros more than two years ago. Simon Philips, head of retail at travel money specialist No 1 Currency, said: ‘A tumbling euro means power to your pound. 'British holidaymakers heading to the eurozone this Easter will enjoy rates not seen since pre-credit crunch.’ Figures from Travelex show £500 would now buy 680 euros compared with 610 euros six months ago, 589 euros a year ago and 559 euros two years ago. The rise in the value of the pound against the euro has made everything from hotel rooms and car hire to food and drinks on the Continent cheaper for British families. Some experts believe sterling could rise to 1.55 euros in the coming months as the British economy leaves the struggling eurozone in its wake. David Swann, head of pricing at currency exchange experts Travelex, said: ‘The pound is clearly on a winning streak at the moment, having struck another fresh high against the euro. With the pound up 16 per cent against the euro compared to last year, it’s going to make a big difference to the Brits who are now booking their Easter and summer holidays.’ The euro has been in decline for months but the sell-off accelerated this week after the European Central Bank started printing money through quantitative easing in a bid to kick-start growth across the region. The deepening crisis in Greece and the prospect of hundreds of billions of euros being created through a massive money-printing programme have sent the single currency crashing . The situation in Greece – where the new Left-wing government is struggling to win support from its European paymasters over fresh emergency funding – has also driven the euro lower. Although a strong pound is a boon for British holidaymakers, it can hinder UK exporters by making the goods they sell overseas more expensive for foreign buyers. Harry Adams, managing director of currency specialist Argentex, said the pound could hit 1.55 euros before the end of the year – a level not seen since mid-2002. ‘The euro bashing continues and I would be wary to predict when this will end,’ he said. ‘Investors are very wary of holding euros with the recent implementation of quantitative easing and the uncertainty over Greece. There are far safer currencies to hold such as the dollar and pound, forcing these rates higher and higher.’ The pound’s rally was not mirrored on the stock market in London where shares suffered their biggest one-day fall since October last year. The FTSE 100 index closed down 173.63 points at 6702.84 – wiping £44billion off the value of Britain’s leading companies. Analysts blamed worries about Greece and the wider global economy including a slowdown in China. Speculation that the Federal Reserve, America’s powerful central bank, could raise interest rates in the world’s biggest economy this summer also hit sentiment. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City of London trading firm IG, said ‘a heady cocktail of worries has sent investors scurrying’.","The pound has risen to highest level against the Euro since December 2007 .

"Barack Obama did not call Kanye West at home - despite the rapper's claims to the contrary- but a presidential staffer did ring to set up a future chat, sources have claimed. The back-and-forth began a couple of weeks ago, when Kanye boasted about his close relationship with the most powerful man in the world during a speech at Oxford University.

When asked about Kanye's claims about their friendship, he replied: 'I met Kanye twice. 'The first time was when I was a senator and he was with his mom and he had just gotten big… And then about six months ago he came to an event. I love his music.' President Barack Obama had dismissed the claims he called rapper West at home during at appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live (pictured) 'I don't think I've got his home number.' But Kanye refused to back down, and made the bizarre assertion again when questioned by a TMZ reporter at LAX Airport. After the Kimmel interview was aired, Kanye told reporters at LAX Airport 'I love Obama, he called our house before' Despite Mr Obama's flat-out denial, the outspoken rapper still insisted that he would contact him at home.

"A Texas man has been charged with animal cruelty after he shot dead a bull terrier at a Houston-area dog park because he thought the animal was acting in a threatening manner. The Harris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that 26-year-old Joseph Potts is facing a count of felony animal cruelty with a deadly weapon in connection to the January 25 shooting at Bay Area Dog Park in Houston. If convicted, Potts could face 2-10 years in prison. Following his arrest Monday, the 26-year-old suspect was released after posting $5,000 bond. Scroll down for video . Justice for Diesel: Joseph Potts is facing a count of felony animal cruelty with a deadly weapon for shooting dead Randall Livingston's 2-year-old dog, Diesel (pictured) Tragic: Sheriff's deputies say Potts, 26, was at Bay Area Dog Park in Houston in January when one of his dogs had an interaction with Diesel, which ended with the 26-year-old man shooting the animal three times . Authorities said Potts, himself a dog owner, gunned down a 2-year-old black-and-white Staffordshire bull terrier named Diesel in front of his owner’s horrified mother. Potts, who is a concealed handgun license holder, told deputies the dog was aggressive toward him, his wife and their two pets. But witnesses told police that Diesel was playing with other dogs in the park when Potts came up to the bull terrier, kicked him and then shot him three times - once in his leg and twice in his back. Randall Livingston, Diesel’s owner, told Click2Houston he was excited when the sheriff's department reached a decision this week to charge Potts with a crime in connection to his pet's killing. 'That was obviously the outcome we were looking for,' he said, adding that he hopes Potts learns to 'stay the hell out of the dog park.' Livingston previously said that on January 25, his mother took his beloved pet to the Bay Area Dog Park to play with other animals. Four-legged 'threat': Potts, who is a concealed handgun license holder, told deputies Diesel (pictured) was aggressive toward him, his wife and their two pets . Cruel: Witnesses said Potts kicked Diesel to get him away from his own dog, and then pulled a Glock and fired on the pooch, striking him in the leg and back . But what started out as a fun Sunday morning outdoors ended in a tragedy when Diesel had an 'interaction' with one of the other pups running around the park. According to witnesses, the other dog's owner, Joseph Potts, gave Diesel a kick, pulled out his Glock 9-mm and shot the 2-year-old animal three times. Diesel was rushed to VCA Animals Hospital, where he later died from his injuries. According to a sheriff’s report cited by Houston Press, Potts told a deputy that he shot Diesel because he approached one of his dogs 'and began to get aggressive.' After failing to kick Diesel away from his pet, Potts stated that he 'began to fear for the safety of his dogs, his wife and himself.' The 26-year-old pet owner was quoted as saying that he was sorry for what happened, and that ‘he did not want to harm the dog but felt like he had no choice.’ 'Innocent': Randall Livingston insisted that from the time he adopted Diesel when he was just six weeks old, the pup had never exhibited any signs of aggression . But according to an eyewitness, it appeared that Potts was taking his time and carefully aiming the gun at Diesel. Randall Livingston insisted that from the time he adopted Diesel when he was just six weeks old, the pup had never exhibited any signs of aggression. Following Diesel's killing, supporters of Randall Livingston launched a Facebook page, which has drawn nearly 9,340 'likes' so far. A month after Diesel's death, members of the 'Support for Diesel' community came together at Bay Area Dog Park for a ‘Peaceful Walk’ honoring the 2-year-old pooch.","Joseph Potts, 26, charged with felony animal cruelty with deadly weapon for shooting dead Randall Livingston's 2-year-old dog, Diesel .

USA breaks the news of the royal birth with claims of a 'dramatic delivery' Panic: Life & Style says the Duchess has had a girl and included lots of dramatic photos taken in 2013 . Target: The Duchess of Cornwall is regularly a target for bizarre claims in US tabloids . Allegations: One paper ran a story that claimed Charles is a cross-dresser jealous of his mother's clothes . Still alive: The Queen, pictured at an investiture ceremony yesterday, was said to be dying in 2012 . It has also run specious stories about Prince Charles' alleged penchant for cross-dressing and included claims attributed to 'sources' that the Prince of Wales is jealous of his mother's wardrobe. As a result, the tabloid alleged, the Duchess of Cambridge had been 'picked to be the next Queen' in place of Camilla. Most of the paper's more ridiculous claims remain unpublished in the UK, with the Globe among the US tabloids to make their website inaccessible in Britain - a move designed to spare them the UK's stricter libel laws, requirement for accuracy and from the ire of regulating bodies such as IPSO. The latest round of bizarre stories, which also include allegations that the royal family was kept out of the delivery room, are unlikely to trouble the Duchess herself, who revealed that her due date is in 'mid to late April' during an engagement on Wednesday. She is also expected to join Prince William next week for a round of engagements in south London, among them a visit to the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford. The Centre, which was designed by architect David Adjaye OBE, is home to the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust and was set up in memory of Stephen, who was murdered by racist thugs in 1993.","US magazines OK!

"Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, the enlisted U.S. soldier who left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was later ransomed from an Islamist extremist network by the Obama administration for five Taliban leaders, was charged with desertion and 'misbehavior before the enemy' buy the U.S. Army on Wednesday. But he won't face the death penalty if a military court martial finds him guilty of 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty.' The level of that charge the Pentagon levied on him carries a maximum of just a 5 year prison term. The other charge, however, 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place,' could send him to a military prison for life. The Uniform Code of Military Justice describes examples of that crime as running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . CHARGED: An Army officer announced the formal criminal complaint against Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl at Fort Bragg, N.C., on Wednesday . Bergdahl, a US Army sergeant who was swapped in 2014 for five high-value Taliban leaders, has been charged with desertion and will face a military court martial, according to reports on Wednesday . President Barack Obama announced the return of Bergdahl on May 31, 2014 in a White House Rose Garden press event as the soldier's parents Jani (left) and Bob (right) looked on . SOLDIER: Bergdahl was an Army private when he was captured, but the Pentagon restored his rank upon his release to what it would have been – sergeant – if he had remained on active duty, and paid him more than $200,000 in back wages . In addition to a potential life sentence, punishments for the crimes Bergdahl was charged with include a dishonorable discharge from the Army, a reduction in rank all the way down to 'E-1' – the lowest level of enlisted personnel – and forfeiture of all of his military pay. An Army spokesman said in a hastily scheduled press conference at Fort Bragg in North Carolina that the next step in the procedure would be an 'article 32' hearing at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. That's where Bergdahl remains on active duty, and will remain unless he's convicted. An article 32 hearing is analogous to a grand jury in the civilian court system. Its purpose is determine if there is enough evidence for a formal court martial. Bergdahl, 28, disappeared from his post in Paktika province, Afghanistan on June 30, 2009 after tellign comrades that he had grown cynical about America's mission there. The Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based network of Islamists aligned with the Taliban regime, took him prisoner and held him for nearly five years. A deal brokered by the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar brought him home, but at the cost of releasing the Taliban insurgents from the military prison complex at Guantanamo, Cuba. Two of them have recently said they are eager to rejoin the fight against the West when their Qatar-imposed year of restrictions and monitoring is over. A government official meanwhile told Fox News that three of the men have already tried to 're-engage' with their old networks, and one was 'trying to provide advice, council or inspiration' to his former terror network. Bowe Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': . Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': . Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . The Pentagon was set to announce a decision in the case Wednesday afternoon at Fort Bragg, N.C., but the White House insisted it was in the dark. 'I'm not aware of any plans for them to do that,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily press briefing, after Daily Mail Online asked him for comment on the looming Pentagon press conference. 'But this is a process that's being run by the United States Army,' Earnest added. 'So I'd direct you to the Pentagon for an answer.' A Pentagon official confirmed the charges in advance of the announcement. House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement after the Army's announcement that 'every American is innocent until proven guilty, and we all wanted to bring Sgt. Bergdahl home.' 'But my chief concern remains President Obama’s decision to release five hardened terrorists, with no guarantees that they won’t return to the battlefield. I believe it made Americans less safe.' Bergdahl's case has seen a series of shifts in administration policy, but charging him with a potentially capital offense would represent a stunning 180-degree turn. Last year after Bergdahl came home, National Security Adviser Susan Rice claimed he had served his country 'with honor and distinction.' But in the days before his then-mysterious disappearance in 2009, he wrote an email to his parents spelling out his disillusioned thoughts. 'The future is too good to waste on lies. And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong,' he wrote, according to Rolling Stone magazine. 'I have seen their ideas and I am ashamed to even be American.' Bergdahl's father reportedly responded with an email whose subject line read: 'OBEY YOUR CONSCIENCE!' The Fox News Channel reported in 2014 that Bergdahl's platoonmates found a note in his tent telling them that he had left to start a new life – and that he intended to renounce his citizenship. 'TALIBAN FIVE': The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . PROOF OF LIFE: Bergdahl's captors released a video on July 19, 2009 showing him with his head shaven, and showing his military 'dog tag' ID to the camera . Gen. Mark Milley, the commanding officer at Fort Bragg, has been leading the inquest into the Bergdahl case. The U.S. Army's decision to send the desertion case to a court martial signals that military prosecutors believe they can prove Bergdahl never intended to return to his combat unit. Desertion itself can carry a death sentence, but only in the most serious of cases. That penalty hasn't been levied on a U.S. servicemember since 1944. The Pentagon has broad discretion and can charge soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen with desertion on a variety of different levels. Bergdahl's attorney spoke to reporters in advance of the Pentagon's announcement. The Washington Post reported that Eugene Fidell, Bergdahl's attorney, said his client was handed his 'charge sheet' Wednesday at Fort Bragg. President Barack Obama attracted scorn when the prisoner swap was announced, especially from Bergdahl's former platoonmates – who insisted he deserted them and their mission. One of them, Cody Full, told a congressional committee in June 2014 that Bergdahl could – and should – be court martialed on eight separate charges, including disobeying orders and 'misconduct' as a prisoner. BALLET BOWE: Bergdahl was a classical dancer from the age of 16 or 17, studying at the Sun Valley Ballet School before he enlisted in the Army . SWAP: The Army opened an investigation into Bergdahl's 'capture' almost immediately after his release, shown here in a still frame from a video of the prisoner exchange (Bergdahl is 3rd right, back to the camera) TEMPORARY: Jubilant signs and American flags went up overnight in the Bergdahls' hometown of Hailey, Idaho – but were largely taken down as the circumstances of Bowe's capture made the news. Most of the backlash against the president, however, came from Congress – which wasn't given 30 days' notice about the 'Taliban 5' being transferred out of Guantamo Bay. A federal law requires such notice. The House of Representatives later approved a resolution condemning Obama for breaking the law, with 22 Democrats breaking ranks to agree. 'By setting free five top Taliban commanders from U.S. custody, the Obama administration made Americans less safe,' Speaker John Boehner said then. Obama defended his actions in a June 2014 joint press conference in Brussels, Belgium with British Prime Minister David Cameron, just a few days after Bergdahl was released into U.S. custody. 'I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents,' the president said then, 'and that the American people understand that this is somebody's child and that we don't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back.' 'We had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated, and we were deeply concerned about [him],' Obama told reporters about Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 'And we saw an opportunity and we seized it. And I make no apologies for that.' Administration officials told senators that they were kept out of the loop on the hostage swap because the Taliban threatened to kill Bergdahl if information about the negotiations was leaked. Separately, the parents of an Army lietenant who died while searching for Bergdahl months after he walked away from his platoon told Daily Mail Online that the Pentagon 'lied' to them about the circumstances of their son's death. Second Lieutenant Darryn Andrews perished in September 2009, and his commanders first said he was blown up while hunting a Taliban commander. Once Bergdahl was released, they were told the truth. 'It's a big cover-up like Benghazi,' Andrews' father said three days after Bergdahl's release, 'just like everything Obama has done.'","'Misbehavior before the enemy' charge could result in life in prison but Pentagon chose a lower level of desertion that carries just 5 years .

"Companies run by women performed almost three times as well than those run by men, according to a new study. Cash invested only in Fortune 1000 stocks from companies with female CEOs had a return of 348 per cent over the past 12 years, researchers found. In the same period of time, a portfolio made up of stocks from the S&P500 index would have returned just 122 per cent. The discovery was made by finance technology company Quantopian, which ran two imaginary $100,000 investment funds using stock data from 2002-2014. Bringing home the bacon: A study found that Fortune 1000 companies with female CEOs produced returns of 348 per cent from 2002 to 2014, as shown in green on the graph above. For comparison, the S&P500 index, in blue, had a return of 122 per cent in the same period . Top of the pile: Mindy Grossman, CEO of HSNi (left), Debra Cafaro of Ventas (center) and Marissa Meyer of Yahoo! (right) all brought in substantial returns for shareholders during their tenures . At the end of the experiment, the women's fund was calculated to be worth $440,158, while the S&P fund was at $222,306. The women's fund would hold stocks by all Fortune 1000 companies with female CEOs for as long as the woman was at the head of the company. It would sell the stock whenever a woman left the top spot, and buy in to new companies which appointed women. Fewer than one in 20 major companies currently has a female CEO. According to a report by Fortune magazine, the best performers were HSNi, which runs the home shopping network, and Ventas, a healthcare company which runs housing estates for the elderly. HSNi has been run by Mindy Grossman since 2006, and Ventas by Debra Cafaro for the whole 12-year period - both women returned more than 500 per cent on initial investments. Other high-performing female CEOs were Marissa Meyer at Yahoo!, Linda Lang at Jack in the Box and Carol Meyrowitz at TJX, a homeware and clothing retailer. Some women dragged the pack down, however, including New York Times CEO Janet Robinson, whose eight-year tenure saw the company shed 80 per cent of its worth. There is no definitive explanation for why female CEOs apparently bring in so much more cash for investors. It has been suggested that typically female personality traits make for better corporate leaders. Kip Tindell, CEO of The Container Store, has made 70 per cent of his executives female. He told Business Insider: 'Emotional intelligence is the key to being really successful. People who have it keep their egos in check; they're comfortable with surrounding themselves with people better than them...' However, it has also been suggested that female leaders can feel pressure more than male counterparts. Mindy Grossman, one of the best-performing female CEOs of recent times, told Forbes that high-powered women are more at risk of burning out, too. She said: 'Being female, I’d say we have tendencies to want to be perfect at everything in every moment of everyday. The challenge is understanding how to allocate your time personally and professionally, and remembering you have to be a person too.' Keeping on: Carol Meyrowitz, head of homeware and clothing retailer TJX, brought good returns for shareholders too. An exception to the rule was New York Times Company CEO Janet Robinson, who lost investors some 80 per cent of their cash . Kerrii Anderson, CEO at Wendy’s International also lost investors' money in her tenure from 2006-08. Karen Rubin, who helped build the simulation, said she believes the results are because of the so-called 'glass ceiling' holding women back from big jobs. The result, she said, is that any women who wants to lead a huge company must be extremely competent - and so good financial performance follows. She told Fortune: 'There’s a lot of the theorizing around why the results are dramatically higher for the women, but most think it has to do with how hard women have to work to become CEO at such big companies in the first place'. However, it has also been theorized that the results are also affected by the types of companies women have typically led - media, retail and consumer organizations - which benefited greatly in the recent economic upturn. The female-only index also crashed more steeply than the S&P500 during the 2008-09 recession, but remained worth more overall throughout - and rallied more strongly afterward.","Finance technology company plotted how companies with female CEOs performed from 2002 to 2014 .

"A DIFFERENT KIND OF WEATHER . by William Waldegrave . (Constable £20) At the start of the Falklands War in 1982, William Waldegrave, then a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher’s government, was standing in the division lobby of the House of Commons when he saw Thatcher and her entourage of ‘toadies’ marching towards him. He felt compelled to say something, so, with the U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig at the time trying to broker a British ‘sell-out’ to the Argentinians, he asked: ‘Where do the Americans stand, Prime Minister?’ ‘I don’t know, William,’ came the immediate reply. ‘But I know where they are going to stand.’ Would that David Cameron could deal so unequivocally with the White House, but then none of Thatcher’s successors have, least of all the pusillanimous Tony Blair, whom Waldegrave compares with Ted Heath. Margaret Thatcher (right) is once said to have fought off Norman Tebbit (left) with a snarling remark in Waldegrave's defence . This is surprising, for Waldegrave was a passionate Heath loyalist before transferring his allegiance to Thatcher. But he is surely right when he asserts that Heath’s great disappointment in life was that the patriotic, liberal Conservative Party in which he believed so fervently — ‘he and it were family’ — did not return his devotion. And in that respect Waldegrave is reminded of Blair, who ‘genuinely thought — and thinks — that he created a family called New Labour which loved him’. In fact it was success that New Labour loved, not Blair. This absorbing memoir contains some choice gossip as a counter-balance to Waldegrave’s insightful political analysis. Getting back to Heath, he recalls one of the old curmudgeon’s dinner parties — ‘not occasions of much merriment’ — at which Emma Soames gamely tried to enliven proceedings with an anecdote about her brother Nicholas, who had just been selected to contest a tough seat in Glasgow. At a raucous selection meeting, very unlike anything in the Home Counties, the prospective MP had been grasped by the lapels and asked, ‘Are ye married?’ Around Heath’s table, the diners waited expectantly for the end of an amusing story, but Soames suddenly and mystifyingly stopped speaking. Driving her home later, Waldegrave asked if she’d forgotten the punchline? ‘No,’ she said. ‘I was on autopilot and got that far without remembering that after Nicholas admitted to being unmarried, the response was: “Och, not another Tory poofter!” ’ She hadn’t wanted to offend her illustrious host, whose sexuality was always the subject of speculation — though Waldegrave adds that in relation to the Scotsman’s allegation, it was not ‘as far as anyone I ever knew could discover, true’. Waldegrave’s own background differs markedly from those of two of his Tory heroes, Heath and Thatcher, if rather less from that of another, the grouse-shooting enthusiast Harold Macmillan, whom he recalls silencing another dinner party, this time at Waldegrave’s own house, by turning to his neighbour and declaring: ‘Such a pity they abolished the gold sovereign, you know. What does one tip one’s loader?’ Waldegrave's privileged background was very different to that of his Tory hero, Margaret Thatcher (pictured) The seventh and youngest child of an earl, directly descended from King James II, Waldegrave is himself the very definition of a toff. And he grew up privileged not just socially and materially but also intellectually. His parents’ friends included the philosopher Isaiah Berlin. He was educated at Eton, Oxford and Harvard. His accent alone opened doors, as he made his way in the world in the Sixties. As a scruffy, long-haired student, he once tried to check in for the night at the Great Western Hotel at Paddington, admitting that he had no money on him but would pay once they sent him the bill. The cut-glass vowels, and his explanation that there had once been a locomotive on the Great Western line named after his family — The Earl Waldegrave — secured him the room. For those of us who do not come from such lofty beginnings, there is something beguiling yet also appalling about the upper-class milieu Waldegrave describes so well. After his engagement to Victoria Rothschild ended — her father, the political power-broker Victor Rothschild, had made a protégé of him — he found a letter to his own father from a fellow Wykehamist, stating: ‘You must be pleased to see the back of the Jewess.’ From an early age, Waldegrave’s ambition was to rise to high political office. The path ahead looked gilded when he became MP for Bristol West in 1979, and Thatcher did eventually make him Health Secretary. She liked and rated him, and once fought off a snarling Norman Tebbit on his behalf. From an early age, Waldegrave's ambition was to rise to high political office, Thatcher (pictured) liked him and eventually made him Health Secretary . As Britain’s representative on the European Environment Council in 1984, Waldegrave had tried to force British Leyland into taking the dangers of pollution more seriously. This enraged Tebbit, who savaged him during a meeting at No 10 for being a toff, and knowing nothing of the concerns of working folk at British Leyland. Thatcher listened, and then ‘began to purr dangerously’. With magnificent condescension, she explained to Tebbit that she was a chemist, and that it was he, not Waldegrave, who did not understand these matters. Bit by bit, she dismantled Tebbit’s case until he had no argument left. ‘I said absolutely nothing,’ Waldegrave writes. ‘I just sat there, terrified, while these great animals fought over me. ‘As we all filed out, she grasped my elbow, quite hard, and said: “I always look after my young people, William.” ’ But Thatcher’s patronage wasn’t enough. Gradually it occurred, if at first only to him, that he would never reach the top of the greasy pole. He was instinctively a loyalist, and didn’t always back the right horse. Yet this elegantly-written volume is not really an exercise in score-settling, as so many political memoirs are. It is more a reflection on a fascinating life than an account of it, and Waldegrave is an astute observer of the political animal, noting that the current Mayor of London has more than a little in common with the late Willie Whitelaw. ‘A subtle and intelligent man, he knew that the British do not like their politicians to appear too clever,’ he writes of Whitelaw. ‘His deliberate comical obfuscations predated Boris Johnson’s by 30 years, and were a delight.’ On the whole, Waldegrave wears his social pedigree about as lightly as he can, while exploiting it to shed light, sometimes alarmingly, but also hilariously, on upper-crust ways. While holidaying with the Rothschilds in Barbados, he visited rich socialites Ronnie and Marietta Tree, who ‘along with their supermodel daughter Penelope (who could water-ski on bare feet) occupied the classical house at Heron’s Bay. ‘There Tull the butler was alleged once to have silenced a boring guest at Rothschild’s request by means of powdered Nembutal in his bullshot’. Many people emerge heroically from Waldegrave’s engrossing reminiscences — not least the great love of his life, his cookery teacher wife Caroline — but possibly none more so than Tull the butler.","Waldegrave grew up privileged not just socially but intellectually .

"Kellermeister owner Mark Pearce said he made the 'unfortunate' discovery that 25,000 litre of his wine had been drained on Sunday morning . A prominent winemaker is accused of destroying more than $300,000 worth of alcohol at the winery he was previously employed at. Trevor David Jones, 57, of Lyndoch in South Australia's Barossa Valley, allegedly snuck into the Kellermeister winery in the early hours of February 22 and opened the taps on four tanks to release 25,000 litres of wine. Jones faced the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Tuesday after being arrested last month, charged with serious criminal trespass and property damage. Kellermeister owner Mark Pearce said he made the 'unfortunate' discovery on the morning of the incident. 'We're pretty lucky that the wine that was affected was some of our chardonnay and back vintage wines so all of our higher value wines were unaffected and, you know, are safe and sound,' Mr Pearce told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is what it is. We can't do much about it, it's in the hands of the police now.' Mr Pearce said his winery predominantly produced high-value shiraz-based wines. A spokeswoman for the Barossa Grape and Wine Association said 'it's disappointing that it's happened' but declined to comment further as it is a legal matter.

Cinetta Jackson, 50, of Memphis, Tennessee, reportedly slept with the boy who is just 14-years-old while she was living at his family's home. She was arrested on Wednesday and has been charged with statutory rape by an authority figure. According to Fox 13, Jackson is being held on $50,000 bond and has declined to comment. She is expected to appear in court on Thursday morning.

"A baby clothing company is being accused of fat-shaming babies after it came out with a onesie with the saying, 'I Hate My Thighs' on the front. The kitschy company Wry Baby was brought into the spotlight after Ms. Magazine editor Michele Kort published a blog on March 10 saying the supposedly humorous onesie was actually detrimental to babies' body image. 'Yes, we know—it's meant to be funny. After all, the company that sells this onesie with the saying ""I Hate My Thighs"" is named Wry Baby. And we feminists do have a sense of humor. But really, there's something icky about projecting fat awareness on babies,' Kort posted on the magazine's blog. Scroll down for video . Love it or hate it? This onesie reading, 'I Hate My Thighs' was taken off of Wry Baby's website after a writer accused the company of fat shaming babies . The negative opinion was enough for the company to pull the onesie from their site for a time out. The company then offered with with an alternative saying, 'Love Me For My Leg Rolls.' Wry Baby posted a pretend poll in the comments section of Kort's post sarcastically asking consumers which onesie they preferred to see, one that favored cynicism (I Hate My Thighs)  or the other one which favored sweetness (Love Me For My Leg Rolls), reports E Online. Wry Baby's true to form snarky response joked that the style that gets the most buyers will be the one they keep and that the proceeds from selling both will go to the MS. Foundation for Women. Kort didn't find Wry Baby's response especially funny. 'Please make the donation to Ms. Magazine, Wry Baby. The Ms. Foundation for Women is an entirely separate organization,' she wrote. 'And sorry that we don't see much difference between I Hate My Thighs and Love Me For My Leg Rolls; the subtext of the latter is that someone would NOT be loved for her leg rolls. But of course we're making too much of this, right?' Today reports that Wry Baby posted on their Facebook Page that they are merely trying to make parenting fun. New alternative: After the 'I Hate My Thighs' jumper caused fury among some women, the company Wry Baby offered another alternative that said 'Love Me For My Leg Rolls' Other funsies: These fun baby onesies are among Wry Baby's kitsch collection of baby gear . 'What we’re trying to do is make the entire parenting experience as fun as humanly possible,' writes Wry Baby co-owner Kelly Sopp. 'We equate having kids with having a good time. Why shouldn’t it be?' Wry Baby continued to fight back against Kort's criticism of them and wrote on March 12, 'We couldn’t agree more about body image. ‘That’s why we made an ironic joke about it. Obviously no baby would or should hate their thighs! ... But we’re glad you’re able to froth up your readers this week and shine a light on what is apparently a vital mission of MS. Magazine – reviewing baby clothes.' Kort spoke with Today.com and said she hoped that Wry Baby would stop basking in the spotlight and focus on the health of babies' body image. 'Think about your daughters,' Kort added, 'and what message that you want to convey to them.' Some other messages from Wry Baby are sporty onesies with the sayings, 'Silently Judging you, ' 'Bringing Booty Back,' and 'Turnt Up.' It's likely that the babies sporting the onesies will need some help from mom and dad reading what they say and understanding what they mean.

"Lord Warner, pictured, has accused the Labour party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care . ED Miliband’s pledge to rein in NHS ‘privatisation’ by capping profits of firms providing care has come under fierce attack from a former Labour health minister. As Labour made the NHS the central issue of its election campaign launch, Lord Warner accused his party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care. He said competition between different providers was vital to ensure the NHS can cope with spikes in demand, which occur most winters. ‘It is very difficult for the NHS to cope with the peaks and troughs of demand without the involvement of the private sector,’ he said. Kicking off his campaign at the site of the 2012 London Olympics in east London, Mr Miliband said the election ‘may come down to the wire’, though his deputy Harriet Harman insisted Labour was already ‘within touching distance of victory’. His main policy announcement was that Labour would halt what he called a ‘tide of privatisation’ in the NHS. Firms brought in to provide free treatment to patients would be hit with a five per cent profit cap, he said. Labour said the cap would apply to all NHS contracts worth £500,000 or more. Any company that made more than five per cent from the contract would be forced to reimburse the NHS for any returns above the level of the cap. Local NHS commissioners would have the power to allow higher profits in exceptional circumstances, if approved by NHS England or the Health Secretary. The cap would not apply to GPs, pharmacies or dentists. Mr Miliband repeated his pledge to introduce a ‘mansion tax’ on expensive homes, impose a levy on the tobacco companies and close tax loopholes exploited by hedge funds. The £2.5 billion raised would pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more doctors, 5,000 new care workers, and 3,000 more midwives, he said. Claiming another five years of Conservative government would mean ‘the disintegration of our public services’, Mr Miliband added: ‘We’ll scrap David Cameron’s market framework for the NHS and stop the tide of privatisation. ‘The NHS will be the preferred provider. No company working with the NHS will be able to profit by cherry picking: rejecting patients with the more complex and expensive needs for their own advantage.‘And, for the first time, we will cap the profits that private health companies can make from our National Health Service. ‘The standard rule will be a five per cent cap. Because the money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care, not for excess profits for private firms.’ Miliband kicked off his campaign at the site of the 2012 London Olympics in east London . Critics accuse party of hypocrisy, since expenditure on NHS services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before, when Labour was in power. Overall, around just six pence in every pound is spent in the NHS with the private sector, compared to just under five pence under Labour. Labour insists that the Government’s NHS reforms have accelerated the number private firms winning NHS contracts, with around one in three now going outside the health service. Lord Warner, a health minister between 2003 and 2007, pointed out Labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the NHS – and insisted it could not now survive without them. Of Mr Miliband’s profit cap, he told the Daily Mail: ‘It runs the risk of being one of these pre-election promises which doesn’t stand up when confronted with the reality of government. ‘It’s far from clear how you would actually implement it. A lot of the private sector is currently providing services to the NHS at standards NHS tariffs. Is that a profit? Miliband's main policy announcement was that Labour would halt what he called a ‘tide of privatisation’ in the NHS (file picture) ‘If you want to scare people, you can scare people. But all the work that was done in the Blair government on choice and competition showed that people didn’t have concerns on whether work was done by the private or public sector. ‘What they were concerned with was whether they would have to pay and was their care safe.' The Labour peer said some senior people in his party appeared overly ‘preoccupied’ with the issue of private sector involvement in the NHS, insisting: ‘It rather misses the point. ‘The point is what’s the best quality of care we can provide for patients at a reasonable price.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘If you bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time – then you’ll put our NHS at risk. We can only have a strong NHS if we have a strong economy, but Ed Miliband doesn’t have an economic plan. ‘We all know Labour want to “weaponise” the NHS but this is another policy from Ed Miliband that looks ill-thought through. It risks higher infection rates, higher waiting times and chaos for our NHS. This incompetence is exactly why Ed Miliband is simply not up to the job. ‘Independent commentators confirm that use of the private sector has grown at half the rate under this government as it did under ,o this is no more than a gimmick to scare people about privatisation that isn’t happening. ‘The real issue for the future of the NHS is how to fund the growing needs of an ageing population, and by tearing up an economic plan that is working Labour would threaten the real increases in funding that Conservatives are promising. No one can deliver a strong NHS without a strong economy.’ Lord Warner, a health minister between 2003 and 2007, pointed out Labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the NHS – and insisted it could not now survive without them . Dr Leonard Shapiro, a consultant cardiologist at Papworth Hospital NHS Trust, said of the profit cap: ‘Practically implementing something like this is going to be virtually impossible.’ Most private sector bodies work both for the NHS and privately, and pooled costs, he said. ‘To try to figure out how much profit they make from the NHS is going to be nearly impossible. In fact, it may actually cost more money to go through the accounting papers than the amount it will save from making a cap.’ But Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association council, backed Labour.‘Proposals to remove the most damaging elements of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, to support more joined up care and to prevent the private sector from cherry picking the most profitable services are a step in the right direction,’ he said. ‘The BMA wants a publically provided and funded health service, and believes the NHS should always be the preferred provider.’ Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘Liberal Democrats in government put an end to Labour's sweetheart deals with the private sector, while the independent King's Fund has poured cold water on Labour's claims about privatisation. ‘Only the Liberal Democrats have a credible plan to invest the £8bn per year by 2020 that NHS bosses say is needed. ‘A private sector profit cap sounds appealing but the devil would be in the detail and a simplistic policy could cause chaos for local hospitals.’ Dr Louise Irvine, of the National Health Action Party, said Labour’s plan ‘doesn’t go far enough’ and an extra £2.5 billion ‘won't stop the NHS from teetering over the cliff-edge’. ‘The bottom line is that Labour's policies will leave the NHS under-resourced and open to continued privatisation, which will make it impossible to provide a comprehensive, high quality, efficient and safe health service,’ she added. ‘A cap on private profits is unworkable. It's easy for private companies to arrange their tax affairs so as to avoid registering profits. For example, Virgin do not currently record a profit in the UK on their NHS contracts.‘Labour's commitments on the NHS are lukewarm and tinkering around the edges.’","Miliband has been accused of scaremongering and risking patient care .

Ms Keighley said: 'I was speaking to my uncle and I asked him if he wouldn't mind if I set something up. 'He is still distraught and said yes without really thinking much about it. I didn't think it would go this big. 'With the kids being so young and will need to be looked after until they are 18 I thought it was important for them to have some support. 'Hopefully this will mean they can do some nice things that will take their minds off losing their mum. 'My uncle said to me that he was proud of me for doing this because it reminded him of Melissa as this would be something that she would of done.' She added: 'The family are so proud and they would like to thank everyone who has donated and will thank them properly at the right time. 'When something like this happens, you worry about funeral costs and buying things that the kids need. 'The donations have lifted a weight off the family's shoulders and it's one less thing for them to worry about. It's amazing how the community comes together at times like this. 'It isn't just the family who are devastated it is also other young mothers who knew her from the area. It has affected everyone. 'The family are still distraught. It's like it isn't real. They are taking each day as it comes.' The case was referred to Newcastle Crown Court and Ross was remanded in custody until the next hearing on March 19.

"Evidence: A terrorism expert said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's computer contained lectures by an American-born Muslim cleric suspected of being a terrorist and a writings from an al Qaida publication . A note written by Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as he hid inside a boat contained themes of global jihad similar to those found in extremist materials on his computer, a terrorism expert testified Monday at his federal death penalty trial. In the note, scrawled in pencil and carved in wood on the inside walls of the boat, Tsarnaev condemned U.S. actions in Muslim countries and asked Allah to make him a 'shaheed,' a martyr, said Matthew Levitt, a terrorism expert at The Washington Institute, a think tank that focuses on U.S. policy in the Middle East. Levitt said many of the ideas included in Tsarnaev's note are contained in lectures by Anwar al-Awlaki — an America-born Muslim cleric suspected of being a terrorist and killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011 — and writings in the al-Qaida publication Inspire magazine, both of which were found on Tsarnaev's computer. In one Inspire article shown to the jury, titled 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,' the instructions say a pressure cooker 'should be placed in crowded areas and left to blow up' and 'More than one of these could be planted to explode at the same time.' Two pressure-cooker bombs were planted by Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, near the finish line of the 2013 marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev made it clear in the note he wrote in the boat that the brothers saw the attack as retaliation for U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died three days after the bombings following a shootout with police and being run over by Dzhokhar during an escape. Dzhokhar was found more than 18 hours later hiding in a boat parked in a yard in Watertown. During opening statements, Tsarnaev's lawyer acknowledged that he participated in the bombings but portrayed Tamerlan, 26, as the mastermind who recruited his younger brother, then 19, to help him. Tsarnaev's lawyers have made it clear they are using both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial to try to save him from the death penalty. Prosecutors are expected to rest their case in the guilt phase this week. The same jury will then decide whether he spends the rest of his life in prison or receives the death penalty. Materials: One Inspire article shown to the jury was titled 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom' Writings in the al-Qaida publication Inspire magazine (pictured) were found on Tsarnaev's computer . Levitt, testifying for prosecutors, said the themes in Tsarnaev's note are common in the global jihadi movement. In one part of the note, Tsarnaev wrote, 'We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.' 'It's the idea that if you hurt one Muslim in any part of the world, it's incumbent upon a Muslim ... to do something about it,' Levitt said. Levitt was expected to be cross-examined Tuesday by Tsarnaev's lawyers. Earlier Monday, one of Tsarnaev's lawyers aggressively questioned an FBI agent about extremist materials found on Tsarnaev's computer as the defense attempted to portray Tamerlan as more radicalized and primarily responsible for the 2013 attack.

During opening statements, Tsarnaev's lawyer acknowledged that he participated in the 2013 bombings but portrayed Tamerlan, 26, as the mastermind who recruited his younger brother, then 19, to help him. Kevin Swindon, a supervisory agent in charge of the Boston FBI's cybersquad, last week described a variety of extremist content found on Tsarnaev's computer. During cross-examination Monday by defense attorney William Fick, Swindon acknowledged that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's computer had encryption software on it, but Dzhokhar's computer did not, an apparent attempt by the defense to suggest that Tamerlan had something to hide. While questioning Swindon, Fick also suggested that much of the activity on Dzhokhar's computer centered on Facebook and other subjects of interest to teenage boys, including popular music and homework. As part of one of his questions, Fick said there was nothing about 'jihad' or 'Islam' among the top search terms on Dzhokhar's computer.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's note condemned U.S. actions in Muslim countries and asked Allah to make him a martyr, terrorism expert Matthew Levitt said .

"A stripper's father has been accused of extorting nearly $3million from a businessman who paid to have a threesome with his daughter and her cousin who he said was underage. Terry Tackett, 52, allegedly demanded money from retired software executive Paul Vagnozzi, 61, from Detroit, Michigan, after learning about the sexual encounters he had with Jessica Tackett, 25. According to federal prosecutors Jessica met Mr Vagnozzi at a strip club in 2008, where she was working as a topless dancer to help support her family. The pair then started a relationship where he would pay for sex, court documents have revealed. Scroll down for court documents . Affair: Jessica Tackett, 25, started working at a Detroit strip club to help support her family. She met businessman Paul Vagnozzi in the summer of 2008 and they started a sexual relationship . Threats: Terry Tackett, 52, demanded money from retired software executive Paul Vagnozzi, after he discovered he had a threesome with his daughter and her cousin. Tackett told Vagnozzi she was underage . That summer, according to court documents seen by The Detroit News, he paid to have a threesome with Jessica's cousin. Her father found out about the illicit encounter in October and threatened Mr  Vagnozzi - saying the girl was underage and that he would tell the police unless he was paid. Tackett also said he would get his 'mafia' friends at the Jokers Motorcycle Club to beat him up if the hush money stopped. The document filed in the United States District Court in Michigan stated he first handed Tackett $30,000. Two months later Mr Vagnozzi asked the family to confirm in writing they would not tell the police and asked them to stop demanding cash. Case: Tackett is free on $10,000 unsecured bond but faces up to five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice . They then sent him a letter demanding more installments of $30,000. According to the documents in one month, Mr Vagnozzi gave Terry Tackett $1.15 million in checks, . The flow of money, which stopped in 2012, funded Tackett's lavish lifestyle, including a home in Romulus, Michigan, six Harley-Davidson motorcycles, muscle cars, Jet Skis and expensive gifts for his stripper girlfriends. The indictment also mentions that Jessica  and her mother, Kimberly, 53, also filed a phony rape complaint against the businessman as part of the alleged extortion scheme. West Bloomfield Township police in Michigan told The Detroit News that the phony rape complaint was filed against Vagnozzi. Tackett is now facing 119 federal charges in relation to the scheme - conspiracy to obstruct justice, tax evasion, money laundering and banking crimes. If convicted, he could be jailed for up to 20 years. The indictment also mentions that Jessica Tackett and her mother, Kimberly (pictured), also filed a phony rape complaint against the businessman victimized in the alleged extortion scheme . Jessica Tackett is free on $10,000 unsecured bond, but she and her mother face up to five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice . Raymond Cassar, Mr Vagnozzi's lawyer, thanked the U.S. Attorney's Office  for bringing the 'group to justice.' In a statement to the Detroit News, he said: 'My client is a good man who was the victim of a lengthy extortion plot by a group of individuals that conspired to take as much money from him as they possibly could over a lengthy period of time.' Mr Vagnozzi is not on the indictment because he is considered a victim. He has not been charged in relation to having sex with the cousin who Tackett claims is underaged.

"A defiant father-of-ten who has had his Christmas lights up for almost five months  is refusing to take them down despite being branded a 'pikey'. Kevin Franklin got a friend to put up the huge festive display on his council house after he suffered a stroke in November. He stopped turning them on in January but said they helped calm his autistic son Bradley, 15, and plans to switch them back on for Autism Awareness Month in April. Despite the good cause he has received a poison pen-letter from someone on his street in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, calling his family 'pikeys' and the lights 'grotesque', 'tacky' and 'an eyesore'. The letter said: 'I know you live in a council house but there's no need to make it look like one'. Row: Defiant father-of-ten Kevin Franklin is refusing to take down the Christmas lights still hanging outside his council house . Backlash: A neighbour put this poison-pen letter through his door, calling the lights 'grotesque' and the family 'pikeys' Good cause: Mr Franklin says that the lights are good for his autistic son Bradley so he has kept them up since November . Mr Franklin now says he has even more lights in his garage, which he will add to the collection on his house. He suspects that the abuse has come from people on his street who have bought their house. Sad: Kevin, 53, who lives with wife Michele, 46, who cares for Bradley full-time, said the letter upset him . The poison pen writer sent an anonymous letter addressed to 'the pikeys that live at number 80'. It read: 'I am fed up of seeing your grotesque, tacky, council house Christmas lights. 'It is March for goodness sake. Your house leaves this lovely community looking a disgrace. It looks like a state. It sticks out like a sore thumb. 'I don't want to keep driving past this eyesore, every time I do my kids scream. 'I know you live in a council house but there's no need to make it look like one. 'Yours sincerely, A very disgruntled citizen.' Kevin, 53, who lives with wife Michele, 46, who cares for Bradley full-time, said the letter had upset him but said he planned to put up more lights, rather than take them down. He said: 'I was shocked and quite upset when I got the letter. But they're not coming down. They're not doing anybody any harm. 'I don't switch them on until it comes nearer Christmas. 'Apart from that they're going on in April which is autism awareness month, because I have a 15-year-old autistic son. 'I've had neighbours who have said they will join in and also donate to autism charities.' Response: Mr Franklin has refused to cave in to pressure and says he will put even more lights up . Festive cheer: The family believe it brightens up the area but a disgruntled neighbour told them:  'I know you live in a council house but there's no need to make it look like one' Fundraising: The Franklins hope that the display will raise cash for autism charities . He added: 'I think the person who sent the letter comes from the posh side of the street. 'Our side is all council houses while the other side is where the houses have been bought. 'They think they're better than us but the only difference between us and them is that they buy their pile of bricks and we rent ours. It's still my house and I'm proud of it. 'We keep our garden nice and tidy but we like the lights. The principle is nobody tells me what to do in my house. 'We're going to make sure the house is covered and really give them something to whine about.' One neighbour said a petition was started to try to get Kevin to remove the Christmas lights, although many residents in the street are divided over the ongoing display. Matthew Ludley said: 'I heard someone started a petition and a few people had complained, I don't know who would have sent the letter though. 'I'm not really bothered by the lights being up, it doesn't really affect me.' Another resident, John Rogers, 71, said: 'I'm with the old age pensioner lot. There is a big divide between the people who have purchased their houses and the council house lot. Conspiracy: Mr Franklin suspects the rude note came from people on his street (pictured) who may have bought their house . 'I'm not offended by the lights, I think if he has been ill then that's actually a good enough reason not to take them down. 'I think it's a bit petty to send a letter, you would think they would just talk to him.' Another resident, who asked not to be named, said the author of the letter was 'sad'. The word 'pikey' is believed to have been used as early as the 16th century. But it was not seen in print until 1837, when The Times used it to describe strangers who visited the Isle of Sheppey. The actual origins of the word are unclear. It could be connected to the word 'turnpike'. These were toll roads, which had rotating barriers made of sharp poles called pikes - and vagrants were known to gather in these areas in the 18th century. An alternative version of the word is 'piker', which is said to have come from the verb 'to pike' - which once meant to run away. In recent years gipsies have complained when the term is used against them and say it is insulting. It is also used in the modern day as a term to insult someone of supposedly low class. She said: 'Do people not have anything better to do than moan about Christmas lights still being up? They're not even on. It's a bit sad.' Residents also took to social media to express their opinion on the matter. Beckie Louise wrote on Facebook: 'Absolutely disgraceful !! Have people lost their minds? 'Is this really causing anyone physical harm? Emotional harm? Physiological harm maybe? The answer is NO. 'I can't believe money and resources are being spent on worrying about Christmas lights on someone's house. 'Don't we have more things to concentrate on. Like the youth of today and resourcing places for them to go... Thefts in and around the area. 'The bullying at schools, need I go on? Leave them alone.' Marc Curt Leopold, who said he lives next door to the family, wrote: 'We live next door and have offered to take them down, but in all honesty our kids love them and we have a good relationship with our neighbours so if they need them down then we will help.' Kevin, who used to run a pub but is now unemployed, responded to the outcry by saying he has a garage full of more lights which he is now planning to put up next week.","Kevin Franklin had lights put up in November after he had a stroke .

"A bus driver who claims to have eaten over 500 takeaways a year for 20 years has given up his habit to shed a whopping six stone. Mark Gadsby, from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, fed his addiction by tucking into Indian, Chinese and fish-and-chip takeaways at least once a day - and then binning the food packages to hide the evidence. But the 33-year-old ditched the convenience food and 20 years after being bullied as a teenager, he has shed six stone. Mark was eating takeaways everyday, left, before he joined slimming world and lost six stone, right . Mark, who works for a coach company, said: 'I'm utterly ashamed of what I was like. I would love to be able to ask myself what I was doing to myself before. 'I just see a massive fat person when I'm looking at old photos. I think, 'What an earth was I doing to myself? 'I was not eating all day when I was big - it was only at night. It was all about convenience food and the amount I ate was huge. 'I would always call at McDonald's after work, or a chippy or takeaway. 'I would always top that up with convenience food like hot pasties and sausage rolls from bakeries and fast-food places. 'From the age of 10 to 32 that pattern would continue and that's when I was really big. I was eating about 500 takeaways a year, which over that period of time is 10,000. Mark, pictured before the weight loss, would always stop in at McDonald's or a chippy after work . Mark suffered emotionally because of his weight and was a target of cruel bullies who made his life a misery . 'Having all of that food, often late at night, gave me terrible indigestion and made me feel ill. 'It was awful. It was constant Greggs and Subway and it would be every day.' Mark said he suffered emotionally because of his weight and was a target of cruel bullies who made his life a misery. He said: 'There was a group of girls who would refer to me as Man Boobs - it was very hurtful. The bullying really hurt and made me feel worse than I did before.' As Mark is a bus driver, he felt like he had to get his food quickly and on the go. He said: 'I would use a drive-through quite a bit because I could go straight through and I didn't need to get out. 'I would hide the food packaging because I didn't want people to know. I was like an alcoholic craving booze.' Mark moved in with his mother about two years ago and a combination of the Slimming World diet plan and his mum's cooking has meant the weight has dropped off. He said: 'She helps me a great deal and it's brilliant to be back. She keeps me on track and there's no sneaking food now. 'Everything is freshly prepared and there's nowhere near the same amount of takeaways as before.' Mark now hopes to be able to use his own experiences to help other people in their battle with weight as a Slimming World consultant. Mark, pictured above, has been put in Slimming World's Hall Of Fame as 'Slimmer Of The Month' Mark no longer sneaks food and says that all of his meals are freshly prepared thanks to his mum's cooking .","Mark Gadsby from Derbyshire ate 10,000 takeaways in his lifetime .

Police allege he went on a rampage of rape, assault and an attempted car-jacking in the hours after he is accused of killing the 17-year-old and before he handed himself into police.

Masa had more costumes and accessories than anyone. She used to take her mum shopping and she'd always buy another dress to take home and add to her collection. Masa also had an unrivalled love for fashion which she said she developed as a baby as a result of her mum changing her outfit three or four times a day to take baby photos. On a recent trip to Paris and Montenegro she managed to pack, among many other things, four heavy winter coats so she wouldn't be photographed in the same one. Her room is all pink with her collection of costumes, quirky posters and so on. She had skill to take selfies like no other and she was indeed the princess of selfies. She made many many friends in her short life. Masa loved her sister Nadja and brother Petar dearly. She shared a special bond with them both and that is a bond that only family who are close with siblings share. You'd hear Masa and Nadja talking together, performing various roles in front of the camera. Masa and her mother were very close. They laughed together and often debated together. Masa always seemed to win the debate. Masa wanted to become a lawyer and dreamed of enjoying drinking lattes in a range of different outfits. Masa was an inspiration to many. Her motivation and drive were exceptional and would have been an outstanding wife. She used to go on walks with her father which would usually end up in some make-up store. The family would like to express their gratitude for the love and support they received from their family and friends and community at large. A particular thank you to Victoria Police. Masa touched all our hearts. Even if you do not know her personally. We miss her beautiful smile, her funny little mannerisms and the sparkle in her eyes. Masa we love you, you will be in our hearts forever. Masa's school friends, many who wearing pink ribbons in their hair and arms, created a sea of pink flowers outside the chapel .
