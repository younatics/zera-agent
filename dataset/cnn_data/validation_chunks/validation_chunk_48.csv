"A transgender woman has been hounded by an abusive mob which likened her to Jimmy Savile and branded her a paedophile in a vicious hate campaign. Nell Stockton is now frightened to leave her house in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, after being targeted by the transphobic gang. On one occasion, the 55-year-old divorcée, who has been living as a woman for two years, was told by thugs they would 'break her legs' because she had once been a man.

Police have installed CCTV at the home after Miss Stockton's housemate, who is also transgender, was physically attacked. They believe the pair are being specifically targeted because of their gender but have yet to make any arrests. Among the abusive slurs hurled at Miss Stockton, who works for the council helping adults with learning difficulties, are comparisons to the paedophile Jimmy Savile. 'These people have been coming out with lots of vile things. They have been chanting ""paedo, paedo"", saying ""are you a she-male or tranny?""' she said. 'It is very frightening and makes me wonder if we dare leave the house in case we come back and it's ruined.' On one occasion thugs threatened to break Miss Stockton's legs because she was born a boy. She is currently awaiting gender reassignment surgery. 'This was in broad daylight after I finished work,' the human rights activist added.

Police installed temporary CCTV at her home but she fears the attacks will begin again once it is removed . Police have installed temporary CCTV at the property in the hope of catching the youngsters. But Miss Stockton fears they will return when it is removed. 'This is all good for a while as it acts as a deterrent but when they take it away, which they will, it will all start up again.' An online donations page has been set up by one of her friends to help raise money to pay for a permanent solution. 'It is difficult enough to get to this stage in life and going through the transition.... most people don't have to put up with this,' added Miss Stockton. 'I am a hard working person and trying to get on and live and do my job. It isn't much to ask, we aren't going around being offensive to anybody. 'There is nothing worse than feeling unsafe in your own home.' South Yorkshire Police said it was investigating several reports of criminal damage and public order offences but have yet to make any arrests. 'We take reports of suspected hate crime extremely seriously and incidents of this nature will not be tolerated,' a spokesman said.","Nell Stockton is frightened to leave her home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire .

"Robert Freeman is undeniably one of the greatest lost photographers of the modern age, most famous for shooting the first five album covers for the Beatles and the first Pirelli calendar. Now, aged 78 and in poor health, it is both himself and his legacy - a historic archive of iconic photographs spanning 60 years - that could be lost forever. In response to huge public demand, coupled with the love of his family, the serene 1965 photograph ‘John Lennon with Panda’ is today being re-released and available at www.freemanarchive.com as a limited edition A2 or A3 archival C-type metallic print. In response to huge public demand, coupled with the love of his family, the serene 1965 photograph 'John Lennon with Panda' is today being re-released to raise funds for its photographer Robert Freeman's care . The exclusive sale organised by his son Dean Freeman will end 15 May 2015, raising vital funds for Robert’s ongoing care as well as the preservation of a body of work that captured the likes of his personal friend, Andy Warhol, Muhammad Ali, Sophia Loren, Marianne Faithful and Jimmy Cliff. Due to the proud and eccentric nature of a great artist, Robert has refused all family help and this is Dean’s way of maintaining his father’s dignity and saving his priceless archive. Due to the proud and eccentric nature of Robert, whose work includes this picture of Andy Warhol called Rome from 1972, he has refused all family help . After graduating from Cambridge in 1959, Freeman became a professional photographer, with assignments for the Sunday Times  and went on to capture pictures like this montage of Jimmy Cliff in 1966 . As well as capturing five Beatles album covers and the first-ever Pirelli calendar, Robert's work also includes this grainy shot of Charlton Heston in 1962 . All previous reproductions of his work have sold for thousands of pounds so this auction is set to raise a huge sum. Robert became close to the Beatles at the height of their fame, and it is this mutual intimacy that gave him unprecedented access to capture their lives through a series of beautifully grainy black and white photographs. Speaking about Robert, Paul McCartney once said: 'Although other people were taking photos of us at the time, I think we all felt that his stuff somehow summed up our own feelings. His photos were among the best ever taken of the Beatles.' After graduating from Cambridge in 1959, Freeman became a professional photographer, with assignments for the Sunday Times and other magazines. As well as musicians, he worked with athletes, including Cassius Clay a.k.a Muhammad Ali, captured in 1964 . He also worked with The Beatles in their feature film debut, A Hard Day's Night . One of his assignments was photographing jazz musicians at a London jazz festival, helping him to develop a portfolio including portraits of John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Dizzy Gillespie, Elvin Jones, and Coleman Hawkins. These were the photos he sent to Beatles manager, Brian Epstein, in the summer of 1963. In addition to being the Beatles’ most favoured photographer, Robert directed television and film commercials and two feature films: The Touchables and Secret World. Dean Freeman, a successful director who has published more than 10 works on various stars and once worked as the Spice Girls' official photographer, said: 'My father is extremely frail, living alone in a small hostel and is in desperate need of care. 'He can no longer look after his valuable archive of work that is falling into disrepair. All proceeds of our exclusive sale will help him recuperate and preserve his wonderful images and stories. 'It would be heartbreaking to see this irreplaceable body of work lost to future generations.'

"A Milwaukee police officer fired last year after he killed a mentally ill black man during a scuffle won’t get his job back, a panel of police commissioners ruled on Monday. Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton 14 times last April during a confrontation that started with the officer supposedly making a welfare check on the homeless man. According to Manney, Hamilton, who had been sleeping in a downtown park, grabbed the officer's baton and attacked him with it. Dontre Hamilton's mom Maria, center, hugs a supporter after a panel of three Fire and Police Commission members upheld the firing of police officer Christopher Manney during a hearing  in Milwaukee on Monday . Christopher Manney, left, shot Dontre Hamilton, right, 14 times last April during a confrontation that started with the officer supposedly making a welfare check on the homeless man . The three-commissioner panel found that Manney violated department protocol when he tried to search the man moments before they began fighting. Hamilton’s family and friends cheered when the ruling on Manney's firing was announced. Prosecutors ruled the shooting was justified, but Chief Ed Flynn fired Manney, saying he improperly initiated a pat-down. Department investigators contend Manney couldn't explain why he felt the need to pat Hamilton down beyond a general belief that homeless and mentally ill people often carry knives. Hamilton had paranoid schizophrenia, but his family has said he wasn't dangerous. 'No one suspected him of committing a crime,' Mark Thomsen, an attorney representing the department, said in closing arguments on Monday. 'There wasn't a basis for (the pat-down).' Milwaukee Police Officer Fitchett testifies during the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission hearing for Christopher Manney who lost his job after firing 14 shots in the death of Hamilton in April 2014 . Thomsen had argued that officers can frisk someone only if they reasonably suspect the person is armed and poses a threat. He maintained that Manney never clearly explained how he felt threatened. Manney's attorney had argued that 'the good of the service' did not require that the officer be fired. 'I want to be a cop. It's who I am. I've helped people my whole life,' Manney told the panel. Prosecutors' decision in December not to charge Manney with a crime touched off days of peaceful rallies that saw protesters compare Hamilton's death to Michael Brown's fatal shooting at the hands of a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Dontre Hamilton's brother, Nate Hamilton, told reporters after the panel's first ruling on Monday that the family was happy with the decision. 'There's still more to come,' he added. 'I'm just not going to be satisfied until all officers respect us, respect people, respect our constitutional rights.' Christopher Manney, who was fired after the fatal on-duty shooting of Dontre Hamilton, - he has maintained that he had done nothing wrong . Maria Hamilton, right, mother of Dontre Hamilton, listens during Monday's disciplinary appeal. With her, are Dontre Hamilton's brothers Dameion Perkins, center, and Nate Hamilton . The U.S. Justice Department has said it will review the shooting to determine whether it should pursue a federal civil rights prosecution. Manney, who filed an application for disability retirement two days before he was fired, had testified on Sunday that he thought Hamilton might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol and he believed he might have a weapon. 'Lots of homeless have knives,' Manney's attorney Jonathan Cermele said. While Manney wasn't certain of what was in a bulge in Hamilton's clothing, Cermele said, 'he knew homeless people have a shard of glass, a knife, et cetera.' Flynn testified on Saturday that Manney's 'bad decision-making' created a chain of events that put him in a position where he had to use deadly force. A former Milwaukee detective said at the hearing on Monday that Manney did the right thing by trying to frisk Hamilton. Steven Spingola, who now works with TNT's 'Cold Justice' program, said Manney would have been reckless otherwise. Prosecutors' decision in December not to charge Manney with a crime touched off days of peaceful rallies that saw protesters compare Hamilton's death to Michael Brown's fatal shooting at the hands of a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri . Spingola acknowledged that Manney told investigators that the first time he felt fear was after Hamilton had lunged at him and punched him. Robert Willis, a master police tactics instructor, testified that he felt Manney's approach was valid because he legally stopped Hamilton and felt concerned for his safety. Willis said under cross-examination that Manney's legal team is paying him $175 an hour for his work in the case and he planned to bill them for 20 to 25 hours of work.","Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney was fired after he shot Dontre Hamilton 14 times during a scuffle last April .

"Detectives investigating the death of a Jerry Springer producer's disabled sister now believe that she never wanted to commit suicide and was in fact murdered by her bankrupt sister, according to a shocking new report. Jill Blackstone claims she was carrying out her sister Wendy's wishes for a suicide pact when Wendy, 49, suffocated to death March 14 in the garage of their Los Angeles home earlier this month. Jill told police she meant to die as well, but got cold feet and called a friend for help at the last second. Jill Blackstone (pictured left after her sister's death) says her disabled sister Wendy (right) died during a botched suicide pact in which both women intended to take their own lives . Now, detectives believe that Jill intended to murder her sister, who was deaf and partially blind, and that Wendy never agreed to a suicide pact, according to TMZ. The Daily Mail Online has previously reported that Jill Blackstone, a 52-year-old talk show producer who had worked on 'The Jerry Springer Show' and for Dr Drew, was drowning in $1.4million of debt and owed $122,000 to her sister Wendy. Police who responded to the scene arrested Jill Blackstone, 52, for murder, but later released her when the District Attorney ordered the case sent back to LAPD detectives for more investigation. Detectives determined early in the investigation that a suicide note that was supposedly written by Wendy had in fact been written by Jill, according to TMZ. According to court documents filed three years ago, Jill Blackstone owed her sister Wendy $122,000. Wendy died in the garage of their $950,000 home in Studio City in Los Angeles . According to court documents Jill filed when she declared bankruptcy three years aog, she owed her sister $122,000 from a 2010 loan. She had more than $1.4million debts and about $700,000 in assets. The two sisters had recently sold their $950,000 home in Studio City in Los Angeles, but were still living in it while they waited for the new owners to take possession of the property and demolish it. The two sisters also ran a dog rescue agency to found homes for unwanted pets. Three of their dogs were found dead in the garage where Wendy was found dead from asphyxia.","Jill Blackstone says she and her sister Wendy planned to kill themselves in a suicide pact .

"Two brothers dragged a female police officer 100ft down the road when she tried to stop them driving off in a stolen car. Daniel Icke, 21, and his 20-year-old brother Donovan had never driven before they stole a Ford Escort from outside a house in Wednesfield, West Midlands in December last year. They were stopped by PC Akwaal Baryana, who reached in to the car to take the keys when they pulled up at traffic lights and told them to get out. But Donovan, who was driving, ignored her warnings and put the car into reverse as PC Baryana clung on to the steering wheel. Theft: Donovan and Daniel Icke stole a car after breaking into a house and taking the vehicle's keys . The car careered backwards, crossed a busy dual carriage and crashed into a wall, causing the brave officer serious leg injuries. Donovan admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, aggravated vehicle taking and driving without a licence or insurance while his brother pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking. But they were spared jail and given suspended prison sentences when they appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday. Donovan, was given a 12-month prison sentence suspended for two years and ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work. He was also banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to pay £500 compensation to PC Baryana. Ordeal: The brothers dragged a police officer 100ft down a road in Wednesfield, pictured . Daniel received a four-month suspended sentence, 120 hours of unpaid work and a 12-month driving ban, and will have to pay £250 compensation. Recorder Richard Benson QC said he had decided 'with some trepidation' not to send them to prison, adding: 'This was inexcusable and potentially lethal behaviour. 'Some will say I am failing in my duty but they would not have had the benefit of reading the reports I have seen and hearing the mitigation.' The court heard the brothers took the keys to the car from a home they had broken into at 4am on December 2. PC Baryana and a colleague responded to the break-in, then spotted the stolen car at a junction 10 minutes later. Target: The two men stole a Ford Focus similar to this one shown in a file photo . Prosecutor Emma Wynne-Owen said: 'She held on to the steering wheel which prevented her being dragged under the car as it travelled for a further 35 metres. 'She pleaded with him to stop but the car continued in reverse, crossing the dual carriageway, mounting the pavement and crashing into a wall. 'The officer then told Donovan Icke, ""I told you to stop,"" and he replied, ""sorry"".' Amanda Jenkins, defending the brothers, said: 'Neither had driven before and they argued over who should drive before Donovan stupidly took the wheel. 'They could not believe their luck. It was raining and they had a fair way to go to get home, so very foolishly they took the car. 'When the officer opened the driver's door Donovan panicked and put the vehicle into reverse. 'It swerved because the officer was holding the steering wheel. He did not know what to do but realises it could have been far more serious.'","Daniel and Donovan Icke stole a Ford Escort after taking keys from a house .

"Mel Greig, the Australian DJ who became notorious following a prank call during the Duchess of Cambridge's first pregnancy, has appeared on TV to complain that she still can't find work. The 33-year-old, who has previously revealed that she was sent bullets in the post following the 2013 hoax, says people are still unwilling to give her a chance. 'The reaction in Australia has not been good,' she said. 'People aren't willing to give me a chance and a lot of people forget that I have worked in the media for 15 years. Scroll down for video . Work: Australian DJ Mel Greig has revealed that she wants to return to the radio . 'I have grown and learnt so much from the prank call that I am going to be a wiser announcer. I think it‘s important to put me back on air because I have so much wisdom now from such a tragedy.' The DJ shot to global notoriety after making a prank call to the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for severe morning sickness - an incident that later led to the suicide of nurse Jacinta Saldanha. Ms Greig, who was stricken with guilt following Mrs Saldanha's death, revealed that she suffered severe depression as a result. Speaking to guest presenter, Fiona Phillips on ITV's Lorraine this morning, Greig said: 'I have made it through the depression. 'It was a really hard time for about a year and a half but I did find the strength to get through that. In just one moment, it’s incredible how you can just go down there and experience feelings, emotions that you’ve never experienced before.

Appearance: Ms Greig was appearing on ITV's Lorraine where she spoke to presenter Fiona Phillips . Tough times: Ms Greig, seen here leaving the ITV studio, has struggled with depression since the incident . So depressed did Ms Greig become, she admitted that she even blamed her childlessness on the 'karma' from the incident. 'I won’t be able to have children naturally which at one point I thought was my karma from the prank call,' she revealed. 'That was quite hard to come to terms with but I am at peace with that and I know that’s not how it works… I want to be a mother so I will do whatever I can to try and be a mother.' Greig also spoke of the moment she came face to face with the Saldanha family during last year's inquest into the mother-of-two's death, describing the encounter as 'intense'. 'I said to the Saldanha family from the start if there is anything I could answer, anything I can do to try and help with this situation [I would.] . Scare: Greig made the call to a hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge, seen on Friday, was being treated . Tragedy: Nurse Jacinta Saldanha, who put the call through, later committed suicide . 'Obviously I was one of the main causes of it, they welcomed me there [to the inquest] if I could assist. 'I didn’t meet them, we were in the same courtroom, [but] I was able to apologise face to face at the end which was a really intense moment… . 'I could see that they knew my apology was sincere and it was.' Now the DJ, who married her long term love last November, says she hopes to be able to move on with her life and return to radio. 'Things really are fantastic for me [and] I’m feeling great,' she said.' [The wedding] was beautiful, it was just us and it was the most privacy we’d had in a long time. 'That lifted me even further for me to want to work again and to create a good lifestyle for my husband and I. 'I didn’t worry about employment for a long time,' she continued. 'It’s just the last eight months [that] I’m like, OK I want to work again. 'It’s been really hard.

"Some of the most popular family restaurants are serving children’s meals with dangerously high levels of salt, a survey has revealed. More than a quarter of meals sampled contained over an entire day’s salt allocation for a child under the age of four. Experts warned last night that chain restaurants’ disregard for child health risks creating a generation addicted to salt, leading to raised blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. Scroll down for video . Worst offender: Burger King Kid’s Veggie Bean Burger (pictured) with small fries contained 4.6g of salt per serving, the equivalent of nine packets of crisps . Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash), a charity backed by leading doctors, carried out a spot check of 218 children’s meals at 23 popular chain restaurants. It found that 28 per cent of the meals surveyed contained more than 2g of salt, an entire day’s allowance for a child under four, and 7 per cent contained more than 3g, the allowance for a child under seven. The worst meals sampled contained as much salt as nine packets of crisps, the researchers discovered. Cash chairman Professor Graham MacGregor, a heart expert at Queen Mary University London, said: ‘Evidence suggests dietary habits in childhood can influence eating patterns later in life. ‘Salt should therefore not be given to children as this could lead to a “salt addiction” – a preference for salt throughout their lifetime. This will consequently raise their blood pressure which tracks into adulthood, leading to increased risk of developing strokes and heart attacks.’ Cash nutritionist Sonia Pombo said: ‘It’s a scandal that very few restaurants are taking salt reduction seriously, especially when the health of our children is at risk.’ The meal with the most salt content was the Burger King Kid’s Veggie Bean Burger with small fries, which contained 4.6g of salt per serving, the equivalent of nine packets of crisps. Hungry Horse’s ham with mashed potato and baked beans contained 4.2g of salt per serving. And Loch Fyne Seafood and Grill bangers and mash with gravy contained 4g. Other meals in the top ten for salt came from Beefeater, Bella Italia, JD Wetherspoon and Nando’s. Restaurants included in the study insisted they had already reduced salt content in their meals. A Burger King spokesman said: ‘Burger King Corp has successfully reduced the sodium content in many of its products around the world.’ A spokesman for Greene King, the owner of Hungry Horse and Loch Fyne, said: ‘We are committed to reducing the levels of salt within our supply chain and many products already used in our children’s menus are reduced salt, such as burgers, sausages and baked beans in Hungry Horse.’ A Beefeater spokesman said: ‘As a popular family friendly restaurant visited by thousands of people every week, we are constantly working hard to bring down the salt content of our meals and we take our responsibilities towards public health very seriously. Bella Italia said: ‘Our menu is varied with plenty of options for children of all ages, tastes and requirements, and it features a great selection of vegetables, salad, pasta, fish and chicken.’ Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ‘Whilst certain popular meal combinations such as chicken nuggets, chips and baked beans have higher salt levels, we also include several lower salt combinations or meal.’ Nando’s did not reply to a request for comment.","More than 25% of meals contained entire day's allocation for those under 4 .

"Eoin Collins, five, eats anything from stones to fabric conditioner due to a rare disorder . A five-year-old boy eats everything from stones, sand, soil and mortar to toilet paper, sponge, paint and fabric conditioner due to a rare disorder. Eoin Collins, from Chester, has an impulsive and untreatable craving disorder called Pica - a appetite for non-food substances. He was diagnosed  three years ago when he started to chew on sand from the beach in Cornwall during a family holiday. His insatiable appetite means he consumes cleaning products, wallpaper and has even started to chew on his nine-year-old brother Finn's Comic Relief red nose. His disorder keeps his single mother-of-three Ceri Collins on her toes and she has to watch him constantly to keep him from eating something that could make him seriously ill. Mrs Collins, 32, a childminder, said: 'You can't turn your back on him for a second without him sticking his hand in the sand or mud. 'If I leave cleaning products out for a second then he will eat them or try to drink them and he's always picking paint off the walls. 'And I had to give a plant that a friend gave to me as a present to my mum because he was always at the soil. 'He will eat literally anything.' Eoin has picked paint off the walls all around their home and risks eating his way through to his grandmother's house next door. Mrs Collins has to keep all potentially fatal products on the top shelf and even uses stair gates to keep her son out of  cupboards. Recently, Eoin has developed a taste for sponges and even toilet paper - and his cravings show no sign of stopping. She said: 'I just thought that it was a phase and that he would grow out of it when I first saw him eat sand. 'The real danger is that he will eat something that will make him sick. 'But thankfully that hasn't happened yet and he's not gained weight. 'But Eoin has limited speech so he can't tell me why he does it at all and it's really stressful.' Pica, the Latin word for 'magpie', is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious complications if the person is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible. They can also damage their teeth, or have part of the body obstructed – something often seen in people who eat hair. Eoin drives his mother crazy by eating paint and mortar from the walls of his home. Recently, he has developed cravings for toilet paper and sponges . Pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value. These can include stones, sand, paint and dirt. It is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious complications if the person is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible. These include being poisoned by toxic ingredients and having a part of the body obstructed (which is often seen in people who eat hair). It can also lead to excessive calorie intake, but also nutritional deprivation if the person eats a substance with no nutritional value instead of nutritious foods. The person can also damage their teeth and be infected with parasites. It can lead to weight gain if they are consuming more calories, or a deficiency ff they are replacing nutritious food with substances with no nutritional value. Eoin has one-on-one assistance at Broughton Primary School in Chester to keep him from eating bizarre items when he is away from his mother. But he has to be watched like a hawk when he visits friends' houses as he will . Mrs Collins said: 'His cravings can be horrendous some weeks and when he goes to people’s houses he sometimes goes straight to the little drawer in their washing machine to scoop up the fabric conditioner.' Eoin has a brother, Finn, nine, and sister Niamh, two, who are not affected by his bizarre cravings. Mrs Collins said: 'Both his brother and sister are brilliant with him. 'Niamh will sometimes try and copy him and start eating bubbles in the bath and stuff like that. Ceri Collins, 32, has to supervise her son constantly as she is terrified he will eat something harmful . 'But at least she doesn't like the taste - Eoin is not bothered by taste at all and he can't help the urge. 'I don't know what it is - whether it is the texture or something else - but I just have to try and distract him to stop him eating things he shouldn't.' Eoin's cravings - especially for mud and moss - have made it difficult for him to go outside to play and last summer, he was stuck indoors. Mrs Collins is now fundraising to raise £8,000 to create a garden of 'non-edible' materials. It will enable him to play outside without close supervision which he needs to prevent him from hunting down his favourite 'food' - moss. Mrs Collins said: 'He will get more freedom when he goes outside which is really important - it will be a massive step for his independence. 'He loves to be outside and people have been really kind by donating things and raising money for the new garden. 'He's a rascal but is really loving. Unfortunately he can't go outside on his own much because of the condition but hopefully that is about to change.","Eoin Collins, five, eats everything from stones and sponges to sand .

"David Cameron backed a Government review into Britain's seagull menace – after a bird once stole the ham from his sandwich. The Prime Minister insisted he had nothing against 'the entire seagull population', despite committing £250,000 in the Budget to tackling the scourge of Britain's seaside towns. An 'urban seagull' research fund will be used to find a solution for the noise, mess, disease and aggression caused by the birds. An 'urban seagull' research fund has been set up to find a solution for the noise, mess, disease and aggression caused by the birds . Despite efforts from local councils including using artificial eggs and experimenting with stronger refuse bags, the gull population in the UK is thought to have grown to more than a quarter of a million breeding pairs. Last year, councils in the seaside resorts of Exmouth, Sidmouth and Seaton in Devon spent £15,000 on specially-bred 'super falcons' to try to stop seagulls from disturbing residents and tourists. In 2013, Royal Mail said postmen would not deliver in a street in the Cornish coastal town of Perranporth after being injured by the swooping birds who dive-bomb and peck at their heads. Asked whether he had ever been attacked by seagulls, the Prime Minister told the Western Morning News he had never felt 'particularly oppressed by seagulls'. But he revealed: 'In my distant past I remember some seagulls taking the ham out of a sandwich. But I haven't held that against the entire seagull population since.' Bath MP Don Foster, who held a 'seagull summit' in Parliament in 2012, said: 'Urban gulls cause mess, noise and damage to property, and are very aggressive in the nesting season. 'There is not enough data to enable a strategic approach to the problem, and I have long been pressing for funding to be given so that progress can be made.' David Cameron, pictured at today's EU summit in Brussels, backed a Government review into Britain's seagull menace – after a bird once stole the ham from his sandwich . Labour have claimed the seagull fund and other small measures in the Budget are little more than 'pork barrel politics' aimed at winning over marginal seats have been dismissed by the coalition. At least 16 marginal constituencies benefited from measures in the Budget, including £97 million for regeneration in Brent Cross, which straddles the ultra-marginal Hendon constituency where Conservative MP Matthew Offord has a majority of 106. Lib Dem sources insisted the seagull study was aimed at tackling the problem nationwide and the Treasury said the Chancellor had set out economic plans for every region in the country. Mr Foster has campaigned for action to be taken to tackle the 'menace' since before the Lib Dems entered government and hosted a 'seagull summit' three years ago. A Liberal Democrat source said: 'It's just silly stuff from an Opposition trying to cause mischief. 'Urban seagulls are a serious issue across the country and Don Foster has fought a campaign to get a proper study done so they can be properly dealt with.' A Treasury spokesman said: 'From investing £13 billion to improving transport across of the whole of the north of England to introducing 20 housing zones around the country to keep Britain building, from day one this Government has been committed to building a truly national recovery to close the long-term gaps between the north and south, London and the rest. 'The Chancellor has set out long-term economic plans for every region to make sure that Britain's prosperity is shared across the country and the Budget took this even further with ambitious investment in a wide range of areas like enterprise zones, flood defence and science to ensure that no industry and no region is left behind.'","David Cameron insisted he had nothing against 'entire seagull population'

New development: The top floor has student lofts which will reportedly benefit from far-reaching views over the city - and even the countryside . UK students would therefore be paying up to £11,220 a year, on top of the £9,000-a-year course fees, totally almost £61,000 over three years. For international students, thanks to their fees of up to £17,500-a-year, the total figure could be more than £85,000 - before living costs are factored in. The university website says term-time living costs - excluding accommodation - are £3,740 a year, making the total cost of a degree near £100,000. The building is being renovated by developer Burrington Estates, which has already converted another site in the city into luxury student apartments.

"A Labour MP launched an attack on the Natural History Museum and Marks & Spencer last night over a range of dinosaur clothes for boys. Frontbencher Chi Onwurah accused both the retailer and the museum of sexism over the joint range, saying it excluded girls from science. The shadow cabinet office minister said the Natural History Museum was guilty of ‘gender-specific marketing’, and that she plans to join a protest outside the building next week. Scroll down for video . Attack: Shadow cabinet office minister Chi Onwurah has accused Marks & Spencer and the Natural History Museum of 'gender-specific marketing’ over range of dinosaur tshirts . But a spokesman for the attraction questioned her agenda, telling the Mail: ‘In the run up to the election, she has her own motivations’. The launch of the clothing range in January sparked a huge row, with critics accusing both the museum and the retailer of sexism. The range of clothes produced by M&S in partnership with the museum – which is famous for its dinosaur exhibition – includes pyjamas and t-shirts with images of dinosaurs on them. Campaigners said it was wrong only to target boys with the clothes and that girls should also be encouraged to take an interest in natural history. Yesterday Miss Onwurah wrote on Twitter: ‘If you’re in London next Monday help tell the dinosaurs in @NHM_London girls want a share in science too #hearusroar. Miss Onwurah said the t-shirts was excluding girls from science . She also tabled a series of questions in Parliament accusing the museum of ‘gender specific marketing of toys’ and failing to ‘target boys and girls equally’. Criticism of the range has been led by the ‘Let Clothes Be Clothes’ campaign. When the row first exploded the group’s co-founder Ruth Lopardo said: ‘I was astounded a national museum, which ought to have a clear access-forall policy, should license designs to M&S that are only marketed at boys. ‘How have these two national institutions, M&S and the Natural History Museum, managed to get through the entire product development cycle, from the initial idea to the product on the shelf, without anyone thinking that perhaps dinosaurs and natural science don’t just appeal to boys?’ A Marks&Spencer spokesman said: ‘This is a brand new partnership and, as with any new range, we have listened carefully to feedback from our customers on how they would like to see it evolve. ‘Our design team is working with the Natural History Museum on expanding the range to include products for girls.’ A spokesman for the Natural History Museum said: ‘We are currently working with the Marks and Spencer design team to expand the range to include products for girls. Licensing retail items plays an important role in generating revenue to help fund our work. ‘The Natural History Museum is passionate about science learning and careers for all. Products in the Museum shop are displayed without gender differentiation for children.’","Labour MP accuse Natural History Museum and M&S of 'sexism'

"A Dallas woman faces up to 20 years in federal prison for her role in the overdose death of a 19-year-old apparent first-time heroin user. Rian Lashley, whose teenage YouTube debut revealed a talented and beautiful singer rife with potential, died in March 2014 after a stripper's implausible attempt to rob her of $3,000 went terribly wrong. That stripper, Cierra Rounds, gave her disgusting account of the ill-fated plot in court on Tuesday as she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Sad: 19-year-old Rian Lashley was killed in an attempt to rob her by injecting her with heroin that went terribly wrong, prosecutors say. Dallas stripper Cierra Rounds, right, revealed in court Tuesday the calamitous chain of events that led to Lashley's demise . The trouble began when Rounds, along with some of her friends, met with the young woman at a Plano, Texas IHOP in order to sell her $100 worth of heroin. While they ate, the New York Daily News reports, Rounds and her friend Kathryn Dirks, 25, came to discover that Lashley was carrying $3,000 cash ion her purse. Rounds soon reached out to her drug dealer, identified as J.C. or Jaymo, NBCDFW reports, and the plan was hatched. 'I figured ud (sic) want me on this money,' Rounds texted J.C. The trio then drove to a home in Dallas. J.C. told Rounds via text message to keep Lashley there. 'Ima bout (sic) to shoot her up for her first time,' Rounds said. At the home, prosecutors say Rounds and Dirks, at Lashley's request, injected heroin into the teen. Tragic: The trouble began when Rounds, along with some of her friends, met with Lashley at a Plano, Texas IHOP in order to sell her $100 worth of heroin . China White: The 19-year-old had never done heroin. She was sold three bags of China White by Rounds' cohort Glen Brunton, according to prosecutors . Little girl lost: Lashley's funeral home obituary page is covered in heartfelt condolences to Lashley's family, as well as photos from her painfully innocent-looking upbringing . Later that afternoon, Lashley began to appear distressed. Rounds said Tuesday that they then put the teen in a bathtub of ice water in order to try to counteract the heroin. She appeared to go to sleep thereafter and died that afternoon. An autopsy revealed her death was due to heroin overdose. Dirks and a man to whom J.C. gave the heroin to sell to Lashley, 28-year-old Glen Brunton, were indicted on drugs charges last year, the Dallas Morning News reports. Brunton goes to trial in April. Dirks is still a fugitive. Rounds remains jailed pending sentencing and faces a $1 million fine along with her potential jail time. She returns to court in September.

"A hapless Vietnamese pair caught running a £100,000 cannabis farm told police they thought they were growing 'western vegetables,' a court heard. Police discovered more than 500 illegal plants growing in 11 different rooms in the four-storey house in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Chien Nguyen, 32, was jailed for three years and Hieu Nguyen, 35, for three years and fours months after they pleaded guilty to growing cannabis. The Vietnamese nationals tried to deny responsibility for the offence after being arrested. Chien Nguyen, 32, pictured left,  was jailed for three years and Hieu Nguyen, 35, pictured right, was jailed for three years and four months after they both admitted cultivating cannabis . They claimed they believed the plants were 'Western vegetables' and did not know they were breaking the law. Police forced entry to the property on October 19 last year, after being alerted by a strong smell of the class B drug coming from the property. Once inside, officers found Hieu hiding in the framework of a sofa and Chien was in the void above a fake ceiling. Prosecutor Louise Pryke said over 100 high-powered lights had been fitted at the property to help the plants grow. Analysis later revealed that the plants were capable of producing more than 16kgs of cannabis. The two men were in the UK illegally and entered the country via the Czech Republic. Timothy Jacobs, mitigating, said the pair had been paid by others to look after the plants and were unaware of the scale of the operation. Mr Jacobs said it was accepted that both men would be facing lengthy prison sentences and would be deported upon release from custody. Police discovered more than 500 cannabis factory in the four-storey property in Delphs Lane, Leeds. Pictured: Street View image of the road . Judge Geoffrey Marson, QC, described the cannabis discovery as a 'thoroughly professional enterprise.' 'It was designed to produce significant quantities of cannabis for commercial use to be put on the streets of this and other cities to enrich the lives of those involved at the expense of the misery of those who are addicted,' he said at Leeds Crown Court. 'I am entirely satisfied that this was a commercial enterprise motivated in each of your cases by financial advantage. 'You were clearly entrusted by others playing leading roles with these plants.'","Chien Nguyen, 32, and Hieu Nguyen, 35, admitted cultivating cannabis .

"Hundreds of women and children have been seized from Nigerian primary schools by Boko Haram militants to be used as 'human shields' as the extremist group starts to lose its grip on the region. The Islamic militants took adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak as troops from Niger and Chad approached a month ago, Mike Omeri, the Nigerian spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, confirmed this week. When the soldiers arrived, they found the town largely deserted - with local reports suggesting as many as 500 people were taken in the raids. Scroll down for video . Kidnapped: As many as 500 women and children were taken from Damasak, in north-eastern Nigeria, as Chadian troops (pictured) advanced on the town, which had been held by Boko Haram for months . Mr Omeri refused to be drawn on exactly how many people had been taken by Boko Haram militants, but he was clear on the reason why they had been kidnapped. 'Boko Haram ... rushed to primary schools they took children and adults that they are using as shields to protect themselves from the menacing advance of troops,' he said. 'They are being used as shields by Boko Haram.' Damasak, which is near the border with Niger and had been held by Boko Haram for months, was recaptured on March 16 - but officials have only confirmed the kidnappings now. Evidence of a mass grave was also discovered by the troops from Chad and Niger, who now hold the town, Chad's ambassador to the U.N. Mahamat Zene Cherif confirmed Wednesday. Last week, the troops found the bodies of at least 70 people in an apparent execution site under a bridge leading out of Damasak, which had been used as an administrative centre for the extremists who hope to create their own 'caliphate' in the region. Defence: Officials believe they were taken so they could be used as human shields when troops arrived. Pictured: Chadian army celebrates entering Damasak - showing off one of Boko Haram's flags . A 40-year-old resident, who gave her name as Fana, said fighters had rounded up captives in the main mosque before taking them out of town. She said she saved her two children by hiding them in her house. The news of the mass kidnappings and killings comes at a crucial time - just days before Nigeria goes to the polls in crucial elections. The six-year battle against the insurgents is one of the major issues voters will be considering on Saturday. Gruesome: Soldiers also discovered a mass grave near the town. Pictured: Seizing the militants' weapons . Thousands have already lost their lives - including an estimated 10,000 last year alone - while more than 174,000 people are thought to have fled to neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger as refugees. Last year, Boko Haram's reign of terror hit the international headlines when they took 276 girls from a government boarding school. Dozens escaped in the first couple of days, but 219 remain missing. Since then, troops from Nigeria's neighbours have started to help the country combat the militants and win back Nigerian towns. Meanwhile, Boko Haram has vowed to violently disrupt the elections.","As many as 500 women and children taken from Damasak primary schools .

"The mother of an Alabama girl testified through tears on Monday that the child's grandmother doesn't deserve to live after being convicted of running her nine-year-old granddaughter to death. Heather Walker took the stand in support of prosecutors who want the death penalty for her former mother-in-law, Joyce Hardin Garrard. Walker said the 49-year-old Garrard 'shouldn't be spared' after being convicted of capital murder in the death of Savannah Hardin. Scroll down for video . Savannah Hardin (left) died in 2012 after her grandmother punished her by making her run around the house for three hours. Her mother, Heather Walker (right), told the court that she believes her ex-mother-in-law deserves the death penalty . Joyce Hardin Garrard was found guilty of capital murder on Friday. After  more than three hours of deliberation an Etowah County jury found Garrard guilty of murder in the death of nine-year-old granddaughter, Savannah Hardin . 'I personally feel like I see no remorse and she took away my baby's life,' Walker said of Garrard. Seated just a few feet away at the defense table, Garrard showed no emotion. Meanwhile, much of Walker's testimony was hard to understand because she was sobbing uncontrollably. Walker, who is divorced from Garrard's son Robert and has since remarried, said she wasn't allowed to see Savannah during the last two years of the girl's life. She had sent multiple care packages that were returned to her, and when she would phone the numbers, eventually all the contact numbers she had had been changed. But then one day a number she didn't recognize phoned her, she told the court on Monday, and it was Robert calling to say Savannah had suffered brain swelling following a seizure . 'How soon can you get here?', he asked. At that point in her testimony Ms Walker burst into tears, detailing how she tried frantically to get more information. When she finally tracked her daughter down at Children's Hospital a person on the line said she needed 'the grandmother's permission' to give Heather any information. Joyce tried to keep Heather from being alone with Savannah when she did get there. Monday on the stand Heather sobbed as described her daughter, who looked normal other than some blood on her face, but was nonetheless hooked up to machines with a fatal injury. Savannah never had ADHD to her memory and had no injuries or other medical issues. ''I couldn't understand how that could just happen,' she said she thought. Heather had not seen daughter Savannah in the year before her death, as she moved out of state to live with her father and stepmother. Jessica says she repeatedly sent things, which would be returned to sender to her . Jurors convicted Garrard on Friday and now must decide whether to recommend death or life without parole, the only options under Alabama law. The final decision is up to the judge. Garrard showed no reaction when the guilty verdict was read, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies. She glared toward the audience as she walked out silently. Some of her relatives sitting behind her began to cry. Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict, delivered after about three-and-a-half hours of deliberation. Garrard's husband, Johnny, sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter before the daughter ran from the courtroom sobbing. The defense will begin presenting its case for a life sentence on Wednesday. Savannah collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood as Garrard refused to let her stop running. She died three days later in hospital . Prosecutors said Garrard — with eight surviving grandchildren and a ninth-grade education — should be put to death for making the child run around her yard and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy in February 2012. Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise. In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson. Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9-year-old Savannah while the girl's father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department. Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Rhea, Walker said she didn't believe Garrard 'woke up that morning' planning to kill Savannah. Rather, she said, the situation seemed to get out of hand. 'I think there was a point where she knew what she was doing,' Walker said. Another witness, Samuel Hudgins, testified he saw the girl running laps around the house that day as Garrard stood by. Garrard forced Savannah to run around the house and carry wood as punishment for a lie about candy in February 2012 . Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said. But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day. Garrard showed no reaction when she was found guilty, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies . He said, 'I think we have all had the thought: 'If it was that bad, why didn't they do something?'' He said witnesses didn't notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support. 'Then it becomes 'Oh yeah, I witnessed boot camp. I witnessed the drill sergeant from hell',' he said. Garrard was the final witness to testify on Wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments Friday afternoon. Savannah collapsed from a seizure and died three days later in a hospital in Birmingham after doctors determined there was no brain activity and removed her from life support. An autopsy blamed her death on seizures cause by low sodium following extreme physical exertion. Walker described the mournful scene in the hospital room as a physician turned off a breathing machine as a test to see whether Savannah, who was unconscious, would breathe on her own. 'During this time Joyce was just screaming at Savannah saying, 'Savannah, you need to breathe,'' Walker said. Within moments it was obvious Savannah wouldn't survive, she said. 'I held her hand until her body stiffened up,' said Walker, sobbing and barely understandable. But Garrard seemed more worried about herself than her granddaughter, Walker said. Later at the hospital, Walker said, Garrard grabbed the shoulders of the child's pregnant stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin. Even though Hardin was in labor at the time and would later give birth, Garrard seemed intent on getting the other woman's attention, Walker said. 'She said, 'Jessica, there's a lot on the line. You need to pull it together,'' Walker said. Walker said already had suspicions about what had happened to her daughter, and she became 'more uneasy' after hearing Garrard's remarks to Hardin. Garrard (left) and Jessica Mae Hardin (right), Savannah's stepmother, were arrested in February 2012. Garrard has been waiting in jail for three years for her sentence. Harden has also been charged with her murder, for allegedly sitting by as Garrard ran the girl to death, which carries a life sentence . Garrard and Hardin were both at the house the afternoon the girl ran, evidence showed. Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence. Hardin has also been charged with her murder, for allegedly sitting by as Garrard ran the girl to death, which carries a life sentence. The girl was in the care of her stepmother and grandmother while her father was away. Hardin, who is awaiting trial, gave birth the day after her arrest in 2012. Savannah loved cheer leading and horses and wanted to be a veterinarian when she grew up, Walker said. 'She was full of life. She was the sweetest little girl,' said Walker.","Joyce Hardin Garrad, 49, was convicted for the 2012 murder of her granddaughter Savannah Hardin, aged nine .

"Data firms trading in medical and financial records are working for state schools, dentists and the Government, it emerged last night. Colleges admitted buying data on children from a company exposed by the Mail for selling pensioners’ health secrets. NHS dentists are also allegedly buying information on patients to offer free treatments before convincing them to go private. Scroll down for video . Vidya Mishra, who runs data firm Prospect 360, claimed he sells data to NHS dentists so they can target poor people, who are more likely to have poor teeth . Dentists then allegedly try to convince the patients to pay for private follow up treatments, according to Mr Mishra (pictured in an undercover video) Vince Cable’s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, meanwhile, paid up to £15,000 to use one a data broker exposed by the Mail, entrusting it to manage an email campaign targeting small businesses across the country. It bought half a million records, with contact addresses gathered by cold calling receptionists and coaxing information from them. The deal has emerged a day after David Cameron described the Mail’s revelations about the sale of personal data as ‘extremely serious’ and said he expected serious penalties to be imposed. The Government’s champion for older workers, Dr Ros Altmann, said: ‘Taxpayers will not want their money spent on enriching firms that have shown such careless disregard for citizens’ rights.’ Andy Silvester, campaign director at the TaxPayers’ Alliance added: ‘Civil servants should spend taxpayers’ money as if it’s their own, and that means checking who you’re giving it to. It’s vital that there are better safeguards in place so that taxpayers’ money isn’t subsidising firms who are engaging in such questionable practices. The Department needs to seriously consider its current position.’ The Mail revealed yesterday how medical details on people with arthritis, diabetes, physical disabilities and even bladder problems were sold to an undercover reporter by Joanne Clayton, owner from Data Bubble. Joanne Clayton (pictured) of Data Bubble revealed that her firm sells data on local parents to state academies, universities and higher education colleges . For 15p each, the colleges buy at least 3,000 records a time on parents in their catchment areas to invite them to open days . She also revealed her firm sells data on local parents to state academies, universities, and higher education colleges Moulton College in Northamptonshire, City of Wolverhampton College and Warwickshire College. For 15p each, the colleges buy at least 3,000 records a time on parents in their catchment areas to invite them to open days. ‘I do a lot of work with colleges by providing them with parents data,’ said Mrs Clayton, who also works as a hypnotherapist. ‘Parents of 15, 16, 17 year olds – so they’re a nice little earner for me, if I’m being honest. ‘A lot of academies are wanting to speak to businesses in their local area. They may not have the business information so they’ll come to me for the business data.’ Moulton College writes in an online testimonial that it bought 10,000 records from Data Bubble and as a result ‘our February Open Day was the busiest one we’d had for some time’. Marketing director Andrea Hughes admitted the data was bought to target children. ‘‘We... purchased a list of parents of Year 11 children within a ten-mile radius of the college,’ she said. ‘We had no cause for concern around Data Bubble and believe the mailing was successful.We have no plans to use Data Bubble again.’ Undercover reporters from the Mail also contacted data broker Prospect360. With Data Bubble, it was one of three firms whose names were passed to the paper as having sold personal information on pensioners which ended up in the hands of people suspected of being involved in a major fraud. Mr Mishra revealed that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was one of his clients . He boasted that the Government had commissioned his firm to create and send out hundreds of thousands of emails under a scheme, to help small businesses at a cost of ‘ten, fifteen thousand pounds’ Asked where they obtained the firms’ email addresses, Mr Mishra said call centres phoned receptionists to ask for information . Prospect360 managing director Vidya Mishra offered to sell personal pensions data for as little as 5p a time and spoke of the benefits of targeting the vulnerable when making cold calls. Mr Mishra, whose wife is a dentist, also claimed he sells data to NHS dentists so they can target poor people, who are more likely to have poor teeth. Dentists then allegedly try to convince the patients to pay for private follow up treatments. Mr Mishra, 44, revealed that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills was one of his clients. He boasted that the Government had commissioned his firm to create and send out hundreds of thousands of emails under a scheme, to help small businesses at a cost of ‘ten, fifteen thousand pounds’. Asked where they obtained the firms’ email addresses, Mr Mishra said call centres phoned receptionists to ask for information. Warwickshire College admits online that it has used Data Bubble ‘again and again’ and ‘have no hesitation in recommending them’ but said yesterday it ‘will await the outcome of the investigation by the ICO’ before deciding whether to use them again. City of Wolverhampton College said: ‘No details other than names and addresses of people who might be interested in further study were requested or obtained. The college has no plans to use this organisation’s services in the future.’ The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the deal with Prospect360 was arranged through a third party. It would not comment on the amount of taxpayers’ money it spent. Mrs Clayton said: ‘We are a reputable data broker who supplies data legally. It is our responsibility as a data broker to supply data within the laws and regulations surrounding our industry and we take those responsibilities very seriously.’ Mr Mishra said: ‘We buy and supply data in good faith. We never do anything underhand and we never misguide people.’","Schools have admitted buying data on children from firm Data Bubble .

"BBC 1 drama The Ark will not include the iconic scene of animals entering the Ark two-by-two. It stars Shameless actor David Threlfall as Noah . It is one of the strongest biblical images learned in childhood – the animals entering Noah’s Ark two-by-two. But BBC 1 drama The Ark, to be shown over Easter, will not include the iconic scene – because writer Tony Jordan doesn’t want it to feel ‘like Peppa Pig’. Jordan, best known for his work on EastEnders, said: ‘What we have done with Noah in the past is to change it into a children’s story. It’s like a version of Peppa Pig. ‘Every time someone makes a film, they have the ramp and then the two crocodiles followed by two ducks. It’s all rubbish.’ The Ark, which stars Shameless actor David Threlfall as Noah, also ignores the scene where a dove carries an olive leaf to Noah to let him know the flood is receding. But the changes do not please traditionalists. Theologian Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali said: ‘The animals are an integral part of the story because it is about the whole of creation, not just human beings. 'Then the dove coming back with the olive leaf, that is about calmness and the return to order.’ The gritty depiction of Noah may also surprise traditionalists. In one scene he headbutts a thief and in another his sons talk about the impossibility of making love to their wives in such cramped conditions. Jordan said his irreverent approach to the original material was about revealing the wider truth in the story, adding: ‘The characters are supposed to be human beings.’ The writer said he chose not to include the scene because he doesn’t want it to feel ‘like Peppa Pig’ (pictured)","BBC drama which will be shown over Easter will not feature iconic scene .

"President Barack Obama challenged Republicans who oppose Obamacare to come up with an alternative at an event today celebrating the fifth anniversary of the law. In a subtle jab at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who has zealously fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama said, 'folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law, you’ve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free.' Cruz led a 2013 filibuster in the Senate that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law, making it easier to legislatively dismantle. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama challenged Republicans who oppose Obamacare to come up with an alternative at an event today celebrating the fifth anniversary of the law. To 'folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law, ' he said, 'you’ve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free' He and his allies were eventually defeated in that effort after a two-week stand off with Democrats, who held the majority in the upper chamber at the time. But he has continued to fight to have the law nullified and named repeal a top priority in a speech announcing his candidacy for higher office on Monday. The White House was won't to react that afternoon to Cruz's entry into the 2016 brawl but it did rib him over his campaign promise to throw out the sitting president's signature policy achievement. 'Well, there was a presidential candidate who ran in 2012 promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and that campaign pledge didn’t work out very well for him,' Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters, referring to that year's Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney. In a twist of irony, Cruz said Tuesday that he would sign his family up for Obamacare. Previously included in a plan in the name of his wife, a Goldman Sachs employee, Cruz's family will lose its health care soon as she leaves her job to join him full time on the campaign trail. Earnest resisted taking a shot at Cruz over the matter on Wednesday, saying that if he does apply for a plan via the government marketplace, 'he will find is what millions of Americans across the country have found,' which is that there are good quality healthcare plans available  because of the health care reform law. While others have pointed out the irony of the situation, 'I am seeking to merely point out the common experience that it seems that the Cruz family may be sharing,' Earnest told a reporter pressing him on the issue. At the event on Wednesday, Obama said critics of the law need to explain 'why forcing millions of families to pay thousands of dollars more will somehow make us more secure. Or why we should go back to the days when women paid more for coverage than men' and a 'preexisting condition locked so many of us out of insurance.' The president said that because of the law, 'If you’re a woman, you can no longer be charged more just for being a woman. 'And you know there are a lot of women. Like more than 50 percent,' he said, eliciting laughter from attendees of the White House-sponsored event for private and public sector health care workers. 'This law is also saving lives - lives that touch all of us,' he said. 'It’s working despite countless attempts to repeal, undermine, defund, and defame this law.' Defending the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare after its biggest backer, the president, Obama said, 'It’s not the “job-killer” that critics have warned about for five years.' In fact, after it was passed, 'businesses began the longest streak of private-sector job growth on record,' he said, noting that the economy has added 12 million new jobs in the last 60 months. 'It’s not the fiscal disaster critics warned about for five years. Health care prices are rising at the slowest rate in nearly 50 years, which has helped cut our deficit by two-thirds since I took office,' he contended. Before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, health care costs were projected to be the 'single biggest driver' of new deficits. 'Today, health care is the single biggest factor driving those projections down,' he said. 'We have been promised a lot of things these past five years that didn’t turn out to be the case: death panels, doom. A serious alternative from Republicans in Congress,' he said. The comment was a subtle jab at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who has zealously fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Cruz, pictured here on Monday at his campaign kick off, led a 2013 filibuster in the Senate that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law, making it easier to legislatively dismantle . Obama said the reason that Republicans are having such a difficult time coming up with an alternative to his plan to reform the healthcare system is because it was 'pretty much was their plan before I adopted it.' Repeating past claims, Obama said the ACA is 'based on conservative, market-based principles developed by the Heritage Foundation and supported by Republicans in Congress, and deployed by a guy named Mitt Romney in Massachusetts to great effect. 'If they want to take credit for this law, they can. I’m happy to share it,' he added. The president acknowledged that his administration has 'made our share of mistakes since we passed this law.' 'But we also know beyond a shred of a doubt that the policy has worked,' he said. 'Coverage is up. Cost growth is at a historic low. Deficits have been slashed. Lives have been saved.' 'So if anybody wants to join us in the spirit of the people who have put aside differences to come here today and help make the law work even better, come on board,' he said, trolling Republicans. To GOP lawmakers who want to get rid of the law, he pointed to 28-year-old Obamacare recipient Anne Ha, a Philadelphia business owner who was present for his remarks, made from the South Court of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is located next door to the White House. 'She thought what many of us think when we're young...that she was too young, too healthy to bother with health insurance. She went to the gym every day. She ate healthy, looks great, felt invincible. Why pay a doctor just to tell her she’s okay?' Ha bought healthcare insurance from the federal marketplace that was created by Obamacare at the behest of her mother, he said. And four months later she was diagnosed with stomach cancer, for which she underwent chemo therapy and surgery. 'Today, she’s recovering. She looks great. She’s here with us at the Whte House. She invited me to her wedding,' he said. 'I told her you don't want the President at her wedding.' Because Anne was covered under Obamacare and had her cancer diagnosed early, he said, she is now healthy and will be able to follow through with a September wedding to her fiancé Tom. 'And she’s convinced him to get covered, too,' Obama stated. The president said he and First Lady Michelle appreciated Ha's invitation to her wedding, but 'as I said, we have to mag people at the wedding, and it spoils the fun.'","President made a subtle jab at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who has zealously fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act .

"A chocolate-mad mum has lost a staggering 10 stone after realising she looked just like a character from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Nicola Savory, was left red-faced when she saw a picture of herself looking exactly like the bloated blueberry character Violet Beauregarde, the greedy girl who swelled to the size of a giant blueberry after scoffing forbidden confectionery. The 36-year-old, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, tipped the scales at 21st 10lbs but is now nearly half her size after ditching her diet of chocolate bars, sausage rolls and pasties for healthier options. Scroll down for video . Feeling blue: Nicola Savory, 36, (right) thought she saw more than a passing resemblance to the character of Violet Beauregarde from the film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . The new Nicola! After losing seven pounds in her first week of serious dieting, Nicola never looked back and lost 10 stones, going from a size 28 to a size 12 . After two years of watching her weight, Nicola has dropped eight dress sizes going from a size 28 to a size 12 after attending Slimming World classes. She said: 'I loved chocolate bars up until I saw a picture of myself and was horrified. I looked like the swollen blueberry girl from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and that's when I knew I had to lose weight.' Nicola adds: 'Before, I'd tried every diet that you could think of including a soup diet and even one where you eat nothing but eggs. 'I would be eating scrambled eggs, egg and grapefruit, eggs on toast...but it really didn't work for me. 'With all the diets I tried, I always found myself hungry and would slip back into old habits and before I knew it I'd put on weight again. Unearthing a new confidence: Nicola had begun to shun family parties for fear of people telling her how much weight she had gained (left) and (right) Nicola's new, slender look came after she finally found a diet that worked for her . Nicola (far right) began to hate comparisons with her mum (far left) who has always been a larger lady . The weight became such an issue that Nicola says she no longer felt 'comfortable in my own skin' and stopped going to family parties. 'When I missed my Nan's 80th birthday I felt dreadful, but I was sick of people saying I'd put on weight and that I looked like my mum, who was a big woman. 'It was a vicious cycle - the more depressed I was about my weight, the more food I ate.' Nicola was nominated as Slimming World's Woman of the year for her local club in Buckinghamshire and was shortlisted in their finals of 55 women. Before losing weight Nicola would often joke with friends about her size, especially for having to order 5XL t-shirts and shop at specialist stores for larger people. But now, at half the woman she used to be, she's barely recognisable. In her first week of dieting, Nicola lost seven pounds and seven days later had lost a stone after making her New Year's Resolution to lose weight. Nikki cut back on her beloved chocolate and saw her weight plummet down to 11 stone . From then - January 2012 - she continued to battle the bulge and got down to her 11 stone target weight. Doctors told Nicola that if she didn't lose weight she'd have to be put on blood pressure tablets at the age of 34. Nicola said: 'I was really overweight, I'd eat a whole eight pack of sausages in one sitting. 'My ankles would swell when I walked, so would my knees and when I bent over I'd struggle to breathe. 'What stopped me before was the thought that I'd be the biggest person in the room but everyone's lovely and supportive, we all help each other lose weight. 'Now I feel so much happier in myself, I look great and nothing's holding me back. The mum of one ditched processed food and now has an extensive selection of foods that she can cook as part of her weight loss range. Nicola on holiday with her partner after losing the weight, she says the diet has left her feeling 'like a different woman' with a new lease of life . She said: 'The great thing is I can eat anything I just have to tweak recipes to make it leaner and cook it without fat. 'Before I'd use so much oil when cooking, I'd have sugars in my coffee it's no wonder I put all the weight on. 'Now I prefer a healthier option and feel so great for it, it tastes delicious and is good for me. 'Since losing weight I've been telling everyone - friends, family, anyone I could find that Slimming World truly helped me. 'I feel like a completely different woman now my BMI is now 26 which is great and I have so much energy. 'Although my husband's told me he'd love me whatever weight I was but personally I feel so much happier and I have much more energy. 'Now I'm not afraid to go to any family parties I'm now showing off my new figure. 'I'll never hide away from social occasions again, I feel good having my picture taken again now and we can start filling our family albums with pictures.'

"A Georgia teen who splurged on a BMW using $31,000 mistakenly deposited into his account has been sentenced to ten years on probation and has to pay the money back. The money was intended to be placed into the account of a Vietnam veteran, Steven Fields, 70, who had just sold land - but the 18-year-old, with the same name as the victim, had the money given to him through a bank error. Surprisingly for the men who met each other for the first time in court, both Mr Fields and the spend thrift reside in the same town of Hull, lived within half a mile of each other for a period of time and bank at First Citizens Bank, according to CBS 46. A Georgia teen (18-year-old Steven Fields above) who splurged on a BMW using $31,000 mistakenly deposited into his account has been sentenced to ten years on probation and has to pay the money back . The money was intended to be placed into the account of a Vietnam veteran, Steven Fields, 70, (elder Fields pictured above) who had just sold land - but the 18-year-old, with the same name as the victim, had the money given to him through a bank error . In addition to the flashy purchase of the BMW, his ten-day spending spree also included purchases on clothes and food at various stores and a fast-food restaurant, according to KHQ. Following his sentencing, he has reportedly been arrested for illegal drug possession. In the March 2014 bank error, the teenager was charged with felony theft after spending the money. When he first received the funds, he first withdrew  $20,000 in cash before spending another $5,000. On March 18, when he returned to the bank take out more cash, he was asked to return the money mistakenly placed into his account, according to Athens Banner-Herald. While Mr Fields and the recipient of the money had a lot in common, they never knew of each other. In addition to the flashy purchase of the BMW, his ten-day spending spree also included purchases on clothes and food at various stores and a fast-food restaurant. Following his sentencing, he has reportedly since been arrested for illegal drug possession . Surprisingly for the men who met each other for the first time in court, both Mr Fields and the spend thrift reside in the same town of Hull, lived within half a mile of each other for a period of time and bank at First Citizens Bank (above) Following the incident, the rightful owner of the money has reportedly had it returned to him by the bank. However, he said more than anything, he is upset the teller, who has not been named and made the transaction, has been forced to retire following her error. He said: 'That's the only thing that upset me was that my friend lost her job.' Last March, a woman, Stacey Sorrow, who raised the younger Fields said the teller should have corrected her mistake if she was aware there were people with the same name. She said of the moment the teen received the money: 'He was excited. I would have been too.' The teen and his father have both apologized to the veteran, who said he does not know if younger Fields is sincere, or just sorry that he got caught.","Steven Fields, 18, had $31,000 deposited into his account by bank teller in an error at First Citizens Bank in Georgia last March .

"They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and that was certainly true of lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone following the breakdown of her 22-year marriage. The mother-of-three revealed in her autobiography how she was furious to discover her husband, Michael, was seeing her old friend and colleague Samantha Bunn following their split. Michelle, 43, was suspicious that the pair had started their relationship before she and Michael separated - but this is an allegation he has always denied. Scroll down for video . Michelle Mone, pictured on This Morning, said she regrets her behaviour following the end of her marriage . Michelle admitted she saw red after finding out Michael and Samantha - who was nine years her junior - were together. And matters were not helped by the fact she continued to share her six-bedroom mansion in an affluent area of Scotland with her ex for eight months after they agreed to separate. During this time, Michelle waged war against the father of her children, damaging his prized Porsche, cutting up his clothes and putting laxatives in his coffee. But now years later and in a much happier place, Michelle admits she regrets her acts of childish revenge. 'When I found out about my ex employee and ex husband it was my way of getting the hurt out for 18 months,' she said on today's This Morning. The lingerie tycoon told This Morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that married couples who work together - like they do - should set ground rules to stop work going home with them . Michelle split with husband Michael, the father of her three children, in 2011 . 'I was so bitter, it was so out of character, I am not like that. I really regret it but every day is a school day and every day we learn and get stronger. 'I did do things I regret, like smashing up his car.' The Ultimo founder told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on the ITV show that she wishes she had thought about the effect her behaviour was having on their children, who were then aged 12, 15 and 19. She said: 'We lived together for eight months after the break up and I do feel bad for putting the kids through that. I was drinking heavily and just thinking about me. I wasn't thinking about how my behaviour effected my kids.' Michelle admitted she flew into a rage when she discovered her ex husband had started a new relationship with Samantha Bunn, left, who had once been her friend and Ultimo head of design . Michelle admitted that she is now off the booze and hasn't had a drink since December 31. After fighting for control of Ultimo from her former business partner husband (who went on to set up a rival lingerie company with Samantha), she has since sold 80 per cent of Ultimo and is no longer the chief executive. She said she prefers to do motivational speaking and advises couples to learn from her mistakes when it comes to working with a loved one. She said: 'If you are going to work with your partner, you have to have set of up ground rules, don't talk about phoning the bank when you're in bed together on a Friday evening. 'If you take business home with you, you will get a divorce or the business will go bust.' Michelle, who grew up in poverty in the East End of Glasgow, married Michael when she was 18 after she fell pregnant with their first child. The couple launched Ultimo together in 1999 after setting up their company MJM International in 1996. But Michelle admits the stress of making their business venture a success took its toll on their relationship. She wrote in her autobiography, My Fight To The Top, published by Blink yesterday: 'Going to work became like walking through a minefield, our boardroom meetings constantly interrupted by one or other of us storming out, and the arguments continued at home where our sex life was virtually non-existent.' After calling time on their relationship in 2011, the couple said in a statement on their separation that 'no other parties had been involved and the split was amicable.' The mother-of-three, pictured modelling for Ultimo, is no longer as involved in the brand she founded . However, things soon turned sour when Michelle discovered her husband had moved on with Samantha, who had been the head of design at Ultimo and had lived in a guest annex next to their mansion. Michelle explains in her book how she discovered Michael and Samantha were together after hiring a private detective who gave her pictures of them kissing. Michelle said it was finding out about their relationship that tipped her over the edge. She writes: 'Deep down I knew my marriage had been over for years, but I still felt indescribable pain. My knees buckled and I fell to the ground crying. 'My grief turned to anger. After texting Michael to tell him that he had been caught red-handed, I grabbed a knife and went to town on his beloved Porsche, scratching it to shreds. 'Then I charged round to the guesthouse where Sam was living - thanks to the kindness which she had betrayed - and threw all of her possessions into the garden, the dressing table along with them. I was like a banshee.' Michelle, pictured this week, said she feels in good health having not drank alcohol since 31 December . She added that she continued to terrorise her ex for the following months they continued to live together. 'I put his favourite shirts and cufflinks in the bin. I let down his car tyres. I cut holes in all his boxer shorts. I put laxatives in his coffee on the day that he and Sam were going to a wedding - God only knows if that worked,' she writes. 'On the day I moved out to a hotel I crept up to the master bedroom, pulled back the luxurious throw and threw a bucket of cold water over his side of the bed before replacing the covers.' But now she realises that she made a mistake in treating him this way and wishes she had behaved differently. Now she's moved on to live in her own place, stepped back from Ultimo and taken on a role as a motivation speaker, she wants to help other people be strong through adversity. 'If you don't love yourself, that's where the problems begin,' she advised on This Morning.","Michelle and her husband and business partner Michael split in 2011 .

"A Pennsylvania man with a history of violence has been accused of holding his girlfriend captive for more than three days during which he repeatedly struck her with a hammer, pulled out clumps of her hair and poured bleach in her eyes and wounds. Police in Latrobe said the victim, Stacey Myers, 40, escaped Saturday morning from 43-year-old Glenn Whittier’s home on Spring Street. She was taken to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital suffering from a laundry list of injuries, including bleeding in her lungs, skull trauma, bite marks on her chest and cuts on her back and thigh.

Myers spent half of last week captive in Whittier's home in Spring Street in Latrobe, Pennsylvania . Police said Myers, a mother of two grown daughters and a grandmother, told them Whittier hit her with the hammer. They say she had bite marks, cuts, bruises and a large amount of hair missing from her scalp. Cody Ghrist, the boyfriend of Myers' daughter Ashley, told the station WTAE when the woman showed up on his doorstep on Main Street sometime after 11am Saturday, she was covered in wounds and could hardly walk or talk. The couple called police after the badly beaten woman fell asleep, and officers who responded to the home found her lying on the floor with bruises on her face and body. 'She had slurred speech and was unsure of her surroundings,' a police officer wrote in a report cited by TribLive.com. [She] also had a severe injury to her left ear.' History repeats itself: Whittier has a lengthy criminal record, which includes charges of domestic violence . Whittier's neighbor Tracey Mehalic told the station that she often heard screams and sounds of fighting coming from the man’s apartment. Online records show Whittier has a lengthy criminal record, which includes charges of domestic violence, harassment and disorderly conduct. He was being held Wednesday in the Westmoreland County prison on $100,000 bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 23 on charges including aggravated assault and unlawful restraint.","Glenn Whittier, 43, charged with aggravated assault and unlawful restraint for allegedly beating and torturing Stacey Myers, 40 .

"Human remains have been found along an Alaskan trail less than two miles from the home of a family of four who disappeared without a trace last May. Brandon Jividen, 38, his girlfriend Rebecca Adams, 23, her two children Michelle, 6, and three-year-old Jarraca and their dog Sparks have not been seen for 10 months, prompting massive police searches with help from the FBI. Now police in the Alaskan town of Kenai, are connecting the discovery of the remains and items of clothing with the family's disappearance. Responding officers found remains and items reported missing from the home of Brandon Jividen, 38, and girlfriend Rebecca Adams, 23 . Clothes and human remains were found on the trail near their home, pictured, that may finally reveal what happened after the family vanished from their home . A map showing exactly where he remains and items of clothing were found on a trail near to the family home . It comes after a person driving down a west Kenai trail on Saturday spotted items, which were reported missing from Miss Adams and Mr Jividen's home. FBI officials are travelling to the area to help with the investigation. Currently yellow crime scene tape has cordoned off a brown, wooded area the size of a football field and police SUVs and a forensics tent has been erected. Police added that it would take time to positively identify the remains and to complete the investigation. Lieutenant David Cook told ABC: 'At this point it’s not apparent where they have gone or where they might be.

Miss Adams sister, Lanell Adams said that the young mother had been 'very distressed' during a phone call in the week before she went missing. Miss Adams who travelled to Alaska from Washington State to look for her sister, said: 'She sounded very distressed. She just told me: ""Know that I love you"" and that she had to get off the phone very quickly. 'Growing up we always had this thing, we say ""Thou shall not lie'' and you always have to tell the truth. 'I asked her, ''Thou shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?'' She said, ''Don't ask me that right now. Just know that I love you.'"" Meanwhile her uncle Dennis Giffords told the Alaska Dispatch News: 'You have a shred of hope that they will be found.

"Hundreds of believers have flocked to a hillside in Colombia after a landslide revealed the face of Jesus. The 'miraculous' discovery was made in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, on Saturday. Since then police have had to be called in to control the crowds as believers from across the country have descended on the hill to witness the 'miracle.' Scroll down for video . Hundreds of visitors have flocked to a hillside in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, after the face of Jesus appeared after a landslide . Now some local landowners are cashing in by charging visitors to view the holy image, according to a local newspaper. 'If you believe in Jesus, you will see your image,' Ximena Rosero Arango told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo after visiting the site to photograph the hillside. The image has also been making the rounds on social media since Saturday. But not everyone was impressed with the 'miracle'. There was some debate on social media whether it was the face of Jesus as one Twitter user Magui, under the handle ‏@AdasOz, said: 'Congratulations to those who can see the face of Jesus in landslide in Putumayo. 'I just see a mountain of earth surrounded by trees.' It certainly is not the first time that Jesus has turned up somewhere unexpected. The face of Christ has appeared on everything from Marmite lids, tacos and naan bread, to tree stumps and laundry. In 2012 the image of Jesus was discovered on a wall by a painter and decorator working on a house in Eldroth, near Austwick, North Yorkshire . Divine sign: The image of Jesus was found on a drainpipe, left, by nurse Alex Cotton in Coventry . In 2012, the son of God was discovered on a wall by a painter and decorator working on a house in Eldroth, near Austwick, North Yorkshire. Sam Dalby discovered the divine countenance on a roughly plastered section of wall. His face has also been spotted in household items and even stains. Nurse Alex Cotton, 38, found an image of Jesus in a drainpipe at her home in Coventry, West Midlands which was dubbed 'the Second plumbing'. Bank worker Toby Elles claimed he was saved by divine intervention when he woke to find a burning frying pan on his cooker. On further inspection of his singed bacon snack he also found the face of the Son of God burnt to the bottom of the pan. My mate: Jesus in the lid of a Marmite jar, left, and in a frying pan containing bacon which was on fire . They both thought it looked like the images of Jesus you see in paintings and on stained glass windows,' she said. In the U.S., Mary Jo Coady, a medical secretary from Massachusetts made a similar discovery burned on her iron while doing housework. The 44-year-old said the image immediately renewed her faith in God. Drinkers at the Tanners Hall pub in Darlington, County Durham, were stunned to see the face of Christ in the foil top of a Bulmers cider bottle. And mother-of-three Claire Allen, 36, found the Saviour's friendly features in the lid of a jar of Marmite which was smeared with the yeast-based spread. She said: 'I opened the Marmite jar and the lid caught my eye. Immediately I thought, that's Jesus. 'It wasn't a new jar, but I'd never noticed that before.' The face of Christ appears in a crumpled sock (left) while the image appears in a burnt on stain on an iron (right) Ms Allen, of Ystrad, Rhondda, South Wales, showed the lid to her older boys Jamie, 14, and Tomas, 11. 'They both thought it looked like the images of Jesus you see in paintings and on stained glass windows,' she said. Sarah Crane, from Orpington, was stunned when she hung her laundry out to dry and discovered the face of Jesus staring back at her from a crumpled sock. Miss Crane was so impressed by the clarity of the face she even built a shrine to the holy image. 'I'd left the washing out to dry overnight - and it had probably been sitting there a bit too long when I noticed the face in the sock,' she said. 'I called my boyfriend over straight away - we could both clearly see the face of Jesus in the sock. There is a straight-on face, and a side profile too - we couldn't believe it. 'We think it's a bit of a sign - but for what we don't know.' An image of  Jesus Christ also appeared on a tree stump in a Belfast cemetery. The tree, which was felled at Belfast City Cemetery in west Belfast, appeared to show the face of a bearded man resembling Jesus on the remaining stump beside a grave. While in Texas, a man found the holy image in the middle of breakfast and the revelation came in his bacon and egg taco. Ernesto Garza, 80, says he was busy munching away when he realised that Christ was staring back at him -- his face visible in the burn marks of the tortilla. It's a blessing from God,' Mr Garza told KTVB news. A Texan found a picture of Jesus in the middle of his breakfast bacon and egg taco which he was hoping to frame and save . Churchgoers in Russia began worshipping at a tree after this image of Jesus appeared in the bark . Mr Garzo was hoping to keep the taco and eventually figure out how to preserve it so he can frame it to hang on his wall. While in Russia, churchgoers have begun worshipping at a tree after claiming that religious icons with the faces of Jesus and the saints appeared on its trunk. The images began to appear on the birch tree in the village of Burmakino in central Russia's Kirov Oblast last month in the places where gardeners had trimmed off old branches. Villager Valentina Naumova explained: 'We thought nothing of it until the tree started to form these arched shapes, just like church icons. 'Then the faces of Jesus and his disciples began to appear in them and we realised this really must be God's work.' Now whole congregations of people gather in front of the tree to pray and give thanks.","Apparition appeared after a landslide in Putumayo, Colombia on Saturday .

"An Alabama official says a state agency has closed an inquiry into whether the deal to publish Harper Lee's upcoming novel involved financial fraud. Some in Lee's hometown of Monroeville questioned whether the 88-year-old To Kill A Mockingbird author was capable of consenting to the second novel's publication. She has only ever released the one novel, in 1960, which was a Pulitzer Prize-winner and resounding literary classic, and has repeatedly refused to release anything anything over the last 50 years. After publisher HaperCollins announced a second book - Go Set A Watchman, which was written before To Kill A Mockingbird but is set 20 years afterward - a longtime friend came forward claiming Lee is mostly deaf, blind and in poor health. Others questioned whether her mental health was sound enough to make such a decision. Scroll down for video . Cleared: Controversy over the mental state of author Harper Lee - which has raged since it was announced last month she would publish a second book more than half-a-century after To Kill A Mockingbird - has been quelled followed an investigation in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama . However Alabama Securities Commission Director Joseph Borg said Thursday his agency reviewed the matter at the Department of Human Resources' request, and that Lee answered questions to an investigator's satisfaction. They have since closed the file. A high-ranking state official said DHR opened its investigation after the second novel's announcement. The status of the DHR investigation was unclear. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The New York Times reported this week that investigators interviewed staff at the Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides, as well as friends and acquaintances. A doctor who asked to remain anonymous said he had filed a complaint after knowing Lee for two years and believing her infirm. Investigator: interviewed staff at the Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides, as well as friends and acquaintances . He said he had been told she was mostly incapable of communication. Such investigations can involve law enforcement if financial exploitation can be shown. One person speaking to the Times anonymously said Lee seemed to understand the investigators and give clear responses. As the investigation continues, people have argued for several different pictures of Lee: funny, depressed, witty, confused, or even varying from day to day. She reportedly had a stroke in 2007 resulting in health and vision problems. 'It’s a call only God or a doctor can make,' attorney Philip Sanchez, who was a pallbearer for older sister Alice's funeral, told the Times. I am more concerned that Nelle is content than the discussion of her cognizance.' Accounts of Lee's mental and physical state have been contradictory over the last few years, but intensified recently after HarperCollins announced her second book, . A friend of Lee, Wayne Flynt, said he visited her recently and found her mentally cogent. But he agreed she had some health issues, telling him 'I'm not so sure anymore,' in response to a congratulations on the new book. Lee has only given statements about the novel through her attorney, Tonja B. Carter. Carter handled the book deal and declined to respond to interview requests. Lee wrote the book, Go Set A Watchman, in the 1950s. It was first submitted to publishers before To Kill A Mockingbird and is considered her earliest work. The manuscript was presumed lost, according to reports, but was found last year. It centers around Mockingbird's protagonist, Scout, returning to Maycomb after 20 years.","Publisher HaperCollins announced new book by Lee, 88, last month .

"A Premier League footballer's son was one of two boys expelled from a leading public school after they allegedly stabbed 15 other pupils with a used needle, causing an HIV scare. The pair, both 14, were dismissed from the school in south England after claims they found a used diabetes pen, which normally tests levels of glucose in the blood, belonging to a pupil before attacking their classmates with it. School authorities alerted the police and public health officials, who recommended that the students be tested for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV, it is claimed. Fifteen pupils at a leading public school have been tested for HIV after they were allegedly stabbed with a needle used by diabetics to test the level of glucose in the blood by two 14-year-old pupils . The father of one of the expelled pupils is a star with one of the country's top football clubs, according toThe Sun. The shocking incident happened last month when the teenagers jabbed their classmates in a prank gone wrong. They used the needle of the diabetes pen, believed to have been left behind by someone with the condition, which is usually used to test levels of glucose in the blood. Teachers immediately called the police and public health officials, with affected students undergoing emergency tests. The police took no further action but the boys were expelled. A spokesman for the school said: 'We can confirm that an incident took place at the school last month involving a diabetic testing pen. 'The incident was extremely concerning and as soon as we became aware of it all parents of pupils involved were contacted immediately and given the advice received from public health experts. 'While the risk of infection was low or negligible, children affected were advised to have blood tests all of which proved negative.'","Two schoolboys jabbed classmates at a top public school with needle .

"With plenty of dogs waiting eagerly to be petted and a warm welcome from staff, the Queen's visit to the Battersea Dogs Home couldn't have got off to a better start. Then David Gandy, the 35-year-old Essex-born model who has been dubbed the world's most handsome man, arrived - and it appeared to get even better. The Queen, smiling broadly, happily shook the model's hand and followed it up with a chat with Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, another high-profile Battersea supporter. Scroll down for video . Nice to meet you: Her Majesty looks delighted as she's introduced to underwear model David Gandy . Her Majesty, who was accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, was at the animal rescue centre to open its new Mary Tealby Kennels. After being welcomed by a 'dog guard of honour', the Queen and the Duke were ushered into the reception where Gandy and a group of other supporters, among them comedian Paul O'Grady, were waiting to meet her. The Queen's encounter with Mr Gandy is the third time a member of the Royal Family has had a brush with the world of showbiz in less than a week. Last Wednesday, the Duchess of Cornwall found herself starring in a snapshot with glamour model Katie Price, taken during a visit to the Cheltenham Festival. It was the Duchess of Cambridge's turn the following day, with the 33-year-old royal pictured happily hobnobbing with the cast of Downton Abbey during a set visit. Lovely chat: The Queen smiled as she was introduced to Amanda Holden in the Battersea reception . Unexpected meeting: The Duchess of Cornwall bumped into Katie Price at Cheltenham last week . Happy hobnobbing: The Duchess of Cambridge with Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery (Lady Mary) Glamorous though Mr Gandy is,  the Queen saved her biggest smile for the homeless dogs - many of whom were enjoying a grooming session in the new kennels when she arrived. One, a corgi named Beama, came within a whisker of being adopted by the world’s most famous Corgi enthusiast. The eleven year old pedigree, who arrived at the renowned animal rescue centre just last week, was introduced to the Queen as she toured the site in south London. At first the gentle and well-behaved pooch put on a suitably regal show. But as the afternoon wore on he did what most dogs would have done, he sighed and appeared to nod off – leaving the dog-loving sovereign looking on with affectionate bemusement. Asked by Battersea ambassador, actress Amanda Holden, whether she was tempted to take the Corgi home with her, the Queen was suitably diplomatic. ‘Maybe,’ she said. Miss Holden then asked the Queen’s husband, Prince Philip, the same question. Almost! Beama the corgi was almost adopted by the pet-loving monarch . Adorable: The Queen couldn't resist stopping to pet members of her doggy guard of honour . ‘What Corgi?’ the bemused royal asked, before turning to  Gandy and asking, 'Have you got a Corgi?’ ‘No, Sir, but I am tempted,’ the underwear model replied. The Queen once owned a huge pack of the pampered animals – a breed she has loved since she was a girl - but given her advancing years has slowly been allowing the number she owns to dwindle. Currently she owns two Corgis, Willow and Holly, and two Dorgis, Candy and Vulcan. Although she has long been associated with pedigree breeds, the Queen appeared delighted by the group of waifs and strays that greeted her today as she arrived at the home. The sovereign was visiting the iconic rescue centre in her role as its royal patron, a position she has held for almost 60 years. Waiting to greet her, appropriately, was a ‘guard of honour’ comprised of a dozen of the 9,000 dogs (and, now, cats) that pass through its doors each year. After passing through the canine guard, the Queen and her husband Prince Philip, were greet by the home’s Chief Executive, Claire Horton, Chairman Heather Love and her cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, who is Battersea’s President. The royal party then proceeded to the new Mary Tealby Kennels, named after Battersea's Founder, which will provide accommodation for 56 animals. Enjoying the visit: Both the Queen and Prince Philip looked thrilled to be at Battersea . Keeping an eye on things: The Queen watches exercise classes (left) and heads to the reception (right) The kennels have been designed to make the often stressful experience of being brought to the home as comfortable and easy all as possible. All of the kennels have in built speakers so soothing music can be played to the animals, some of Battersea’s most vulnerable and anxious dogs. The Queen viewed the new facilities, meeting both staff and dogs, including an adorable mongrel puppy called Harry, who was found wandering the streets last week, and a three-year-old greyhound, Harvey. Prince Philip was taken aback by the facilities on offer, which also boast underfloor heating. ‘They have inside and outside areas and beds? Wonderful,’ he said. They were also taken to see the exercise paddocks where more dogs were undertaking training and exercise, before unveiling a plaque to mark the opening of the new kennels. It was in the exercise area that the sovereign was introduced to Beama by television presenter Paul O’Grady, who outlined his sad story. The Corgi was actually rehomed by Battersea as a puppy eleven years ago and proved to be a wonderful family dog, playing with his owners’ children and grandchildren. Sadly, however, the elderly couple have moved to a retirement village where they are not permitted to keep animals, which means Beama has found his way to Battersea again. ‘He’s a beautiful dog and if I didn’t have five already myself I would be tempted to take him,' said Mr O'Grady. Grand opening: The Queen unveils a plaque after officially opening the Mary Tealby Kennels . On her way: Her Majesty makes her exit after touring the Battersea Dogs Home in London . 'He has the most lovely temperament. She seemed fascinated by him but wasn’t in the market, unfortunately. But now he has met Her Majesty at least we can say he is by Royal Appointment.’ Before they left the royal couple were given bags packed with treats such as collars and toys for their own dogs. Prince Philip appeared tickled pink, joking: ‘Gives new meaning to the phrase doggy bag!’ Afterwards Amanda Holden said she had been thrilled to see the Queen offer her support to the home. ‘I was always a huge fan before I took on the ambassador’s role. We already have one dog but I have told my daughters we may well get another one in the autumn. We will see how things go,’ she said. Battersea Dogs & Cats Home was established in 1860 by Mrs Mary Tealby who was concerned by the number of stray animals roaming the streets of London. Then known as 'The Temporary Home for Lost and Starving Dogs', it was originally based in north London before being moved to Battersea in 1871. Since then, Battersea has rescued, reunited or rehomed more than 3.1 million dogs and cats and currently cares for around 9000 animals a year. The Queen is, of course, most famously associated with the Corgi. The breed was introduced to the Royal Family by her father, King George VI, in 1933 when he bought a Corgi called Dookie from a local kennels. The animal proved popular with his daughters and was described as ‘unquestionably the character of the Princesses’ delightful canine family’ and ‘a born sentimentalist’. A second Corgi was acquired called Jane who had puppies, two of which, Crackers and Carol, were kept. For her eighteenth birthday, The Queen was given a Corgi named Susan from whom numerous successive dogs were bred. Some Corgis were mated with dachshunds (most notably Pipkin, who belonged to Princess Margaret) to create ‘Dorgis’. At present, The Queen owns two Corgis: Willow and Holly and two Dorgis: Candy and Vulcan. The Queen’s corgis travel with her to the various residences, with Her Majesty looking after them herself as much as possible given her busy schedule. Over the years, the Royal Family seem to have embraced dogs as their favoured pets. Formal portraits from the 17th century onwards show kings, queens and their children happily posing with their beloved animals, from pugs to greyhounds, King Charles Spaniels to Corgis. Some pets have even merited their own portraits, and, as in many households, were considered very much members of the family. When Queen Victoria’s beloved Collie, Noble, died at Balmoral in 1887, he was buried in the grounds of the castle and given his own gravestone, which read: . 'Noble by name by nature noble too . Faithful companion sympathetic true . His remains are interred here' A terrier named Caesar belonging to King Edward VII was given even greater status when, having outlived the king, he walked behind His Majesty’s coffin in the funeral procession. The Duchess of Cornwall owns two Jack Russell terriers, Beth and Bluebell and, who both came from Battersea Dogs and Cats home.","The Queen was introduced to David Gandy at the Battersea Dog's Home .

"A former Miss England beauty queen who was born following IVF treatment has waded into the row against Dolce & Gabbana. Model Charlotte Holmes, 26, from Plymouth, was crowned with the national title in 2012 but has hit back after the designers labelled babies born as a result of IVF as 'synthetic'. The row was sparked after comments were made in Italian magazine Panorama about the use of IVF treatments. Angry: Former Miss England, whose parents underwent IVF to have her, says fertility treatment should be celebrated and calls for Dolce and Gabana to apologise . But the Devon model has added her voice to stars including Elton John who have been angered by the comments. 'According to Dolce and Gabbana I'm a synthetic human - ironic for a company who charge £1,500 for a nylon jacket,' she said. 'I hope it was blown out of proportion and they will apologise. They were a couple for years; they would have been depriving themselves of a family.' IVF treatment allows people who are unable to conceive in the traditional manner the chance of parenthood. Specialist in IVF technology Lord Winston helped Charlotte's parents conceive, and she feels strongly passionate about his work. She said: 'I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Professor Winston. Elton John and David Furnish with their two sons (left) and the designers Stefano Gabbana (left) with Domenico Dolce . 'To me and my family IVF is of the utmost importance. It is wrong for high-profile celebrities to make comments like this when it is crucial for families who can't have children. 'It's rare to get such negative comments too. Traditional family is obviously great if it works, but IVF is great for families who can't conceive . 'That's just the bottom line.These treatments are available to us and we should be celebrating it. ""We should be developing it to make it more successful and available to other people. 'They were never a company I've shopped with before, so this is more like a continuous boycott, as I will continue to not shop there.' Charlotte won the coveted Miss England crown in 2012 . However, Italian fashion designers Dolce and Gabbana have insisted they 'respect all the world' after their controversial remarks on fertility treatments infuriated Sir Elton John. The pop star called for a boycott of the famous brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised in-vitro fertilization (IVF), which sparked outrage on social media. But Dolce has now insisted his views were private, personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional Sicilian family. In an interview with CNN, Dolce insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure, and said: 'I believe in the traditional family. 'It is impossible to change my culture for something different. It's me... I respect all the world, all the culture.' Good looks have helped Charlotte make succeed as a model . The fashion designer had previously said: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that.

That sparked a furious reaction from John, who has two children with husband David Furnish through IVF, who fired back: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as ""synthetic"".

"Border officials refused a Canadian woman the right to stay in the UK claiming she doesn't have a 'genuine relationship' with her British husband - despite them having been married for 45 years. David Summers, 70, and his wife Maria, 66, have been happily married since 1970, and have a 42-year-old son, Derick, who holds a British passport. The couple lived in Ontario, Canada, until September 2013, when they moved back to the UK to care for Mr Summers's sick mother. But border officials have now refused retired optician Mrs Summers's application for a permanent UK visa because they don't believe the pensioners have a real 'affectionate relationship'. Border officials have questioned David and Maria Summers' relationship and denied her a visa - despite them having been happily married for 45 years. Pictured, right: The couple on their wedding day in 1970 . The decision was appealed and it is currently being considered by the UK Border Agency, who have told the couple that no final ruling will be made until the end of May. The couple, who own a house in Hereford, are meanwhile desperately trying to prove  that their marriage is genuine for fear Mrs Summers could be permanently excluded from the UK when her temporary tourist visa expires. Mrs Summers said: 'It's ridiculous, we are quite willing to give the border people what they want but they are adamant. I don't know what they want us to prove. 'Anyone who has ever spoken to us can clearly see that we are best friends and have been since the day we met. 'We've got almost half a century's worth of birthday cards, 45 years of holiday snaps from all ove the world. 'We've got pictures of us with our son just after he was born, growing up, right up to his wedding day. If they'd asked us to send us all of those photos, we could have done.' Mr Summers, a retired retailer and published author, added: 'Why pick on us? We've been married for 45 years and we are completely devoted to one another, what do they want us to do? 'We could show them pictures, e-mails, texts, everything from our marriage, but they have not asked us for anything. They are doing this based on no evidence at all.' The couple say they have five decades' worth of pictures to prove their long-running marriage is genuine - but were not asked to provide any evidence when applying for the visa . Mr Summers said: 'We love each other very much, it's  hurtful for them to suggest our marriage is not real' Mr Summers added: 'They haven't even given us a chance to prove that our marriage is real. We've got a marriage certificate and a son, what more do they want? 'We love each other very much, it's really hurtful for them to suggest that our marriage is not real.' Mrs Summers's application for a permanent UK visa was rejected by British authorities, with a letter citing the reason for rejection stating: 'You have not provided any evidence that your relationship is still subsisting. 'It is reasonable to expect that in a genuine subsisting, supportive and affectionate relationship, there would be evidence of regular contact, signs of companionship, emotional support, affection, and abiding interest in each other's welfare and well-being throughout the entire duration of your relationship....I am therefore not satisfied that your relationship is not genuine.' The pair met at a dance in Kingston, Ontario in 1966 while Mr Summers was in the country working in retail and soon fell in love. Mr and Mrs Summers lived in Canada after they married in 1970. They want to move to the house they own in Hereford so they can look after Mr Summers's mother . They say the decision has been made all the more extraordinary by the fact that they have grown-up son . They married in 1970 and lived in Kingston until 1981, when they moved to Ottawa. The couple made frequent visits back to the UK and bought their house in Hereford in 1995 for Mr Summers's elderly mother Doris Murray to live in. They made the trip back in September 2013 and intended to retire in Hereford and care for Doris, who had fallen ill. David said: 'We filled in a load of forms when we had Derick which meant we could come back and forth as much as we wanted, but for us to retire here permanently, we found out Maria needed to have this pemanent visa. 'If Maria's second visa application fails, we would have no choice but to move back to Canada. 'We would have to sell our home and move my mother into a care home. We have family here but they cannot look after her. 'I find it utterly extraordinary, I can't really contemplate life without my wife.' The Home Office, which runs the UK Border Agency, has yet to comment on the case. Mrs Summers now has to wait until May for her appeal to be finalised, but she fears she and her husband may have to move back to Canada if she is not allowed to stay .","Couple married in 1970 after British man went to work in Canada .

"Four A&E consultants who quit their hospital have today revealed they resigned after becoming 'battle weary and exhausted' from years of fighting against budget cuts. The entire A&E team at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, walked out on February 13 amid alleged rows with the management. On the same day a consultant at nearby Worcestershire Royal Hospital also resigned. In a damning open letter to the trust, four of the consultants branded the NHS trust a 'disgrace' and claimed they had been put under 'unbearable stress'. The 1,700 word letter, signed by Richard Morrell, Sarah Crawford, Christopher Hetherington and David Gemmell, said: 'The trust appears to tolerate massive overcrowding in the county's A&E departments. Four A&E consultants who resigned from the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch last month, have written an open letter to the trust branding it a 'disgrace' and claiming they were put under 'unbearable pressure' 'This is a disgrace and a patient safety issue which causes serious harm to many patients and intolerable stress on all A&E staff. 'The situation has taken a heavy toll on our personal and family lives - the stress has been unbearable at times. 'We are battle-weary and exhausted by the continuous pressure that we have been under. 'We can no longer see a way forward to secure safe and sustainable A&E services at the Alexandra Hospital especially whilst the current senior management and senior clinical leadership remains in place.' The consultants also say they invested years of work into maintaining patient care but felt decisions made by the trust's management had 'undermined' services at the hospital. 'These in turn have led to the self-fulfilling prophecy of failing and unsustainable services,' they said. They added that they feared resources were 'heavily weighted' in favour of people in Worcester at the expense of patients in nearby Redditch who use the Alexandra Hospital. They also said they had raised concerns several times but believed they had not been listened to and felt they had no choice but to resign. The letter is not signed by the fifth consultant, who worked at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital. The NHS Trust has published a 720-word response in which it said they were 'disappointed' the consultants had not recognised the pressure the trust was under. A statement read: 'We are disappointed that our ED colleagues have not acknowledged the serious challenges to NHS services in this area that drove the need to review and reconfigure key medical services – changes that are essential to improve patient care across the entire county and beyond.' On the same day a consultant at nearby Worcestershire Royal Hospital also resigned. The Trust said it is disappointed the doctors did not recognise the pressure the NHS services in the area were under . It added: 'Unfortunately, recruitment efforts for years have failed to improve the shortfall of medical staff at the Alexandra Hospital, and this is predicted to cause potential risks for patients in the future. 'This means that some clinical departments need to be reorganised. Such decisions are never taken lightly. 'Change, even when essential for patient care, can be difficult and inconvenient for staff, but facts need to be faced and will not be altered if we fail to confront them. 'It would be better if the consultants had stayed to work with the trust to support the development of emergency services for the whole county.' The consultants' letter praised the team they worked with in the emergency department at the Alexandra Hospital. 'We have built a unit which is recognised for good patient care and excellent training,' they said. 'We have had the pleasure of encouraging a passion for Emergency Medicine in many trainees over the years who are now consultants all over the country. 'We would like to thank all of our A&E staff who have given us their unfailing support and loyalty over the years and helped us to build a quality service. 'All of them should be justly proud of their achievements which we and the patients have benefited from. 'We would also like to thank the many trainees, staff and patients who have made such kind comments over the last few difficult days - we have all been greatly moved.' The Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust told MailOnline it is in discussions with a number of potential partners to replace the A&E team. Penny Venables, the Trust's chief executive said: 'We are disappointed that a number of our Emergency Department consultants have decided to leave us in order to work for another NHS Trust. 'But we are making strenuous efforts to ensure they are replaced and we are doing everything we can to ensure we maintain a continuous, high quality service for local patients. 'We have received offers of support from a number of individual A&E consultants and from neighbouring Trusts and we are now in discussions with various people as we seek to ensure continuity of service.' A trust spokeswoman said it has taken the decision to publish in full on the website, both the consultants' letter and the response from senior colleagues. She said recent discussion on social media suggested 'quite wrongly' that the consultants had been 'gagged'. 'In order to demonstrate that this wasn't the case the Trust has decided to publish their letter,' she said. The Trust has commissioned the Good Governance Institute to lead an independent review to investigate allegations around bullying and harassment. Ms Venables said: 'We take any and all such allegations very seriously. This is why we asked the NHS Trust Development Authority to commission a completely independent review.'","Four consultants at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch resigned last month .

"Oscar-winning actor and director Ben Affleck testified before the U.S. Senate on Thursday about the continuing importance of foreign aid to developing nations. Affleck, founder of the nonprofit Eastern Congo Initiative, was joined by Bill Gates, as the pair addressed members of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs. The committee was meeting to discuss the $50 billion budget spent on non-lethal aid to Africa. It is money is currently under attack as some senators want to shift as much as half of it to the Pentagon's budget. Scroll down for video . That's my girl: Affleck kept a tight hold of Violet's hand as they left the crowded hearing room . Passionate: The Gone Girl star was animated as he spoke about how his organization is helping to rebuild the coffee industry in eastern Congo that was destroyed during two decades of war in the region . I'm proud of you: Violet Affleck, 9, gives her dad Ben a big pat on the back after listening to him testify before a U.S. Senate Committee and urge them not to cut foreign aid to Africa . Father-of-three Affleck, 42, founded the Eastern Congo Initiative in 2010 after making several trips to the Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa and learning about the humanitarian crisis afflicting that war-ravaged region. The nonprofit seeks to raise awareness and funding for local community-based groups that seek to support survivors of rape and sexual violence, return and reintegrate boy soldiers into their home communities, provide access to health care and education and foster economic opportunity. Affleck spoke about the resurgence of the coffee industry in eastern Congo which had been destroyed during 20 years of war. He said that Starbucks had agreed to purchase the entire first harvest of coffee beans - about 40 tones - produced by a cooperative supported by his nonpropfit organization. 'That's not a lot for Starbucks but it's a heckuva lot for the cooperative,' he said. 'This is good business.' Farmer incomes have more than tripled, he said, and transformed lives in the eastern region of the embattled nation. Iconic moment: When Hollywood comes to Washington, D.C., it always causes a commotion in the hallowed halls of power . Philanthropist: The Oscar winning actor and director founded the Eastern Congo Initiative in 2010 to help communities in the war-ravaged Central African region start to rebuild their lives and their economy . Pulling the American aid would be totally counterproductive, he warned, and revive 'a history of mistrust and disappointment' among Africans when it comes to promises made by America and other nations. Gates, the Microsoft founder and co-chairman of the world's largest private foundation, was seated next to Affleck and also testified about the importance of foreign aid. Affleck's actress wife, Jennifer Garner, and eldest daughter Violet, 9, were seated in the audience. In an Instagram post earlier on Thursday, Affleck posted a photo of himself sitting on the ground talking with former boy soldiers. 'I made my first trip to Congo seven years ago after reading about the two decades of conflict the Congolese people had endured,' he wrote. 'I expected to find hopelessness, but the people I encountered, like these former child soldiers, were among the most courageous and resilient I could imagine.' Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and their daughter Violet leave after Thursday's hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington . Influencers: Affleck was joined at the senate hearing by Microsoft founder and the world's richest man Bill Gates. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation seeks to reduce Africa's reliance on food imports within 15 years . Show of support: At one point during the hearing, Garner reached out an arm and placed it on her husband's back as a gesture of encouragement and support as he talked about what his nonprofit is doing in Africa . Despite the serious nature of the hearing, Affleck did manage to inject a little lighthearted humor into the proceedings and even got in a plug for his new movie Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. At the start of his testimony, the superhero star first acknowledged the Democratic Senator from Vermont, Patrick Leahy. Leahy, 76, is a life-long Batman fan who has had cameos in Batman And Robin, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. 'I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge my costar in Batman,' Affleck said. 'The role is marginally smaller than mine, but I understand that you are quite good.' The comment suggests that the senator will be making an appearance in Affleck's new film set for a 2016 release. Is this a bat cave? Affleck, who plays the Caped Crusader in the upcoming Batman V Superman movie, met with Sen. Patrick Leahy, a life-long Batman fan who appears to have had a cameo in the film due out in 2016 . Serious business: Affleck put his jokey nature to one side as he passionately argued that billions of dollars of U.S. aid to Africa is making a real difference in helping rural communities escape hunger and poverty . Affleck was joined by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates for the hearing and both men urged the panel of Senators not to cut aid to Africa. They both argued that U.S. foreign aid to Africa, which currently stands at more than $50 billion, is having a positive impact on the country and helping to make a real difference for those living in poverty and at risk of starvation. Gates, the world's richest man, is the co-founder with his wife of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and one of the foundation's goals is to end African dependence on food imports within 15 years. He said that U.S. aid is helping to improve agricultural productivity in poor rural areas which in turn is reducing the levels of hunger and poverty in those communities. A family affair: The Hollywood star obviously has the full support of his wife and children in his efforts to make life better for those less fortunate in war-torn and poverty-stricken African countries . All grown up: Affleck's eldest daughter wore a smart navy blue dress for the big occasion and actress Jennifer Garner positively beamed with delight as she watched her daughter and husband on Capitol Hill . Actress Jennifer Garner with daughter Violet leave a senate hearing room after listening to her husband speak during a Senate Appropriations' subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs .

"Seattle's city employees will not be allowed to travel to Indiana for work purposes via city funding, the office of Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said Saturday. The news comes in the wake of  law S.B. 101, or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, going through in Indiana. In a release, Murray said 'Seattle has been a leader in the fight to protect civil rights and ensure equality for all people – no matter who you are, or who you love. This is why I am ordering that none of our taxpayer dollars should go toward supporting this discriminatory law.' Scroll down for video . Issues: Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, left, plans to sign an executive order that 'will ban City employees from work-related and city-funded travel to the State of Indiana.' Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, right, defended the new state law on Sunday, and said it wasn't a mistake to have enacted it . The release said 'To formalize the Mayor's decision, he will be issuing an executive order next week. The order will ban City employees from work-related and city-funded travel to the State of Indiana.' Last week, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee also called SB 101 'discriminatory' in a Thursday statement. He said 'We stand united as San Franciscans to condemn Indiana's new discriminatory law, and will work together to protect the civil rights of all Americans including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. 'Effective immediately, I am directing City Departments under my authority to bar any publicly-funded City employee travel to the State of Indiana that is not absolutely essential to public health and safety.' Indiana Gov. Mike Pence defended the new state law that's garnered widespread criticism over concerns it could foster discrimination on Sunday, and said it wasn't a mistake to have enacted it. Pence appeared on ABC's 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos' to discuss the measure he signed last week prohibiting state laws that 'substantially burden"" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. The definition of 'person' includes religious institutions, businesses and associations. Since the Republican governor signed the bill into law Thursday, Indiana has been widely criticized by businesses and organizations around the nation, as well as on social media with the hashtag (hash)boycottindiana. Already, consumer review service Angie's List has said it will suspend a planned expansion in Indianapolis because of the new law. Outrage: Since the Republican governor signed the bill into law Thursday, Indiana has been widely criticized by businesses and organizations around the nation . Changes: Already, consumer review service Angie's List has said it will suspend a planned expansion in Indianapolis because of the new law . Pence did not answer directly when asked at least six times whether under the law it would be legal for a merchant to refuse to serve gay customers. 'This is not about discrimination, this is about empowering people to confront government overreach,' he said. Asked again, he said, 'Look, the issue here is still is tolerance a two-way street or not.' Pence told the Indianapolis Star on Saturday that he was in discussions with legislative leaders over the weekend and expects a clarification bill to be introduced in the coming week. He addressed that Sunday, saying, 'if the General Assembly ... sends me a bill that adds a section that reiterates and amplifies and clarifies what the law really is and what it has been for the last 20 years, then I'm open to that.' But Pence was adamant that the measure, slated to take effect in July, will stick. 'We're not going to change this law,' Pence said. Some national gay-rights groups say it's a way for lawmakers in Indiana and several others states where such bills have been proposed this year to essentially grant a state-sanctioned waiver for discrimination as the nation's highest court prepares to mull the gay marriage question. Supporters of the law, including Pence, contend discrimination claims are overblown and insist it will keep the government from compelling people to provide services they find objectionable on religious grounds. They also maintain courts haven't allowed discrimination under similar laws covering the federal government and 19 other states. Arkansas is poised to follow in Indiana's footsteps, with a final vote expected next week in the House on legislation that Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson has said he'll sign. Josh Earnest, President Barack Obama's spokesman, appeared on 'This Week' just after Pence, and said the debate isn't a political argument. Thousands of opponents of Indiana Senate Bill 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are seen Saturday on the lawn of the Indiana State House . 'If you have to go back two decades to try to justify what you're doing today, it may raise questions,' Earnest said, referring to the 1993 federal law Pence brought up. He added that Pence 'is in damage-control mode this morning and he's got some damage to fix.' State Rep. Ed DeLaney, an Indianapolis Democrat, told a large, boisterous crowd Saturday gathered outside of the Statehouse to protest that the law creates 'a road map, a path to discrimination.' Rally attendees chanted 'Pence must go!' several times and held signs that read 'No hate in our state.' Pence addressed the critics Sunday, saying: 'This avalanche of intolerance that's been poured on our state is just outrageous.' Asked if he would be willing to add sexual orientation to the list of characteristics against which discrimination is illegal, he said, 'I will not push for that. That's not on my agenda, and that's not been an objective of the people of the state of Indiana.' U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, released a video statement on his Facebook page Saturday, saying: 'We'll work together to reverse SB101 and we'll stand together to make sure that here in Indiana, we welcome everyone, every day.' Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a Republican who opposed the law, has said he and other city officials will talk with businesses and convention planners to counter the uproar. Angie's List had sought an $18.5 million incentive package from Indianapolis' City-County Council to add 1,000 jobs over five years. But founder and CEO Bill Oseterle said in a statement Saturday that the expansion was on hold 'until we fully understand the implications of the freedom restoration act on our employees.' The Indianapolis-based NCAA has expressed concerns about the law and has suggested it could move future events elsewhere; the men's Final Four will be held in the city next weekend.","Seattle's city employees will not be allowed to travel to Indiana for work purposes via city funding, the office of Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said .

"Carol Kirkwood, pictured at the Television and Radio Industries Club awards where she was crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time, has been getting explicit pictures in the post . She has just been crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time – so there is no doubt Carol Kirkwood is a hit with viewers. But the 52-year-old BBC Breakfast presenter has revealed some male fans are more than a little enthusiastic and send her explicit pictures in the post. ‘I do get letters from older men, fan mail,’ she said, gesturing to her nether regions. ‘It is terrible. I have had so many over the years. I am almost immune to it. You can tell by the hand writing. ‘I don’t have anyone who checks our mail as it all comes into the office. I don’t count them.’ Her smiley demeanour and shapely figure, which she often dresses in figure-hugging outfits, have attracted an army of admirers. On Tuesday she was given the Weather Reporter gong at the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Awards for the seventh time, beating off ITV rival Laura Tobin and the BBC’s Tomasz Schafernaker. Speaking at the awards ceremony, the presenter – who also does weather reports for The One Show – said she also receives sordid messages online. ‘You get a lot on social media. If they are on Twitter you block them,’ she said. She explained any explicit pictures sent to the office are quickly ‘binned’. The weather presenter is divorced from Jimmy Kirkwood, her husband of 25 years. But her new partner, whose identity is unknown, takes her legions of male admirers in his stride. She said: ‘My boyfriend is used to it. He just thinks it is funny. He does not take it seriously which is probably just as well.’ The broadcaster herself has taken a light-hearted approach to live TV slip-ups. Last year she battled on despite accidently ‘clicking her clicker’ twice, revealing scorching temperatures of 99 degrees in a place identified as ‘Town name’. Speaking about her live gaffes, Mrs Kirkwood explained: ‘We can’t see the weather map behind us. Sometimes the map and town doesn’t pop up behind me and that has happened numerous times. You just have to get on with it.’ The glamorous weather presenter said she receives fan mail from enthusiastic older men who would send the explicit pictures in the post . And is seems some viewers have very high expectations of her capabilities. ‘People do blame me for bad weather, definitely,’ she revealed. ‘And also people’s expectations are high. People wanted to see snow this year. Some parts saw snow but by no means everywhere.’ She believes women of her age have a lot to bring to the profession. ‘More and more we are seeing women my kind of age and possibly older coming through the ranks to present the weather. It is good as we offer a load of experience,’ she said.

She revealed: ‘Bill Turnbull has tried to do it but he is more like a ballerina. When you present the weather it is like tapping your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time.

"George Osborne's taunts have hit a nerve in Paris, after the Chancellor boasted that Britain's booming economy was storming ahead of France. Senior Tories have repeatedly contrasted the UK's strong recovery with the sluggish growth and high unemployment on the other side of the Channel where socialist Francois Hollande has floundered. Now French minister Segolene Royal has hit back at the 'spiteful and inappropriate' attacks, and warning: 'What goes around comes around.' French minister Segolene Royal (left) has hit back after George Osborne repeatedly contrasted the UK's strong recovery with the sluggish growth and high unemployment on the other side of the Channel . In his Budget statement last week, Mr Osborne made several references to Britain's strong growth compared to France. He mocked the high rate of French unemployment, quipping that one English county - Yorkshire - had created more jobs than the whole of France. He pointed to forecasts suggesting the British economy grew by 2.6 per cent last year, '50 per cent faster than Germany, three times faster than the euro-zone – and seven times faster than France'. He and the Prime Minister also pointed to the UK's nearest continental neighbour as a lesson of why Labour - whose leader closely associated himself with the approach of Socialist Party president Francois Hollande - would be bad for Britain. He and the Prime Minister also pointed directly to the UK's nearest continental neighbour as a lesson of why Labour - whose leader Ed Miliband closely associated himself with the approach of Socialist Party president Francois Hollande - would be bad for Britain. 'Our economy is growing seven times faster than France's,' Mr Cameron wrote in the Sunday Times. 'Imagine if Miliband had been free to pursue his French dream: the fallout would be felt in catastrophic job losses, falling living standards, eye-watering debt and fast-diminishing hope in our future.' The UK economy has enjoyed much stronger growth than France since the crash in 2008, according to Eurostat . Unemployment has also fallen more sharply in the UK than on the other side of the Channel where more than 10 per cent were out of work in 2014 . Asked about the attacks, Ms Royal told BBC2's Newsnight: 'I am very surprised by what I consider to be something which seems so far removed from the traditional British sense of fair play. 'It is rather condescending. It seems a little spiteful and inappropriate.' European countries 'should all stand together when any country is in difficulty', she said. 'When a country like the UK is facing difficulty, we don't make fun. In your country your budget deficit is much greater than it is in France, we don't have take pleasure from it. 'In the end, what goes around comes around.' Ms Royal is the ex-partner of Mr Hollande. The pair, who have four children together, never married, reportedly because they considered it 'too bourgeois'. The French economy has struggled since the financial crisis as it struggles to reform its bloated public sector . Ms Royal has four children with French President Francois Hollande, who has had a string of relationships since they split in 2007 . London Mayor Boris Johnson added to the row today, by again taunting the French over their economy . But London Mayor Boris Johnson added to the row today, by again taunting the French. In an appearance on LBC Radio, he claimed talented people are fleeing 'crazed socialist' France as part of an attack he launched on Labour leader Ed Miliband. The mayor said: '(Labour) have an overt admiration for the way things are done in France, where they have unemployment now running at around 12 per cent. 'You've got huge numbers of talented French people fleeing France at the moment because it's a crazed socialist, 1970s version of a European economy.'","Senior Tories say the state of France's economy justifies their policies .

"The brothers suspected of bombing the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April of 2013 in Massachusetts visited a New Hampshire gun range about a month before the attack. There is surveillance video of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev visiting a gun range in Manchester on March 20, 2013. Dzhokhar is on trial for killing four people and bombing the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Scroll down for video . A video shows Dzhokhar (right) and Tamerlan (left) Tsarnaev visiting a New Hampshire gun range in 2013 . The brothers shot 9mm pistols for about an hour during their visit to the Manchester Gun Range on March 20 . Surveillance video captured Dzhokhar and Tamerlan driving and parking up at the range . The scene: Witnesses at the trial recalled the 'ferocity' of the shootout between police and Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the court was shown pictures of bullet casings and evidence strewn across the street . The video was shown on Tuesday at his trial in federal court in Boston. In the video, the brothers can be seen at the Manchester Gun Range. According to documentation that was presented during the trial, the brothers shot 9mm pistols for about an hour, Boston.com reported. The brothers rented a Glock 17 and Glock 34 and bought four boxes of  ammunition from the range. The guns were similar to the Luger pistol (pictured) that was used to murder MIT Police Officer Sean Collier . Bullets for a Luger handgun were found on the Watertown street where the Tsarnaevs got in a shootout . Dzhokhar, now 21, paid the entire $170.75 bill himself, according to a receipt. Both brothers wrote they had an 'intermediate' level of experience with pistols and they were not suffering mental illness or users of illegal drugs, WMUR reported. In the footage, Dzhokhar appears to be wearing the same black Adidas sweatshirt he was captured in on April 19, 2013 in Watertown, Massachusetts. The guns were similar to the Luger pistol used to murder MIT Police Officer Sean Collier and engage in a shootout with Watertown police. Blood is seen in a police car, located on the street where Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev engaged in a gunfight with police, and evidence presented to the court shows how bullets were fired at the vehicle . Police officer stand on the street and lay markers as they collect evidence for the investigation . Evidence markers laid out on the street of the gun fight . The aftermath of the shootout, where Tamerlan was killed, saw empty packets of bullets left on the street and casings on the ground . Tamerlan  died in the shootout after being shot multiple times and run over by his brother. A Massachusetts State Police ballistics expert, Lt. David Cahill, testified 56 bullets were fired from the Luger handgun during the confrontation in Watertown. Dzhokhar's lawyers claim Tamerlan shot Collier and used the gun during the shootout. In addition to Collier, the brothers are accused of killing restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard. If found guilty, Dzhokhar faces life in prison without the possibility of parole. He could also be executed as he is being prosecuted under the federal death penalty statute. If he is found guilty, Dzhokhar, 21, is facing life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty . Evidence shown to the court shows how bullets from the firefight hit the side of the house and damage property inside .","Tsarnaev brothers were at a gun range in Manchester, New Hampshire .

"This is the dramatic moment rescuers freed an 18-month-old baby girl who was left dangling upside down next to her dead mother for a staggering 14 hours after their car plunged into a frigid river. The newly-released footage, filmed on an officer's body camera, shows emergency crews battling to rescue Lily Groesbeck from her mother Lynn's Dodge sedan at a  river in Spanish Fork, Utah. First responders are captured running toward the overturned vehicle, before straining to turn it on its side. One can be heard yelling, 'Let's go guys, come on!' as they struggle to lift the heavy sedan. Seconds later, the officers successfully lift the partially-submerged car out of the water and discover Lily hanging upside down in her car seat. The infant was unconscious, but miraculously alive. The brave officers said that as they approached the car they could clearly hear a woman's voice coming from the car shouting for help, but in the bodycam video, parts of the audio are silent. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking scene: A dramatic new video, filmed on an officer's body camera, shows emergency crews battling to rescue 18-month-old Lily Groesbeck from her mother Lynn's Dodge sedan at a river in Spanish Fork, Utah . Partially submerged: First responders are captured dashing over to the overturned red vehicle (pictured) Struggle: The officers strain as they try to turn the heavy sedan on its side (above). One can be heard yelling, 'Let's go guys, come on!' However, seconds later, the officers successfully lift the vehicle out of the icy water . Life-saving rescue: The first responders were shocked to discover Lily hanging upside down in her car seat. They quickly freed the infant from the seat, before passing her cold body from one person to another (above) Tragic: Following the rescue, Lily (pictured, right, this week), was rushed in a critical condition to hospital. She has since been released. Tragically, her mother, Lynn Groesbeck (left, with Lily), aged 25, died at the scene . During the rescue the men are filmed quickly freeing Lily from the car seat, before passing her cold body from one person to another. Once on the shore, the baby was lifted into an ambulance and given CPR. The video, which was released by Spanish Fork Police Department and obtained by NBC, shows several concerned bystanders watching the scene from the top of the river bank last Saturday. Following the rescue, Lily, whose face was apparently just inches away from the icy water, was rushed in a critical condition to Mountain View Hospital, where she was treated for hypothermia. She was later flown to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, from which she was released on Wednesday. Three police officers and four firefighters were also treated for hypothermia. Tragically, Ms Groesbeck,  who is not depicted in the video, was pronounced dead at the scene. The 25-year-old mother and her daughter were driving home to Springville, a suburb of Provo, at around 10.30pm on the fateful day when their red-colored sedan crashed into the frigid river below. Unconscious: The video, which was released by Spanish Fork Police Department, shows several concerned bystanders watching the scene from the top of the river bank last Saturday. Above, Lily is lifted out the car . Speedy: Ms Groesbeck and her daughter (pictured being passed between first responders) were driving home to Springville, a suburb of Provo, at around 10.30pm  when their sedan crashed into the frigid river below . Heroes: First responders are seen dashing across the rocky terrain next to the river with Lily in their arms . Transfer: The officer's body camera captures the waiting ambulance that the 18-month-old girl is lifted into . On Wednesday, police said the car had apparently struck a cement barrier on the bridge above the river before plunging into the water. However, they said the cause of the crash remains unclear. Ms Groesbeck's partially-submerged car was discovered by a fisherman, who subsequently alerted the authorities shortly after noon on Saturday. The sedan was resting face-down in the water. According to the Deseret News, the angler called a non-emergency line and said: 'Are you guys aware there's a car in the river on the south end of Spanish Fork, Main Street, over the bridge? 'I didn't see anybody when I came in here and I can't see in the car.' Only four minutes later, the same caller dialed 911 directly and said: 'There's a car in the river. It's upside down off of Main Street and there is a person inside. I can see a hand.' A paramedic is seen laying Lily down on a table in the ambulance, before performing CPR on her cold body . Family: Earlier this week, Lily's father, Deven Trafny (center with Ms Groesback, left, and Lily, before the tragic accident, which occurred last week), revealed his daughter's incredible progress in a video taken in hospital . A mystery voice: Emergency responders have said they  heard desperate pleas from Ms Groesbeck inside the Dodge sedan when they approached the car (pictured after the rescue), even though she likely died on impact . Recovery: Officer Tyler Beddoes, who was involved in the rescue, said: 'For two nights I've laid awake trying to figure out exactly what it could be. All I know is it was there, we all heard it. It was extra motivation' Earlier this week, emergency responders said they had heard desperate pleas from Ms Groesbeck inside the car when they approached the car, even though she had likely been killed on impact. They reported hearing cries of: 'Help me! Help me!'. However, the mother was certainly not alive at the time of their arrival. Rescuers are now trying to figure out how they  heard Ms Groesbeck's voice. Officer Tyler Beddoes, who was involved in the rescue, said: 'For two nights I've laid awake trying to figure out exactly what it could be. All I know is it was there, we all heard it. It was extra motivation.' It is still unclear how Lily managed to survive with no food or water, but a doctor told CNN that when someone suffers from hypothermia, their metabolism slows and their oxygen intake reduces. Police at the scene: It is still unclear how Lily managed to survive with no food or water, but a doctor told CNN that when someone suffers from hypothermia, their metabolism slows and their oxygen intake reduces . Safe: Dad Deven Trafny smiles as he looks at his daughter, Lily Groesbeck, in a video taken in hospital and released by the family. Lily has now left the hospital after surviving for 14 hours in a car wreck . On the mend: Mr Trafny is seen playing with his daughter, who is back to her normal self, he has said . This results in a 'neuro-protective' condition, the doctor said. Also this week, Lily's father, Deven Trafny, revealed his daughter's incredible progress in a video taken from hospital, which shows the infant bouncing around and waving shyly at the camera. 'I'm blessed,' Mr Trafny, told KUTV on Wednesday. 'I'm counting all my blessings right now... She should be gone. She shouldn't be here right now. I'm overwhelmed with joy right now.' Mr Trafny said Lily has been watching cartoons and laughing with family members despite it being only a week since the deadly crash. She also remembers everything she knew before the crash. 'Lily came into the hospital on Saturday in critical condition, and today she's in great condition - she's happy, playing, talking, and even reciting her nursery rhymes,' the devoted father said. Emotional: The father said he is overjoyed and shocked that Lily survived the crash. However, he is also mourning 'the love of my life' - Lily's mother and his fiancee Lynn Groesbeck, who was found dead in the car . Survivor: Lt Johnson said an investigator had found a small bag of marijuana in Ms Groesbeck's purse at the scene, along with an unused, packaged syringe and a bottle of Tramadol, a pain killer. Above, little Lily . 'Except for a few bruises, she has made a remarkable recovery.' But while caring for little Lily, Mr Trafny is trying to comprehend losing his beloved fiancée Lynn. 'That's kind of a hard situation for me right now,' he said. 'I haven't really wrapped my head around that. She was the love of my life and I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that.' According to police lieutenant Matt Johnson, toxicology results are pending in the case. Lt Johnson said an investigator had found a small bag of marijuana in Ms Groesbeck's purse at the scene, along with an unused, packaged syringe and a bottle of Tramadol, a pain killer. However, he could not say if any of those items were a factor in the accident. The items were taken to the state medical examiner's office in Salt Lake City, he said.","Newly-released footage was filmed on an officer's body camera at scene .

"Little Ariana Sufi has amazed her parents after learning how to say 'I love you' - aged just seven weeks. Proud father Ali Sufi, 25, was tucking his daughter into bed for an afternoon nap when he told her he loved her - and was stunned when she said it back. The baffled sales assistant repeated the amazing conversation to his partner Fatima, 22, who thought he was joking - until she heard her daughter speak for herself. Ariana now tries to say 'I love you' whenever she hears the phrase - and her parents are expecting her to grow up into a very chatty child.

'When she was just three or four weeks old she was saying ""ahhs"" and she has always been a very active baby,' said Ali. 'She is always punching, and giggling and smiling. I have always talked to her quite a lot, and love talking and playing with her. 'The first time she did it she was one month and 22 days. 'I’ve always thought she was quite smart.

The tiny tot, who is now nine weeks old, was filmed by his 36-year-old mother who says that she knew he had been trying to communicate for a while. Toni said: 'He was trying to speak for a while but that day I knew he was trying to say something. 'I'd read that babies communicate from a young age and to give them space to answer when you talk to them. 'That was I was doing that day and because he was so alert and making such good eye contact I decided to video him. You can tell my total shock when he came out with ""hello"".' In the short clip, Cillian can be seen moving his mouth around trying to talk. After making several attempts he eventually comes out with his first word. Last year, a video of an infant saying 'I love you' went viral. Stephanie Passalacqua reveals in her description of the impressive video that the baby's father noticed her trying to mimic all his words. The baby's gaze never leaves her father's face as he tries several times to get her to defy all reason by speaking the words. Finally, after a few laboured attempts, the baby manages to just about blurt out the words.","Ali Sufi, 25, was tucking his daughter Ariana into bed for an afternoon nap .

"If an Englishman’s house is his castle, his garden shed is his fortress: a refuge that has nurtured many a seedling and saved many a marriage. But today a mere shed is not enough. Timber is so last year. So meet the £22,000 Solardome – an Eden Project for the burbs. It’s the ultimate uber-shed, a grand, permanent 20ft-across structure made from glass. Hundreds of these and similar egg-shaped conservatories are springing up around the country – and now John Lewis is about to start selling the smaller-scale £599 garden igloo. If it’s good enough for John Lewis, it’s good enough for me. Scroll down for video . Top of the range: The Solardome, which costs a cool £22,000, is the ultimate uber-shed . Yes, its construction demands a degree of patience, if not, I’m glad to say, a degree in mechanical engineering, but this DIY dome is undeniably impressive: a 12ft-across and 7ft-tall geodesic structure made of precision-crafted, flat-packed German plastic. Now, I don’t claim to be a practical man. While I can happily whip up braised saffron sweetbreads or layer a ceviche, DIY remains a strange and alien country. I can barely wire a plug without bringing down the National Grid. Ikea is, truly, a four-letter word. When we first moved in together 100 years ago, my wife Deborah brought with her a set of power tools that would not have disgraced a Formula 1 mechanic. I brought my spice rack and a pastry brush. So it was with some trepidation that, yesterday morning, I took delivery of an enormous, corpse-heavy cardboard box, dispatched – with typical Teutonic efficiency – from a Berlin factory in just 24 hours. Grand: Egg-shaped conservatories are springing up around the country like the Solardome (pictured) which is a permanent 20ft-across structure made from glass . It might be called an igloo but, much to my daughter’s disappointment, you don’t have to hand-carve blocks of pack ice, which would have been undeniably tricky in Dorset at the end of March. But even with a set of faultlessly efficient instructions – the poles are all numbered, the instructions straightforward, albeit tedious – I was a worried man. In fact, gazing at the 164 poles, all of differing lengths, and 62 connectors, I have not felt quite so fazed since being trounced in the first round of The Krypton Factor in 1992 by a postman from Peterlee. He managed to build a 6ft dice from scratch; I didn’t. A breezy promotional video shows some Beanie-hatted hipster nonchalantly putting his igloo up in just 30 minutes, but it took me two-and-a-quarter hours, slowed by the shaming fact I clearly can’t tell the difference between a hexagon and a pentagon and, as a result, got two of my joints muddled up, wreaking havoc. As my wife said tartly: ‘I don’t think it’s meant to have a hole in the roof and a pole left over.’ Cue some furious, ill-tempered dismantling followed by a quick first-aid break as I clumsily managed to all but deglove my finger unscrewing one of these stubborn joints and spattered the white doorway with blood: not a great look. Inspiration? The conservatories are stylistically similar to the maze featured on classic game show The Crystal Maze . There was one last glitch as my wife and I grumpily managed to slide on the skin-tight PVC cover, inside-out. This is arguably the trickiest section: imagine trying to coax a single cover over a double duvet while swearing – and sweating – under plastic. But finally, finally, it was done. And the satisfaction was immense. It was then time – with help from Sherborne’s Castle Gardens – to dress my new man cave: an orange tree, a fig and a fern, table and chairs, a ghetto-blaster and, more crucially, a wine-cooler. The Garden Igloo might look funkier than your average potting shed but there is one drawback: it is completely transparent. If you’re after a secret doze or a hush-hush hideaway for your home brew, this is not for you. And it is crazily hot: a stand-up polytunnel. Certainly, my fig tree is flourishing in this sun-warmed fug, so too my oranges. Tomatoes would be perfect, so too pineapples. If you can ignore the sickly reek of new PVC, this weather-proof quasi-sauna is a little idyll. Newly on sale in here, the manufacturers of the Garden Igloo, also called Garden Igloo, believe the UK is the perfect marketplace. Sales in Germany have been relatively modest – about 1,500 last year – but Chris Dimpker, head of marketing, says: ‘Our product is 100 per cent weather-proof and really suits the UK. You have warmer winters and cooler summers – this multi-purpose dome is tailor-made for those conditions.’ 1. Guided by the efficient instructions, after 30 minutes the base is almost complete. So far, so good. 2. I've passed the two-hour mark after muddling my connectors and slicing through a finger. Where does that top piece go? 3. I enlist my wife's help. After trying to slide the cover on inside-out, tempers fray. We're both ready for a sit-down. 4. With the igloo finally up, it's time to dress the dome: cue pot plants, a hi-fi and of course, a wine cooler. 5. Now that's more like it - a chilled sun-downer, some tunes on the ghetto-blaster and a good book. At 12ft across, this is a roomy space to make of what you will: the perfect sci-fi housing for a paddling pool or hot tub, as long as you don’t mind looking like a slightly comical extra from Blake’s 7. And, despite being incredibly strong, it’s absurdly portable, hence the ten anchor poles that you will absolutely need if there is so much as a breath of wind, unless you want to see your treasured igloo disappearing over your fence like a startled jellyfish. But this is clearly the year of the dome and the options are as variable as the prices. Luminair makes a unique canvas dome designed by an airship engineer that can be built up a tree, complete with its own solar power and a wood stove. Its prices start from £8,000. There is even a designated camp site. Gloucestershire’s Dome Garden – recently voted the UK’s best glamping site – is made up of 11 vast geodesic domes. But you could, this Easter, do a great deal worse than this budget version of the glasshouse retreat: my new dome-office-come-sweat-lodge. I’m about to fill the wine-cooler and I’m battening down the hatches. I may be some time.","The Solardome – an Eden Project for the burbs - is the ultimate uber-shed .

"Nike’s ‘Just do it’ slogan is undoubtedly a killer line – and now it’s been revealed that the inspiration for it came from an actual killer. The phrase, first used in a Nike advert in 1988, was pitched to the firm by advertising executive Dan Wieden, who admitted that it was borrowed from something a Utah murderer uttered as he faced a firing squad. The condemned man in question was Gary Gilmore, who was sentenced to death in 1977 for robbing and murdering two men in Utah the previous year. Scroll down for video . Nike’s ‘Just do it’ slogan is undoubtedly a killer line – and now it’s been revealed that the inspiration for it came from an actual killer . The tagline 'Just do it', which has become synonymous with the Nike brand, first appeared in 1988 at the end of an advert featuring 80-year-old runner Walt Stack (pictured) Gary Gilmore (pictured) uttered the words 'let's do it' before he was executing by firing squad for two Utah murders in 1977. The phrase inspired one of the most successful advertising slogans of all time . He chose to be executed by firing squad and it was reported that he said ‘let’s do it’ in the moments before he died. Mr Wieden, speaking at an advertising conference in Cape Town in February, said that he recalled this line in 1988 just before he had a crunch marketing campaign meeting with Nike bosses, and decided to suggest a slightly altered version as a slogan. This week Mr Wieden, co-founder of advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, repeated the story to Dezeen magazine. He described how he was worried that an upcoming series of five TV adverts lacked cohesion, because they all had a different feel to them. He felt they needed a tagline to tie them all together. His company had been parachuted in by Nike to help them counter-attack rivals Reebok, who had just announced bigger profits. Dan Wieden (pictured) revealed that the slogan 'Just do it' was borrowed from the last words of Utah murderer Gary Gilmore . Mr Wieden said: ‘We… came up with five different 30 second spots. The night before [a meeting with Nike] I got concerned because… there wasn't an overlying sensibility to them all. Some were funny, some were solemn. So I thought… we need a tagline to pull this stuff together. ‘I wrote about four or five ideas. I narrowed it down to the last one, which was ""Just do it"". The reason I did that one was funny because I was recalling a man in Portland. ‘He murdered a man and a woman, and was put before a firing squad. And they asked him if he had any final thoughts and he said: ""Let's do it."" And for some reason I went: ""Now damn. How do you ask for an ultimate challenge that you are probably going to lose, but you call it in?"" So I thought, well, I didn't like ""Let’s do it"" so I just changed it to ""Just do it"".’ At first, he recalled, Nike hated the idea, but he won them round and the slogan appeared at the end of an advert featuring 80-year-old runner Walt Stack. It is now one of the most famous slogans in the world, described by Campaign magazine as ‘arguably the best tagline of the 20th century’.","The 'Just do it' slogan first appeared at the end of a TV advert in 1988 .

"A 9-month-old boy found dead in a Pittsburgh-area apartment is believed to have starved after his mother died of an apparent overdose. The woman's brother found the two dead early Friday morning when he went to check on his sister. Sara Kessler, 22, had not been heard from for several days, Assistant Allegheny County police Superintendent James Morton said. Morton said Kessler may have died a week or two earlier. Scroll down for video . Sara Kessler (pictured) lived with her 9-month-old son Casey on the second floor of an apartment block in Millvale, Pennsylvania. They were found dead by her brother after he hadn't heard from her for several days . She was found on her bed, with the son, Casey, found in the living room. He said there were no signs of foul play. 'It's a very sad situation in there,' Morton told reporters outside the apartment in Millvale, just across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. 'It seems like he [the infant] tried to survive but there was no food or anything for him to have.' 'It looked like he was trying to get around somehow by himself for who knows how long.' The woman's mother died of natural causes in the same apartment in November, Morton said. Police suspect the woman died of a drug overdose, and needles were found all over the apartment. A former resident of the building told CBS Pittsburgh that Kessler was a drug addict and said that the family had tried to get her help many times. Video courtesy of WPXI . Kessler was known to be a drug addict by other residents of the building and it is suspected that she died of an overdose. Casey's body was found in the living room - he is thought to have starved to death . The Millvale apartment building where Kessler and her son's bodies were discovered. One former resident says that a neighbor did hear Casey's cries after his mother's death . No one else lives on the same floor of the apartment building and so no one heard Casey's cries. However, the same former resident claimed that a downstairs neighbor did hear Casey crying for up to two days but didn't report it. 'Now why she didn’t alert anybody, I don’t know. That baby never had a chance.' Autopsies were scheduled for Saturday to officially determine the causes of death. Three house cats were also found in the second floor apartment. Police say the animals survived because of an automatic feeder.

"Former Vice President Dick Cheney, defending the GOP against charges of bigotry, says its President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder who are 'playing the race card' and not the other way around. 'To say that we criticize, or that I criticize, Barack Obama or Eric Holder because of race, I just think it’s obviously not true,' Cheney said. 'My view of it is the criticism is merited because of performance—or lack of performance, because of incompetence. It hasn’t got anything to do with race.' Cheney addressed the subject during a 10-hour long interview with journalist James Rosen, a portion of which appeared on Playboy's website late Tuesday night. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, seen here on the set of Meet the Press in December, says it's 'obviously not true' that GOP criticisms of President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder are race-related . 'Certainly we haven’t given up—nor should we give up—the right to criticize an administration and public officials,' the former George W. Bush administration and George H.W. Bush administration official said after Rosen asked him if there is any 'truth' to past suggestions by Obama and Holder that Republican opposition to the president is race-related. Holder has conjectured numerous times that Republican hostility to the president and his policies are based, at least partly, on Obama's race. Obama, whose father is Kenyan, is half black. He has strongly embraced his African-American heritage, as has his wife, Michelle Obama, whose mother Marian Robinson lives at the White House with the first family and has made it known in the past that it was preferable to her  that her son-in-law wasn't 'completely white.' The soon-to-be retired attorney general is also black. He again claimed in an interview several weeks ago with Politico that racism was sometimes an underlying factor in the administration's struggles with congressional Republicans. 'There have been times when I thought that’s at least a piece of it,' Holder acknowledged. 'I think that the primary motivator has probably been political in nature … [but] you can’t let it deflect you from … your eyes on the prize.' Cheney also chastised the Obama administration in his sit-down with Rosen for habitually viewing large-scale controversies through the frame of race. Discussing the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting of a young black man by a white police officer, Cheney said he's 'been disappointed' with the executive branch's response to the tragedy. 'It seems to me it’s a clear-cut case that the officer did what he had to do to defend himself. He was perfectly within his authorities to take action,' Cheney asserted. 'That if you reach through the open car window and slap an officer upside the head and reach for his gun, you know, there is going to be a response. 'I think there should have been more people who were ready to stand up and say, “Look, the evidence is pretty overwhelming. The grand jury has reviewed it thoroughly. Here’s what we know. This is what happened.” ' Continuing, he said, the administration was wrong to have allowed race to cloud the debate. 'We should not sort of throw it all over on the burden of race, or racial inequality or racial discrimination, as being responsible for this particular event,' he argued. 'I think that would be wrong, and [pauses] it bothers me that that kind of an incident has generated that kind of response. 'I don’t think it is about race. I think it is about an individual who conducted himself in a manner that was almost guaranteed to provoke an officer trying to do his duty.' It's President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, seated here in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in February with Senior Adviser to the President Valerie Jarrett, who are 'playing the race card' and not the other way around, Cheney charged . He further took Obama to task over decisions he's made in the last six years as commander in chief, since taking the baton from George W. Bush in 2009, that Cheney, the former No. 2 government official, believes are to the detriment of America and have led to the unraveling of the stability abroad that he and Bush helped put in place. 'Oh absolutely. Where do you start?' Cheney replied when Rosen nudged him to say that Obama had 'intentionally' or 'inadvertently' undone his predecessor's work. Passing judgement on the Democratic president's handling of Iraq, Cheney said it was a 'huge mistake' for Obama to withdraw troops and 'we are paying a price for it now.' 'He’s having to go back in now, and the guy who campaigned on the basis of bring the boys home and get out of Iraq is now redeploying forces to Iraq,' he said, referencing the fight against ISIS. Obama's so-called 'apology tour' in Cairo, Egypt in 2009 was also 'a huge mistake,' Cheney proclaimed. 'I don’t think he ever bought into the notion that we’re at war, in terms of a war on terrorism; I think he always wanted to treat it as a law-enforcement problem. 'I think he’s done enormous damage to the military,' Cheney, a former defense secretary under Bush senior said, repeating old lines of attack on Obama, who had no military experience when he took office. 'The way Obama is functioning now, he’s crippling the capacity of future presidents to deal with future crises' by cutting its size. 'It takes a long time to build up that military force.' Cheney said he is 'absolutely convinced' that a future president 'will be faced with a major crisis and will not have the military capability he needs to deal with it' because of Obama's actions. 'I can go on for hours,' he said, before cutting himself off. Cheney, left, served as the vice president in George W. Bush's administration. They are pictured here talking to the press in the Oval Office in 2002 ahead of Cheney's 10-day trip across the Middle East and Europe to discuss with allies the Iraq situation . While Obama has advocated for a leaner military, it is, ironically, conservatives in Congress who are currently standing in the way of a massive increase in defense spending to replace the armed services divisions depleted coffers. Obama has called for an end to defense spending caps demanded by sequestration legislation as part of his fiscal year 2016 budget. Defense hawks on the right also want to re-up the defense department's resources. But fiscal conservatives believe that fulfilling the party's promise to balance the budget over the next decade and put a dent in the federal deficit is of greater importance. The official budget put forward by House Republicans on Tuesday leaves the sequester in place while instead expanding an overseas account for the military. The White House on Tuesday called it a 'slush fund' intended to give Republicans, generally known as aggressively in favor of the military, 'political cover' while Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee' described it as a gimmick.","The criticism is 'merited because of performance—or lack of performance, because of incompetence. It hasn’t got anything to do with race,' he said .
Holder has conjectured numerous times that Republican hostility to the president and his policies are based, at least partly, on Obama's race .

"Alcohol often goes hand in hand with violence, but no matter the level of intoxication most people would dare not pick a fight with an elephant. This was not the case recently in Sri Lanka, when a drunk man in a national park decided to antagonize an elephant as horrified onlookers stood by. Video of the encounter shows members of the crowd shouting at the man to leave the elephant alone as it had killed a person only days earlier. The man lies down on the grass before the elephant as onlookers warn it has recently killed someone . After getting up and continuing to antagonize the creature, it suddenly runs out of patience . In a matter of seconds, the angry elephant rushes towards him as he tries to escape . But the elephant is too quick and the drunk man falls underneath it as it runs over the top of him . But ignoring their pleas, he begins taunting the angry creature by first lying down on a bank directly in front of it. Despite the increasingly urgent cries from the crowd, he gets up and climbs down the bank until he is standing  in front of the animal. Suddenly, it loses its temper and rushes towards him. He falls over and is trampled by it before it almost immediately wanders away disinterested. The drunk man is then pulled up the grassy bank and it appears as though part of his ear has been torn off and his once-muddy shirt is left covered in blood. The footage was filmed in the Udawalawe National Park in Sri Lanka, where it's believed around 250 Sri Lankan Elephants - a species native to the country - live. A policeman also appears in the background of the video, though it is unclear if he arrested or intervened following the fight. Immediately after it trampled the man, the elephant wandered away appearing disinterested .

"The bond between a handler and their K-9 can only be built over time. It's a closeness that becomes intrinsic, with the dedication of the dog built not on money or benefit, but love. So having to say goodbye is always going to be heartbreaking. Such was the sad situation faced by the 802nd Security Forces Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas recently, when a beloved member of their unit, MWD Daysi, had to be euthanized for an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Senior Airman Chelsea LaFever says goodbye to MWD Daysi, who had to be euthanized at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas due to an aggressive form of cancer . Emotional: Sgt. Paul Olmos, the military working dog handler assigned MWD Daysi since last year, plays with his partner one last time before she was euthanized on February 27, 2015 . Daysi was certified to join the narcotics detection team in January 2014, the Air Education and Training Command released this week. She had never had a handler before, and her partner with Sgt. Paul Olmos, had never had his own dog. 'Daysi and Olmos were an ideal team pairing,' said Tech. Sgt. Kevin Nelson, 802nd SFS kennel master. 'Their relationship is immense because this was their first experience as a MWD team.' Olmos would spend all of his free time with his charge. 'I'm single and I don't have immediate family here, so I'd come on the weekends just to visit her and take her on runs,' Olmos said. 'I couldn't even tell you how much time we've spent together.' Together they participated in the Texas Toughest Dog competition. However in January this year, trainers noticed something was wrong with Daysi's left leg. Sick: Daysi had an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor and could not be operated on . An initial check-up didn't show anything abnormal. However a follow-up evaluation detected a tumor. Daysi's certification was subsequently canceled and she was taken in for treatment. The tumor was found to be pushing on a nerve and causing her pain. But due to the location, doctors were unable to operate, which would cause the cancer to spread to the rest of her body. 'The news of Daysi's declining health hit us hard; this sort of news always does,' Tech. Sgt. Kevin Nelson said. 'Euthanasia of MWDs is a last resort and we try to approach every option available before it comes to that,' 'Most of our dogs get adopted out or continue on with their service in a civilian police department.' Final goodbye: Military members line up and salute MWD Daysi as she is walked into a veterinary clinic to be put down by her partner, Sgt. Paul Olmos . On February 27, all of those who had worked with MWD Daysi lined up outside the veterinary clinic. A police procession blared sirens that resonated throughout the base. The officers then saluted as Daysi was lead into the facility to be put down. 'These dogs are our brothers and sisters in arms as well,' Nelson added. While highly-emotional, no one seemed to be more affected than Sgt. Olmos. 'Through all the training we've done together and the long 12 to14 hour days; it was just me and her,' he said. 'She's my partner.'","WMD Daysi joined the narcotics detection team at the Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland in Texas in January 2014 .

"For nine-year-old Xiang Xiang, there is only one ambition - he just wants to be able to look at himself in the mirror like other children. The youngster suffered severe burns to his face and head four years ago after he fell into a fire, and underwent a skin graft operation that has meant he had to spend years wearing a mask to help his scorched flesh to heal. Dubbed 'Mask Boy' in China after his plight was raised in online reports, Xiang Xiang (not his real name) would rather not have to wear the headgear – but also wants to be 'handsome' so that other people no longer stare or, worse, bully him. Xiang Xiang was dubbed 'Mask Boy' after he suffered severe burns falling into a fire four years ago . The nine-year-old hates wearing the mask and it is hopes a series of further operations will rid him of the headgear . His family have taken him to Beijing, where he is set to undergo a series of further operations to repair the damage to his  face and body at a cost of around 300,000 yuan (£32,000). Since being horrifically burned Xiang Xiang has only looked in the mirror once and seen the full extent of his disfigurement, according to his father. 'At the time he stared at the mirror for a long time and said one sentence, ''How did my face get so burnt?'' and then he never looked into the mirror again,' Mr Wang told the People's Daily. 'We are afraid he will be bullied and hurt. So this time coming to Beijing we must have our son healed so that he can be handsome again.' After the initial skin transplant, the boy was forced to endure a lengthy wait for further surgery to allow his breathing to fully recover from the ordeal. The nine-year-old wants to be 'handsome' and his family fear that he will be bullied because of his appearance . Xiang Xiang was playing with two friends when he fell into the fire leaving him horrifically injured . The lengthy delay has led to Xiang Xiang becoming self conscious about his appearance and aware of how his facial expressions and vision are restricted. 'At the end of last year his breathing ability had recovered and was at the standard required for the operation to go ahead,' said Mr Wang. 'My son said to me that he had to do the operation so that he could get rid of the mask.' The boy was forced to endure the cruel stares of passers-by after he bravely decided to remove his mask as he travelled to the hospital for his latest round of treatment. He told his father his father he needed further operations to 'get rid of the mask' The boy was forced to endure the cruel stares of passers-by after he bravely decided to remove his mask as he travelled to the hospital . 'People were staring at Xiang Xiang's injury which made the child very sad,' said Mr Wang. 'In the past my son hated the mask and often when he was getting ready to sleep he would hide the mask hoping that the next day he would not need to wear it any more.' Xiang Xiang was just five-years-old when he fell into the flames as he played with two friends in Fenyang. He also lost one finger on his left hand. After undergoing an initial skin transplant he was forced to wear the white coloured mask that was specially designed to assist the healing process. Heartbreaking images of little Xiang Xiang  were beamed around the globe and led to a fund being set up to help pay for the boy's treatment. The latest operations will look to address the opening and closing of his mouth, the limited use of his hand and hair loss. His father said when Xiang Xiang was getting ready to sleep he would sometimes hide the mask in the hope that the next  day he would not need to wear it any more . Xiang Xiang is said to hate the mask that protects his skin and is eager to finally see the back of it . Dr Shen, who is in charge of the boy's treatment, explained that he needed to undergo further surgery to ensure that he did not develop in an unnatural manner. 'As he grows up, and with skin growing back, it is possible that we need further rectifying operations,' he said. 'Therefore Xiang Xiang's plastic surgery will not be completed in one go. 'There will be at least seven to ten operations to complete the basic recovery. 'At present each operation will be limited to the three-hour mark to prevent the anaesthetic from harming the child.'","Xiang Xiang, nine, was horrifically burned after falling into a fire in 2011 .

"In what doctors are calling an extraordinarily rare case of survival, a 22-month-old Pennsylvania boy whose lifeless body was pulled from an icy creek was revived after an hour and 41 minutes of CPR, and has suffered virtually no lingering effects. Gardell Martin came home from the hospital on Sunday, and his doctors said Thursday he has made a full recovery. 'It's not only extraordinarily rare that we got the kid back, but what's even more extraordinary is the rate at which he recovered and the completeness of his recovery,' said Dr. Frank Maffei, director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Geisinger's Janet Weis Children's Hospital in Danville. Scroll down for video . Lucy escape: Gardell Martin (pictured with his mother Rose) fell into a stream that runs through his own near Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania, and was swept away by the fast current on March 11 . 'The stars and moon aligned, and he had an angel on his shoulder.' Gardell and two of his brothers had gone outside to play on March 11 when, at some point, he fell into the stream that runs through their five-acre property near Mifflinburg and was swept away by the fast-moving current. His seven-year-old brother, Greg, ran into the house and screamed that he couldn't find Gardell. Their mother, Rose Martin, did a quick search of the property before realizing her young son had likely fallen into the creek, which was swollen because of melting snow. She called 911 while her two teenage daughters began walking downstream in a frantic search for the toddler. Scene of the incident: Gardell's body temperature was 77 degrees, more than 20 degrees below normal, after he fell into this river - against all odds, his heart restarted after CPR . It was a neighbor who found Gardell nearly a quarter-mile away, caught up in a tree branch, the water gushing around his body. An ambulance crew arrived moments later, found no pulse and began CPR. Resuscitation would continue, unbroken, for 101 minutes - in the ambulance, at a community hospital, aboard a medical helicopter and, finally, in the emergency room of Janet Weis, the pediatric wing of Geisinger Medical Center, where a team of some 30 doctors and nurses sprang into action. Gardell's body temperature was 77 degrees when he arrived, more than 20 degrees below normal. In this case, the boy's profound hypothermia worked to his advantage, dramatically slowing his metabolism and giving his organs 'some degree of protection from cardiac arrest,' Maffei said. Knowing that, Maffei ordered CPR to continue while the team slowly warmed his body. At around 82 degrees, they detected a pulse. Against all odds, his heart had restarted. Hours later, Gardell regained consciousness - and his brain function was normal, stunning doctors yet again. 'It was an act of God,' said his grateful mother, Rose Martin. 'There is no doubt in my mind it's a miracle. God had the right people in the right place at the right time and they all did a wonderful job.' Dr. Richard Lambert, the attending physician in the pediatric intensive care unit, said Gardell belonged in a 'rare, rare, extreme category for recovery.' A week later, the medical team is still on a high. It 'provides us with a smile on our face, knowing you were part of something this wonderful and amazing,' Lambert said. Back at home, Gardell is walking - though he still needs to regain a bit of balance - and chattering away. But not about his ordeal. 'It's hard to tell how much he remembers or knows about what happened,' his mother said. 'He can't really tell us in that way.'","Gardell Martin  fell into a stream that runs through his own near Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania, and was swept away by the fast current on March 11 .

"As we find more planetary systems elsewhere in the galaxy, something is confusing astronomers - why does our solar system appear so unique? Many other systems have ‘super-Earths’ and other planets in tight orbits close to their star, but ours does not. And now we might know why - because Jupiter acted like a ‘wrecking ball’ in the early solar system and knocked planets out of the solar system or into position. University of California scientists have presented a new theory for the solar system. They say early in its life, Jupiter swung through the inner planets (illustration of early solar system shown). This explains why there are no planets between Mercury and the sun. But it may also indicate our system is an 'oddball' in the galaxy . If this is true, it would suggest that the conditions that have allowed life on Earth to thrive are incredibly rare. The study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences helps explain why our solar system is so different from the hundreds of others discovered in recent years. ‘Now we can look at our own solar system in the context of all these other planetary systems, one of the most interesting features is the absence of planets inside the orbit of Mercury,’ said Professor Gregory Laughlin, of California University in Santa Cruz, who co-authored the study. ‘The standard issue planetary system in our galaxy seems to be a set of super-Earths with alarmingly short orbital periods. Our solar system is looking increasingly like an oddball.’ Aliens are real - not little green men visiting Earth as depicted in movies, but rather microbial life in our own solar system and intelligent life beyond. That’s according to two leading Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Seti) researchers, who took part in a hearing at the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in Washington DC last August. During the talk dubbed ‘Astrobiology and the Search for Life in the Universe’ in May, the scientists laid out the evidence and reasoning for believing we are not alone. The speech was made by Dr Seth Shostak, Senior Astronomer at the Seti Institute in California, and Dr Dan Wethimer, Director of Seti Research. And, they added, with adequate support it is likely we will find alien life in some form or another within 20 years. Dr Wethimer said: ‘It would be bizarre if we are alone,’ he told the committee. ‘It would be a cramped mind that didn’t wonder what other life is out there.’ The new findings provide an explanation for this ‘gaping hole’ in our inner solar system between Mercury and the sun. But they also reveal certain characteristics of Earth and the other rocky planets, which would have formed later than the outer ones from a depleted supply of material. Namely, Jupiter may have helped Earth form in a habitable part of the solar system. And it also possibly played a part in Earth's size, ensuring it was not too big or small to host water and life. Computer models of the early solar system showed the migration of Jupiter may have shepherded small early planets - initiating a ‘collisional cascade’ in the inner solar system. Before this it’s plausible that rocky planets with deep atmospheres would have been forming close to the sun from a dense disk of gas and dust on their way to becoming typical ‘super-Earths’ like so many of the planets astronomers have found around other stars. As Jupiter moved inward, gravitational perturbations from the giant planet would have swept the inner planets and large space rocks into close-knit overlapping orbits - setting off a series of collisions that smashed all the planets into pieces. ‘It’s the same thing we worry about if satellites were to be destroyed in low-Earth orbit,’ said Professor Laughlin. ‘Their fragments would start smashing into other satellites and you’d risk a chain reaction of collisions. ‘Our work indicates that Jupiter would have created just such a collisional cascade in the inner solar system.’ As Jupiter (pictured from the Cassini spacecraft on 8 October 2000) moved inward in the early solar system, gravitational perturbations from the giant planet would have swept the inner planets and large space rocks into close-knit overlapping orbits - setting off a series of collisions that smashed all the planets into pieces . The study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences helps explain why our solar system is so different from the hundreds of others discovered in recent years. Notably, many other systems have super-Earths (illustration shown) - but our solar system has none . The resulting debris would then have spiraled into the sun under the influence of a strong ‘headwind’ from the dense gas still swirling around the sun. ‘The ingoing avalanche would have destroyed any newly-formed super-Earths by driving them into the sun,’ said Professor Laughlin. A second generation of inner planets would have formed later from the depleted material that was left behind, consistent with evidence that our solar system’s inner planets are younger than the outer planets. The resulting inner planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars - are also less massive and have much thinner atmospheres than would otherwise be expected. ‘One of the predictions of our theory is that truly Earth-like planets - with solid surfaces and modest atmospheric pressures - are rare,’ added Professor Laughlin. Ultimately, Jupiter's interaction with the inner solar system billions of years ago may have given rise to the solar system we know today (illustrated) - and also the conditions necessary for life on Earth, namely a habitable distance from the sun and a suitably-sized world . Planet hunters have detected well over a thousand exoplanets orbiting stars in our galaxy, including nearly 500 systems with multiple planets. What has emerged from these observations as the ‘typical’ planetary system is one consisting of a few planets with masses several times larger than the Earth’s - super-Earths - orbiting much closer to their host star than Mercury is to the sun. In systems with giant planets similar to Jupiter, they also tend to be much closer to their host stars than the giant planets in our solar system. The rocky inner planets of our solar system, with relatively low masses and thin atmospheres, may turn out to be fairly anomalous. According to Professor Laughlin, the formation of giant planets like Jupiter is somewhat rare, but when it occurs the giant planet usually migrates inward and ends up at an orbital distance similar to Earth’s. Only the formation of Saturn in our own solar system pulled Jupiter back out and allowed Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars to form. Therefore, another prediction of the paper is that systems with giant planets at orbital periods of more than about 100 days would be unlikely to host multiple close-in planets.","University of California has present a new theory for solar system .

"A team of scientists claim it has found a way to inject people’s eyes with ‘night vision’. The research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft (50 metres) in almost total darkness for 'several hours'. By injecting his eyes with a liquid solution, he could spot people running among trees in dark conditions 100 per cent of the time, while others who hadn't been treated with the drops were successful in only a third of cases. Californian researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision. The solution combines Chlorin e6 (Ce6) with insulin and saline. A small amount of it was dripped it into a researcher's eyes. It briefly turns the eyes dark or black before it is absorbed, seen in this image of researcher Gabriel Licina . The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called ‘biohackers’ in California called Science for the Masses. They used a solution of a substance called Chlorin e6 (Ce6), which is found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also been used in cancer treatment research. Combining Ce6 with insulin and saline, the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions. In April, researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor, which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses. Created by University of Michigan researchers Ted Norris and Zhaohui Zhong, the sensor uses an atom-thin material called graphene which could be layered onto contact lenses. Graphene takes infrared rays and translates them into electrical signals. The process is similar to the way silicon chip in a digital camera work with visible light, Wired reported. 'If we integrate it with a contact lens or other wearable electronics, it expands your vision,' Zhong said. 'It provides you another way of interacting with your environment.' They note in their paper, though, that ‘the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution.’ As a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home. Russell Peake, Eye Health Condition Manager at Boots Opticians, told MailOnline that people should not attempt to recreate the experiment. 'Unless a solution has been prescribed or recommended by an optometrist, GP or pharmacist, people should not be inserting anything into their eyes,' he warned. 'An invasive eye procedure should only ever be undertaken by a trained expert in a clinical environment, as wrong use could lead to disruption or damage of the eye’s surface or tears, potentially leading to vision loss. 'Whilst the idea of ""night vision eye drops"" may seem interesting, this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval. 'We would strongly advise against anyone trying this at home as the risks could potentially be very damaging and would advise people speak to their local optician for further information or advice.' The experiment was carried out by a group of so-called ‘biohackers’ in California called Science for the Masses. It is not advisable to try this at home. They used a solution containing Chlorin e6 (Ce6), found in some deep-sea fish and has light-amplification properties, and is also used in cancer treatment research . In the team's experiment, the liquid was dripped onto the conjunctival sacs on the eye of Gabriel Licina, one of the researchers, which carried the solution to his retinas. ‘Ce6 solution was added to the conjunctival sac via micropippette at three doses of 50μl [microlitres] into each eye,’ the researchers wrote. The solution  initially made his eyes turn black, before being absorbed in a few seconds and returning his eyes to their natural colour. 'To me, it was a quick, greenish-black blur across my vision, and then it dissolved into my eyes,' Mr Licina told Mic. However, to ‘reduce the potential for bright light exposure,’ the team covered his eyes in black contact lenses. Within an hour his vision had noticeably improved in low-light conditions. To test the effects, Mr Licina and four ‘control’ subjects who had not been given the solution were taken to a ‘darkened area’. Within an hour, Mr Licina was able to see in darkness - for several hours. In experiments he could see three times better than 'normal' eyes. After testing, Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning seemed to return to normal. Shown is a stock image of US soldiers in Iraq in 2003 . They were then asked to identify symbols in the dark, either moving or still, and to spot individuals moving in a small grove of trees. ‘The Ce6 subject consistently recognised symbols that did not seem to be visible to the controls,’ the researchers wrote. And, in the second test: ‘The Ce6 subject identified the distant figures 100 per cent of the time, with the controls showing a 33 per cent identification rate.’ After testing, the team said that Mr Licina wore sunglasses while he slept, and his eyesight in the morning appeared to return to normal. ‘As of 20 days, there have been no noticeable effects,’ they said. While they note that more testing is needed, the initial results suggest that the technique can provide low light amplification in the human eye. ‘Further testing is need to confirm and measure the degree of improvement in health subjects,’ they concluded.","Solution uses Chlorin e6 (Ce6) insulin and saline to enable night vision .

"When 16-year-old Billy Flynn gunned down the husband of his high school instructor and lover, Pamela Smart, in 1990, the trial became an instant tabloid sensation. Its lurid details aired gavel-to-gavel on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle and spawned movies and books. Twenty-five years after Gregg Smart's killing, Pamela Smart remains in prison serving life without the possibility of parole and Flynn makes his first bid for parole Thursday, his 41st birthday. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus credit for pretrial incarceration. Here's a look at some key details in the case: . Teacher:  Pamela Smart (seen in this 1991 file photo) was convicted of conspiring with her 15 year-old lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24 year-old husband, Greggory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . Student: In this 1991 file photo, William Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Greggory Smart in the head and killed him. Flynn pleaded guilty to killing Smart and  has a parole hearing scheduled for Thursday . The plot . According to trial testimony, Smart was 22 and one of Flynn's instructors in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced the 15-year-old Flynn. She told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced Gregg Smart as their wedding anniversary approached. Flynn said he and three cohorts bungled an attempt to kill Smart in April, when they got lost on the way there. But on May 1, 1990, he and 18-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.' Smart was convicted March 22, 1991, of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy and witness tampering. Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. Life in prison: Flynn (seen in January 2008) married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license . Media circus: The trials's lurid details aired gavel-to-gavel on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle and spawned movies and books . Sensational trial . Smart's trial was the first in the country to be televised nationally from start to finish, her trial lawyer, Mark Sisti, said ruefully. 'Her trial turned into the ultimate daytime TV drama, and the witnesses were dressing up for it and performing rather than testifying,' Sisti said. Hers was also one of the first high-profile trials involving a teacher-student sex affair. Stories of the trial and Flynn's testimony about their affair were picked up internationally, and cameras caught every graphic image and detail. 'We're a voyeuristic society,' said veteran trial lawyer and University of New Hampshire School of Law professor Buzz Scherr. 'We like looking at other people's dirty laundry.' And, Scherr noted: 'This one had it all.' Parole pitch . Parole files in New Hampshire are not public record, and Flynn's lawyer, Cathy Green, declined to say what Flynn would tell the board. Seven years ago, testifying on his motion for a reduced sentence, a tearful Flynn took full responsibility for his actions and apologized. 'I promise you I will carry this guilt and remorse with me every day for the rest of my life,' he said. Gregory Smart's father, William, told Flynn then that he might be prepared to see him go free when Flynn reached 40 but that he wasn't ready yet. William Smart has since died. Flynn married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license. 'This never would have happened if it wasn't for Pam Smart,' said attorney Paul Maggiotto, who prosecuted Smart. 'It was Smart's manipulation of Flynn that caused this crime to occur.' Flynn's age and testimony against Smart were taken into account at sentencing. 'I desperately want you to know I'm not that weak person anymore,' Flynn said in 2008. Students: In May 1990, Patrick Randall (left) and Billy Flynn (right) entered the Smarts' condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head . On the big screen: The case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix . Flynn, who is serving out his sentence in Maine, will not be present at the parole board hearing. He will address the board on speakerphone (file photo) Smart's stance . Smart has been at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for women in New York since her transfer for unspecified security reasons in March 1993. Her friend and spokeswoman, Eleanor Pam, told The Associated Press that Smart is not taking a position on Flynn's parole bid but chafes at her life sentence without the chance at freedom that the triggerman is getting. Smart told her: 'If they look at Flynn, they really should take a look at me.' Pam said that while Smart acknowledges the affair with Flynn led to the series of events leading up to her husband's death, she maintains she didn't plan it. What to expect Thursday . Flynn, who is serving out his sentence in Maine, will not be present at the parole board hearing. He will address the board on speakerphone. Gregg Smart's family members and friends have a right to make victim impact statements. State prosecutors will also weigh in. The three board members are expected to confer among themselves without leaving the hearing room at the state prison in Concord and then render a decision. If parole is granted, Flynn would not be freed before his parole eligibility date of June 4 and only after his final parole plan is approved by the board.","Pamela Smart was a 22-year-old high school instructor when she seduced 15-year-old Billy Flynn, according to trial testimony .

"Fresno's deputy police chief was among four people arrested on federal drug charges, including conspiracy to distribute oxycodone and heroin, authorities said Thursday. Deputy Police Chief Keith Foster, 51, was arrested for conspiracy to distribute and/or possess with the intent to distribute oxycodone, heroin and marijuana, the Federal Bureau of Investigations said in a statement. Foster and Fresno residents Rafael Guzman, Jennifer Donebedian and Randy Flowers were arrested as result of a yearlong joint investigation by the FBI and ATF that involved wiretaps and surveillance, the FBI said. Scroll down for video . Accused: Deputy Police Chief Keith Foster, 51, was arrested for conspiracy to distribute and/or possess with the intent to distribute oxycodone, heroin and marijuana, the FBI said (file) Foster, a 29-year-veteran of the Fresno Police Department, oversaw patrol operations for the department's four police districts. He has been a deputy chief since January 2007. Foster has been put on paid administrative leave while the Fresno police conduct an internal investigation into alleged criminal and policy violations, the Fresno Police Department said in a statement. 'This is a very sad day for the Fresno Police Department, the citizens of Fresno, the law enforcement profession, and for me personally,' Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said. An affidavit by U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives special agent Sherri L. Reynolds shows Foster told Flowers in a Dec. 23, 2014, phone call that he had '100 of those things' for Flowers. Foster picked up a prescription for 100 oxycodone tablets at a Rite Aid pharmacy drive-thru and then drove his black BMW to Flowers' home on West Church Avenue in a pocket of southwest Fresno just outside city limits. Foster picked up another prescription of oxycodone pills on Jan. 27, 2015, and then drove to Flowers' home. Flowers has a criminal history in Fresno County that includes a 1988 conviction for possession of cocaine base for sale; a 1994 conviction for being a felon and addict in possession of a firearm; and a 2010 conviction for delivery of a schedule II controlled substance from Marion County, Oregon, the affidavit says.

"Convicted child molester Yova Kana Shaday, 69, requested to be released from a New York prison so that he could donate to a sperm bank . A convicted child molester begged a New York judge for permission to leave jail so that he could donate to a sperm bank and have a chance to procreate. Yova Kana Shaday, 69, said he was being robbed of his 'last opportunity to be fruitful and multiply' in the letter filed at Brooklyn Federal Court. Shaday said he feared that, if imprisoned, he would be too old to donate his sperm once released. He wrote that he prayed the court would consider the 'very serious truth in releasing me' and warned  that 'the gravity of this extenuating circumstance is in your hands'. The letter signs off with Shaday's hope that 'your god lead you to be fruitful and multiply,' before he adds in a 'P.S' that his sperm donation was intended for an unnamed 'specific receiver,' according to the New York Daily News. Federal Judge Edward Korman swiftly denied Shaday's request. Shaday is currently incarcerated at the Queens Correctional Facility. He is awaiting trial for failing to register as a sex offender in New York. If convicted, Shaday faces up to 10 years in prison. Police received a tip in November that Shaday was living under a fake name in Brooklyn, a fact they confirmed after showing his mugshot to neighbors. The request was filed to Brooklyn Federal Court (pictured) and was swiftly denied by Federal Judge Edward Korman. Shaday is currently awaiting trial for failing to register as a sex offender . They then nabbed Shaday when he reported his bicycle was missing to the NYPD under his alias, Lucas Avram. Shaday is supposed to register as a sex offender every year for the rest of his life, . According to court papers, Shaday has been convicted twice in California for molesting minors. Shaday pleaded guilty to committing a lewd act with a child under the age of 14 in 2005 and was sentenced to three years in prison. He then pleaded guilty to molesting a child under the age of 18 in 2008 and served 180 days in jail.","Yova Kana Shaday is currently incarcerated in Queens, New York and is awaiting trial for failing to register as a sex offender in the state .

"My teenage kids (Molly, 15, Dylan, 17) demand something a bit more exciting than sand and sea from family summer holidays nowadays. So, given their obsession with all things Kardashian, we decided on California this year - a classic American road trip along the Pacific Coast Highway (aka Route 1) from San Francisco to Los Angeles. We took our time (three weeks) to do it, but fitted so much in that I can't hang about now. San Francisco is known as America's most European city, you'll need to pack a fleece even in late July . So here we go... San Francisco is known as America's most European city, possibly because you'll need to pack a fleece even in late July. The mist that rolls in off the sea and shrouds the Golden Gate Bridge most days can sometimes linger, but we never stayed still long enough to get cold. Based in the funky Hotel Zetta - where the foyer combines games room and bar, and is plastered with colossal photos of John Lennon and past guests of Alcatraz - we spent three days hurtling around the city, often clinging for dear life to the famous cable cars that haul you up and down the City's equally famous hills. We ate clam chowder from a bread bowl at Fisherman's Wharf, we trawled the boutiques of Haight Ashbury in search of the summer of love, we bussed out to the Golden Gate, and we wondered at the aquarium in Golden Gate Park. Jane travelled to America with her teenage children, Molly, 15 and Dylan who's 17 . And, fleeces on, we took the boat trip to Alcatraz, which is not to be missed. The brilliant audio guide that leads you around the prison is narrated only by men who were once guards or prisoners on the rock. It's an eerie and compelling tour. After trying to distil the city into only 72 hours, we climbed into our SUV and headed for Route 1. It's only about 350 miles as the crow flies between San Francisco and LA, but this (mostly) coastal route is probably well over 500 miles long as it winds through some of California's most wonderful, ever-changing scenery. Much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it's time to take your foot off the gas, relax and take it all in. The kids said it reminded them of Dorset as we headed south past Santa Cruz and then nipped briefly into Monterey to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of Cannery Row, the waterfront district made famous in John Steinbeck's novel of the same name. At Dylan's insistence, we took a detour on to 17 Mile Drive, the scenic road around the Monterey Peninsula that leads to the world-famous Pebble Beach golf club. He was rather disappointed by the condition of the course there, but thrilled with the state of Quail Lodge and Golf Club, our first port of call just outside the pretty little town of Carmel. Even the non-golfers among us loved our luxurious bungalow at the edge of the course; secluded and tranquil, plush and green with a view of distant misty mountains. When the sound of silence got too much for us, just across the street at Valley Hills there was the excellent and lively Baja Cantina Mexican restaurant, and a wonderful deli too. Leaving Carmel, you find yourself at the edge of the spectacular area known as Big Sur: wild and often mountainous terrain battling it out with the equally wild Pacific. The road coils up and down cliffs and crosses cavernous gorges for almost 100 miles - incredibly dramatic but sometimes not for the faint-hearted. We stopped off at the Garrapata National Park, in a baking-hot and silent valley, where the crash of the waves was replaced by the hum of insects and the call of the buzzards wheeling overhead. Much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it's time to take your foot off the gas, relax and take it all in . This was a completely different wildness, underlined when Dylan narrowly avoided stepping on a basking rattlesnake. At the end of Big Sur you can encounter yet another type of wildness altogether in the form of the legendary Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo. Every bedroom is themed here - from Rock Bottom (it's a cave) to Old Mexico and the comparatively muted silver walls and flock wallpaper of our own Crystal Room. To call the Madonna Inn 'kitsch' is to do it a huge disservice, because it takes everything to a whole new level of eyepopping taste. Take the Gold Rush Steakhouse, which puts the shocking into pink. The whole place is furnished and upholstered in a pink that is practically pornographic, softened only by the presence of enormous gold chandeliers. You have to see it to believe it. But the food and service were fantastic. The family nipped briefly into Monterey to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of Cannery Row, the waterfront district made famous in John Steinbeck's novel of the same name . We took a rare detour off Route 1 to the Danish settlement of Solvang, a sort of cutesy yet sinister re-creation of Denmark in the California sun, full of pastry shops and Chinese tourists. A little unnerved by this, we headed back to the safety of the highway and soon found ourselves in Santa Barbara. It's the classic California of posters and T-shirts, with infinitely long palm-lined streets with mountains at one end and the ocean at the other. We stayed at the beachside end of one such thoroughfare in the aptly named Harbor View Inn. We found great seafood at the end of the pier at Stearns Wharf opposite the hotel and at the fantastic Fishhouse just a couple of blocks along Cabrillo Boulevard. Over the rail tracks behind the inn is State Street, where you can find everything from Macy's and American Apparel to tattooists and cavernous bars advertising Punk Rock Bingo. The Horrocks' took a detour on to 17 Mile Drive, the scenic road around the Monterey Peninsula that leads to the world-famous Pebble Beach golf club . The farmers' market closes the street on a Tuesday afternoon, offering up a Californian cornucopia of fruit, veg and other tasty treats. To the east of State Street is The Funk Zone, an old industrial area that is regenerating itself into a haven of restaurants, art galleries and wine-tasting rooms. Back on the road near San Simeon, you will see exotic animals on either side of the highway. Floundering on the beach are gigantic elephant seals - enormous specimens of blubbery ugliness hooting and honking and generally having a riot at the edge of the sea. On the other side are zebras - direct descendants of the herd that press tycoon William Randolph Hearst installed at the magnificent Hearst Castle, which appears right ahead of you. You can take a tour of the castle and its grounds. After a 15-minute coach drive up the snaking road to the top of the hill, you discover a spectacular mansion furnished with antiques and tapestries from all over Europe, andboasting Roman baths, an enormous neo-Classical marble swimming pool and its own private cinema. In the 1930s, Hearst Castle was party central for Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Greta Garbo et al. There are gold courses galore just outside the pretty little town of Carmel . Having soaked up a bit of the Golden Age of Hollywood, we headed off on Route 1 again to see the City of Angels of today. There we stayed at the slick and sleek Viceroy Santa Monica Hotel, choosing the beach-life of Santa Monica and Venice over the urban sprawl of Hollywood or Beverly Hills where the car is king. The body-builders and gymnasts of Muscle Beach and the roller-blading buskers of Venice are highly entertaining, and you can actually walk everywhere. Hollywood is really an idea rather than a place anyway. It always seems as if it might be just around the next corner but it never is, and the Hollywood sign always stays aloof in the distance. We went on an excellent guided tour taking in the Chinese Theatre, Walk of Fame, Rodeo Drive, Sunset Strip and other spots of note. A Sunday trip to Universal Studios was great fun, too, for the rides and a look at a real working film set on its day off. Mind you, the scariest ride of the day was getting on the freeway by accident on the way into LA. Stop off for an guided tour taking in the Chinese Theatre, Walk of Fame, Rodeo Drive, Sunset Strip and other spots of note in LA . Unless you're a professional stunt driver in a hurry, the freeway is probably best avoided in favour of a trundle along the city's more sedate boulevards. We drove the last 40 miles south through the LA suburbs to our final stop at the Huntington Beach Hyatt Regency. And what a beach it is - three-and-a-half miles of uncrowded white sand known as Surf City. It was thrilling to watch the guys surfing along on the waves. Later we watched the sun go down over the pier from the comfort of the superb Duke's Restaurant, before ambling back along a beach glowing with fire-pits and shrouded in barbecue smoke - preparing ourselves for the horrors of donning fleeces again for the journey home.

"Ryan Lockyer, 22, (pictured) was jailed for six years for the 'terrifying' attack, which left his 31-year-old victim afraid to go out . A woman was forced to jump into a canal to escape a dangerous serial sex attacker who threatened to kill her - but he will not serve a day for the crime. Ryan Lockyer, 22, of  Reading, Berkshire, was jailed for six years for the 'terrifying' attack, which left his 31-year-old victim afraid to go out alone. Reading Crown Court heard the incident took place less than 18 months after Lockyer was released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks. Lockyer stalked his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, as she walked home from work on October 7, 2014. As she passed through a nature reserve near Fobney Lock in Reading, Berkshire, at around 3.45pm, the defendant began following her. When she noticed him he started to run towards her shouting: 'I have a knife and I will kill you.' Prosecutor Walton Hornsby said Lockyer, who was brandishing a 10cms long knife, grabbed the woman and told her: 'I will kill you if you don't do what I want you to do.' Mr Hornsby said: 'She thought the only way to get away from him was to jump in the river.' The woman then told Lockyer she would do whatever he wanted, which appeared to take him by surprise and gave her the chance to slip free from his grasp and jump into the canal. Lockyer immediately ran off but the victim remained in the water for some time, scared he was still in the area. The victim eventually returned home and reported the incident to police the following day, describing her attacker as looking like an actor from BBC drama The Tudors. Lockyer was arrested after being picked out of an identity parade on October 10 and he was charged the next day. He gave a no comment during his interview but at a court hearing on January 7 he admitted a charge of making threats to kill, committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and threatening with a bladed article. Reading Crown Court (pictured) heard Lockyer carried out the attack less than 18 months after being released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks . In a victim impact statement the woman described how she now takes the bus everywhere rather than walking alone and sees a potential attacker in every man she encounters. After his arrest Lockyer was recalled to prison to serve the rest of his previous licence period. That sentence related to a hearing at Oxford Crown Court in 2011 when, aged 18 years, Lockyer was jailed for four years with a three-year licence for sexual assault, three counts of sexual activity with a child and causing actual bodily harm. 'This was, without question, a terrifying experience for your victim,' Judge John told Lockyer, who appeared via video link from HMP Bullingdon. The judge then blasted Parliament for laws which meant he could not jail Lockyer for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks, meaning he will 'literally not serve a day' behind bars for the latest offence. The judge blasted Parliament for laws which meant he could not jail the 22-year-old for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks . 'That is a consequence which, I feel bound to say, I deplore but about which I can do nothing,' Judge Stephen John told Lockyer as he sentenced him via video link at Reading Crown Court. Judge Stephen John described Lockyer as 'one of the more dangerous men' he had come across during his lengthy career, saying it was a 'chilling' case. Judge John said the defendant had an 'alarming' history and said he was plainly a danger to the public. However, the judge said that because of laws introduced in 2003 and the fact that Lockyer would be released halfway through his latest sentence, he would effectively not serve a day behind bars for the canal attack. 'Apart from the effect of your recall, you will be entitled to release from the sentence I now impose at the halfway point, thus three years from today, which would be March 9, 2018,' said Judge John. 'Because of the licence recall, you will not be released until May 13, 2018, a mere seven weeks later. 'Because Parliament in its wisdom chose in 2003 to abolish the power to return a prisoner to custody to serve the unexpired portion of licence and then to order the fresh sentence to run consecutively to that recall, the effect of my order is that you will literally not serve a day longer for the offences for which you are now sentenced.' When he is released, Lockyer will remain on licence for 10 years. In mitigation, Peter De Feu said: 'As far as this offending goes and this very brave victim, he is sorry. 'He is still young and young enough perhaps for there to be a hope of change.' Lockyer was jailed for six years for making threats to kill and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence. He will serve a two year sentence for threatening with a bladed article concurrently. He was also handed an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order, having already been given a 10-year order in 2011.","Serial sex attacker Ryan Lockyer, 22, attacked his victim with a knife .

"The BBC could lose millions of pounds a year if it sacks Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson . The BBC is set to lose as much as £67million a year if Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson is sacked over claims he punched a producer. The corporation's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £50million a year from selling the rights to Top Gear overseas, with the show watched in 214 countries around the world. On top of that, BBC Worldwide makes millions more from Top Gear Magazine and live shows in the UK and abroad, as well as sales of DVDs. But all of this could be lost if Clarkson is sacked - an outcome he hinted at during a charity ball last night. The Top Gear star, who is alleged to have hit producer Oisin Tymon during a 'fracas' over a steak dinner, said he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. The BBC could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give Clarkson his marching orders, with the sale of the show overseas making £50million. Top Gear Magazine has a global circulation of 1.7m, bringing in another estimated £7.4million - not including profit from advertising, as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine. The motoring programme is also set to make around £7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the UK this year. The conservative estimate is based on 15,000 tickets sold for each show at the cheapest price of £35 each, however with more expensive tickets and VIP packages available, this figure could be far higher. Car manufacturers are also thought to pay to have their cars featured on the stadium tours. The programme's 2014 Christmas DVD - Top Gear Perfect Road Trip 2 - was the highest-selling in the UK, with 272,000 copies bought in just three months, accounting for about £2.17million. Other DVDs, Top Gear merchandise and mobile apps are other sources of revenue that could be cut off if the show comes to and end with the sacking of Clarkson, with Richard Hammond and James May refusing to film without their suspended co-presenter. Last night the Top Gear frontman was caught on camera as he launched into a foul-mouthed rant at the BBC during a charity gala. BBC Worldwide makes millions of pounds from the shows offshoots, including Top Gear Magazine (left) - which has a 1.7m circulation - and the programme's DVD releases (right) Rant: Clarkson, pictured next to Pink Floyd's Nick Mason, hinted that he expects to be sacked by the BBC . Clarkson, speaking in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, said he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. He told guests at The Roundhouse Gala that the driving series 'was a great show and they've f***** it up'. A video of his speech emerged as it was claimed last night that Clarkson visited his producer's home to apologise for their Top Gear altercation - but was given the cold shoulder. In footage obtained by the Daily Mirror, he spoke to the Roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his 'last ever lap' on the Top Gear track - which later went for £100,000. Clarkson said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me. 'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.' He added: 'There was an 18-year waiting list to be in the audience of Top Gear, but the BBC has f***** themselves.' Clarkson is alleged to have punched producer Oisin Tymon during a 'fracas' at a hotel in North Yorkshire . Petition is delivered: A man dressed as The Stig is pictured leading a tank charge to the BBC offices in London today to hand over one million signatures calling for the return of Clarkson . Hosts: Although Top Gear has been taken off air, Clarkson and his co-presenters Richard Hammond (left) and James May (right) are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week . Last night, a report claimed that the BBC probe into the row had been told producer Oisin Tymon refused to even open the door to Clarkson after he turned up at his house. Sources said the incident happened four days after 54-year-old Clarkson allegedly punched Mr Tymon during an argument after filming over a hot meal at a North Yorkshire hotel. The claims emerged as it was revealed Clarkson, Hammond and May are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week. Clarkson is still suspended by the BBC pending a report into what happened during the hotel altercation. The internal probe will be passed to Director-General Lord Hall next week before a final decision is made. Today, the BBC was given another reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank.

"This bronze statue put up in memory of murdered Sarah Payne was stolen from Burhill County Primary School in Hersham, Surrey . A bronze statue in memory of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne has been recovered by police after it was stolen from outside her school. The 2ft statue depicting a young girl was taken from Burhill County Primary School, Hersham, Surrey, yesterday. It was given to the school in memory of the former pupil who was murdered in 2000. It was found by a member of the public this morning after Sarah's mother, Dr Sara Payne, had appealed for its safe return. The statue was found outside an address in Northfield Road, Cobham, this morning. It is believed that it was left outside the property between 5.15am and 7.30am. Three people are believed to have been involved in the theft. A van was also seen in the area around the time of the offence. Sergeant Marc Nettleingham, of Surrey Police, said: 'The member of the public who found the statue, which is thankfully undamaged, had seen our appeal on Facebook. 'We are continuing to carry out a number of inquiries to identify the offenders responsible for this theft, which is particularly reprehensible given that it was presented to the school in memory of Sarah Payne and the investigation is ongoing.' Her mother, Sara, said: 'I implore the the public to help me and the police bring my Sarah's memorial statue back where it belongs' Eight-year-old Sarah was abducted by paedophile Roy Whiting as she played  in a field outside her grandparents' rural home in West Sussex in 2000 . Her mother, Sara, said yesterday: 'Monetary-wise it's not worth that much. 'It's worth far more to the school. 'The residents feel sick and I feel sick about it.' Eight-year-old Sarah was abducted by paedophile Roy Whiting as she played with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte  in a field outside her grandparents' rural home in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex in July 2000. Michael Payne and his then wife Sara made a series of heart-rending appeals for her safe return, but her body was discovered 16 days later in a shallow grave just a few miles away. Whiting was sentenced to life behind bars in January 2001, and is held at HMP Wakefield, dubbed the Monster Mansion due to the number of high risk sex offenders imprisoned there. It later emerged that Whiting was already on the Sex Offenders Register after abducting and sexually attacking another eight-year-old. Her brutal death remains one of Britain's highest profile child murders and led to the introduction of Sarah's Law following a lengthy campaign by her mother. The rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. Sarah's father, Michael, died aged 45 last October after a long battle with alcoholism. Her mother was awarded an MBE in 2008 for her campaign work.","Statue presented to Burhill Primary School, Hersham, stolen yesterday .

"A man was arrested after a four-hour armed siege with police after he claimed to have a gun and explosives in his house. Dozens of police - many of them heavily-armed - were involved in the tense stand-off in Huddersfield yesterday. They rushed to the scene and evacuated houses after the man claimed to have a gun and an explosive device inside the house. Tense: Heavily-armed police were involved in the standoff for four hours after the man claimed to have a weapon and explosives . Drama: The housing estate in Huddersfield went into lockdown whilst police surrounded the house . Siege: Police wearing full body armour swarmed into the estate to protect the public . The drama eventually ended shortly after 5pm when police confirmed a man had been arrested. Police cordons had sealed off a large area of the estate and Chief Inspector Jonathan Blackwell confirmed the siege had ended safely last night. He said: 'At 5.08pm, the 31-year-old man left the property after officers successfully negotiated his surrender. 'The man was then arrested by police on suspicion of firearms offences and section 136 of the Mental Health Act. 'Officers were called to the property on Hall Cross Grove at 1.36pm this afternoon following concerns for a man's safety. 'At that stage the man had made threats to harm himself and claimed to be in possession of a firearm and explosive devices. 'The safety of the public is our top priority and it was necessary to close some roads in the area while the incident was ongoing. 'We are now pleased to have resolved this incident without any harm coming to anyone and I would like to thank local residents for their patience and support while we worked to bring this situation to a peaceful and safe resolution'. Police carried out a detailed search of the property for explosive devices and firearms, but had yet to confirm whether they had found anything. Armed: The drama eventually ended shortly after 5pm when police confirmed a man had been arrested .

The drama centred on Hall Cross Grove, a small cul-de-sac, and officers were stationed all around the house. Dozens of armed officers wearing full body armour arrived at approximately 1.30pm, and set up a cordon to keep the public safe. Kieran Carter, who lives just yards from the house at the centre of the drama, told the Huddersfield Daily Examiner while the siege was still ongoing: 'It's very surreal. 'I was out in the back garden, which backs on to Hall Cross Grove, tidying up some rubbish when all of a sudden the police were there. 'They told me they needed to use my garden to get through to a house and told me to go inside. 'There are three of them there at the minute: one with what looks like a machine-gun, another one with a dog and the third what looks like a grenade launcher. 'There's also a very big vehicle pulled up outside. It looks as though it is an armoured vehicle'. 'It's all very surreal. I know the guy who lives in the house and he keeps himself to himself'. A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police confirmed today that the man remained in custody and enquiries were ongoing.","Drama in Huddersfield  after man claims to have gun and bomb .

"David Cameron today compared himself to action hero Tom Cruise in his mission to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe. The Prime Minister said a Tory victory in the General Election would give him a 'very powerful mandate' to win sweeping reforms and insisted it was possible. It came after Donald Tusk, the Polish president of the European Council which represents EU leaders, said rewriting the EU treaties to curb migration would be 'close to Mission Impossible' for Mr Cameron. But the PM told a press conference in Brussels: 'Tom Cruise normally prevails in the end. He's a little bit smaller than me, but I hope to be just as effective.' David Cameron, pictured in Brussels today, has compared himself to action hero Tom Cruise in his bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe . Mr Cameron urged voters to the election as an 'opportunity to make sure the problems that bedevil Britain's relationship with the EU are dealt with', he said. He said: 'The moment of truth is fast approaching,' he said. 'One of two people will represent Britain in Europe after the election. It's either me or Ed Miliband. 'If you send me back here as Prime Minister on 8 May, I have a very clear plan. I want to sit at that negotiating table with a mandate from the British people to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it. 'For too long this issue has been swept under the carpet and I believe it is time to deal with it. If I am returned as Prime Minister, that is what I will do. 'So I say to the British people: give me another term and I will give you your say on Europe.' Mr Cameron said there were other EU leaders 'who will breathe a sigh of relief' if he is not re-elected. The Prime Minister's remarks came after Mr Tusk said he was 'ready to help Cameron' – but dismissed his chances of negotiating a new European treaty within the next two years before holding an EU referendum. The former Polish prime minister said it would be hard to find agreement among all 27 EU leaders that would satisfy Mr Cameron. He said: 'I have no doubt that we have to help in a limited and rational framework. We have to help David Cameron because he is obviously pro-European. But Mr Tusk added: 'I am sceptical when it comes to changing the treaty.' Donald Tusk, the Polish president of the European Council which represents EU leaders, greeted Mr Cameron today after claiming that his bid to rewrite the EU treaties to curb migration would be 'close to Mission Impossible' Mr Cameron wants a new Brussels treaty to nail down a series of changes allowing Britain to limit benefits for EU migrants. The PM has insisted that new rules are needed to help the crisis-hit Eurozone, giving Britain the chance to renegotiate its relationship with Brussels. But Mr Tusk said: 'My intuition is that treaty change is close to mission impossible today because it's not only about rationality, about good argument. 'We need unanimity between 28 member states, in the European parliament, in 28 national parliaments in the process of ratification. To say that it is a Pandora's Box is too little.' Mr Tusk said: 'First of all we need more precise concrete [details] about British demands. 'When we have more information about details, about legal problems, then we can decide if discussion about treaty change is at all necessary. 'For me the problem of possible treaty change is a practical question. It's not only about the arguments of Cameron. I can agree or disagree with some of them. 'But at the end of the day I would like to ask him 'what is your concrete proposal?' and then I can consult with the other member states.' But he said: 'We need, also for the United Kingdom, a good solution for Cameron and Great Britain under existing law,' he said. 'We need the United Kingdom in Europe. For me there's no more obvious political thesis than this one. And I feel, but it's not my role to decide about it, but I feel that the United Kingdom needs Europe.' The former Polish prime minister's remarks are the first since he took over as European council president in December. He also admitted, in an interview with the Guardian, that he will find it hard to crack down on immigration – because of the number of Poles living and working abroad. He said: 'It's not easy for me because of some expectations close to the immigration problems, which means also the huge Polish minority in Great Britain.'","EU chief Donald Tusk said it would be 'Mission Impossible' for Cameron .

"A married couple who were so desperate to be parents they sold all their valuables to fund costly fertility treatment finally have the baby of their dreams - after winning a competition. Chris and Amanda Schlatter, from Nevada, had tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to fall pregnant, attempting to conceive naturally - even experimenting with fertility-boosting yoga hanging upside down after intercourse. But after finding themselves broke after almost a decade of unsuccessful attempts, the pair ended up winning the chance to have a baby in a competition run by an IVF charity - and this week celebrate the second birthday of their son Noah. Chris and Amanda Schlatter, from Nevada, celebrate their son Noah's 2nd birthday this week . Noah, pictured newborn, was conceived after Chris wrote a heartfelt plea to the charity Babyquest explaining the couples years of fertility struggles . After starting to after visiting a fertility clinic in December 2009, tests found Mr Schlatter had low testosterone levels and Mrs Schlatter was diagnosed with endometriosis, a polycystic ovary and a blocked fallopian tube. The couple started IUI – intrauterine insemination – which involves separating out the fastest moving sperm and placing them in the womb. But the costly treatment meant they were forced to sell possessions in their home to cover the $10,000 (£6000) cost. 'We became so desperate to get pregnant we sold everything of value in our home, to fund the IUI,' Mrs Schlatter, 30, said. Amanda and Chris on their wedding day: 'When I married my wife my intention was to give her the world, but instead we have known struggle' Chris said in his prize-winning letter . Left: The couple when they first met; Right: Pictured recently with Noah as he turns two . 'With each treatment I hoped we'd get pregnant. And when each one failed we'd pin our hopes on the next. But we had six goes and none of them were successful. 'My wife and I have seen hardships but none greater than what we currently face. 'In the first months of our relationship Amanda and I would sit and talk for hours about our future children. 'Our initial failures did not alarm us, our panic did not begin until we'd been trying several years. 'We understood conceiving a baby can sometimes take more time for some than others. We needed to try harder but nothing worked. 'After several failed attempts the heartbreak became more intense. 'When I married my wife my intention was to give her the world, but instead we have known struggle. 'As we read about your [the charity's] work, our hopes began to rise to know there are organisations that still exist to help people and ease the pain of others. 'The pain of infertility is brutal and the tears have been frequent. With your [the charity's] help, those tears can finally be dried.' 'I felt bitter that other people had children and felt sad and jealous when friends started having babies. 'In the end our doctor said: ""Any further treatment along these lines would be a waste of money""'. 'IVF became our only option after this, but we knew it would be expensive, and we'd run out of things to sell by this point.' Amazingly, it was Mr Schlatter's magical words that saw them get pregnant after they beat 99 other couples to win funding for IVF treatment. After researching treatment options online, the couple came across a charity, Baby Quest Foundation, which was granting struggling couples the funding for IVF. So Mr Schlatter, 34, applied, explaining why he and his wife would make perfect parents, and should receive the help. 'His letter was so heartfelt,' Mrs Schlatter explained. 'He wrote about our struggle to conceive and about how heart-breaking it had been for us with every negative pregnancy test.' Incredibly, two months later, in April 2012, the couple got the call to say they'd won the funding. And less than a year later, in March 2013, their son Noah was born. Mrs Schlatter said: 'When the doctor said the words I never thought I'd hear – 'you're pregnant' I couldn't stop smiling. 'After eight years of trying we were finally going to have a family of our own – thanks to Chris' beautiful words. Left: Miracle baby Noah pictured recently; Right: A newborn Noah in March 2013 . Mrs Schlatter (pictured when she was pregnant in 2013) said: 'When the doctor said the words I never thought I'd hear – 'you're pregnant' I couldn't stop smiling. 'Chris and I had first spoken about having kids a year after we met when I was 18 and he was 22. We were young, but all we ever wanted to be was parents.' Speaking of her struggle to fall pregnant naturally, Mrs Schlatter continued: 'It just didn't happen naturally for us. So we tried natural treatments. I took vitamins and did yoga to boost my fertility. 'I even hung upside down, any stupid thing that was suggested, to get me pregnant. 'We tried not to worry, but as our friends started having families we couldn't help it. 'Our sex life became like a military operation. Each day I'd take my temperature, and work out which day of the month I'd be most fertile. Then we'd take time off work specifically to try and conceive. 'Having sex stopped being romantic. It was like a chore and not fun.' Mrs Schlatter said of Noah (pictured recently): 'We have nothing but thanks for the charity who've made our family possible. Noah is our miracle baby' Mrs Schlatter, pictured  pregnant, is due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again, with the embryos created during their winning IVF treatment . During their plight to be parents, Mrs Schlatter admits convincing herself that she was pregnant every time her period was late, and whenever she had an ache or pain, she put it down to a symptom of pregnancy. The mum-of-one, said: 'Every month another test would be negative and I'd make excuses, like I'd tested too early, and try again. 'We did hundreds of tests and they were always negative. It seemed like the one thing I wanted I couldn't have. I was ashamed that I couldn't do what a woman is supposed to do, or give my husband what he wanted.' The couple, who celebrate Noah's 2nd birthday this week, are due to start the process of trying to get pregnant again, with the embryos created during their winning IVF treatment. Mrs Schlatter added: 'We have nothing but thanks for the charity who've made our family possible. Noah is our miracle baby, and we hope now to give him a brother or sister. 'Without winning that treatment, Chris and I would still be struggling to have a baby and still going through all that heartache. We really couldn't be more thrilled that we won. Noah is by far the best prize we could've hoped for.' The mum-of-one, said: 'Every month another test would be negative and I'd make excuses, like I'd tested too early, and try again. Mrs Schlatter, pictured pregnant, said before winning the competition: 'IVF became our only option after this, but we knew it would be expensive, and we'd run out of things to sell '","Chris and Amanda Schlatter from Nevada tried naturally for eight years .

"Having rich parents doesn’t just buy an expensive education and exciting holidays abroad. It may also purchase more brainpower. A study found the children from wealthy families have bigger brains than their poorer counterparts. Los Angeles researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower. Their study found that money was important to a young mind. Parental income was found to be more important than their education. Shown is a picture of Angelina Jolie, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt and Brad Pitt . Brain regions key to academic success were particularly large, the journal Nature Neuroscience reports. Interestingly, the study also revealed that money matters more than parental background when it comes to nourishing the young mind. In one of the first studies of its kind, the US researchers put more than 1,000 healthy children and teenagers through brain scanners and quizzed their parents on their background and income. Richer people live further away from their parents than those on modest wages, a study in December 2014 claimed. The report found workers earning less than £25,000 ($37,000) live within 31 miles (50km) of their family, but this distance grows the wealthier people become. Britons who earn £35,000 to £45,000 ($52,000 to $67,000) live 42 miles (68km) away while those earning more than £55,000 ($81,000) live 47 miles (76km) away. Annuities firm Partnership said this was because high-earning professionals were more likely to have moved away from where they grew up to secure a lucrative career. The study also found people in their 50s live closest to their ageing parents, but later move farther away to be near their own children and grandchildren. While people in their 40s lived 37 miles (60km) away, on average, this reduced to 33 miles (53km) as people reached their early 50s. The youngsters, who were between three and 20 years old, also did tests of memory and something called executive function. This term covers the mental skills that are used to weigh up options, prioritise, multi-task and plan ahead. Children with poor executive function may struggle to memorise information and be more likely to get into fights. Analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school. However, parental income was even more important. Brain areas key to language and executive function were bigger in children from wealthier families. These youngsters also did better in the mental tests. Researcher Dr Elizabeth Sowell, of the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, said: ‘Our data suggest that wider access to resources likely afforded by the more affluent may lead to differences in a child’s brain structure. ‘Access to higher-quality childcare, more cognitively stimulating materials in the home and opportunities for learning outside the home likely account for some of these effects.’ Analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school. However, parental income was even more important, perhaps because the children had better living conditions (stock image shown) She said that growing up in a household that is free of the stress of struggling to make ends meet is also likely to foster brain development. The link between income and brain structure were particularly noticeable among the most deprived children, with small differences in salary having a relatively big effect on the brain. It is thought this is because a slight increase in income makes a bigger difference to living conditions to someone on a low wage than to someone who is already well provided for. Researcher Dr Kimberley Noble, of Columbia University in New York, said that despite the clear impact of socio-economic status on the young mind, it would be wrong to think that the changes are fixed. She said: ‘This is the critical point. The brain is the product of both genetics and experience and experience is particularly powerful in moulding brain development in childhood. ‘This suggests that interventions to improve socioeconomic circumstance, family life and/or educational opportunity can make a vast difference.’","Los Angeles researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower .

"A woman has been cleared of murder after spending 35 years in jail as new tests found a different inmate's DNA on the evidence. Cathy Woods, 64, was 29 when she was convicted of stabbing 19-year-old nursing student Michelle Mitchell to death on the edge of the University of Nevada campus in 1976. But in September a judge threw out the case - and on Friday ruled that there will not be a retrial as planned. Instead, prosecutors are now investigating attempted murderer Rodney Halbower as a suspect in the case. Release: Cathy Woods, 64, will not face a retrial in the 1976 murder case of college student Michele Mitchell, whom she was accused of stabbing to death. She is pictured in court in September after being absolved . New evidence: Tests revealed Woods' DNA is not on the evidence from Mitchell's (right) death scene . Halbower, 66, is serving a 30-year term for attempted murder in Oregon, and has since been charged with murdering two teenage girls in California. When Woods was absolved of murder in September 2014, Washoe District Judge Patrick Flanagan ordered the 64-year-old Woods to appear at a retrial July 13. On Friday Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks told a news conference that he's filing a motion to dismiss the case. 'It is our belief that the newly discovered DNA evidence and the continued investigation of this case exonerate Cathy Woods of the murder of Michelle Mitchell,' Hicks said. Woods was at the Southern California home of her brother and his wife when the decision was announced. They have been taking care of Woods since her conviction was tossed and she was released from prison on bail in September. New suspect: Rodney L Halbower, an inmate in an Oregon penitentiary, recently submitted DNA evidence which now connects him to a cigarette butt found on Mitchell's dead body . Paula Baxter (left), 17, was abducted February 4, 1976, stabbed to death and had her head bashed in; Carol Lee Booth (right), a 26-year-old housewife, was discovered in a shallow grave . Innocent girls: Veronica Cascio, 18, was snatched off the street while walking to a bus stop (left); Tanya Blackwell, 14, went missing while walking from her home, and her decomposed remains were discovered only six months later . 'She'll be happy. She's phoned a couple of times a day wanting to know if she's going to be prosecuted,' said her public defender, Maizie Pusich. 'She's going to be very excited to know she'll be able to stay at home.' Neither Pusich nor Hicks faulted earlier prosecutors, police and juries for their roles in Woods' convictions. 'Certainly, I wish they had DNA evidence back then, but they didn't,' Pusich said. 'They just didn't have the evidence.' Pusich and the FBI say DNA found on a Marlboro cigarette butt at the Reno crime scene suggests the real killer is a former Oregon inmate recently charged in the deaths of two women who were among five victims in the 'Gypsy Hill' murders near San Francisco about the same time Mitchell's throat was slashed. Woods was convicted in 1980 and again five years later. The convictions were based largely on the confession she made in 1979 at the psychiatric hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana, where her mother committed her months earlier. Scene: Above, the house in Reno where Michell's body was found in 1976. The 19-year-old's throat was slashed shortly after her car broke down near the University of Nevada campus . Justice: Halbower was sent to prison not long after Mitchell's murder, the the rape of a blackjack dealer just a few blocks from where the nursing student's body was found . Prosecutors at those trials argued that only Mitchell's killer could have known the information Woods provided to police in her confession. The Nevada Supreme Court overturned the initial conviction based partly on the trial judge's refusal to allow defense attorneys to present evidence that Woods could have learned everything she told investigators from newspaper accounts. Nevertheless, Woods' lawyers were unable to persuade the jury in the second trial to disregard her earlier confession, Pusich said. Woods doesn't remember acknowledging the killing while hospitalized in March 1979, Pusich said. Previously, Pusich told The Associated Press that Woods confession was given in an effort to get a private room. Shortly after being told she wasn't dangerous enough to qualify for a private room, Woods claimed 'she had killed a woman in Reno,' Pusich said. Woods remains under treatment in Southern California, Pusich said, and is 'doing well.' Rodney Halbower, 66, a native of Muskegon Heights, Michigan, was serving a 30-year sentence for attempted murder in Oregon when he was extradited to San Mateo County in California, and charged in January with murder in the 1976 deaths of Paula Louise Baxter, 17, and Veronica 'Ronnie' Anne Cascio, 18, near Pacifica. The FBI announced two days before Woods' Nevada conviction was vacated that Halbower was a person of interest in the Gypsy Hill murders. Halbower had been arrested for the rape of a 33-year-old woman in Reno in November 1975. He was released on bail and barely a month later, the Gypsy Hill murders began in California. Cascio's body was found Jan. 8, 1976, and Baxter's on Feb. 4. Mitchell was killed Feb. 24. Hicks said Halbower is a suspect in the Nevada murder. His DNA was obtained in 2013 when he was sent to Oregon. 'I would love to bring her (Mitchell's) murderer to justice and we'll do our best,' Hicks said.","Cathy Woods, 64, was absolved of murder in September 2014 .

"Britain's former top female police officer who was in charge of the  operation that led to the death of innocent Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes has been awarded a CBE by the Queen today. Cressida Dick, who quit Scotland Yard to take up a job in the Foreign Office last year, received the honour during an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London. The 54-year-old wore her Metropolitan Police uniform as she collected the honour from the monarch, who wore a dusky rose dress. Scroll down for video . Cressida Dick, who was in charge of the bungled operation that led to the death of innocent Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes, received the honour during an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London . The former assistant police commissioner stepped down from the force in December last year, after 31 years of service, and took up a secretive job with the Government's Foreign Office. Her departure came just months after she was moved from a key counter-terror role at the Metropolitan Police. The controversial 54-year-old was in charge of specialist operations, including counter-terrorism, between July 2011 and summer 2014. However, Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe moved her to specialist crime and operations for the last few months of her career – stripping her of counter-terror responsibilities. Ms Dick was appointed assistant commissioner at the force in 2009 - 26 years after joining the Met Police in 1983. She was in charge of the operation which led to Mr de Menezes being shot seven times in the head in 2005 after being mistaken for a suicide bomber. She gave evidence at an Old Bailey trial and the inquest in 2013, coming close to tears as she described the 'horrible'' and 'terrible' tragedy. She denied that she gave an order that Mr de Menezes must be stopped from getting on to a train at Stockwell 'at all costs' and also denied instructing the firearms teams to use lethal force to stop him. Ms Dick, who quit Scotland Yard to take up a secretive role in the Foreign Office last year, wore her Met Police uniform as she received her honour from the Queen. Ms Dick, 54, was formerly Britain's top police officer . Last year, Ms Dick said: 'I first joined the Met in 1983 and have loved my time as a police officer in London. 'It has been a wonderful privilege to work in such an extraordinary organisation and with such fabulous people. I feel very lucky to have done so. I will miss you all.' Upon her departure, Sir Bernard described her as a 'fantastic leader' and a 'role model for women across the service.' Among others who received honours during today's investiture ceremony was Margaret Aspinall and Trevor Hicks who have fought for more than a quarter of a century for justice for the victims of the Hillsborough disaster. The pair were awarded CBEs from the Queen for their services to the bereaved Hillsborough families. Ms Aspinall's son James, 18, and Mrs Hicks's daughters Sarah, 19, and Victoria, 15, were among the 96 Liverpool fans who were killed in Britain's worst sporting disaster. The pair are both heavily involved in the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG and have been the driving force in the lengthy legal battle against the British establishment which saw the accidental death verdicts in the previous Hillsborough inquests being quashed and a new hearing ordered. Cressida Dick was the police commander in the control room during the operation which led to the death of Jean Charles de Menezes. Ms Dick gave the order to 'stop' Mr de Menezes at Stockwell Tube Station after it was feared that he was one of four men who had tried to bomb the London Underground the day before. The 27-year-old electrician was shot dead on July 22, 2005, after anti-terror police mistook him for bomber Hussain Osman. Ms Dick, who was later promoted to the deputy assistant commissioner, told his inquest that the innocent Brazilian was the victim of a series of 'unfortunate' coincidences. She choked back tears as told the hearing in 2008 that she thought about his death every day. Cressida Dick (left) was the police commander in the control room during the operation which led to the death of Jean Charles de Menezes (right). The innocent Brazilian was shot by anti-terror police in July, 2005 . When asked what went wrong, Ms Dick said it was a series of 'unfortunate' coincidences. She said: 'If you ask me whether anybody did anything wrong or unreasonable in the operation, I don't think they did.' Officers followed Mr de Menezes when he left his flat in Tulse Hill, South London - thinking he could be suspect Hussain Osman, who lived in the same block - but were not able to positively identify him. He was shot seven times in the head as he boarded a train at Stockwell station after Ms Dick gave the order to 'stop' him as he entered the Tube. During his inquest, she denied giving an order that Mr de Menezes must be stopped from getting on a train 'at all costs' or instructing the firearms teams to use lethal force to stop him. 'I would need to be absolutely satisfied that this person posed a dreadful imminent threat before I would order a critical shot,' she said. 'I was asking for what you might call a conventional challenge from the firearms officers.' The inquest by jury later found the Met Police guilty of health and safety failings over its bungled operation but no officer faced criminal charges.","Former British police officer Cressida Dick, 54, has been awarded a CBE .

"Patrick Schwarzenegger was pictured getting a little too close for comfort with a mystery brunette while partying in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Sunday. And the following day, the 21-year-old star took to Twitter to explain things were not as they may have seemed to be and he would never betray his girlfriend of five months, Miley Cyrus. The controversy began as Patrick danced with and appeared to even hold hands with the mystery beauty dressed in nothing but a skimpy black bikini as they partied the day away at the Mango Deck Restaurant & Bar during spring break. Scroll down for video . What would Miley say?: Patrick Schwarzenegger was spotted cosying up to a mystery brunette as he partied at the Mango Deck bar in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Sunday . Hitting back: As Miley's rabid fanbase lambasted him on social media, Patrick responded by saying the girl he was pictured with was a friend's girlfriend and that males and females could have platonic relationships . She appeared to be a friend of Patrick's from USC as she wore a headband with Kappa Kappa Gamma emblazoned on it, which is one of the sororities at the Los Angeles university he attends. The brunette beauty was definitely comfortable with the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver as she put her arms around him while putting her face close up to his as they seemingly danced the afternoon away. At one point, Patrick appeared to be taking a body shot off the mystery woman as he hunched over a female in a black bikini as he apparently put his lips on her skin while another man squeezed a lime on her torso. Too close for comfort?: The 21-year-old model appeared had his arms around the waist of the brunette beauty as her mouth appeared to inch up close to his . Slow dance: The boyfriend of Miley Cyrus was seen dancing in close quarters with the brunette beauty . Just the two of us: The pair appeared to be a little worse for wear as they partied together at the Mango Deck Restaurant & Bar . Loosening up: The brunette appeared to admire Patrick's body as she stepped back to look at him . The pair looked like they were worse for wear as they strolled along the beach arm-in-arm and even appeared to hold hands momentarily during the walk. Patrick was dressed comfortably for the occasion as he wore a pair of blue board shorts with sharks printed all over them, a white fedora and a navy T-shirt tied around his neck. The sorority girl did not occupy all of the young star's time as he was seen chatting it up with another male friend as he shaded his head with the navy top. Cosying up: The model was arm-in-arm with the bikini-clad brunette beauty as they strolled on the sand . Home Wrecking Ball: Patrick and the brunette were seen hand-in-hand at one point . Arm-in-arm: The pair seemed practically insperable during the outing . Comfortable: The mystery brunette draped her arm around the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger of Maria Shriver as they enjoyed the afternoon of partying . Touchy feely: Patrick's friend put her hands on his hips as she took a look at the sharks printed on his swim shorts . Not seen on the outing as he frolicked on the beach with the mystery woman was Patrick's 22-year-old girlfriend Miley. Patrick took to his Twitter on Monday to respond to Miley's loyal fanbase lambasting him over his close encounters with the woman with a series of tweets. He wrote: 'Omg. It's one of my best friends girlfriend...' Then he maintained that he would never betray someone he's in a relationship with as he tweeted: 'Would NEVER do anything against my GF.....' Chugging along: Patrick appeared to be taking body shots as the USC student enjoyed his spring break . Shots shots shots! The model placed his mouth on the navel of the mystery girl wearing a black bikini . Bad taste in your mouth: A man squeezed a lime on the frame of the woman as Patrick finished up his shot . Lastly, he clarified that males and females can have platonic relationships:  'Girls have guy friends and guys have friends that are girls...' The trip comes at an interesting time for The Grown Ups 2 star as last week it was reported that he and his ladylove have been telling friends that they will get married some day. Fit: The son of Arnold showed off his physique by going shirtless in a pair of navy blue boardshorts with sharks printed all over it and a white fedora . Friendly: The mystery woman seems to be a friend from USC as she donned a headband with Kappa Kappa Gamma emblazoned on it, which is a sorority from the university . Spring break: No doubt the model was in high spirits as he beamed while spending his afternoon at the hotspot . According to a Thursday TMZ report, things may have originated as a 'hook up' between the two but things are getting serious as the pop princess is trying to clean up her image in order to win over his mother Maria. Miley and Patrick, who have been dating for over five months, have now apparently grown so close that they're comfortable seriously talking about a future together. The couple even shared a cosy dinner date with the 59-year-old American journalist Maria on Wednesday night as she was dressed much more sensibly than her scantily-clad stage ensembles. Feeling it: Patrick appeared to be a bit worse for wear as he seemingly could barely keep his eyes open . Hanging out: The brunette did not monopolize his time as he hung out with another male friend . Three's a crowd: His pal put his arm around him as the two shared a laugh together . The wild child is said to be trying to rein in her hard-partying ways - which she has mainly shared with Patrick in previous months - to help get Maria on side. At first, it was rumoured that Maria did not approve of the relationship and allegedly banned her from attending the annual Kennedy Christmas party. Terminator actor Arnold, on the other hand, rang in the new year with the boisterous two piece when they partied in Las Vegas and appeared to be on board with the pairing. All in good fun: The actor also hung out with a friend who had a marijuana leaf emblazoned on his headband . Out with the boys: Patrick chatted with his male chums as the brunette beauty did not stray too far . Shady: The Grown Ups 2 star chatted with his male companion as he covered his head with a navy blue top . Before dating Miley, Patrick reportedly dated another USC mate named Tootsie Burns. The pair were spotted on a few outings together including one where she and a few gal pals visited him at his Blaze Pizza restaurant. On Monday afternoon, Miley took to social media for the first time since the suspecting photos were released but opted not to personally discuss the matter. Instead she posted a bizarre photo of her with a male friend as pubic hair was animated on their nude-coloured ensembles. Heating up: Though she was not seen on the outing, things are reportedly getting serious between Patrick and 22-year-old girlfriend Miley, as they were pictured together at a Pre-Grammy Gala in LA last month . Bizarre: Miley took to Instagram on Monday afternoon to put this image of she and a male friend wearing nude-coloured ensembles with pubic hair super imposed on it along with a long caption about how she's blessed to have the pal in her life, ending the message with: 'Feeling supaaaa blisssssed or maybe I'm juzzzz stoned'","The son of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver is enjoying his USC's spring break in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico .

"A freshman senator who spearheaded a letter to Iranian leaders, cautioning them that any deal negotiated by the Obama administration would not outlast the current president, defended his actions on Tuesday as necessary to prevent the Middle Eastern country from becoming nuclear capable. 'They’ve been killing Americans for 35 years, they’ve killed hundreds of troops in Iraq, now they control five capitols in the Middle East,'Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Tuesday on MSNBC. 'They are nothing but hardliners in Iran and if they do all of those things without a nuclear weapon, imagine what they would do with one.' Cotton's remarks came after Vice President Joe Biden, the official president of the Senate and a former representative for Delaware to the upper chamber, sent out a biting statement Monday evening accusing letter signers of acting 'beneath the dignity' of their office. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'They’ve been killing Americans for 35 years, they’ve killed hundreds of troops in Iraq, now they control five capitols in the Middle East,' Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Tuesday on MSNBC program Morning Joe while defending his controversial letter to Iranian leaders . The letter, signed by 47 Republican senators, told Iranians the Senate will 'consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei.' Reminding the foreign government that U.S. President Barack Obama is ineligible for a third term and will leave office in January 2017, ' the GOP lawmakers said 'most of us will remain in office well beyond then – perhaps decades.' In previewing the letter to Bloomberg, Cotton said Monday 'Iran's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that … any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril.' The White House, State Department and Democratic leaders denounced the audacious move and warned that it could have the intended effect - the dismantlement of the Obama and other world leaders' blossoming agreement with Tehran. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it 'undermines' negotiations. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said it 'certainly interferes' with ongoing talks. Republicans' effort to 'essentially throw sand in the gears here is not helpful,' Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing on Monday. Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at Republicans on Monday night in a statement distributed to reporters through the White House's massive press list. The message, 'expressly designed to undercut a sitting President in the midst of sensitive international negotiations, is beneath the dignity of an institution I revere,' Biden said, arguing that he had never seen anything like it during his thirty-six years in the Senate. 'I cannot recall another instance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country—much less a longtime foreign adversary— that the President does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them,' he said. 'This letter sends a highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our Commander-in-Chief cannot deliver on America’s commitments—a message that is as false as it is dangerous.' Firing back at the VP on Tuesday morning during an appearance on Morning Joe, Cotton said if Biden 'respects the dignity of the institution of the Senate he should be insisting that the president submit any deal to approval of the Senate, which is exactly what he did on numerous deals during his time in Senate.' He also attacked Biden's foreign policy credentials. 'Joe Biden, as Barack Obama’s own secretary of defense has said, has been wrong about nearly every foreign policy and national security decision in the last 40 years,' Cotton said in remarks captured by Politico. The Arkansas lawmaker was referring to former DOD head Robert Gates, who deprecated Biden in a memoir released after he exited Obama's cabinet. Biden, another likely candidate for president in 2016, is a former chairman of the Senate's Foreign Relation's Committee. He was initially added to Obama's ticket in 2008 to counter the freshman senator's relative lack of experience with world affairs. He was not alone in his condemnation of his former colleagues' actions. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Republicans' 'very blatant effort to undermine the legitimacy' of the president and 'disrespect' his as a negotiator is 'unconscionable.' They essentially said the president 'doesn't speak for the Constitution,' he told CNN Tuesday morning. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine lambasted Cotton and his co-signers Tuesday on the Senate floor, even while conceding that he partially agrees with their position. 'I share many of the concerns of my colleagues, the 47 who wrote the letter,' Kaine said. 'But I deeply believe, ' he added, 'we should not try to tank a deal, critique a deal, undercut a deal, before there is a deal. ' He criticized Cotton without naming him, for writing 'to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state.' 'The message that is communicated to the American public and to the world is, we will never accept any deal,' he said of the letter. 'We are not interested in diplomacy. We are not interested in negotiation.' 'And that attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of Iran, which is currently engaging in terrorist activity. Thy would want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent the United States that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith.' Iran's foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said Tuesday, 'This kind of communication is unprecedented and undiplomatic.' 'In fact it implies that the United States is not trustworthy,' he said according to Iran's state-run news site. The letter, signed by 47 Republican senators, told Iranians the Senate will 'consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei' The White House on Monday reproached senators for acting outside 'the role our Founding Fathers envisioned Congress for to play when it comes to foreign affairs' and questioned the 'wisdom of their strategy.' 'The rush to war, or at least the to the military option that many Republicans are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the United States,' Earnest said. Republicans have not specifically lobbied for military engagement with Iran, but its the White House's view that war could come about if world leaders do not at least attempt to negotiate a deal with Iran in good faith. Psaki contended Monday that senators wrongly implied that they have any say over a possible agreement. 'Congress doesn't have the power to alter the conditions of international arrangements negotiated by the executive,' she said. Additionally, the State Department is of the opinion 'that this letter, designed to score political points, ignores the fact that executive agreements between countries provide things like protections for troops, that we rely on every day, allows for the basing of American service members overseas, allows for us to obstruct the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on the high seas,' she said. While it is true that Congress does not currently have the authority to authorize the pact as it's not technically a treaty, the Senate will soon vote on a bipartisan measure that would give the legislative body the power of review over any package the administration offers Iran. And, as Cotton noted Tuesday morning on CNN's New Day, several of the Republican senators who lent their name to the letter are considering presidential bids and could, in two years, potentially be calling the shots in the Oval Office. 'I welcome even Hillary Clinton to join us because I suspect she might have reservations about this ill-fated nuclear deal as well,' he said, name-checking the Democratic front-runner for president. Vice President Joe Biden, pictured here at the International Association of Firefighters Legislative Conference and Presidential Forum on Monday, sent out a biting statement that evening accusing letter signers of acting 'beneath the dignity' of their office . From left, Secretary of State John Kerry, Biden and National Security Adviser Susan Rice listen as President Barack Obama meets with European Council President Donald Tusk in the Oval Office on Monday. The State Department said the GOP's letter to Iran 'undermines' nuclear negotiations. The White House said it 'certainly interferes' with ongoing talks . Asked about the GOP senators' attempt to undercut his foreign policy strategy on Monday, Obama said he thought it was 'ironic' that they were aligning themselves with Iran's hardliners, who also don't want a deal to go through. In his unusually long statement, Biden said the senators' letter, sent 'in the guise of a constitutional lesson, ignores two centuries of precedent and threatens to undermine the ability of any future American President, whether Democrat or Republican, to negotiate with other nations on behalf of the United States.' 'Around the world, America’s influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments.' The United States must 'maintain our credibility and global leadership even as Presidents and Congresses come and go,' he wrote. 'The decision to undercut our President and circumvent our constitutional system offends me as a matter of principle,' he continued. 'As a matter of policy, the letter and its authors have also offered no viable alternative to the diplomatic resolution with Iran that their letter seeks to undermine.' Republicans have said that instead of diplomatic negotiations and a deal that would allow Iran to continue working toward a peaceful nuclear program, they would like to bury the country with sanctions until it completely abandons its Uranium enrichment program. Blumenthal said Tuesday that Cotton and other legislators had polarized and undermined a bipartisan coalition of senators 'which is now in tatters' that were demanding the White House allow the Senate to have the final say over any deal it negotiated with Tehran. The Democratic senator said he was determined to 'stitch it back together,' however. Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said the irony of the situation was that the Senate's bill, sponsored by Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, requiring congressional oversight was headed toward a veto-proof majority before this. Now, Republican have 'blown that,' he said on CNN, and 'literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.'","Arkansas' Tom Cotton authored the letter that was signed by 47 Republican senators and sent to Iranian leaders on Monday .

"A Texas man who's finally no longer required to pay child support after 13 years of bank-breaking wage garnishment still owes the state $21,000 in back payments. And the girl isn't even his. Willie Carson says he suffered for years as he struggled to make monthly payments and now that it's been proven he can't possibly be father to the girl, who he's also never even met, he may still be forced to pay up. Expensive mistake: Willie Carson of Houston, Texas has had his wages garnished for some 13 years because he was erroneously included on a girl's birth certificate . According to Texas state law, he's required to pay any outstanding payments owed, as well as any accrued interest. All this, despite DNA tests proving unequivocally Carson is not the father and all because he was initially named on the birth certificate by the mother. 'I've never seen the child. I never spoke to the child. I don't know what the child looks like,' Carson told MyFoxHouston. Nonetheless, because of his garnished paychecks, he says: . 'There were days that I didn't eat. I went without electricity.' Carson has a court appearance on Monday, one he hopes will save him from losing all his hard earned cash to what amounts to a clerical error. 'I'm hoping for it but the judge has the last say so,' he said. In Texas, the answer is: when the man is finished paying. The termination of the man’s parental rights ends the obligation to pay future support, as of the date the order is rendered. However, the order does not eliminate any child support obligations before that date or any interest that has accrued. The man is still responsible for arrears that accrued up to the termination date, as well as for interest that accrues after the termination date. SOURCE: Texas Attorney General . Law not on his side: 'I'm hoping for it but the judge has the last say so,' Carson said as he discussed whether he'll be off the hook for his outstanding balance . The state of Texas voted to allow DNA proof to reverse parental rights, whereas it had previously been next to impossible. However, the law was written to work forward, not backward. And there are no refunds. So, the woes of people like Carson who've already had trouble paying child support will continue as they struggle to keep up with mounting interest on back payments. And Carson is far from alone. Another Texas man, Ray Thomas, reached out to KHOU in 2011 to discuss the very same predicament. The Texas man owed even more than Carson, though. He owed back child support amounting to $50,000, $13,000 of which was interest. I don t understand the judge can just give you a baby that ain't yours, Thomas said at the time. You are not the father: Carson and his ex are both totally positive he isn't the 13-year-old girl's father, but the law in this situation does not look backward--what's done is done and Carson's debts, at least for now, must still be fulfilled . The girl's mother has written to authorities to say Carson should not be forced to pay support and they agreed. However, state law requires he pay the back payments plus accrued interest .","Willie Carson of Houston, Texas has had his wages garnished for some 13 years because he was erroneously included on a girl's birth certificate .
The girl's mother has now written to authorities and now Carson's 401K is no longer frozen and he no longer must pay child support .
However, Texas law requires Carson must still pay his $21,000 unpaid support and any interest accrued after the termination date ."
"A 17-year-old who was forced to have chemotherapy against her will is now in remission, according to sources close to her case. Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but did not want to receive the recommended treatment. But in January a court decided that she must have the chemotherapy at Connecticut Children's Medical Center - she was not able to make the decision as she is not legally mature enough. Cassandra Fortin, a 17-year-old who was forced to have chemotherapy against her will is now in remission, according to sources close to her case (file photo) Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but did not want to receive the recommended treatment (file photo) On Sunday the Department of Children and Families Commissioner Joette Katz said in a statement released: 'We are very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. 'We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life .' Doctors said the chemotherapy would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival, but without it there was a near-certainty of death within two years. Her mother Jackie Fortin said: 'She has always - even years ago - said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body' Cassandra underwent chemotherapy at the Connecticut Children's Medical Centre (pictured) Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. Several other states recognize the 'mature minor doctrine', but the court said she did not understand the severity of her condition. She will have to wait until she turns 18 in September before she can make her own medical decisions. Cassandra was diagnosed in September and after initial surgery failed, she was given two rounds of chemotherapy. She then asked for treatment to be stopped and, in order to avoid further trips to hospital, ran away from home. Her mother Jackie Fortin supported her choice but the DCF claimed custody of the girl and took the case to court. 'It's a question of fundamental constitutional rights-- the right to have a say over what happens to your body-- and the right to say to the government 'you can't control what happens to my body,' Cassandra's mother's attorney, Michael S. Taylor, told Fox CT. Her mother told NBC Connecticut that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want 'poison' in her body. 'She has always—even years ago—said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body,' Ms Fortin explained. She was then returned to Connecticut Children's Medical Center to start chemotherapy. 'CCMC reported to the Department of Children and Families that I was not giving medical attention to my daughter,' said Ms Fortin. Writing for the Hartford Courant, Cassandra said: 'This experience has been a continuous nightmare. 'I want the right to make my medical decisions. 'It's disgusting that I'm fighting for a right that I and anyone in my situation should already have. 'This is my life and my body, not DCF's and not the state's. I am a human — I should be able to decide if I do or don't want chemotherapy. 'Whether I live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone's choice but mine.' She added: 'I believe there's a natural way or at least an alternative to chemo out there that I am willing to look for and explore. 'Not that it would cure the cancer but it may help it.'","Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, ordered to undergo chemotherapy .

"The devastated mother of an alleged rapist who was dragged from a prison by an angry Indian mob and stripped naked through the street refuses to accept her son was a rapist. Zubaida Khan, 60, cannot accept her son is now dead after a mob broke into a prison and dragged him out to be beaten on the streets. It comes as police arrested 18 people in Nagaland state, but it was unclear if they were directly involved in the killing of Syed Faird Khan, also known as Sharif, whose body was then strung up to a clock tower on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Khan's mother Zubaida Begum and his brother Syed Sarif Uddin Khan comfort each other after hearing of his death by lynch mob . Khan, 60, cannot accept her son is now dead after a mob broke into a prison and dragged him out to be beaten on the streets . Mrs Khan spoke of her devastation saying: ‘I want my son back, he cannot die, and he cannot leave me. I want him back' Khan's brother, Syed Jamal Khan, said he was innocent and accused police of trying to falsely implicated him of rape . Speaking from the family home in Karimganj, in the state of Assam, Mrs Khan said: ‘I want my son back, he cannot die, and he cannot leave me. I want him back.’ The widow and mother of seven can barely speak through the grief. Sharif’s youngest brother, Syed Naseeruddin Khan, 28, said the family feels guilty for not being able to help him. He said: ‘My mother collapsed after hearing the news of his death, she’s not stopped crying. ‘She kept shouting and screaming and demanding to see him. We’re terrified of leaving the house in case the mob come for us too.’ According to police Khan had been accused of raping a 19-year-old student on February 23 at a hotel in Dimapur, in the state of Nagaland, eastern India. A mass protest erupted against the rape charges on Thursday and an Indian mob broke into Dimapur Central Jail and managed to pull out Sharif before beating him on the streets. The mob stripped him naked and paraded him through the town before he was beaten to death and his body hung from a clock tower in the heart of Dimapur. They also set fire to homes and shops in an area where the suspect ran his business. Naseeruddin said they burnt many of the family’s cars and properties. He explained: ‘Our shop with seven cars in Dimapur was ruined, they were set on fire and looted. ‘We were all terrified for our lives; we left the city as the protests started. We fled to our ancestral family home in Assam. We thought we were in danger too.’ Several thousand people gathered as alleged rapist Syed Farid Khan (pictured, top) was mercilessly beaten to death by a lynch mob. Police have now arrested 18 people who were part of the frenzied mob . The gang overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man before beating him to death . Police say they are now verifying if the men arrests besides being part of the mob were also involved in the lynching . The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Khan had given her 5,000 ($80) rupees after the attack in return for her silence . Sharif married his wife Holy Begum, 27, ten years ago and they had two children, but their son died in 2009. They now have a three-year-old daughter Sneha. Naseeruddin said: ‘We just can’t believe our brother was a rapist. ‘The girl told us that if we paid her 2 Lakh Rupees (£2,000) she would withdraw the case. We are sure this was just an attempt to get money out of our family because we have done well for ourselves.’ Naseeruddin, who has another brother serving in the Indian Army's Assam Regiment, said that he and his family left the city for fear of their lives but Sharif’s wife Holy tried to save her husband as the mob beat him. He added: ‘Holy is from Nagaland state so she felt safer and she could stay. She told us that when she heard about the mob she ran into town but the mob wouldn’t let her pass, they stopped her from getting to him. ‘We feel very bad that we could not help him. We could’ve saved him if we had got to him. ‘Sharif was a wonderful person, he loved his wife a lot and we cannot believe he would ever rape anyone. We demand justice for my brother. We demand a CBI enquiry into this case and we’re hoping the Assam Government will support us. Protesters in Tinsukia demonstrate against the mob killing of a man accused of rape in neighbouring Nagaland state . 'If we do not get justice, my mother would die. She is unable to accept that he is no more.’ The family is now waiting for Holy to arrive in their village with Sharif’s body today. Meanwhile, Inspector General of Police Wabang Jamir confirmed: 'So far we have arrested 18 people for rioting and unlawful assembly.' 'We are now verifying if besides being part of the mob they were also directly involved in the lynching.' 'We have already identified many more people (for arrest) from videos and photos (of the incident on social media.' The lynching comes as India is in the midst of a raging controversy over a government order to ban the broadcast of a documentary about the December 2012 fatal gang-rape of a young student in New Delhi. Indian women protest for women's safety and equality, and call for severe punishment of men convicted of rape, on the eve of International Women's Day in Ahmedabad . Activists of the Communists Party of India burn an effigy representing the rapists of Delhi student, Nirbhaya during their protest in Hyderabad . India has seen an outpouring of anger over frightening levels of violence against women since the 2012 attack, which sparked shock both within India and around the world. But the lynching is also linked to ethnic tensions within Nagaland, whose indigenous groups have for years accused growing numbers migrants from Bangladesh of illegally settling on their land and eating into resources. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Khan had given her 5,000 ($80) rupees after the attack in return for her silence. 'It was only after the incident, he gave me the money to keep silent, so I took the money and gave it to the police station,' the woman told the NDTV network. Mr Jamir said the women’s initial medical report “confirmed rape and other injuries on her body”.","Police have arrested 18 people who were part of a lynch mob in India .

"Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don’t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website.

Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece – such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet – have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop’s advice. 'Although not as ""sexy"" as ""anti-inflammatory diets"" and ""magical cures"", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website’s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic’s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a ‘magical cure’ for morning sickness – while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation – Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004 . Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion size' however, and recommends 'avoiding fast foods, overly processed foods, and sugared sodas'. One of us: While critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years, Ms Paltrow, pictured last week in Hong Kong, recently insisted she was 'incredibly close to the common woman' In regards to recommended weight gain, Dr Salber admits: 'There is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy. 'It depends on whether you are normal, over, or underweight to start with.' 'Normal weight women should gain between 25-35 pounds, underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds, and overweight between 15-25 pounds. Obese women should gain slightly less, between 11-20 pounds. Other kernels of advice offered up by Ms Vlachonic in her recent Goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day, and plenty of time spent in the 'bathtub, a pool, or the sea.' She even helpfully suggests: 'The crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you’re pregnant!' Repeat offender: Goop (pictured) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice, not to mention outrageously expensive products . This is far from the first time Goop has been criticized for its questionable health advice. In January, Ms Paltrow came under fire for suggesting women partake in 'vaginal steams', which she said 'cleanse your uterus' and 'balance female hormone levels'. This information was slammed by doctors, some who even suggested the practice might be harmful. Just this week, Ms Paltrow defended herself in the face of long-standing criticism surrounding Goop's expensive and unattainable content. Speaking to CNN Money, she said: 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.'","Mother-of-two Gwyneth Paltrow enlisted her go-to 'pain expect', Vicky Vlachonis, to write the tips on her lifestyle website, Goop .

"Real estate mogul Donald Trump, a day after announcing he'll form a presidential exploratory committee, told activists on Thursday his business experience makes him the best candidate to reform Washington. 'We need people in Washington that know how to make a deal,' said Trump, who is considering a bid for the Republican nomination. Trump spoke at the home of New Hampshire state Rep. Steve Stepanek. Although Trump's critics say he would bring an unflattering and circus-like atmosphere to Republican politics, many people in the crowd said they appreciate the reality TV star's willingness to say exactly what he thinks. PRESIDENT 'THE DONALD'? Trump is shaking all the right hands in New Hampshire, an important early primary state, as he makes the case that he should run for the White House . I'M HIRING MYSELF: Trump was stumping for other candidates but his political operatives have told Daily Mail Online that he's serious about self-financing a his own campaign . 'A man that has the ability to handle the press, play with them and hold his ground, I have tremendous respect for that,' said Lori Davis, vice president of the GOP committee in Weare. 'He's not afraid.' Trump has repeatedly flirted with a presidential run, but he has recently begun hiring staff in early voting states, including New Hampshire. He did not stop to speak with reporters after the event Thursday but said as he got into a black SUV that he has a 'better chance than anybody' of beating former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic favorite for the nomination. Trump shook a few hands as he headed toward the door rather than staying to mingle with the crowd of state lawmakers and activists. Earlier in the day, he attended private meetings with a group of New Hampshire veterans and Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas. Trump's pitch to the crowd centered on his career as a businessman. Unlike some of his potential Republican rivals, he said, he would not cut entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicaid. 'I would make this country so rich that you wouldn't have to cut it,' he said. HILLARY WHO? He said he's the best-positioned Republican to send Hillary Clinton packing in 2016 . Trump also suggested to the crowd that Wall Street financiers – he called many of them 'horrible people' – would negotiate better on the world stage than existing U.S. diplomats. His comments reflected the brash style that many in the audience said they'd like to see more of in Washington. 'I not only like it, I admire it,' said Randy Heller, an independent voter from Barrington. 'Many great men have high self-confidence.'","'The Donald' is expected to make an earnest run for president after flirting with the idea in 2012 .
'We need people in Washington that know how to make a deal,' said the business titan .
Critics don't like the circus atmosphere a Trump candidacy might bring, but supporters say he's self-confident and plain-spoken ."
"Victim: Martin Richard, eight, bled to death during the attack at the Boston Marathon in April 2013 . Jurors sobbed in court today as a medical examiner detailed the horrific and painful injuries suffered by eight-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the Boston bombings. Testifying in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Monday, Massachusetts' Chief Medical Examiner Dr Henry Nields, who performed the child's autopsy, revealed Martin had suffered injuries to nearly every part of his body. Dr Nields was the last witness for the prosecution before it rested its case on Monday. Martin's parents, Bill and Denise Richard, were also in court. They had been at the marathon finish line with their three children when Martin was killed and their daughter, Jane, lost a leg. 'Cause of death was blast injuries to torso and extremities,' Dr Nields said, adding that Martin died primarily from loss of blood. Shrapnel - including small nails, plastic, pellets and wood - from one of the homemade pressure cooker bombs set off by Tsarnaev and his older brother had punched through the boy's 69-pound body. He suffered a six-inch-by-six-inch wound to his left abdomen, which exposed his intestines, and caused damage to his liver, left kidney, spleen and two ribs, Dr. Nields said. 'There was also a perforation of his lower spine,' Dr Nields said, indicating that shrapnel had passed through the child's body and exited through his back. Scroll down for video . Lurking: On Monday, this new image was released showing the Richard family watching the race while Tsarnaev stand behind a tree. It shows just how close he came to the family before killing their son . Violent: Evidence taken from the body of another victim, Krystle Campbell, shows the size of the pieces of shrapnel from the bombs. The victims also had nails, wood and plastic inside their bodies . His left arm had also nearly been torn off and his left leg suffered a broken bone and lacerations. The youngster also suffered third-degree burns as well as scrapes to his head and neck. 'Overall, the injuries... would be painful,' Dr Nields said. As well as presenting the jury with a picture of the child's body - which the public and the boy's parents did not see - the medical examiner also showed them multiple pieces of shrapnel found embedded in his tissue and bones, including nails, plastic, pellets and wood. He also showed the jury clothing Martin had been wearing on the day of the blast. Among them, the boy's Patriots football t-shirt and Boston Celtics jersey both showed large tears on their left sides where he had suffered the huge wound to his abdomen. His shorts had melted in the explosion, while his belt had been used as a tourniquet to try to save his left arm, Dr Nields said. Devastated: Jane Richard, left, lost her left leg in the blast. She is pictured with her family during a wreath laying ceremony to commemorate the one year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing . Heartbroken: Bill and Denise Richard, pictured with their daughter Jane and sons Henry (left) and Martin, were in court to hear how the eight-year-old boy passed away. They did not view photos of his autopsy . Martin was one of three people killed on April 15, 2013, while more than 260 others suffered injuries. On Monday morning, the bomber's lawyer, Miriam Conrad, suggested that Tsarnaev did not purposefully target Martin and his younger sister Jane. He put the bag near, not behind, the children, Conrad said - but prosecutors suggested he purposefully placed it by the children and even looked back at them after the blast. The heartbreaking testimony came after the jury heard how another victim, Lingzi Lu, suffered 'very painful' gaping leg wounds from chunks of shrapnel and bled to death within minutes. 'Her injuries were caused by debris hitting her body and going through her body,' Boston medical examiner Katherine Lindstrom said. 'They would have been very painful.' Lu, a 23-year-old Chinese national and graduate student at Boston University, had been watching the marathon near the finishing line with friends when the bombs detonated. Victim: Lingzi Lu, 23, was likely conscious after suffering painful leg injuries when two bombs detonated at the Boston Marathon in 2013. On Monday, the jury in her killer's trial heard graphic details of her death . Chaos: She suffered a devastating injury to her femoral artery after the blast (pictured) and likely passed away within minutes, the medical examiner told the jury at the trial on Monday . Shrapnel punched through her legs, leaving multiple wounds, including one that was seven inches long, Dr Lindstrom testified. She said Lu's femoral artery in her left leg was essentially cut in half, causing her to bleed to death. Loss: Krystle Campbell, 29, also died in the attack . 'It would have been not immediate, but relatively quickly, seconds to minutes,' she said, adding that Lu did not suffer any head injuries so likely would've been conscious the whole time. When her body arrived for autopsy, there were still two belts around her leg where someone had attempted to stop her from bleeding out, Dr Linstrom said, the Boston Globe reported. Inside the injuries, the medical examiner found debris including shrapnel with jagged edges, round metal pellets, small nails, plastic and fabric, she said. Photos of Lu's body were shown to the jury. A legal secretary was seen wiping away tears during the testimony, according to a Boston Globe reporter in the courtroom. Last Thursday, the jury also heard testimony on the death of 29-year-old restaurant manager Krystle Campbell. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with the bombing attack, as well as shooting Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier dead three days later. His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died that night after a gunfight with police that ended when Dzhokhar ran him over with a hijacked car. Defense lawyers opened the trial last month with a blunt admission that Tsarnaev, a native Chechen, had done everything federal prosecutors claimed. But they contended he did so out of a sense of subservience to his older brother, rather than his own anger at his adopted country. On trial: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured left in a photo submitted for evidence, is on trial for carrying out the deadly bombings with his older brother, Tamerlan, right, who later died during a shootout with police . By painting Tamerlan as the driving force behind the attacks, the defense aims to spare the younger Tsarnaev a death sentence and secure him a life sentence instead. After the prosecution calls its last witness, the defense will have a chance to call its own witnesses, which could include Tsarnaev himself. But they will be limited in how much evidence they put forward about the relative blame of the two brothers before the jury determines whether their client is guilty of the charges he faces. If the jury does find him guilty, the trial will enter a penalty phase, when both sides will call another round of witnesses before the same jury determines whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death or to life in prison without the possibility of parole.","WARNING: GRAPHIC DETAILS .

"A protester has been banned from all Qantas and Jetstar flights after staging a protest to stop the deportation of a Tamil asylum seeker on her flight. Jasmine Pilbrow received an email from Qantas condemning the political statement and saying her 'actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group'. Ms Pilbrow boarded the plane objecting to the transfer and deportation of Puvaneethan, a 25-year-old refugee, who she believed would face persecution upon arriving back in Sri Lanka. Scroll down for video . Ms Pilbrow boarded the flight intent on stopping a Tamil asylum seeker from being sent back to Sri Lanka . Three people have been banned from flying with Qantas after a making a political statement against the deportation of a Tamil asylum seeker . 'If he is sent back to Sri Lanka, he is likely to be imprisoned and tortured,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald. Upon boarding the flight Ms Pilbrow refused to take her seat until Puvaneethan was taken off the plane and returned to the Melbourne Immigration Detention Centre. Ms Pilbrow says she learnt of her ban after reading an article published by Fairfax Media last Tuesday. Jasmine discovered she was banned from Qantas flights after reading an article in The Age . Standing by her convictions: Ms Pilbrow  makes a speech during the International Day of Peace . 'I tried to follow up on the ban but there was no number for me to call. When I called Qantas headquarters they sent me to customer service who told me to fill out a form if I had a complaint about the ban,' Ms Pilbrow said, adding that she is seeking legal advice. 'Communication at Qantas needs to be fixed up.' Ms Pilbrow is not alone as two other passengers also received ban notices after deciding they would boycott the flight. Paul Leary, 51, and his female colleague were not involved in the protest but said they felt 'uncomfortable' upon learning of Puvaneethan's deportation. Mr Leary said he and a colleague felt faced with a 'moral dilemma.' After his female colleague decided she was not comfortable being on the plane Mr Leary also decided not to fly. 'We couldn't have been politer. We were travelling for business, we've both got executive roles in the organisation we work for… we were not aggravating or inciting other people,' Mr Leary told Daily Mail Australia. When he and his colleague were back inside the airport the federal police took their details but no one from Qantas informed them at that point of any kind of ban. Ms Pilbrown, Mr Leary and his colleague have also been banned from flying with Jetstar and Qantas affiliates . Flyers were handed out at Melbourne airport asking the public to save asylum seeker Puvaneethan from torture . It wasn't until Mr Leary was returning from Darwin four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to Melbourne with Qantas and was told he was subject to a no-fly ban. 'As a result of your actions on board QF838 from MELDRW on 2nd February, we have decided to issue you a No Fly Notification - Until Further Notice while the incident is investigated,' Qantas wrote. 'I still didn't hear anything by Monday and the only response I got was to submit a customer care complaint,' he added. After Mr Leary submitted his complaint he then received a formal letter on February 16 informing him of his ban. Paul Leary was issued with this 'no fly notification' after he walked off a flight from Melbourne to Darwin which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation . While Ms Pilbrow was dissatisfied by the way Qantas communicated the ban to her, she said it was not right for the other two passengers, who were not part of the protest, to also face a ban . Mr Leary has since complained to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal's human rights division saying the ban discriminates against him on the basis of his political belief. 'If alternatively there was no asylum seeker on the plane and I decided to accompany my colleague off the plane because she was ill I don't think I'd be banned. 'So the only reason I can see for this ban is my political beliefs… I'm not a known activist, I never have been. I'm in my fifties, I'm not a radical.' His female colleague is also  filing a complaint. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the passengers will remain on a no fly list until the incident has been investigated by the Australian Federal Police. 'As the incident is under investigation, it is not appropriate to comment further.' Ms Pilbrow says it is unfair that the other two passengers, who were not part of the protest, also received bans .","Jasmine Pilbrow protested against the deportation of an asylum seeker on a Qantas flight in February .

"Astronaut Scott Kelly's identical twin pulled a fast one on NASA right before his brother blasted off on a one-year space station mission by showing up at the launch without his usual mustache. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told Scott Kelly, who was heading into space, on Monday that he almost had a heart attack when his brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, showed up at the launch. 'He fooled all of us,' Bolden said. Mark Kelly's mustache was 'the only way I can tell you two apart', he told Scott. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Mark Kelly (left) is a retired astronaut while his identical twin brother, Scott Kelly (right), just left for another space mission and will be spending nearly a year in the International Space Station . While Scott (right) is in space, doctors will be studying him and Mark (left) to see how being in space affects the body and behaviors . Mustache-less Mark Kelly (bottom) had a chance to speak with the astronauts (top), including his brother Scott (top left) once they got to the International Space Station. Mark, a former space shuttle commander, was still clean shaven as of Monday afternoon, as he chatted with Bolden about the unprecedented medical experiments planned on the twins over the coming year. Doctors want to see how the space twin's body compares with his genetic double on the ground. In a series of ten investigations, doctors will look at the subtle differences that could occur between the brother on earth and the brother in space. Experiments will look at physiology, shifts in behavior, decision making and alertness, according to People. Scott Kelly arrived at the International Space Station on Friday night following a launch from Kazakhstan. He will remain on board for 342 days, until next March, with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. Mark (left), known for his mustache as a distinguishing factor between him and his brother, visited the space launch the day Scott (right) departed after shaving off his facial hair to fool NASA staff . It will be NASA's longest spaceflight ever. 'It's like coming to my old home,' said Kelly, who spent five months at the space station in 2010-2011. The White House sent congratulations to the astronauts on Monday. President Barack Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, wished Kelly, Kornienko and the rest of the crew the best of luck and noted that the yearlong mission is an important milestone on the path to sending humans to Mars in the mid-2030s. 'You guys are all heroes up there, and we're depending on you,' Holdren said in a phone hookup. Mark Kelly, meanwhile, paid tribute to the brothers' father, who stayed behind in Houston for last week's launch. Richard Kelly, a retired and widowed police officer, is the only parent to endure a child's rocket launch so many times - eight between the two. 'He's been a trouper,' Mark said. Since the men left for space, Mark had a chance to speak with the astronauts once they got to the International Space Station. In a Tweet he wrote, 'Got to talk to @StationCDRKelly & crewmates after they made it safely aboard the Space Station. Doing well so far!'

"A radio DJ has spoken of her nightmare being stalked by a man for 13 years - who would call her 66 times an hour and even threatened to throw acid in her face. Gail Sayles became so terrified of her stalker that she began to self-harm and was afraid to go in to work at Sunrise Radio, in Bradford, alone. The 40-year-old says she finally has her life back after enduring more than a decade of sickening harassment because of stalker Mohammed Basharat Feroz. Gail Sayles (pictured left and right, at work at Sunrise Radio) endured 'sheer hell' thanks to a stalker who harassed her for 13 years. Stalker Mohammed Basharat Feroz was detained indefinitely in hospital . Feroz, 55, was detained in hospital indefinitely last month after Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC ruled he posed a serious danger to the public and Sunrise Radio station in particular. Ms Sayles revealed seeing her stalker in court was only the second time she had seen him in person. But during years of what she described as 'sheer hell,' Ms Sayles said authorities had refused to act because he had never physically attacked her - until last year, when he threatened her with acid attacks and vowed to put her in a wheelchair. She said: 'This man has been in my life longer than my own husband. It's a huge weight off my shoulders as I can get on with my life. 'The calls would range from between 10 to 66 calls every hour. I once had 41 calls in 30 minutes. Ms Sayles says she became too afraid to go in to work at Sunrise Radio (pictured) in Bradford alone . She added: 'I was the only white person working at the station at the time so whether he fixated on that or the fact I was the only one answering I don't know but it was 13 years of sheer hell.' Ms Sayles, from Bradford, says the abuse started in 2001 after a rival business to Feroz's was advertised on Sunrise Radio. After his business went bust, Feroz appeared to blame the station - and as Ms Sayles was the only person answering the phones at the radio station at the time, she believes this is why he became fixated on her. 'He became fixated with me, I think, because I was the only one on the phones so he constantly spoke to me when he called,' she said. 'I had a police escort one night when I attended an election count for work. I didn't want to do my job anymore. It was so emotionally draining.' Feroz was jailed in 2004 for a campaign of harassment against a number of people. Ms Sayles was a witness in this trial, but she said he blamed his jail sentence entirely on her. The jail time failed to deter his actions and after losing his mother early last year, the abuse became more sinister. 'He threatened to rape me and to kill me,' she said. 'He would ring and ask if I could hear anything then I would hear what sounded like the loading of a gun. 'He even said I was a prostitute and that my boss was my pimp. It got so bad that my mum or dad had to take me to work. 'In March 2014, he told me he was going to wait for me and throw acid in my face - that was the final straw.' Feroz was found to be mentally unfit to plead a charge of stalking involving fear of violence in November last year - but a jury found he had committed the acts alleged. He appeared at Bradford Crown Court last month, where a judge ruled he be detained indefinitely in Lynfield Mount psychiatric hospital. Feroz appeared at Bradford Crown Court (pictured) last month, where a judge ruled he be detained indefinitely in Lynfield Mount psychiatric hospital . Ms Sayles added: 'I would urge anyone who is suffering with harassment of any sort to seek help. 'There are so many people who put up with this and feel helpless but they shouldn't. I stood up to my stalker and now I feel free.' Ms Sayles said she was supported by The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which helped her through 'the most difficult times'. Judge Durham Hall told Bradford Crown Court that Feroz was not a bad man, but a 'poorly' one. He said: 'The victim, the editor of Sunrise Radio, has been subjected to years of very intense unhappiness at the hands, or rather the words, of Mr Feroz. 'There has been a life-altering, intensely frightening, series of verbal attacks.'

"A fortnight ago, eight-year-old Janshir Issa gingerly stepped off a plane at Heathrow, his lips blue. It wasn’t the British weather that had turned them such a deathly colour: Syria – Janshir’s home country – can be just as cold in early spring. Rather, it was a combination of rare heart problems that meant blood was not getting around his body properly. In fact, it was receiving little over half the oxygen it should. Ever since birth, congenital heart defects meant Janshir was being slowly starved of air, much like a climber marooned at high altitude. Scroll down for video . On the mend: Jansir with his father Omar in London after being brought to Britain for a life-saving operation . And if that wasn’t enough, almost all he has ever known is war. Since Janshir was four, he and his family have had to live with the devastating conflict that has ripped Syria apart, claiming more than 200,000 lives in the process. Dodging bombs and bullets, his family first fled their Aleppo home just weeks before it was blown to bits by President Assad’s jets. Then they took refuge in a village near the Turkish border, only for it to become the focus of fierce fighting. Like thousands of other children, Janshir has spent time in a tented refugee camp too. Unsurprisingly, his health suffered – and his family frequently feared he would die. But today, thanks to a British charity which brought him here for a life-saving operation, Janshir looks like a different boy. In fact, just days after undergoing surgery at The Harley Street Clinic in London, he appears remarkably healthy. Like any impatient eight-year-old, he grabs a mobile phone from his father Omar – with whom he shares an unmistakable likeness – to show him how it really works. His eyes are bright – and his lips are pink. ‘Janshir is a walking miracle,’ says Emma Scanlan, chief executive of Chain of Hope, which brings children to Britain for heart surgery and conducts operating missions abroad. Devastation: A man walks with children in Jansir's home town of Aleppo after it was hit by bombs last year . ‘Most children in the UK with his condition, called Tetralogy of Fallot, would be treated on the NHS soon after birth. But he has been walking around with this for eight years, been bombed, and had to flee.’ Curling up on his father’s lap, shy Janshir simply says he is ‘happy’ to be recovering after his operation. It involved patching up a huge hole in his heart, widening a crucial vessel taking blood out of the heart, and correcting a narrow valve. The operation, performed without charge by consultant cardiothoracic surgeon Martin Kostolny, means his heart now pumps more efficiently. And thanks to the hole being closed, de-oxygenated ‘blue’ blood will no longer be mixed with fresh blood. Without it, Mr Kostolny says, Janshir’s life would have been ‘severely limited’. He would have got progressively weaker and would probably have died in early adulthood. Instead, he should now have ‘a fairly normal future’ and could even be up and playing football within weeks. ‘Children, in general, recover amazingly quickly after heart surgery,’ says Mr Kostolny. Mr Issa, a physics teacher, holds his son tight. ‘It was a race against time to get him here,’ he says. Aged three, Janshir was flown to France to be fitted with a stent to widen a heart opening, but the family knew that was a temporary fix. As daily life became more difficult, Janshir’s health went slowly downhill. By summer 2012, things had got so bad that Mr Issa decided to move the family out of Aleppo. ‘We fled with nothing except our clothes,’ says Mr Issa. The family, who are Kurds, took shelter in a village where they have roots. ‘Leaving Aleppo was awful, but a month after we left, the apartment block where we lived was bombed. We lost everything and heard friends of ours had been killed.’ But they could not escape the war. By early 2013 fighting had spread to their village near Azaz, close to the Turkish border, so they moved again – this time to a tented camp. A month later, with Janshir’s fragile health getting worse, the family returned to the village, only for Mr Issa to face interrogation by Kurdish fighters from a group called the YPK. Despite being a Kurd himself, they held him captive, asked him why he had left, and whose side he was really on. Homeless: The apartment block Jansir and his family were forced to flee before it was blown to bits by President Assad’s jets . ‘I was in prison for 25 days,’ he recalls. ‘I thought that they were going to kill me. They tortured me.’ All this time he could do nothing to help Janshir, who he desperately needed to take to Turkey to see a heart specialist. After being set free, he took the boy and made for the border, helped by guides. Father and son then spent months in Turkey, during which they visited a cardiologist who confirmed the extent of Janshir’s problems. But nobody could help and they were forced to return to Syria. Finally, last November Mr Issa’s brother Wahid, who lives in London, discovered Chain of Hope. Since being set up 20 years ago by pioneering heart surgeon Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, the charity has treated more than 2,000 children. Janshir and his family were in Syria when news filtered through that the operation would take place – prompting Mr Issa and his wife Awash, 31, to break down in tears. From there Janshir and his father travelled to Istanbul and caught a flight to London, accompanied by a Chain of Hope doctor as there were concerns over how Janshir would cope on the flight. The operation last Sunday went well and Janshir should soon be discharged. Mr Issa is now considering applying for asylum in the UK. At the moment, Janshir and his father are here on three-month medical visas. The charity stresses it does not get involved in immigration issues. While Janshir’s heart has been fixed, what his life now holds – like countless other Syrian children – remains uncertain.

"The Chive, an entertainment site which used photos of a former anorexic's recovery from her Reddit page without her permission, claiming they were an example of an 'amazing weight loss transformation', has issued her a public apology. 'We obviously had no idea Anne Marie had anorexia, but that doesn’t excuse the action at all. It was a mistake, completely unintentional,' the website stated, having left Anne Marie Sengillo, 27, from Cincinnati, Ohio, 'sickened' to see her photos used, in her words, 'as inspiration for a disorder that nearly killed me'. The Chive added: 'We had previously discovered the photo somewhere out there in the internet echo chamber, which contained no frame of reference whatsoever... The photo was removed the second we found out about it.' Wrong message: The Chive has apologized for  using photos Anne Marie Sengillo, 27, had posted of herself before anorexia struck (left) and at her sickest (right)  for an 'amazing weight loss' slideshow . The Chive used two photos Anne Marie had uploaded to Reddit, under the thread: 'My recovery from an eating disorder, updated' - and added them to a slideshow featuring 27 other similar snaps under the heading: 'These weight loss transformations are amazing.' The photo Anne Marie posted to her Reddit thread of herself dangerously thin at 90lbs was used as the 'after' snap in The Chive's weight loss slideshow, and the photo she posted of herself prior to her developing anorexia was used as the 'before' snap. As part of its apology, The Chive made sure to bring light to the intended nature of Anne Marie's photos. 'A few days ago, Anne Marie took the time to put together an inspirational gallery about how she overcame the disorder, even after relapsing,' it reads. 'There is an amazing positive in all this and we’re proud to share her story with the Chive Community and we hope it helps others who might be suffering from the disorder.' Apology: 'We obviously had no idea Anne Marie had anorexia, but that doesn’t excuse the action at all,' the website wrote as part of the above statement . Doing better: 'For them to put my disordered weight as ""ideal"" was a punch to the stomach for me,' said Anne Marie yesterday, pictured during her recovery, after posting the photos to Reddit to chart her progress . Speaking to Daily Mail Online about the publication's response, Anne Marie said: 'I am so pleased that they apologized and featured my story. 'I have no bad blood with them anymore and so happy that they owned up to the mistake! It takes a very strong person to admit when they are wrong, and even stronger when they admit it to a very popular site.' Yesterday, after Annie Marie was originally sent The Chive's article by a concerned Reddit member, and prior to its apology, she told Daily Mail Online: 'For them to put my disordered weight as ""ideal"" was a punch to the stomach for me. 'This disease left me bankrupt and almost killed me. I posted my photos to give hope to others who may have body image issues. The least I could get from The Chive is an apology. 'Anorexia took the best years of my life. To wake up to that image [on The Chive] - I cannot even begin to explain.' Yesterday, we posted a 28-photo gallery called These Transformations are Amazing on The Chive. One of the photos depicted a girl named Anne Marie in a dress who had lost weight, the photo had no text accompaniment whatsoever. As it turns out Anne Marie used to suffer from anorexia. We had previously discovered the photo somewhere out there in the internet echo chamber which contained no frame of reference whatsoever. We obviously had no idea Anne Marie had anorexia but that doesn’t excuse the action at all. It was a mistake, completely unintentional, and the photo was removed the second we found out about it. We usually don’t air these issues out in public, because I think the true apology belongs to Anne Marie personally, which we have also sent. We are deeply sorry for having posted this photo, but I’m posting this out here on The Chive because I think you should know about Anne Marie’s story. A few days ago, Anne Marie took the time to put together an inspirational gallery about how she overcame the disorder, even after relapsing. There is an amazing positive in all this and we’re proud to share her story with the Chive Community and we hope it helps others who might be suffering from the disorder. Deleted: The Chive  removed Anne Marie's snaps from their slideshow (pictured) 'the second' it realized its mistake . As it appeared: The Chive's post, was titled, 'These weight loss transformations are amazing' and featured 27 other people's 'before and after' snaps (pictured), the origin of which are unknown . Anne Marie weighed 150lbs in 2006, just before her disorder started to develop. A 'crash diet' sent her down a 'dark' path, however, and by 2007, she weighed just 70lbs - having lost more than half of her body weight. 'My dad died, and other c**p snowballed my weight loss into some monster of a thing,' she wrote on Reddit, explaining her worsening mental health. 'It started out innocently enough, but became a five-hour-a-day workout and 500 calories a day.' Anne Marie then shared photos of her recovery, as well as several relapses, and reveals that she was finally sent to a treatment center after a suicide attempt in 2013. Her progress since then has been up and down, and her treatment currently means she can't work, and is in $50,000 of medical debt. Road to recovery: Anne Marie, pictured (left) during a relapse and (right) at a healthier weight,  says her disorder almost killed her, and left her $50,000 in debt over medical expenses . Anne Marie finds it extremely frustrating that she can't work, so this year, she started shoveling snow from sidewalks and driveways in her neighborhood - an act which earned her a spot on a Fox News segment. 'I feel really bad taking taxpayers' money,' she says. 'I know I really need it to keep a roof over my head, but it doesn't make me feel any better about taking it. 'Doing things like shoveling my town makes me feel like I earned the money I have taken from my neighbors.' Anne Marie has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help raise funds to pay off her medical bills, which has so far gained $865 in donations.","The Chive added photos it had found of Anne Marie Sengille, 27, from Cincinnata, Ohio, to an 'amazing weight loss transformation' slideshow .

"The 26-year-old wife of former Real Housewives of New York star Aviva Drescher's 79-year-old father George Teichner has revealed intimate details about the couple's 'steamy' marriage, insisting that, despite their 53-year age gap, the couple's love life is more passionate than ever. Dana Lavette Cody, who married reality star George in an intimate ceremony in Malibu last year - which his daughter Aviva chose not to attend - explained to Daily Mail Online that, before meeting George, she was close to giving up on the idea of finding a soul mate who would live up to her standards. 'Before George, I only ever dated men my age or younger and I’d never had an orgasm,’ Dana, who is from Miami, says. Scroll down for video . Beach babes: Dana Lavette Cody, 26, married George Teichner, 79, in Malibu last year - and insists the couple are happier than ever, despite the 53-year age gap . Ageless love: Dana and George, pictured on their wedding day, met when George paid a visit to his wife's salon for a pedicure . ‘I began to think sex was overrated. But then I met a man 53 years older than me and finally I see what all the fuss is about. ‘My husband has the stamina of a 20-year-old. George thinks nothing of making love to me for at least five hours every night and he wears me out!’ The couple's unconventional romance began in March 2011, when George, who appeared on a number of episodes of Real Housewives before his daughter Aviva was fired from the reality series last year, walked into Dana's Miami salon for a pedicure. Thanks to his healthy tan, the manicurist admits that she thought the infamous playboy - who became renowned among Real Housewives viewers and castmembers alike for his 'sickening', 'inappropriate' and 'disgusting' behavior towards women - was as young as 60 years old. And when George asked her for an email address following his appointment, Dana insists that she had no idea he was looking to pursue anything other than a business relationship. But two months later, he surprised her by asking her out on a date. ‘I won’t lie, at first it never even crossed my mind to see George as anything other than a successful businessman who could help me grow my business,' she says. 'But I couldn't see the harm in in saying yes.’ The pair shared a romantic candlelit meal and Dana began to feel a mutual attraction. ‘The more time I spent with George, the more I began to fancy him,' she recalls. Happy couple: The pair married in an intimate ceremony on the beach in Malibu, which George's daughter, former Real Housewives of New York star Aviva Drescher, chose not to attend . Moving on: George's first wife, Aviva's mother, passed away a number of years ago . ‘I loved how intelligent, successful and charismatic he was and suddenly the age difference didn’t seem to matter so much.’ And while George's over-the-top sexual antics were the source of much horror among Aviva's Real Housewives co-stars, it seems to have worked wonders with Dana. About a month into their relationship the pair slept together for the first time, and Dana revealed that any concerns she had about their severe age gap quickly disappeared after the pair spent their first night together. ‘Until I met George I had never ever experienced an orgasm,' she admits. ‘But the first time we slept together, all that changed. I was so nervous. ‘I thought he might have a wrinkly body and need Viagra. But George’s physique is unbelievable as he works out every day – and Viagra was the last thing he needed. ‘He’d studied Tantric sex in India and I lost count of the number of times we had sex, but we were still at it when the sun came up. ‘He was so skilled, he blew my mind. I lost count of how many orgasms I had.' Ironically, while George's talents in the bedroom proved particularly effective when it came to wooing his wife, his playboy lifestyle seemed to have the opposite effect on the Real Housewives - and their viewers. Indeed, castmember Carole Radziwill once went as far as to say of the aging Lothario and his 'uncomfortable' behavior: 'The problem is he's so over the top, it's uncomfortable to watch. 'I love a good drama - whether a screaming match or a hair pulling - but I'm with the audience on this one: get George off the TV. Playboy: During his appearances on his daughter's reality show, George formed a reputation with her castmates for his overtly sexual behavior . Sun-filled fun: George and Dana insist that their age gap does not bother them . 'It's sickening to hear an old man sexually degrade women in all kinds of vile ways.' But despite his less-than-chivalrous behavior during his appearance on Real Housewives, it didn't take much for George to win Dana over - and the couple's relationship quickly began to go from strength to strength, despite the then-23-year-old not even knowing his real age. Despite knowing George was a widower with three daughters and two sons, all older than her, Dana admits that she didn't actually ask his real age until six months after the pair began dating. ‘By then I was so in love, I didn't care,' she admits. 'But on his birthday, I said to him, “Tell me the truth.” ‘He took a big drink of wine and took my car keys from me in case I ran away. Then he said: “I’m 77.” I was shocked. ‘So many things ran through my mind, about the prospect of having children with someone so much older, or the possibility of him dying years before me. ‘But I couldn't let age stand in the way of true happiness with my soul mate.’ In August 2013, George proposed during a family dinner at his daughter’s house and the happy couple tied the knot in a romantic ceremony on the beach in Malibu a year later. And while George's daughter Aviva, who was often forced to defend her father's shocking behaviour to her castmates, did not choose to attend the couple's wedding, Dana insists that the 44-year-old gave them 'full blessing' before they walked down the aisle. ‘George’s kids gave us their full blessing,' she explains. Family ties: Although Aviva (R) chose not to attend her father's wedding to Dana, the couple insist that the 44-year-old gave them her blessing . Motherhood: Aviva and her husband Reid Drescher (L) have two children together (pictured) 'After losing their mum, they are glad to see him so happy again. It was so romantic and afterwards we flew to Hawaii on honeymoon.’ But not everyone has been so thrilled for the couple. Dana admits that some friends have accused her of acting like a ‘prostitute’ in marrying George, who is reported to be worth about $50 million. ‘To this day, people point and snigger if they see us holding hands or kissing,' Dana admits. 'It did upset me, but I've grown a thicker skin and refuse to let some people’s small mindedness ruin our happiness. ‘George is not my sugar daddy. I am a successful woman in my own right. 'I didn't need looking after by a rich man before and I don’t now either. I married him for love. Anyone who spends five minutes with us will know we’re the real deal.’ Dana says that the pair are desperate to start a family as soon as possible - so desperate in fact, that George revealed during an appearance on Real Housewives that he has had his sperm frozen so that Dana can opt to have his children even after he has died. But Dana insists that she has put any fears about George dying before he gets to see their unborn child grow up to the back of her mind. ‘Of course I worry, but life is too short and for all I know, I could die before him,' she says. ‘I think I am the luckiest woman in the world to have found George. In our eyes love is not a number.'","Dana Lavette Cody married George in an intimate ceremony in Malibu last year .

"Gone: Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minneapolis, apartment building last Wednesday after school . Police in Minnesota say they believe the father of a missing 10-year-old boy hasn't been honest about his disappearance. Barway Collins was last seen after school March 18 near his apartment complex. Police said they were working to find the boy and were checking flights to see whether he might have been sent overseas to his mother, believed to be in Liberia. Chief Stephanie Revering said Barway's father, Pierre Collins, is now considered a suspect. Revering says Collins, who was seen wiping away tears at a vigil held for the boy Monday, was given a lie-detector test and 'we believe he was untruthful.' Police released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' Police want to identify the uncle. 'The father and the party described as an ‘uncle’ are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway’s father has not been completely truthful with us.' Dozens of relatives, friends and supporters came together Monday in Crystal, Minnesota, to plead for the safe return of Barway Edwin Collins.

Police say Pierre failed a lie-detector test and is not sharing everything he knows . Over the past five days, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies have been searching the area for Barway with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses. According to the Crystal Police Department, a man and woman pictured in a screen shot from a CCTV camera installed at the front entrance of the Cedarwood apartment complex may have witnessed Barway being dropped off from school. So far, the mystery couple have not been named as suspects or even persons of interest in the case. Chief Revering said Monday that an Amber Alert has not been issued for Barway because investigators believe he may be with a relative. Missing?

While law enforcement officials continued searching for the missing fourth-grader, members of Crystal's Liberian community were busy handing out fliers featuring Barway's picture to help bring him home. At around 5pm Monday, more than 100 people gathered outside Cedarwood apartments for an emotional prayer vigil. 'We miss Barway,' his father, Pierre Collins, told the crowd. 'Barway has been gone for a very long time now. We are begging and asking everyone to look out there.' Chief Revering also attended the gathering, promising Barway's family to continue looking for him until he is found, according to Minneapolis Star Tribune. Barway was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Mr Collins and his wife, Yamah, said the entrance surveillance camera caught their son opening the front door to the building, looking inside and then closing it, as if someone called him outside. 'Please just bring him back. We just want Barway back. We don't want anything from them. Just let him go. Just let him come home,' the parents begged, according to KARE11. Collins is described as 5 feet tall, weighing 80lbs with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, white T-shirt, black pants, red shoes and carrying a red school backpack.

"Google is trying to shake up the auto industry with more than self-driving cars, as a new service launched in California will help drivers shop for car insurance. It is thought that this could foreshadow the company's latest attempt to shake up a long-established industry and has raised questions as to whether Google may one day start selling policies. Called Google Compare for car insurance, the tool allows people to compare offerings from different insurance providers. The new service, unveiled on Thursday, compares auto insurance quotes from up to 14 carriers that are participating in the comparisons. Google has unveiled a new service to help California drivers shop for car insurance, which could be the company's first step towards really shaking up the market . To date 14 insurers are participating in the comparison site which sees Google take a cut from each sale which can be bought online or through an agent - the service is also mobile friendly . Google gets a cut from each sale, but the company said that the size of the commissions will not influence how it ranks the price quotes . The policies can then be bought online or through an agent and Google will receive a cut from each insurance sale. The Mountain View, California, company has said that the size of the commissions will not influence how it ranks the price quotes. Ellen Carney, an analyst for Forrester Research, wrote in January that Google may be making moves to ramp up its insurance knowledge base through an acquisition of San Francisco-based Coverhound. Coverhound has developed its own platform for consumers to shop for car insurance and an acquisition would also bring a lot of insurance market experience to Google. Some of the largest auto insurance providers, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and Geico, haven't joined Google's service. Progressive and Allstate's esurance.com also provide auto insurance price comparisons. It is thought that they fear that one day Google might compete with them, and no longer act as a middle-man. Google has a uniquely dominant position as a search provider through which it can potentially challenge the status quo in an industry. Carney pointed out that Google is learning about the industry as a step towards one day selling and underwriting its own policies. 'They are getting all the data that they need to do it,' Carney said. 'I think there is definitely more to come here.' However, a Google spokesperson said the company has no plans to sell or underwrite insurance. To date in the U.S. only drivers in California can use the service, but it is expected to be rolled out in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas among other states in the near future . The service follows the successful launch of a car insurance comparison tool in the U.K. in 2012. Analysts speculate that this is the first move by the company towards actually selling insurance . Google announced the service through its AdWords blog and highlighted some of the features that should make it attractive for both insurance providers and customers. 'Whether you're a national insurance provider or one local to California, people searching for car insurance on their phone or computer can find you along with an apples-to-apples comparison of other providers -- all in as little as 5 minutes,' said Google. 'You can highlight what makes your business unique, whether that's an ""A"" rating in customer service or better discounts for safe drivers. And when users adjust their deductible or add additional cars to their quote, you can show updated pricing that matches their needs.' Google plans to provide car insurance quotes in other states, too - Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas are suspected to be among the next states. The service follows the lead of the Google compare service in the UK, which launched in 2012 and allows users to get quotes from 126 providers. Google also has similar services in the UK for travel insurance, mortgage quotes and credit cards.","Google has launched a price comparison site for drivers in California to compare auto insurance quotes .

Braydon Smith (pictured with girlfriend Kirstie Nicholls) died in Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital on Monday afternoon following a 10-round featherweight bout at the weekend . Smith appeared to be fine after leaving the ring on Saturday and had given an upbeat interview following his loss  before returning to his dressing room. His girlfriend, Kirstie Nicholls, held an icepack against Smith's swollen face as he joked about the tough fight, the Courier Mail reports. Soon after, he started complaining of a headache and 90 minutes later he collapsed. He was rushed to hospital with suspected minor bleeding and swelling on the brain. Smith was placed in an induced coma, but never regained conciousness after surgery, the Toowoomba Chronicle reports. 'I was a massive fan of Braydon, his No.1 fan,' Ms Nicholls said on Monday night. 'I love him ... we were soulmates.' The Toowoomba boxer had been placed in an induced coma at Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital before he died on Monday afternoon surrounded by family . Smith had given an upbeat interview following his loss on Saturday and his girlfriend, Kirstie Nicholls, held an icepack against Smith's swollen face as he joked about the tough fight . The young boxer - nicknamed 'The Great White' - was highly regarded for being a humble and dedicated competitor, determined to revamp the image of his beloved sport. 'He really wanted to change the image of boxing,' family spokesman James O'Shea said. 'A lot of times in this country the sport gets a bad rap. 'A big goal of his life was to show people it's not (a bad sport).' John Hogg, the Australian National Boxing Federation's Queensland medical registrar, said he was baffled as Smith had been checked before and after the bout by two different doctors. Smith only had two stitches inserted following the fight. 'The doctor obviously had no cause for concern so it's a mystery as to what's happened,' he said. Young Toowoomba boxer Braydon Smith (pictured) has died in a Brisbane hospital - less than two days after losing a 10-round featherweight bout . Mr O'Shea said the massive outpouring of support from the local and wider community was testament to Smith's upstanding reputation. 'So many people looked up to him,' he said. On social media, people using the hashtag 'prayforbrayd' have sent their messages of support to the young man, repeatedly praised for being a 'true gentleman' of the boxing fraternity. He had been surrounded by family, including father and trainer Brendon, and friends since being hospitalised. As well as boxing, Smith was completing his final year of law at the University of Southern Queensland. Family representative James O'Shea said the massive outpouring of support from the local and wider community was testament to Smith's upstanding reputation .","Toowoomba boxer Braydon Smith has died two days after a 10-round fight .

"A man wielding a machete and wasp spray was shot by police at a New Orleans airport Friday night after attacking two Transportation Security  Administration workers and several passengers. Richard White, 63, attacked both security officials and a number of passersby with insecticide, before drawing a machete from the waistband of his pants at the airport's security checkpoint. He then started swinging the weapon, which a male TSA agent managed to block with a piece of luggage as White ran through a metal detector, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said. Seconds later, White began chasing a female TSA agent, prompting Lt Heather Slyve, of the sheriff's department, to fire three rounds at him, striking him the face, chest and leg, Normand said. White was taken to hospital, where he underwent surgery. His current condition remains unknown. Scroll down for videos . 'Attacker': Witnesses said that this man, Richard White, 63, drew a machete and attacked a TSA employee in New Orleans Friday night . Machete-wielder? This photograph from social media showed a man on the floor near a machete after the shooting at Louis Armstrong International Airport, New Orleans . Police clear out the area around Concourse B of Louis Armstrong International Airport on Friday evening . The female agent was also struck in the arm by a bullet while running from White, authorities said, adding that her wound was not life-threatening. Earlier reports had said she was slashed by White. Photographs from inside Louis Armstrong International Airport Friday showed White laying on the floor with a machete close-by. Another showed a woman in a TSA uniform being stretchered away. Other images depicted police flooding the area outside the terminal. On Saturday, bystanders described minutes of panic and chaos at the airport in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner. 'Everyone was ducking for cover. It's New Orleans. I knew they (the gunshots) were coming from the security checkpoint area,' said Garret Laborde, 31, a traveler trying to fly to Houston. 'I immediately ducked down ... Then we waited.' He called the scene 'instant chaos' with 'screaming, lots of females screaming for a short period of time.' Some bystanders ran to get out of the way and received minor cuts and bruises, Normand said. Emergency response: Police poured into the airport  and ushered everybody away from the area where the shooting took place . White reportedly began swinging the weapon at the airport's security checkpoint, which a male TSA agent managed to block with a piece of luggag. Above, officers stand at the entrance to the airport . Dozens of police vehicles surround the entrance to New Orleans Louis Armstrong International Airport . Mr Laborde said he remained down for several minutes, before police began rushing around the airport, telling everyone to get back down. Evaucation sirens also started going off, he said. Logan Tucker, 26, of Meridian, Mississippi, and Phillip Green, 33, of Houston, both headed to Houston for work as deckhands on a tugboat, said they were close to where events unfolded. 'I heard the gunshots,' Tucker said. 'It was pandemonium after that,' Green said. 'I took cover. I didn't want to become part of the story. The Sheriff's Office said Friday there was no obvious connection between White and the airport. A spokesman said: 'We don't know if he was traveling. We're still piecing together witness interviews.' On Saturday, a statement revealed that White  'had a few minor arrests' to his name. Long lines of fliers are seen awaiting word of their departures in the airport's ticketing area on Friday evening . Chaos: Hundreds of people are pictured standing in the ticket area in the wake of White's alleged attack . Officers guard the entrance to concourse A and B at the New Orleans International Airport on Friday . At a news conference outside the airport, Normand described Friday's encounter in detail. He said: 'He walked down the TSA pre-line, encountered the TSA officer who was checking the boarding passes with the scanning machine to be scanned. 'He was challenged at that time by the TSA officer. The response was, he pulled a can of wasp spray and sprayed the officer in the face. 'He proceeded past that checkpoint and encountered the second TSA officer and a third a third TSA officer almost simultaneously. One was a female, one was a male. 'He sprayed the male in the face.' A long wait: Some bystanders ran to get out of the way and received minor cuts and bruises, Normand said . A deputy walks through Concourse B at the airport as the sheriff's department investigates the attack . Describing the shooting, he said: 'The law enforcement officer proceeded down the exit line to come around, coming in very close contact to the individual with the machete, and that officer fired three times, hitting the perpetrator once in the left chest, the left facial area and the left thigh, at that point in time. 'There was an innocent bystander who sustained a graze wound to the arm and there were a couple of members of the traveling public, while in the scrambling, while shots were fired, that happened to cut some limbs on some of the furniture there while trying to get away from that particular area.' Brett Leonard, who flew into New Orleans from San Francisco Friday evening for a wedding, had just got off the plane when the attack took place. Scene: The shooting and machete attack took place at Louis Armstrong International Airport on Friday night . Speaking to DailyMail.com, Leonard said police at the scene told him the man had been shot during the machete attack. Of the response, Leonard said: 'All of a sudden a million police were outside'. He said newly-arrived passengers like himself were hurried out of the terminal and into taxis. The shooting took place in concourse B of the airport at around 8pm. The TSA confirmed that one of its employees had been injured, but said she was not seriously hurt. A spokesman said: 'At approximately 8:00 p.m. CDT, a female Supervisory Transportation Security Officer at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was assaulted in the public area outside of Checkpoint B. The officer was taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.'","Richard White, 63, lashed out with machete and wasp spray Friday night .

"Saturday is the day when love of math and a hankering for pastry come full circle. The date is 3-14-15, the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi: 3.141592653. The best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds, morning and evening, and the occurence won't happen again until March 2115. On Saturday the date is 3-14-15, the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi: 3.141592653. Pi Day is celebrated on March 14th (3/14) around the world. Pi (Greek letter “π”) is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant — the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14159. 'It's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics,' said University of California Berkeley mathematician and author Edward Frenkel. 'Pi is special.' Pi is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle, as in pi times the radius squared, but it appears all over other parts of mathematics. It 'is kind of a basic atomic building block' for math, said Temple University mathematician and author John Paulos, who was interviewed at precisely 3:14:15 p.m. In some places, Pi Day is celebrated with the edible type of pie. 'It's a real exciting moment for math enthusiasm,' said Nathan Kaplan, a Yale University math professor, who called it a time for people to 'remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school.' Kaplan acknowledged that most people don't really recall math as fun, blaming that on how it's taught: 'There's fun stuff out there in the quantitative world.' One interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational, which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns. Yet in 1897, a bill before the Indiana legislature tried to round it up to 3.2. It fell flat. 'We cannot change it. It's not subject to opinion or taste or time,' Frenkel said. 'How many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space?' This pi story goes full circle, with exactly 314 words. In honor of mathematical constant's designated day, MIT will be announcing its 'Regular Action' admissions on March 14, 2015 at 9:26 a.m. ET. Celebrating Pi Day isn't new for the prestigious college, but this year is extra special, as the date aligns perfectly with Pi's first eight numbers: 3.1415926. Pi has been calculated to over one trillion digits beyond its decimal point. As an irrational and transcendental number, it will continue infinitely without repetition or pattern. While only a handful of digits are needed for typical calculations, Pi’s infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorize, and to computationally calculate more and more digits.","Saturday is 3-14-15, the first five digits of  pi .

"For centuries there have been accounts of animals behaving bizarrely before earthquakes. Now, for the first time, scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short-term seismic forecasting. They found that animals in Peru - such as pumas and razor-billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event. Researchers believe that the changes in behaviour may be linked to airborne ions. Scroll down for video . For the first time, scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals in Peru prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short-term seismic forecasting. This still shows a Razor-billed curassow . Led by Dr Rachel Grant of Anglia Ruskin University, experts used data gathered from a series of motion-triggered cameras located in the Yanachaga National Park in Peru. The research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 Contamana earthquake that struck the region in 2011. On a typical day, the cameras would record between five and 15 animal sightings. However, within the 2-day period in the run-up to the earthquake, they recorded five or fewer sightings. For five of the seven days immediately before the earthquake, no animal movements were recorded at all, which was incredibly unusual for the mountainous rainforest region. Dr Grant, a lecturer in animal and environmental biology, told MailOnline that rodents seemed to be particularly sensitive and disappeared completely eight days before the quake. ‘Usually they’re quite ubiquitous in the forest. They’re very common and were everywhere in the control period, but then completely disappeared.’ The research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 Contamana earthquake struck the region in 2011. A stock image showing rupture caused by a quake is shown . Scientists recorded the reflection of very low frequency radio waves above the area surrounding the epicentre of the Peruvian earthquake. In particualr they monitored the ionosphere, the layer of the Earth's atmosphere which contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio waves. It is thought that positive airborne ions, which are known to be generated in large numbers at the Earth’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build-up to an earthquake, trigger unusual animal behaviour. Positive ions in the air lead to unpleasant side effects in animals and humans, such as ‘serotonin syndrome’. This is caused by an increase in the serotonin levels in the bloodstream, and can lead to symptoms such as restlessness, agitation, hyperactivity and confusion. The study which was co-authored by Professor Friedemann Freund of the SETI Institute and Professor Jean-Pierre Raulin of the Centre of Radio Astronomy and Astrophysics Mackenzie (CRAAM) in Brazil, and is published by the journal Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, looked at reasons for this disappearance. They recorded the reflection of very low frequency (VLF) radio waves above the area surrounding the epicentre. The scientists detected disturbances in the ionosphere - the layer of the earth's atmosphere which contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio waves - which started two weeks before the earthquake. A particularly large fluctuation was recorded eight days prior to the quake, coinciding with the second significant decrease in animal activity observed in the pre-earthquake period. Prominent among the most likely causes for the unusual animal response are positive airborne ions, which are known to be generated in large numbers at the Earth’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build-up to an earthquake. Positive ions in the air lead to unpleasant side effects in animals and humans, such as ‘serotonin syndrome’. This is caused by an increase in the serotonin levels in the bloodstream, and can lead to symptoms such as restlessness, agitation, hyperactivity and confusion. They expected the injection of positive airborne ions into the Earth’s atmosphere before seismic activity to have a profound effect on mammals and birds - in particular those living on the ground and in burrows, and the study seems to prove this. Dr Grant, a lecturer in animal and environmental biology, told MailOnline that rodents seemed to be particularly sensitive and disappeared completely eight days before the quake. This still from an in-situ camera shows a Paca rodent during the control period of the experiment . Experts led by Dr Rachel Grant of Anglia Ruskin University used data gathered from a series of motion-triggered cameras located in the Yanachaga National Park in Peru (marked on the map) ‘As far as we know, this is the first time that motion triggered cameras have documented this phenomenon prior to an earthquake,’ Dr Grant said. ‘The results are particularly interesting as we also found evidence of disturbances in the ionosphere in the area where the earthquake struck. ‘We believe that both of these anomalies arise from a single cause: seismic activity causing stress build-up in the earth’s crust, leading, among other things, to massive air ionisation. Professor Friedemann Freund of the Seti Institute, who works at Nasa’s Ames Research Centre in California, added: ‘The camera traps were located on a ridge at an altitude of 900 metres. ‘If air ionisation occurred, it is likely that it was particularly strong along such a ridge. ‘Hence, the animals would have escaped to the valley below, where they were exposed to fewer positive airborne ions. Prominent among the most likely causes for the unusual animal response are positive airborne ions, which are known to be generated in large numbers at the Earth’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build-up to an earthquake. A puma is captured in this image before the quake . ‘With their acute ability to sense their environment, animals can help us understand subtle changes that occur before major earthquakes,' said Professor Friedemann Freund of the Seti Institute. This aerial view shows the tectonic uplift along a fault in Iran . ‘With their acute ability to sense their environment, animals can help us understand subtle changes that occur before major earthquakes. ‘These changes, that we are now able to measure, express themselves in many different ways at the earth’s surface and above.’ Dr Grant said that that next step in the research is to find a reproducible way of monitoring behavioural changes before an earthquake, because ‘we don’t want a false alarm’. She intends to investigate wither zooplankton – tiny animals that live in water – could be used as a biological indicator for seismic activity. ‘We hope our work will stimulate further research into this area, which has the potential to help with short-term seismic risk forecasting,’ she added. As well as predicting earthquakes, animals could help repair the damage they cause too. In November last year, researchers at North Carolina State University fitted cockroaches with electrical 'backpacks' complete with tiny microphones to detect the faintest of sounds. The idea is that cyborg cockroaches, or ‘biobots’, could enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes, for example, and help emergency workers find survivors. ‘In a collapsed building, sound is the best way to find survivors,’ said Alper Bozkurt, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university. ‘The goal is to use the biobots with high-resolution microphones to differentiate between sounds that matter - like people calling for help - from sounds that don't matter - like a leaking pipe. Rise of the robo-roach: Scientists have developed technology that allows cyborg cockroaches, or biobots (pictured) to pick up sounds with small microphones and seek out the source of the sound. They could one day be used in emergency situations to detect survivors . ‘Once we've identified sounds that matter, we can use the biobots equipped with microphone arrays to zero-in on where those sounds are coming from.’ The ‘backpacks’ control the robo-roach's movements because they are wired to the insect’s cerci - sensory organs that cockroaches usually use to feel if their abdomens brush against something. By electrically stimulating the cerci, cockroaches can be prompted to move in a certain direction. In fact, they have been programmed to seek out sound. One type of 'backpack' is equipped with an array of three directional microphones to detect the direction of the sound and steer the biobot in the right direction towards it. Another type is fitted with a single microphone to capture sound from any direction, which can be wirelessly transmitted - perhaps in the future to emergency workers. They ‘worked well’ in lab tests and the experts have developed technology that can be used as an ‘invisible fence’ to keep the biobots in a certain area such as a disaster area, the researchers announced at the IEEE Sensors 2014 conference in Valencia, Spain. A previous study led by Dr Edgar Lobaton, who is also at the university, showed that biobots can be used to map a disaster area. Dr Lobaton and Professor Bozkurt plan on merging their research to both map disaster areas and pinpoint survivors.","Scientists filmed the behaviour of animals in Peru before an earthquake .

"Ksenia Sobchak (above) has fled Russia after receiving death threats in the wake of the murder of Boris Nemtsov . A glamorous TV presenter has fled Russia after receiving death threats in the wake of the murder of Boris Nemtsov, it was revealed today. Ksenia Sobchak, who is also a prominent Moscow opposition figure and glossy magazine editor, was urged to leave for her own safety by the FSB secret service. Although the 33-year-old had recently hired bodyguards she was still not believed to be safe - despite the fact she had known Vladimir Putin since childhood. 'I am going to leave Russia for a while,' she announced at a Moscow party on Friday. 'Close friends explained off the record that she is leaving not because of her extra sensitivity but because the secret service recommended her to do so,' Kommersant newspaper claimed. Ms Sobchak today said reports saying she was emigrating from Russia were an 'overstatement' but did not deny she was leaving temporarily on secret service advice. It had been reported in Russia that her name was on a 'hit list' of Putin foes. The revelation of her sudden flight abroad came as the Russian president was scheduled to reappear after being out of sight for unexplained reasons since March 5. Despite her family links to Putin, the outspoken Ms Sobchak became a strong critic of the president's authoritarian approach. The prominent blogger started to receive death threats from online trolls soon after opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, 55, was shot in the back near the Kremlin on February 27. At Nemtsov's funeral on March 3, a man approached her and said, 'bear in mind, you are the next one, Ksenia.' Ms Sobchak is the daughter of Putin's political mentor and law professor, the late Anatoly Sobchak, who gave him his first political job after he quit the KGB. Scroll down for video . Ms Sobchak is pictured at her flat, which she has been told to leave by Moscow's secret service despite hiring body guards . The television presenter and opposition figure (right) has known Vladimir Putin (centre holding flowers) since a child as her father Anatoly Sobchak was his political mentor and law professor. They are pictured together at Mr Sobchak's funeral in 2000 . Despite knowing the president (left) since childhood, the 33-year-old (right) has not been reluctant to voice opposition to his policies . For years there were rumours that she was Putin's goddaughter - and while this is not the case, many of his supporters have not forgiven her for openly articulating opposition to his policies. Among Tweeted threats she has received one read: 'Give up Ksenia, your death will be fast.' Another, using an insulting nickname for the TV host, wrote after Nemtsov's death: 'I am also very happy that there is one b****** less; when is it your turn, Horse?' One user called Vadim posted a picture of a man pointing a gun with a list of six prominent opposition surnames - Nemtsov, Navalny, Sobchak, Kudrin, Kasyanov, Khodorkovsky - and wrote: 'Just politics, nothing personal'. In the wake of Nemtsov's death, Ms Sobchak warned that Putin has unleashed forces in Russia over which he now has no control. Mr Sobchak (left), who was at the time the Mayor of St Petersburg, is pictured with deputy Putin (right). Putin has not been seen since March 5 . 'Actually it would be in some way less worrying if Putin had ordered Nemtsov's killing,' she wrote. 'It would be an awful system, but at least a system, a manageable system. 'But I feel, unfortunately, this is not the case. 'There is no Putin who gave a command to kill. But there is a Putin who has built a hellish Terminator and he has lost control of it.' She also warned: 'There is no one controlling the process any more - there is chaotic hatred. 'Hatred that is fuelled every day by the federal mass media.' After opposition figure Mr Nemtsov, 55, was shot another user wrote to Ms Sobchak and said: 'I am also very happy that there is one b****** less; when is it your turn, Horse' Of the shots that killed Nemtsov, she said in her blog: 'These are only the first six bullets. There are troubled times ahead.' In December, she riled Putin by challenging him in a televised press conference, criticising him for labelling opponents as 'fifth columnists' and implying they were 'national traitors'. Putin snapped at his press chief: 'Why did you give her the floor?' Earlier the former IT girl told how wealthy Russians are seeking an escape route as the economy collapses due to Western sanctions over Putin's military intervention in Ukraine. Ms Sobchak with parents Anatoly and Lyudmila in St Petersburg when she was young. She has denied claims she is emigrating . She said: 'This is the main society talk in good restaurants in Moscow. It is either getting citizenship, or residence permits, or the like.' Worldwide intrigue and rumours have been circulating over Putin's whereabouts and health in recent weeks. Some suggested he was suffering from chronic back ailments and required treatment from an Austrian orthopaedic - but the Kremlin has not confirmed the reason for his absence. Rumours about his mystery disappearance also included his death, a coup, a severe bout of flu or his 'lover' giving birth to a child in Switzerland. Some Moscow sources believe that Putin has been holed up at a high security presidential retreat in the Novgorod region.","Ksenia Sobchak said she is fleeing Russia at a party on Friday .

"The mortified female office worker involved in a high-profile sex romp has moved back to her native England because ‘she wants to just cut all ties with everyone' in New Zealand, where the tryst occurred. Both the 50-year-old regional manager and the 26-year-old female office worker are no longer employees at insurance firm in Christchurch, and the woman has returned to the UK. ‘She is a beautiful person but she's been such a silly girl who has made such a silly mistake that has had such massive repercussions for so many people,’ a source told The New Zealand Herald. Scroll down for video . The man and woman involved in the office sex scandal in Christchurch have lost their jobs . The 50-year-old regional manager and the 26-year-old junior employee sex romp took place at the Marsh Ltd insurance firm (pictured) The unwanted publicity that came after video of the couple having sex in the office was posted online has horrified the young woman involved. 'She is not proud at all,' a person close to her also told the Herald. 'She wants to just cut all ties with everyone.' The steamy encounter between the two took place in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action. Video footage and photographs taken by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide. Her Facebook page, which was shut down after the scandal hit, has now been reactivated. It says she is from Solihull, in the West Midlands. After the footage became an online sensation, the woman's fiance phoned a local radio station to defend her, but he also claimed that they had split up some six months beforehand. However NZME. News Service revealed that the pair had been 'on a break' at the time and that the engagement had not been officially called off at all. It is understood that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees . Patrons at the Carlton Bar and Eatery (pictured) captured the scandalous behaviour and the footage went viral . It is believed confidentiality agreements prevent all parties from speaking, although it has been reported that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees. The insurance boss involved in the scandal is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter. Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man's wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook. It is still unclear if his wife is standing by him. An employment investigation was instigated following the scandal and all parties are now prohibited from speaking due to a confidentiality agreement . The woman who worked as a secretary with the firm has now returned to her native England . Last month the Daily Mail revealed that a friend of the man's brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved. 'When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,' the friend said. 'After he didn't reply he even asked, 'It's not you is it?' He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.'

"George Osborne declared Britain had reached a ‘massive moment’ after new figures revealed there have never been more people in work. The Chancellor said 73.3 per cent of working-age people were employed – the highest rate since records began in 1971. The Government said the UK had enjoyed the fastest growth in employment of any major economy in the world over the past year. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne, who has said that 73.3 per cent of working age people are now in employment . The jobless total is 1.86million, the lowest since the summer of 2008 and almost half a million down on a year ago. The unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent, compared to a European Union average of 9.8 per cent. Mr Osborne said 1,000 more people had found employment every day since the Coalition came to power in 2010, with a record 30.94million people now working. The proportion of people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance has also fallen to its lowest level for 40 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. Addressing MPs yesterday, Mr Osborne boasted: ‘The evidence is plain to see. Britain is working again.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who hailed the 'remarkable' employment figures . The Chancellor said it had been a ‘truly national recovery’, with more cities in the North and the Midlands feeling the benefits of the UK’s economic growth. He added: ‘Where is employment growing fastest? The North West. Where is a job being created every ten minutes? The Midlands. And which county has created more jobs than the whole of France? The great county of Yorkshire. ‘We are getting the whole of Britain back to work.’ Forecasts published by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility yesterday showed the number of people in employment would rise by another million by 2019. It also predicted the UK’s unemployment rate will fall from the current 5.3 per cent to 5.2 per cent next year, returning to 5.3 per cent until 2019. Meanwhile, the ONS revealed that annual growth in private sector employment was five times the size of the fall in the public sector. This challenges claims by Labour that the private sector would not be able to compensate for the number of people made redundant by the State as a result of spending cuts. Public sector employment fell by 140,000 last year to 5.4million, the lowest level since records began in 1999 and a fall of almost a million since its peak in late 2009. But employment in the private sector hit a record high of 25.5million, after rising by 757,000 in just one year. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘This is a remarkable set of figures, which underlines this Government’s success in backing businesses to create jobs, and supporting British people to seize those opportunities. ‘As a country we should be proud that there are now record numbers of people in work, record numbers of job vacancies available, and the lowest unemployment rate since 2008. ‘For every single day that this Government has been in power we have seen an average of 1,000 more people in work.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘The highest employment rate in our history is not a dry fact. ‘It means more people with the security of a pay packet and a brighter future.’ Nick Clegg may have praised the Liberal Democrats’ contribution to the Budget – but last night his party was preparing its own rival offering, writes Tamara Cohen. In a highly unusual move, Treasury chief Danny Alexander will today address the House of Commons to outline Lib Dem economic plans. He will even have his own yellow Budget Box, which will later be handed over to a party donor who paid £1,500 for it at an auction during the spring conference last weekend. Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, takes in yesterday's budget in the House of Commons . Treasury chief Danny Alexander will today address the House of Commons to outline Lib Dem economic plans . After skipping last year’s Autumn Statement, Mr Clegg made sure he was on the front bench to hear the good news in the Budget yesterday, but was spotted fiddling with his phone and pulling a series of faces. He has insisted it was a ‘Coalition Budget’. But the Chief Secretary to the Treasury will say today that while his party supports the plans for this year, after 2016 it would diverge from them dramatically. In a speech some Labour and Tory MPs are likely to see as a misuse of Government time, Mr Alexander will propose more borrowing for infrastructure. He is expected to accuse the Tories of making ‘cuts for cuts’ sake’ – and Labour of planning a spending spree if they win office. The Lib Dems want to increase the personal tax allowance to £12,500, add more council tax bands for expensive homes, and raise capital gains tax for the wealthiest. A senior Lib Dem said: ‘Our spending plans post 2015-16 differ from the Tories in a number of key areas. We agree on the need to balance the current budget by 2017-18, but they are talking about running a surplus by carrying on cutting after that.’","Chancellor George Osborne says 73.3% of work age people are employed .

"The typical meat-lover will eat 7,000 animals in their lifetime including 11 cows, 27 pigs, and 2,400 chickens, it has been revealed. By the time they reach 80, just over the average life expectancy for Britons, carnivores will have consumed 30 sheep, 80 turkeys and 4,500 fish each, according to the Vegetarian Calculator. If rabbits, ducks, geese, goats, prawns, squid and other small animals are included then the total rises closer to 7,500. If a meat eater lives to the age of 80, just over the average life expectancy for Britons, they can expect to chew their way through 80 turkeys, 27 pigs, and 2,400 chickens (file image) The numbers were revealed by Vegetraian Calculator, a campaign group who are urging people to eat less meat to reduce their impact on the environment. However, meat eater Steve Hunt, 41, from London, said he would never give up eating animals. He said: 'They think the vegetarian calculator will shock people into giving up meat, but to be honest when I did it I realised I needed to eat more turkey and lamb - I’m nowhere near my quota.' Bodybuilder Torvald Alexander, 45, of Edinburgh, Scotland, said he was a big fan of meat - but that you should have a ‘healthy, balanced diet’. He added: 'Providing you don’t overdo it, meat is very good for you, especially chicken and fish. 'I treat myself to a nice leg of lamb every now and again and it does me a few days in leftovers. Once prawns, squid, goats, rabbits, ducks and other small creatures are included, the total rises to close to 7,500 according to campaign group Vegetarian Calculator . 'It’s all about balance - getting enough fresh fruit and veg as well as the odd bit of meat and you can’t go wrong, . 'If you eat bacon sandwiches every morning, have a sausage roll for lunch and a steak for dinner then you’re heading for trouble.' The Vegetarian Calculator Facebook page states: Vegetarians use less resources like water, food, oil, contribute less CO2 to the atmosphere, and animals are not killed for their consumption. #Raising livestock contribute more to global warming than automobiles, and is the second leading cause of global warming behind industrial pollution.' NHS guidelines recommend eating meat as part of a balanced diet, however they also suggest limiting the amount of red and processed meat, as it has links to bowel cancer.","Average British meat-eater will consume  7,000 animals in their lifetime .

"A Ohio grandmother will spend the rest of her life in jail after being found guilty of the rape of her own grandchildren. Edwina Louis, 53, will spend the rest of her life behind bars after she was sentenced to four consecutive life terms without parole. The judge in the case, William T. Marshall, said in all his 19 years experience on the bench, he had never seen anyone more evil. The jury also had no doubt of her guilt, convicting after less than six hours of deliberation. Jailed: A jury spent less than six hours deliberating whether Edwina Louis raped, tortured and abused her four grandchildren who were all under-12. The three girls and one boy spoke of how they were staved and beaten . Along with four counts of rape, she was also found guilty of a number of other serious charges including child endangerment and kidnapping. 'This woman, who never shed a tear or showed even an ounce of remorse, will never get out of prison,' Scioto County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Pat Apel said. 'That's the right thing.' The trial took almost a week as stories of rape, torture and abuse of the three girls and one boy were laid bare before the courtroom. The children described being tied up for long periods of time, even weeks, being untied only long enough to attend online classes and to go to the bathroom. They said they were rarely fed and medical authorities told the court they were underweight. The fridge and the freezer in the house had locks on them with only the adults wearing the keys around their necks. Monster: Edwina Louis of Wheelersburg, Ohio, will never be a free woman. She was found guilty of abusing her four grandchildren, tying them to their beds with ropes and chains and beating them with belts and paddles . Both girls said they were made to stand against the wall with their arms outstretched for hours and if they let their hands down they were beaten and slapped. Along with the stories images of the kids scarred and skinny bodies were presented for the jury to view. Suspicions were aroused after a nine-year-old girl sent a message to her teacher that she and her brothers and sisters were being beaten and had been tied up. The teacher immediately called the police along with child protective services. When police arrived those in the house scrambled to cut the ropes from the children and threw the chains into a plastic bag and then into a garbage can. All four children who were under 12 were removed from the house by emergency court order six days later. Edwin Louis, and the children's biological mother, Bobbi Sue Pack along with her boyfriend Juan Sanchez, were all arrested several days later. Pack and Sanchez have faced the same charges and have now been sentenced to 10 years to life and 25 years to life, respectively. Authorities had their suspicions that the children were being mistreated for years however complaints were never followup with any home visits. Brutal: Juan Carlos Sanchez was given a 25 year sentence after pleading guilty to rape and child abuse of his girlfriend’s  children, who  were kept chained to their beds and starved in the family’s Ohio home . Depraved: Bobbi Sue Pack, the four children's biological mother plead guilty to abusing children. Police found out about the children’s horrifying living conditions after they emailed a teacher at their online school . On at least four separate occasions throughout much of 2012 and early 2013, complaints were made to Children Services. On one occasion there was evidence of bruises and scratches on the children's bodies. Another time, the kids said that they had been kept locked up without food. Other complaints of physical and emotional abuse were also made including savage beatings with a belt. Time and again, Children Services of Scioto County failed to follow up the calls and make the necessary checks. When the children first were interviewed by detectives, they were unsocial, terrified and the two middle children could barely speak. When the children were finally questioned, the only boy in the group of four was  violent and angry. For weeks he would only say 'I hate you!' to anyone who came near. During the trial, the two girls, now 10 and 12 testified from an adjacent room and told horror stories of being raped by Sanchez and being tied up in both ropes and chains and being beaten by Louis. The children are now with a new foster family who is able to give them the love and attention they require and deserve. 'If there is a bright spot in all of this, it is the transformation we have seen from the kids,' Apel said. 'Maybe now, they have a chance.'","Edwina Louis, 53, raped, beat, tortured and starved her four grandchildren .

"A millionaire Tory donor and prominent party supporter has been a heavy cocaine user for years, the Daily Mail can reveal. The businessman’s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug. He has spoken of personally meeting Prime Minister David Cameron but leads a double life as a seedy drug addict and regular user of prostitutes. The businessman’s identity has been made secret by a court order despite his admission that he is addicted to the class A drug (file image above) Just last month he attended the party’s high-profile donors’ ball, and the entrepreneur has frequently spoken out in favour of Government policies. But despite initially keeping it a secret from even those closest to him, he has now admitted – behind closed doors – to using prodigious quantities of the dangerous stimulant and of hiring prostitutes on a weekly basis. His consumption of the drug is so high that people are routinely jailed for possessing the same amount he takes in a single day – because it is assumed that only a drug dealer would carry so much. And remarkably – despite spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on his habit in just a few years – the businessman has so far avoided any prosecution or publicity about his addiction. However he is not shy about appearing in the public eye. He always seems full of energy when caught on camera, and has been very talkative with journalists. He has waged a very loud publicity campaign for his business, putting many details about his life into the public domain. The addict has also spoken out against Labour policies and in favour of the Conservative Government – including for moves which benefited him financially. Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball attended by David and Samantha Cameron in 2007 (above) The donor refused to comment, however when asked about the heavy cocaine addiction, a source close to him said: ‘There’s a court order and it would be a contempt of court if he was identified. ‘He is not a well man. He’s trying to sort it out and sort himself out. He definitely doesn't want to talk about it at this stage.’ Among the Conservative Party fundraising events the man has supported is the Black and White winter ball – a glittering occasion swarming with the super rich. The most recent ball – at the Grosvenor House Hotel on exclusive Park Lane – attracted criticism because the wealthy donors included porn barons and tax avoiders. Tables for ten at the February event cost up to £15,000 each, while the minimum price for a single ticket was £500. Dinner was scheduled to go on for three-and-a-half hours with speeches by Mr Cameron and the Conservative chairman Lord Feldman. Guests could bid to go shoe shopping with Home Secretary Theresa May, have a cup of tea with Boris Johnson, go for a 10km run with Iain Duncan Smith, or have a week in a luxury chalet in Switzerland. In the final big fundraiser ahead of the general election, £210,000 was spent on a bronze bust of Margaret Thatcher and £220,000 was bid for a week-long holiday in a Spanish fortress. One of the paying guests forked out £110,000 at the auction for a single night’s exclusive use of Annabel’s nightclub. But a major cocaine abuser was also among them, rubbing shoulders not just with hedge fund managers and oil tycoons, but also with major party figures – including Chief Whip Michael Gove, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

Not only does maintaining the regrowth take a lot of commitment but the chemical process of bleach on the hair can be incredibly damaging.'

"A fight over a handicapped parking spot ended with a 71-year-old woman being hospitalized with a broken leg and the need for a second hip replacement. The confrontation at the Walmart store on West Layton Avenue in Greenfield, Wisconsin, saw two women, both with handicapped tags on their cars, face off over the space. Kezia Perkins, 32, was attempting to park in the handicapped spot, but couldn't make the turn into the space. That's when the unidentified 71-year-old woman pulled in instead in her SUV. Surveillance footage from February 3 shows Perkins block in the SUV, then get out of her car and move around to the driver's window, out of sight. Perkins can been on surveillance footage rushing around the back of her car to confront the 71-year-old woman that cut across her to get to the handicap spot . Bystanders described how Perkins walked up to the older woman and 'chest-butted' her causing her to fall backwards . She hit the ground hard and rolled onto her side in pain, having recently had a hip replacement - the fall broke her leg . As Perkins began to return to her car, witnesses rushed forward to help the older woman who lay on the ground in agony . She returned to her own car, appeared to look for something in her trunk and then went back to the other vehicle and yelled through the passenger side window. Perkins once again returned to her own car, and after a brief moment the SUV driver emerged and began to walk around the vehicle towards the store. The footage shows the two women exchanging words over the roof of Perkins' car before she rushes around the back of it and appears to shove the older woman to the ground. The 71-year-old hit the ground hard and rolled onto her side in pain as Perkins began to return to her car. Bystanders, including John Rawlins of West Allis, rushed to help the woman who was now laying in the slush and ice. Kezia Perkins, 32, was attempting to park in a handicapped spot at Walmart when the driver of an SUV cut her off and pulled into the spot . 'From what she told me when I was tending to her, she just had hip surgery done. She couldn`t move. It may have come undone,' Rawlins told Fox 6. Perkins was charged on Wednesday with felony aggravated battery and appears in court next week . In describing what happened he said: 'This lady chest-butted,' referring to Perkins. Perkins is alleged to have told police: 'it’s not my fault the elderly woman bounced off my big (chest).' When Greenfield police checked her license and handicapped tag they found that the license wasn't valid and the tag wasn't even registered in her name. Perkins was charged on Wednesday with felony aggravated battery, and could face six years in prison if convicted and up to $10,000 in fines. She appears in court next week. Police said that the victim went through five hours of surgery after she was attacked to fix fractures to her femur. She also needed a second hip replacement. Perkins' lawyer issued a statement maintaining her innocence and that she is handicapped. 'This was an unfortunate accident that came about after a misunderstanding between two individuals. Ms. Perkins is, herself, disabled, however the fact that her disability is not immediately noticeable led to confusion between the two women.'","Kezia Perkins, 32, was attempting to park in a handicapped spot at a Walmart when another driver cut across her and took the space .

"A Detroit boy who was found in his own basement after a highly publicized search into his 11-day disappearance is said to have suffered physical and psychological abuse. Police found Charlie Bothuell V thin and hiding among boxes in his family's townhouse home last June, a stunning turnabout in a search that involved local, state and federal officers. The discovery led to allegations that his father and stepmother forced him to go through rigorous twice-a-day workouts, kept him away from other kids, deprived him of proper food and abused him. Charlie Bothuell IV, 46, and Monique Dillard-Bothuell, 37, are charged with child abuse and torture and current hearings will determine if they stand trial. They have pleaded not guilty. Charlie Bothuell V, now 13, was found in the basement of his family's Detroit townhouse home after his 11-day disappearance. A doctor says the boy, who was found thin and with bruises, was the victim of abuse . Police investigators had already searched the basement (pictured) where Bouthell V was found. His father's lawyer says that the boy is lying about his abuse . Dr Dena Nazer of Children's Hospital of Michigan didn't examine Charlie or speak to him., but she was allowed to testify based on a review of his medical records, photos and his statements to other medical staff. Dr Nazer said Charlie, 12 at the time, indicated that his stepmother sent him to the basement because he didn't do his twice daily workout . The routine allegedly involved doing 100 pushups, 200 situps, 100 jumping jacks, 25 arm curls with a 25-pound weight and thousands of revolutions on an elliptical machine. She said the boy had bruises on his chest and buttocks, which were consistent with his claim that he had been beaten with a PVC pipe. 'He was also threatened to be killed and told no one would know because he was home-schooled,' Dr Nazer said . 'He was subjected to more than one kind of child abuse,' Dr Nazer told a judge. 'He was subjected to child physical abuse and psychological abuse in terms of isolation and deprivation.' Charlie Bouthell IV, 46, and Monique Dillard-Bothuell, 37, face charges of child abuse and torture that could lead to life prison sentences . Bouthell IV and Dillard-Bouthell, (pictured) would allegedly make their son undergo a strenuous workout routine twice daily, doing thousands of revolutions on an elliptical machine . The father famously found out that his son had been found in his basement while being interviewed by HLN's Nancy Grace . The doctor's testimony didn't reveal much new information. Authorities for months have alleged that Charlie was abused. The lawyer for Charlie Bothuell IV said that his client's son 'is a liar' and made up his abuse. '(The son) lives in this fantasy world and that's what this case is all about,' attorney Shawn Patrick Smith said, according to the Detroit News. 'It looks staged,' he said, adding that his client, a nurse, had been bankrupted by the proceedings. Investigators had been in Bothuell's basement before with specially trained dogs but did not find the boy. Last year a neighbor showed Daily Mail Online a tunnel from the basement where he could have used a bathroom or escaped to the outside. Dillard-Bothuell's attorney repeatedly asked Nazer if she was familiar with the exercise routine of young athletes, a suggestion that Charlie's drills weren't unusual. The parents allegedly threatened to kill Charlie Bouthell V, according to Dr Dena Nazer's testimony about suspected abuse . A neighbor near the Bouthell's home in Detroit showed Daily Mail Online a tunnel (right) that the young boy could have used to go to the bathroom (left) or exit to the outside world . 'She's not a sports coach. She's a doctor,' Judge Shannon Holmes said, stopping the questions. Charlie now is 13 and in the custody of his biological mother. He is expected to testify after hearings resume on April 14. Torture in Michigan carries up to a life prison sentence on conviction. Second-degree child abuse is punishable by up to four years in prison. Charle Bothuell IV was told that his son was found in his basement during a television interview with HLN's Nancy Grace. 'The FBI checked my basement. The police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down there several times. We've all been checking,' he said at the time. The father has since terminated his parental rights.","Charlie Bothuell V was in father's basement after 11-day search .

"Sean Penn is adamant that he has no reason to apologize for making a green card jibe at the expense of Mexican director Alejandro Iñárritu while handing him his Oscar for Birdman. When the time came to reveal to the Academy that Iñárritu had triumphed, Penn asked 'Who gave this son of a bitch his green card?' before announcing his film as the winner. The joke prompted a storm of outrage from critics who branded the comments xenophobic - but Penn has today said he has 'absolutely no apologies' and that the only reason anyone could be offended is their own 'flagrant stupidity'. Scroll down for video . 'Who gave that son of a bitch a green card?': Sean Penn, left, was criticized for a joke he directed at Alejandro Iñárritu, right, while handing him an Oscar. He called the reaction 'flagrant stupidity' According to Penn, the jibe was part of his friendship with Iñárritu, with whom he has worked in the past - and even a way to let him know of his victory seconds before everyone else. Speaking at a promo event in Beverly Hills for one of his own movies, Penn said of the reaction to the joke: 'I'm always surprised by flagrant stupidity. I keep having more hope.' He later added: 'I have absolutely no apologies'. 'In fact, I have a big [expletive] you for every...anybody who is so stupid not to have gotten the irony when you've got a country that is so xenophobic. 'If they had their way, you wouldn't have great filmmakers like Alejandro working in this country. Thank god we do.' Controversial moment: Penn is pictured above seconds before opening the envelope and making the jibe . 'I found it hilarious. Sean and I have that kind of brutal [relationship] where only true friendship can survive.' Iñárritu directed Penn in the 2003 film 21 Grams and the two remain close. 'I make on him a lot of very tough jokes that I will not tell you,' Iñárritu added. While Iñárritu's casual dismissal of any perceived offense helped to temper the public response to the comment, Penn has remained largely silent on the topic. Penn also clarified that the order of his comments were intentional. 'There's a little inside humor with he and I where I know, and wanted to know, that he would be the first person in that room to know that his film won,' he said.

"A Catholic high school has enraged hundreds of teenage girls by banning some types of dress from its prom, and demanding students send in pictures of their outfit for approval. Delone Catholic High School, a $5,000-a-year school in McSherrystown, Pennsylvania, started making the demands of its students this year. Authorities have declared war on short hems, cleavage, bare midriffs and nude-colored linings ahead of the May 1 prom. Banned: The above two dresses both violate the rules of Delone Catholic High School. The right-hand dress was deemed acceptable when a 'modesty piece' was added . Delone Catholic High School, a $5,000-a-year school in McSherrystown, Pennsylvania . Some girls say the guidelines were sprung on them by surprise, and have been forced to alter their gowns, or, worse still, been left with inappropriate garments that they can't take back, according to local station Fox 43. Simone Hostetter, who owns a local dress shop, told the channel that parents were being driven to despair by the policy, which could leave them more than $300 out of pocket. She said: 'They’re frantic, more so the parents have been really frantic, calling me with, ""Please, please please would you exchange her dress it’s not allowed.""' Naked controversy: 'Nude' linings, such as those on the dresses above, were deemed unacceptable at the school, and banned . Hostetter has changed her policy to allow returns in this case - and has started published pictures of her dresses on Facebook, spelling out which ones pass the school's modesty test, and which do not. The school insists the sartorial censorship is vital to preserving 'Catholic values and moral integrity' at the school. In a statement it said guidelines were spelled out in September, and the 'only change' from previous years is a requirement for girls to send in pictures for advance approval. They said the move was a preferable alternative to turning students away at the door. Allowed: These two dresses did pass the test of prom censors at the school. Students and parents are petitioning for the new rules to be dropped . Students and parents have expressed their outrage online, starting a Change.org petition aimed at swaying the principal. It calls the new standards 'antiquated and unreasonable', and complains that the prom is so soon that they have no time to act on the rule change. Writing underneath, student Cheyenne Altland said: 'I feel that my fashion choices for prom do not have any bearing on the strength of my Catholic Faith and my school can not tell me otherwise.'","Students at Delone Catholic High School were hit by new regime .

"This is the latest young woman to flee the UK in a bid to reach the terrorist group Islamic State. Photographed in a police cell, the 21-year-old jihadi suspect named by officials as Jaila Nadra H was arrested by Turkish security services as she waited to board a bus in Ankara. They believe the Muslim convert from East London was attempting to travel to the lawless and often porous border with Syria. Scroll down for video . Turkish authorities are holding a 21-year-old British woman named by officials as Jaila Nadra H (pictured) on suspicion of trying to travel to Syria and into Islamic State territory to join the terror group . The woman faces being deported back to the UK where she is likely to be arrested on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Sky News reports she is being held pending deportation hearings. One official said she was expected to be deported 'soon'. Last night her family expressed shock at her arrest. A cousin told the Daily Mail: 'She converted to Islam several years ago and we hear little from her. 'Her father has recently come out of hospital where he was undergoing chemotherapy. It is hard to believe this could happen.' Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities. The woman was detained in Turkey trying to cross into Syria (pictured), a known route for would-be jihadis . They said messages and images on her mobile phone indicated she was planning to head to Islamic State territory. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of government rules against speaking to the media without prior authorization. A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm the detention of a British national in Ankara and are providing consular assistance.' The arrest comes days after three British teenagers were arrested at the airport in the Turkish city of Istanbul and thrown out of the country. The young men, two aged 17 and a third aged 19, were questioned by counter-terrorism police on their return to the UK and released on bail. They have told their families they wanted to go to Syria to 'help', and denied subscribing to the beliefs of militant Islamists. This is the moment two 'naive and impressionable' teenage cousins who dreamed of careers in medicine and engineering were stopped in Turkey by immigration officers at border control as they tried to flee  to join ISIS on Saturday . Exodus: Amira Abase (left), 15, and Kadiza Sultana (right), 16, also travelled to Istanbul from UK on February 17 before reportedly entering Syria - where they could now be under the control of deadly female insurgents . Last month three British girls – Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15 – travelled to Turkey. They were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, a close friend, who travelled to Syria last December. There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the warzone in Syria and Iraq. Last week David Cameron said everyone has a responsibility to examine why people should want to join Islamic State. Turkey is an important ally to the West as European states attempt to stem the flow of foreign fighters bolstering the ranks of Islamic State. It has been criticised for allowing fighters to cross the border into Syria but in return has asked why other countries allow militants to travel in the first place. Yesterday a High Court judge took the unprecedented step of making a 16-year-old boy a ward of court in a bid to stop him travelling to Syria. The boy, who cannot be named because of a gagging order imposed by the court, is a member of a family steeped in militant Islam. He has dual Libyan and British citizenship. Two older brothers have been killed fighting in Syria and a third continues to fight despite being injured. An uncle was held in Guantanamo Bay. Mr Justice Hayden said he was concerned to 'keep this lad alive' and said an order which barred from travelling abroad was proportionate. He said he was a vulnerable young person who had grown up in a family 'where the male members are patently committed to waging jihad in war-torn Syria'. The decision was made in the Family Division of the High Court after an application by social services at Brighton and Hove City Council.

"A Maryland man who was convicted of sexually assaulting men he met beer pong tournaments is said to have had at least 30 victims. Joey Poindexter, 40, from Gaithersburg, was convicted of luring men to his home to abuse them before taking photographs while they were incapacitated. Poindexter was convicted of sexually assaulting five men earlier this year. Prosecutors, who originally believed there were only a few victims, now say that he preyed on dozens of young men for 10 years and have asked for a 200-year sentence. Joey Poindexter, 40, (pictured) was convicted of sexually assaulting five young men he met at bars during beer pong tournaments and lured to his home, though prosecutors say he abused at least 30 . The case against Poindexter (pictured) did not begin to build until 2013, when a student alleged the real estate appraiser sexually assaulted him after they met in a bar during a tournament for the popular drinking game . Prosecutors said after Poindexter, 'confirmed they were helpless, he violated them sexually in every way imaginable, and often recorded it as keepsake.' Poindexter's lawyer, who is new to the case, was granted a continuance after new evidence was presented during the sentencing process, according to CBS 12. It wasn't until 2013 that allegations first emerged, when a student claimed the real estate appraiser sexually assaulted him after they met in a bar during a tournament for the popular drinking game. The student  didn't remember anything when he woke up in Poindexter's home the next morning and went to the police, who asked him to call the man and record the conversation, according to NBC Washington. Poindexter was reluctant to admit anything over the phone, telling the victim 'no matter what did or didn't happen, like I said, I was pretty trashed'. 'If it makes you feel any better, I don’t have any [expletive] AIDS, if anything did happen.' But when Poindexter met with the victim, who was wearing a wire,  he admitted they had sex while the student was intoxicated but said it was consensual. The student told police Poindexter had bought him beer, shots and a Long Island Ice Tea the night they met. Surveillance images (pictured) from the College Park pub showed the victim could barely stand while Poindexter led him out the door. His case has been given a continuance because of new evidence . Surveillance images from the College Park pub showed the victim could barely stand up as Poindexter led him out the door on the night of the assault, according to the Washington Post. And police found a video Poindexter had recorded that night of the two in his shower - which was later shown in court - on his phone. One anonymous juror said it 'seemed pretty clear' that Poindexter had been 'in a predatory state'. The college student's case was just the beginning. Police found pictures of a number of men 'in various states of consciousness' on Poindexter's cell phone. And they identified at least 12 other victims from photographs that were stored on his hard drive. Mayland authorities have also contacted police in Las Vegas, Dallas, Atlantic City, Salt Lake City and Virginia Beach, where Poindexter attended beer pong and skateboarding events. Three men stepped forward after the student's case was publicized and told police they had also been assaulted in Poindexter's Gaithersburg, Maryland, home while drunk . Poindexter was well-known on the tournament circuit and attended a number of beer pong competitions around the country in addition to skateboarding events . Three men stepped forward after the student's case was publicized and told police they had also been assaulted in Poindexter's home while drunk. Officers said all three victims had been drunk, and possibly drugged. Three of the fourmen Poindexter was convicted of assaulting testified against him, sometimes answering questions from their alleged abuser acted as his own lawyer. Poindexter was convicted of sexually assaulting a fifth man in January. Juror Jennifer Davis said the jury were 'disgusted to know that someone of that age' would prey on young adults. Police have urged other potential victims to come forward and contact the Montgomery County Special Victims Unit.","Joey Poindexter, 40, thought to have victimized young men for 10 years .

"A cliff-side walkway will give people the chance to explore a previously inaccessible Chinese mountain and get spectacular views of the cliffs, peaks and winding paths of an impressive mountain range from 1500ft up. Eager explorers have already been testing out the new bridge, which runs through the Wuling Mountain range in the Chongqing Municipality in south west China. The long walkway, which is due to be officially opened later this month, stretches through previously unexplored regions of the vast mountain. A cliff-side walkway which stretches across the previously inaccessible Wuling mountain range in south west China is to be opened . It will allow people access to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is peppered with ravines and gorges with pools and waterfalls, as well as more than 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars. A tourism chief said:  'It is actually quite safe and already to use, however we are waiting for the official opening to open it up fully. Some people have been sneaking past the barriers and there isn't any risk, but we really want people to wait until everything is absolutely ready.' The long walkway is about 800 metres long and its highest point is some 500 metres above the ground, according to The People's Daily Online. Wuling Mountain Valley is a 10km long valley, almost entirely covered by forest. The 800 metre long walkway has already been explored by tourists, who have jumped over barriers ahead of the bridge's official opening . It covers an area of around 29.96 square kilometres, mainly consisting of valleys, fields, winding tracks and precipices. Fuling Wuling Tourism Board came up with the idea of a walkway to give people access to the waterfalls, gorges and ravines that were previously inaccessible. It is part of a larger project that created a 'Five Area Zone' in 2010, which includes includes Fuling Wuling Mountain, Wuling Goddess Mountain, Fengdu South Heaven Lake. The long walkway allows people to explore the mountain range's ravines and winding paths as well as get views from 1,500ft up . The mountain allows access to the UNESCO World Heritage site with its waterfalls, pools and more than 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars . The walkway was created by the Fuling Wuling tourism board as a way to give people easy access to the mountain range and its views . Tourism chiefs said while not officially open yet, the walkway was safe to use but they were trying to wait for the official opening . In the area the Musk Dear Fort Viewing Platform has already been completed. If the new walkway proves a success, other similar bridges could be constructed. Mount Fanjing which is part of the mountain range where the walkway was built is home to the rare Golden monkey and is also regarded as a sacred Buddhist mountain. Qu Lunming, chief executive of the tourism board, said last year that around 590million yuan had been invested in the Wuling Mountain range.","A cliff-side walkway which stretches across a previously inaccessible Chinese mountain range is due to open up .

"A bid to free Guantanamo Bay inmate Shaker Aamer (pictured) faces further delay after US officials launched yet another review . A bid to free Guantanamo Bay inmate Shaker Aamer faces further delay after US officials launched yet another review, it was revealed last night. Even though the 48-year-old detainee from London has already been cleared for release twice by the US, a minister told the Commons his ‘complex case’ was being studied again by six federal agencies including CIA chiefs. The admission by Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood fuelled fears that the father of four could continue to be held indefinitely in the military jail, where he has already languished for 13 years without charge or trial. Mr Ellwood said there was ‘no timetable’ for the decision by US officials but he said they were determined to make sure the captive was ‘not going to be a danger to this or any other country’. Mr Aamer’s plight was raised during an impassioned Commons debate by MPs of all parties pressing for the freedom of the last British resident at the camp. Former Tory minister David Davis called Britain and the US’s handling of Mr Aamer’s case ‘immoral’. Lib Dem Tim Farron said there was ‘no excuse’ why the detainee should not be freed and said the US’s behaviour was like that of an ‘extremist regime’. He insisted the West had ‘fallen short’ of the standards millions of people had died to protect in the 20th Century and said its behaviour in setting up the torture camp was ‘exactly what Al Qaeda would have liked us to have done’. Politicians from all parties lined up to launch blistering attacks on the White House for failing to keep its promise to free the terror suspect, who lived in South London with his wife and children. They pressed ministers to explain why Saudi-born Mr Aamer had not been handed over despite being twice cleared for release – once by the Bush administration in 2007 and again by Barack Obama in 2009. The detainee’s supporters claim the intention is to silence him because he was tortured in Guantanamo and Afghanistan, including being beaten, waterboarded, shackled and threatened with execution. The abuse of Mr Aamer, said to have been a key aide of Osama bin Laden – a claim he vehemently denied – is alleged to have been witnessed by a British security official. The 48-year-old detainee from London has already been cleared for release from Gunatanamo Bay twice by the US (file picture) Labour MP John McDonnell said 33 prisoners had been released last year to countries including Uruguay and Kazakhstan. ‘It is hard to understand why the US finds the transfer to the UK almost impossible,’ he said. ‘The question we are all asking is why is Shaker still being detained. Is it that Shaker knows too much about what happened in Guantanamo and would ensure the truth comes out if he was released. ‘Or is it because he can bear witness not just to the US involvement in illegal criminal torture but also to UK involvement?’ He called for a ‘full and thorough independent inquiry’ into the detainee’s evidence about alleged collusion in torture by British intelligence officers. In a statement, Mr McDonnell said: ‘It is absolutely unacceptable that an innocent man continues to be to be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in absolute denial of his human rights remains in Guantanamo. ‘The continued incarceration of Shaker Aamer on US territory, without charge and against who unspeakable atrocities have been committed shames both our Governments and is an international outrage.’ Labour MP Gerald Kaufman (pictured) has hit out at the delay in releasing Mr Aamer . Liberal Democrat Tim Farron said there was ‘no excuse’ why Mr Aamer should not be released. He said the US’s behaviour was equivalent to that ‘of an extremist regime’. Labour MP Gerald Kaufman said: ‘If Islamic State had a camp where they interned illegally for years without charge people innocent or guilty, in which torture, solitary confinement and inhuman treatment were daily occurrences, we would regard it as savagery.’ MPs want Mr Aamer - who was granted leave to remain in the UK in 1996 - to be returned home urgently due to his deteriorating health. Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. But in 2001, he was detained in Kabul while carrying out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity, his representatives claim. He was handed to the US military for $5,000 and tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison. US intelligence agents insisted he financed Al Qaeda and was. He was sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002. Despite being cleared for release, US officials are determined he is sent to Saudi Arabia, despite serious concerns he will face torture. The current impasse is embarrassing for Prime Minister David Cameron who said President Barack Obama had vowed to ‘prioritise’ the detainee’s release from Guantanamo after White House talks in January. Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood said there was ‘no timetable’ for the six US agencies, which include the CIA and Defense Department, making a decision on his release. He refused to explain why the US was holding up Mr Aamer’s release, insisting he could not comment on ‘intelligence’ matters. But he said the US were determined to make sure the captive was ‘not going to be a danger to this or any other country’. Mr Ellwood added: ‘We continue to raise his case at the highest levels in the US and impress further upon our counterparts the urgency surrounding this.’","Bid to free Shaker Aamer from Guantanamo Bay is facing further delays .

"Seven decades of separation has seen even the language of North and South Korea split into two different dialects. The two countries, though enemies, are tied together by history, by family and by language - but only to a point. South Koreans have incorporated many English words and phrases into their language while isolated communist North Korea has eliminated words with foreign origins and created homegrown substitutes. North Korean defector Pak Mi-ok ended up going without water during a meal in the South because she was too shy to admit she didn't understand the term 'self-service' For those south of the divide, English-based words like 'shampoo,' 'juice' and 'self-service' are common. But they mean absolutely nothing to defectors from the insular North Korea. When Pak Mi-ok first arrived in South Korea after her defection in 2002, she was told by a waitress at a restaurant that water was 'self-service,' an English phrase she had not heard before. She ended up going without water during her meal because she was too shy to admit she didn't understand. 'I worried the waitress would look down on me,' she told the Associated Press. She started out working at restaurants but struggled to understand customers. 'I thought they spoke a different language,' she said. But she gradually picked up the new vocabulary and uses words like 'stress' and 'claim' that are not heard up in the North. Similarly, people in Seoul are confused by homegrown North Korean words like 'salgyeolmul,' which literally translates to 'skin water' - but is just 'lotion' in the South. The Korean Peninsula's 70-year split has created a widening linguistic divide that produces misunderstandings, hurt feelings and sometimes even laughter. The North's isolation near-worship of the ruling Kim family (pictured centre, leader Kim Jong-un) has also skewed the language . The gap has grown so wide that about a third of everyday words used in the two countries are different, according to scholars. North and South Koreans are generally able to understand each other given that the majority of words and grammar are still the same . But the differences show how language can change when one half of the country becomes an international economic powerhouse and the other isolates itself, suspicious of outside influences. The huge cultural influence of America through its military presence, business ties and Hollywood has flooded the South Korean vernacular with words borrowed from English. 'Konglish' uses English words in non-standard ways, like 'handle' for steering wheel, 'hand phone' for cellphone and 'manicure' for nail polish. In North Korea's view, this is just further evidence that the South is an American cultural colony. The North's isolation and near-worship of the ruling Kim family has also skewed the language. South Koreans use the English loan word 'juice' but North Koreans say 'danmul,' or 'sweet water.' South Koreans watch a 'musical' but North Koreans see a 'gamuiyagi,' or 'music and dance story.' 'Suryong' is the revered title for North's founding leader and his son, but in the South it's a historical term referring to a medieval regional or faction leader. The sea creatures that South Koreans call 'cuttlefish' are known in North Korea by the word South Koreans use for 'octopus.' The term 'elderly person' is considered neutral in the North, but pejorative in the South. South Koreans wash their hair with 'shampoo' but North Koreans use 'meorimulbinu,' or 'hair water soap.' The word 'dongmu' is used in North Korea to refer to a revolutionary colleague, but South Koreans seldom use the term. A 'dosirak' is South Korean word for a lunch box while North Koreans call it 'gwakbab.' South Koreans use the English loan phrase 'skin lotion' but it's 'salgyeolmul,' or 'skin water' in the North. North and South Korea have different spelling and pronunciation rules for the first syllable of some Korean words, so the common family name is 'Lee' in the South but 'Ri' in the North. South Koreans often end their conversations with phrases like 'Let's have lunch someday' or 'Let's go out for drinks soon,' but North Korean defectors who have just arrived often take those as literal invitations and expect a follow-up phone call to arrange the appointment. Source: AP . 'Suryong' is the revered title for the North's founding leader and his son, Kim Jong Il, the father of the current ruler, Kim Jong Un. But in the South it's used to refer to a faction or local leader from centuries ago. Misunderstandings can arise to seemingly innocuous Korean phrases like, 'Let's do lunch sometime,' which those in the South frequently use as a friendly ending to conversations, even with casual acquaintances. But newly arrived North Korean defectors take such invitations literally, and are often dismayed or offended when they don't get a follow-up phone call. 'If someone uses such empty words in North Korea, they'll see their relations with others cut off and be branded as a faithless person,' said a defector who asked not to be identified because of worries that doing so would put family members in the North at risk. Linguists say it takes about two years for North Korean defectors to feel comfortable conversing in South Korea. Over the past 10 years, there have been efforts to produce a joint dictionary containing 330,000 words from both countries - a rare example of co-operation. But as is often the case, political tensions have interfered with progress. The meetings only resumed last July after a more than four-year hiatus following the 2010 sinking of a South Korean warship. A new round of meetings, tentatively set for last month, hasn't been held as North Korea bristled over the annual springtime joint U.S.-South Korea military drills. Even language experts from the two countries can have trouble understanding each other. During last year's meeting in Pyongyang, South Korean linguist Kim Byungmoon said he tried to explain how South Koreans use the English word 'glamour' as a noun to refer to a voluptuous woman, but North Korean scholars had difficulty understanding its usage.","Two countries are tied together by history, by family and by language .

"Ownership of the 180,000 carat Bahia emerald has come down to two parties: an Idaho businessman who says he was once swindled into buying a stake in the gem and the government of Brazil, where the stone was first unearthed before embarking on 10 years of international intrigue. On one side is Kit Morrison, a Mormon investor who says he and two associates have successfully beaten back half a dozen rogues and thieves to gain legal ownership of the 840-pound rock. On the other stands the nation of Brazil, whose lawyers contend the cartoonishly large green jewel should be repatriated after it was illegally mined and shipped out of the country in 2001. Legendary gem: The Bahia emerald, one of the world's largest, has wound up in the custody of the LA County Sheriffs Dept after over a decade of changing hands and being shipped, stolen and fought over in court . Crystals the size of a man's arm protrude from the 840-pound stone and make the Bahia one of the largest emeralds ever unearthed . 'We've beaten six people,' Morrison told CBS News. 'We've either settled with them or beaten them in court to show that we are the bonafide purchaser of this emerald. We are the last man standing, if you will.' Morrison says he received it as collateral from gem dealer Larry Biegler for a shipment of diamonds for which he paid $1.3 million but never received. Biegler in 2008 claimed to Morrison--who was still awaiting his diamonds--that he'd been kidnapped by the Brazilian mafia, according to Bloomberg. Biegler had tried to pacify Morrison with two buckets of low quality emeralds he sold for just $20,000 and Morrison realized he was unlikely to ever receive his diamonds. So, he convinced Morrison's cohort Jerry Ferrera to help him get even with Biegler by taking possession of the Bahia emerald. When Biegler found the gem missing from his Southern California vault, he called police. The massive stone, which was pulled from a mine in the jungles of Brazil's Bahia state and is known as the Bahia Emerald, is not going to win any beauty contests. According to those who have seen it, it is a hulking brute of a gem, with several thick green rods the size of a man's forearms jutting out of a stone base. However, part of its allure--indeed, part of what led to a valuations of nearly $400 million--is in its convoluted history. The Bahia, one of the world's largest emeralds, has had a long journey since Silicon Valley entrepreneur Tony Thomas had himself photographed with it in a carport in Brazil in 2001. The LA Sheriff's Dept came to possess the internationally known stone after at least eight gem dealers, investors and thieves had one-by-one come to own--or believe they owned--all 180,000 carats of it . Legend has it, the emerald was originally 'carried out of the rain forest by a team of pack mules. Along the way the mules were attacked and killed by a pair of black panthers and had to be carried by a team of men and a hand made stretcher the rest of the trip,' according to TheBahiaEmerald.com . The emerald came into the U.S. in early 2005 and was kept in San Jose, California, for a time before being taken to New Orleans, according to a lawyer for the remaining group of claimants, including Kit Morrison. It was said to have been stored at a warehouse in New Orleans that was flooded with 16-feet of water during Hurricane Katrina then stolen from another warehouse in the Los Angeles suburb of El Monte. It was sighted briefly in Idaho before authorities finally seized it in Las Vegas in 2008. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is safeguarding it until the ownership dispute is resolved. Kryptonite for investors: The rock at one point was used as ill-fated collateral for business investment and a diamond purchase but now sits in legal limbo after slipping through the fingers of so many . During his trial that began in September 2010 and was delayed several times, Thomas testified that he paid $60,000 to the Brazilian miners who dug it up. He said he had previously paid $20,000 for four smaller Brazilian stones, including a 50lbs emerald that he still owns. Unlike that gem, the Bahia was too big to carry onto an airplane, so Mr Thomas said he returned home to Morgan Hill and wired the money to the Brazilians. Months later, he said, they told him the shipper had lost it. In his ruling, the judge noted Mr Thomas never insured the valuable stone or contacted the shipper to try to recover it. Judge Kronstadt also cast doubt on Mr Thomas' explanation that someone burned down his house to destroy his bill of sale. In a subsequent 2014 court ruling, gem trader Mike Downie was also eliminated from consideration by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Johnson. The judge found Downie's claim was not credible. Most gem-quality emeralds are mined in Colombia, not Brazil, where they tend to have more impurities. However, the lore surrounding the Bahia makes it a valuable collector's item . LA County cops then got involved and tracked the emerald down to Las Vegas, where Morrison and Ferrara had planned to sell it. The gem has remained in an undisclosed LA County facility ever since--through years of legal wrangling between eight different parties who claimed ownership at one point or another. But just as Morrison and company neared the end of the battle, Brazilian authorities threw their hat in the ring. In September 2014, Brazil petitioned to make all claims of ownership over the emerald void, claiming the rock was taken out of the country illegally. 'The simple fact of the matter is when it was mined out of Brazil and illegally exported, it should not have been,' the country's LA-based attorney John Nadolenco told Fox News. 'It belongs to the country of Brazil. It needs to be returned regardless of what happened subsequent to it leaving the country.' Brazil asked the Los Angeles judge to dismiss Morrison's case on Monday, which the judge refused and instead allowed the country to put forward its own formal claim of ownership as eight parties have done before. Morrison's attorney treated the decision as a victory. 'I'm happy for my client,' Morrison's attorney Andrew Spielberger told the LA Times. 'Now they'll have to wait until a judgment.' Brazil sees it as a slap in the face. 'The emerald was never theirs to buy, trade, sell, or invest in,' Nadolenco said. 'The second it came out of the ground, it belonged to Brazil and it still does.' Not so clear: Now at an undisclosed location, the Bahia may go to one of two or three parties, including the nation of Brazil, which wishes to repatriate the emerald .","At least eight rogues, thieves and gem traders have at some point laid claim to the 840-pound rock that was culled from the jungle in 2001 .
Years of legal wrangling have left just one group standing in the fight for the rock led by Idaho investor Kit Morrison .
However, the country of Brazil is now laying claim to the stone they say was mined and then exported illegally .
The over a decade-long saga of lies and betrayal have turned the huge but low-quality emerald into a nearly priceless art piece ."
"A neighbor said he is filled with guilt after hearing the cries of a 9-month-old boy who is believed to have starved to death in an apartment after his mother died of an apparent overdose. 'If I was closer to the noise, I would have done something. I didn't know. I feel so guilty. I feel so bad,' William Gonzalez said. The brother of the Pittsburgh-area woman went to check on his sister Friday morning , when he found her and her child, Casey, dead in their second floor home. Sara Kessler, 22, had not been heard from recently and may have died a week or two earlier, Assistant Allegheny County police Superintendent James Morton said. Scroll down for video . Sara Kessler (pictured) lived with her 9-month-old son Casey on the second floor of an apartment block in Millvale, Pennsylvania. They were found dead by her brother after he hadn't heard from her for several days . She was found on her bed and her son was in the living room. The superintendent said there were no signs of foul play. Mr Gonzalez, who lives on the first floor, said he was most upset knowing that the child was left alone with no chance to survive. 'The thought of that little kid running around after she died ... looking for food ... It's such a helpless feeling,' he told the Pittsburgh Tribune Review. 'It's a very sad situation in there,' Morton told reporters outside the apartment in Millvale, just across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. 'It seems like he [the infant] tried to survive but there was no food or anything for him to have.' 'It looked like he was trying to get around somehow by himself for who knows how long.' Pediatrician Dr Stephen Nelson said that the child may have survived a week without water. Sara Kessler's mother died of natural causes in the same apartment in November, Morton said. Gonalez and fellow tenant Elizabeth Freismuth said that the loss shook the young woman. Neighbor William Gonzalez said he feels guilty after hearing the cries of baby Casey following the death of his mother Sara (pictured) Kessler was known to be a drug addict by other residents of the building (pictured) and it is suspected that she died of an overdose. Casey's body was found in the living room - he is thought to have starved to death . 'She seemed so sad her mom was gone. I told her if she needed anything to ask me, but she never did,' Ms Freismuth said. 'Sara was a little on the wild side, but she was trying to be a good mother. She was devastated by my sister-in-law's death,' her aunt Kim Knaus said. Ms Freismuth added that Kessler 'loved that little baby. He was such a beautiful little boy'. Police suspect Kessler died of a drug overdose, and needles were found all over the apartment. A former resident of the building told CBS Pittsburgh that she was a drug addict and said that her family had tried to get her help many times. No one else lives on the same floor of the apartment building. Autopsies were scheduled for Saturday to officially determine the causes of death. Three house cats were also found in the second floor apartment. Police say the animals survived because of an automatic feeder, according to WPXI.

"Three people have been injured after shots were fired in the underground car park of Denmark's largest shopping centre, police have said. The attack took place earlier this morning at Fields - a busy shopping precinct on the outskirts of the Danish capital Copenhagen. Local media reported that two people had been arrested by police though it was not immediately clear whether . those responsible for the shots are being held. 'We have a massive presence [there]. It happened in the . parking basement. One person is hit in the arm, the other is . possibly hit in the back,' the police chief, Michael Andersen said. Alert: Police in Copenhagen have been on guard since former convict Omar El-Hussein attacked a free speech event and a synagogue, killing two people and injuring five police officers in February . Officials at Copenhagen police reached by telephone said . they could not confirm any details. There was no official word . on any motive, although witnesses claimed the shooting was gang related. Speaking to local news agency Rittzau, Andersen said the shooting was a result of 'two groups who clashed', adding that approximately eight people had been involved in the incident. 'It seem two groups got in a quarrel and it culminated in the parking basement in Field's where a still unknown number of shots were fired,' Police Communications Officer Sebastian Richelsen added. Located in the Amager district, Fields is the biggest shopping centre in Denmark. Copenhagen police have been on guard since local former convict . Omar El-Hussein attacked a free speech event and a synagogue, . killing two people and injuring five police officers last month. The first shooting took place at a public  event called 'Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression' at the, where El-Hussein killed film director Finn Noergaard, 55, and wounded three police officers. Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who garnered fame and notoriety for his drawings of the Prophet Muhammed, was among the speakers and is thought to have been the main target of the attacks. Hours later, security employee Dan Uzan, 37, was shot in the head as he stood outside a building belonging to the city's Great Synagogue. El-Hussein's bloody rampage was brought to an end shortly after when he was shot dead by police officers after a dramatic stand-off. Two deaths: Finn Norgaard, 55, (left) was killed at a free speech debate in a cafe in February, hours before 37-year-old Dan Uzan (right), a basketball player, was shot in the head as he guarded the door of a Bar Mitzvah . Gunned down: Omar El-Hussein, who two men in separate shootings in Copenhagen on Valentine's Day, was shot dead by police this morning after a dramatic standoff . Following the attack Denmark's government  pledged 970 million kroner (£95 million) to strengthen anti-terrorism measures, including boosting foreign and domestic intelligence gathering. The government started drafting the plans in January after lawmakers demanded a review of anti-terror measures following the terror attacks by Islamic extremists in Paris. Social Democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt says the plan includes 415 million kroner (£40 million) to boost efforts to monitor Danes joining Islamic militant groups abroad. A further 200 million kroner (£20 million) went to the domestic intelligence agency, and 150 million kroner (£15 million) to more IT and analysis capacity. The government also stated that it wants more SWAT team members and bodyguards in the city.","One person was shot in the arm and another in the back during the attack .

"UberX driver Gerald Montgomery, 51, allegedly took a passenger to the airport and then returned to her Denver home to try and break in . An UberX driver was arrested after he allegedly took a passenger to the airport and then returned to her Denver home to try and break in. Gerald Montgomery, 51, went to the woman's home after driving her to Denver International Airport and attempted to get in through the back door, according to a police spokesman. Police said Montgomery fled when the unidentified woman's roommate, who was inside the house, noticed him. The woman sent her roommate the Uber receipt, which featured Montgomery's photograph. Her roommate then posted the receipt on her Facebook page with a message to warn her friends. 'I had just gotten home when he was about to get in the back door,' she wrote, according to Fox 31. 'He probably thought no one else was here. Friends that take Uber, please be careful.' Police were able to identify Montgomery after seeing the receipt  and took him into custody at Jefferson County jail on suspicion of attempted second-degree burglary. Uber officials said they have contacted the passenger and refunded her ride, which cost $39.88. A spokesperson for the company said they also immediately deactivated Montgomery's 'access to the platform', according to the Denver Post. The company added that Montgomery had passed all criminal and driving history background checks before he was allowed to become a driver for the popular app. But, at least for his last passenger, that's not enough to make her feel safe. She told Fox 31 she would never use Uber again, even if it meant having to pay $90 to take a cab home from the airport.

"A teenager walking in the rain with her fiance died when he fumbled with their umbrella and accidentally pushed her into the road. Grace Dyson, 18, fell under the wheels of a van – that was being driven by her uncle. The chances of the accident happening and the coincidence of a relative being behind the wheel were ‘unbelievable’, a policeman told an inquest yesterday. Engaged: Grace Dyson (left), 18, was walking in the rain to a fish and chip shop with her fiancé Jason Booth (right) - when the tip of his brolly became caught in a crevice in a wall . Accident: Grace, who was walking with Mr Booth (left, pictured outside the court today), fell into oncoming traffic at the same second her uncle Ivan Beaumont (right, also outside court), 41, was passing in his van . Miss Dyson, an apprentice administrator, ‘wobbled and slipped like when you turn over on your ankle’, and the van driver had ‘no time to brake’, Detective Sergeant Noel Lowden told the hearing. The accident left Grace, a talented linguist, with ‘non-survivable head injuries’ as the split-second knock threw her under the Nissan Cabstar, Huddersfield Coroner’s Court was told. Miss Dyson’s heartbroken fiance, Jason Booth, 21, said he lost her in a ‘split second’. The couple, who had been dating for 14 months, were heading to a fish and chip shop in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, when tragedy struck. Mr Booth, a chemistry student at Huddersfield University, was holding an umbrella over them both as they walked along a pavement in the next-door village of Thongsbridge. Tributes: Flowers at the scene following the fatal crash in August last year in Thongsbridge, West Yorkshire . Remembered: A flag for the metal band Rammstein was among the tributes left at the scene in Thongsbridge . He told the inquest: ‘It was raining quite badly. It was quite a big umbrella with an elongated handle. ‘When we set off the brolly was up. On the side of the pavement we were walking down there was a dry stone wall - I was nearest to the wall and Grace was on my left. Couple: Chemistry student Mr Booth said he and 18-year-old Grace (pictured above) were ‘inseparable’ ‘The metal end of the umbrella got stuck in a crevice in the wall. It made me jolt to the left hand side - I remember seeing Grace’s foot slip over the edge. I think that’s when she fell.’ Driving past at that moment was labourer Ivan Beaumont – Miss Dyson’s uncle – who was coming home from work. He told police he had spotted his niece and was about to wave to her when she toppled into the road and under his Nissan Cabstar van. A passer-by rushed over to help but said there was little that could be done for Miss Dyson. She was pronounced dead by the emergency services when they arrived. Mr Beaumont was questioned by police but not charged. Det Sgt Lowden said: ‘He had no time. She fell in the road and hit her with his van. It all happened so quick and she went under the wheel’. He added: ‘It’s a tragic set of circumstances that Grace lost her footing at that exact time. Sadly this proved fatal. The chances of this occurring are unbelievable.’ Mr Beaumont was questioned by police but no charges were ever brought. Eyewitness Lesley Hardy, who was driving on the other side of the narrow road at the time, said he stopped as soon as he saw the crash. In a statement read in court, the driver said he had spotted a male dressed in Gothic clothes and a ‘black coat’ in the road. He added: ‘I realised this was not a black coat, but a woman. My wife and I got out of the car and went over to where she was. The male was very disorientated and seriously distressed. Struck: At the split second Grace (above) stumbled, her uncle told police he said he had just spotted his niece and was about to try to catch her eye to wave . Praised: Grace was a ‘homebird’ with a ‘natural flair for languages’ and was talented at art, her mother said . ‘There was no movement or sound from the lady in the road. Her body was sort of twisted. I spoke to the passenger who said it was his niece - I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. ‘It didn’t look like she was going to survive. A while later I heard she had died.’ Recording a road traffic accident verdict, Assistant Coroner Mary Burke said: ‘No one could have anticipated that this was going to happen. No one could have changed the pattern of events. 'It happened in fractions of a second. There was no way Jason would have predicted what was going to happen. I offer my deepest condolences to you.’ Grace’s mother Lydia Beaumont told the court her daughter was a ‘homebird’ with a ‘natural flair for languages’ and was talented at art. She added: ‘Grace and Jason were very close - they did everything together.’ After last August’s tragedy, Mr Booth wrote a tribute to his fiancee on Facebook, saying: ‘Life is unbelievably cruel at times, but everyone that ever met you will hold you in their memories as that crazy but absolutely lovable person that you were. ‘I could never thank you enough for the incredible memories you’ve given me, that I’ll forever hold tightly to me. I will be forever honoured and proud that I have your amazing self in my life.’","Grace Dyson, 18, and Jason Booth, 21, were walking to fish and chip shop .

"Underage students at a boarding school were allowed to get drunk at a curry house during a supervised school trip, a tribunal has heard. The teenagers from Moorland High School, in Clitheroe, Lancashire, were said to have drunk wine, lager and spirits as they ate a meal at an Indian restaurant, alongside three staff members, the hearing was told. Deana Hall, 53, was dismissed from her job as a house parent following the incident, and now claims she was made a scapegoat and unfairly dismissed. Deana Hall, 53, was dismissed from her job as a house parent from Moorland High School, in Clitheroe, Lancashire after pupils were said to have drunk wine, lager and spirits as they ate a meal at an Indian restaurant on a school trip . She was one of three boarding house staff who took the group of 27 teenagers to the Balti Stan Indian restaurant in Clayton-le-Moors for a meal. Yesterday, an employment tribunal in Manchester heard that none of the parents had given consent for the students to drink alcohol. But Mrs Hall told the hearing it was not her responsibility to secure permission from the parents of the group of 15 to 18 year-olds, and was instead the responsibility of her superior. The hearing was shown a series of pictures allegedly showing students with alcohol and heard that one boy drank a glass of wine and three pints of lager, and that he bought a Jack Daniels with Coke for another student. It also heard how students were reportedly acting drunk and slurring their words. Head teacher Jonathan Harrison said in evidence that none of the students had been given permission by him to drink alcohol and none of their parents had consented. She was one of three boarding house staff who took the group of 27 teenagers to the Balti Stan Indian restaurant in Clayton-le-Moors for a meal.  But Mrs Hall told the hearing it was not her responsibility to secure permission from the parents of the group of 15 to 18 year-olds, and was instead the responsibility of her superior . Mrs Hall said it was the responsibility of her superior, boarding house manager, Deborah Richards, to secure the correct permissions. She added that Mrs Richards had said a glass of wine, paid for by the school, would be permitted. Mr Harrison, who represented the school at the tribunal, said that Mrs Hall had failed in her safeguarding duties and was guilty of gross misconduct by allowing students to get drunk. He also said that her actions placed the children in danger and the school could have been closed down as a result. Following the incident on Friday, May 16, 2014, Mrs Richards resigned her position and told the headteacher that she accepted full responsibility. Mrs Hall and her colleague Carol Cradock were suspended and attended an internal disciplinary hearing after which they were both dismissed. Mrs Hall, who lives in Clitheroe, appealed the decision but was unsuccessful. The mother-of-two and grandmother-of-one, who had worked at the school for more than 10 years, said that making sure that parental permission for school trips was secured was not her responsibility. The hearing was shown a series of pictures allegedly showing students from the school (pictured) with alcohol and heard that one boy drank a glass of wine and three pints of lager, and that he bought a Jack Daniels with Coke for another student. She also told the hearing that she did not see any student drinking more than a glass of wine or a pint of lager. Mr Harrison told the tribunal: 'She still can't accept that she did anything wrong and I think it's appalling. 'She brought the school into disrepute. She was in breach of the trust of the school and the parents and her conduct could have led to a serious injury to a student who, under the influence of alcohol, could have wandered out of the restaurant and into the path of a car which could have closed the school down. 'I find it impossible that she has not accepted any wrong doing.' Mrs Hall said: 'Mrs Richards rang me up afterwards and told me that she felt awful that we were going to lose our jobs because she had not done her job correctly. 'No student was drunk at all and we made sure of that at the end of the night. 'During my whole time at the school I had never seen a risk assessment and it was not part of my role. 'I would not have permitted alcohol at all if I had organised the trip but my boss said that it was ok and I had no reason not to trust her.' Citizen's Advice Bureau lawyer Angela Cuncliffe, who represented Mrs Hall, said: 'My client seems to have been made a scapegoat. 'She has lost a job she loved, her good name and quite a bit of money.' Judgement was reserved by Judge Rebecca Howard and is expected to be given in the next four weeks. Following the hearing Mr Harrison said: 'Sometimes we have to make very difficult decisions when looking to protect the welfare and needs of children.' A headline on an earlier version of this article said that teachers were present when some pupils drank alcohol at a restaurant. In fact, it was school boarding house staff who were supervising the pupils when the incident in question took place. We are happy to clarify this.","Teenagers from Moorland High School, in Clitheroe, Lancashire, were said to have drunk wine, lager and spirits as they ate an Indian meal on trip .

"The trend for fresh, local, unprocessed foods could be putting people at risk if they opt to drink raw milk. This is according to a new study that claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill than the pasteurised version. Raw milk is associated with more than half of all milk-related food borne illnesses, even though only an estimated 3.5 per cent of the population in the US drink it. Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment.  Advocates believe it is s healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. But a new study claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill . Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment. All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised – heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds. As well as killing E.coli, the process also eliminates campylobacter, salmonella and listeria. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs. Advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children. But US tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same. Advocates believe that raw milk, which contains more natural antibodies, proteins, and bacteria than pasteurised milk, is healthier, cleaner, and tastes better. They argue pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid. But the new study shows the risks are better understood than the benefits and that more research is needed to prove that the health claims are legitimate. They claim it can put people at risk of microbial contaminants commonly found in milk including infectious Salmonella, Campylobacter,and Listeria species along with the most dangerous form of E. coli. These bacteria can cause foodborne illness in humans, including diarrhea, vomiting, cramping, fevers, and sometimes more serious consequences such as kidney failure or death. 'The risks of consuming raw milk instead of pasteurised milk are well-established in the scientific literature and in some cases can have severe or even fatal consequences,' says Cissy Li, a graduate student in environmental health sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 'Based on our findings, we discourage the consumption of raw milk, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, people with impaired immune systems, pregnant women, and children.' Pasteurisation involves heating milk to destroy microbes in the milk supply from fecal contamination, dairy operations, cow udders, or other sources. Treated milk is hermetically sealed to prevent recontamination. Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may also contain these bugs . Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future conducted an analysis of 81 published scientific journal articles, . 'Ultimately, the scientific literature showed that the risk of foodborne illness from raw milk is over 100 times greater than the risk of foodborne illness from pasteurised milk,' says report lead author Benjamin Davis, also a graduate student in environmental health sciences. 'Although potential benefits related to the consumption of raw milk would benefit from further investigation, we believe that, from a public health perspective, it is a far safer choice to discourage the consumption of raw milk.' The study comes as incidents on three farms selling raw milk  led to E.coli poisoning in five children aged one to 12 and one adult aged 28. Last year, the Food Standards Agency in the UK suspended sales of raw cows’ drinking milk and any product made from the milk, including cheese, at all three farms.","Advocates of raw milk say pasteurisation removes important nutrients .

"Prince Charles, pictured today, has been told his letters to ministers must be released despite warnings it would infringe his 'freedom of expression' Prince Charles's 'lobbying' of ministers is set to continue unabated – even though more than two dozen private letters already written by him on issues of Government policy will be made public within weeks. Clarence House yesterday expressed its 'disappointment' that the Supreme Court ruled the Attorney General had acted unlawfully in using a veto to block publication of his so-called 'black spider' memos. But senior royal sources also insisted to the Mail that the future king had no regrets about acting as an 'advocate' for his people. One said the judgment was 'unlikely to impact' on Charles doing what sees as his public duty. Yesterday's ruling by the UK's highest court follows a nine-year legal battle between the Government and The Guardian newspaper, which used the Freedom of Information Act to apply for 27 letters written by the Prince to senior politicians to be released. The Prime Minister also said he was disappointed by the ruling. Charles has long been accused of bombarding ministers with memos in an attempt to influence policy on issues close to his heart such as the environment, farming, the countryside, GM crops and complementary medicine. During the period in question – September 2004 to April 2005 – he wrote to seven Government departments: Business, Innovation and Skills; Health; Children, Schools and Families; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; Culture, Media and Sport; the Northern Ireland Office and the Cabinet Office. The correspondence – nicknamed black spider memos because of Charles's scrawling handwriting and use of underlining and exclamation marks – is said, according to previous Attorney General Dominic Grieve, to contain 'full and frank' expressions of his 'most deeply held personal views'. The newspaper was initially successful in its application. In 2012, however, the Attorney General employed a rarely-used ministerial veto to block publication under Section 53 of the FOI Act. He said the public could interpret the letters sent to ministers in the last Labour government as showing Charles 'disagreeing with government policy'. This would be 'seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality… he cannot easily recover it when he is king'. That veto was challenged by The Guardian in the Supreme Court which ruled, by a majority of five to two, that the government did not have a right to overrule a decision taken by the courts. Charles and Camilla today spent today riding in a rickshaw at Clarence House to promote a race across Madhya Pradesh, India later this year . Views: An August 2000 letter from Lord Irvine, Tony Blair's mentor and later the Lord Chancellor, heavily annotated by Prince Charles in his 'black spider' handwriting . The seven Supreme Court judges made their ruling on two legal points. One was whether Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General in 2012, was right to issue a Section 53 certificate under the Freedom of Information Act, effectively blocking publication of the letters. The other question was whether an obscure EU directive – the 2003 Environmental Information Regulations – meant that any specific environmental information contained in Charles’s letters must be published. Lord Neuberger, the court president, said the Court of Appeal had already rejected Mr Grieve’s arguments that Charles’s views must be kept private. He said that it was not lawful for ‘a member of the executive to overrule a judicial decision simply because he disagrees with it’. Four other judges agreed that the letters should be published but Lord Hughes and Lord Wilson disagreed. Lord Wilson said the Appeal Court judges had ignored the constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Six of the judges said that environmental matters in Charles’s letters should be made public under the EU directive. Discussions are under way as to how to co-ordinate the release of the 27 letters. This may not happen for several weeks but they are likely to prove embarrassing to the Prince. They cover issues such as the Armed Forces, the plight of foot and mouth-hit farmers and other rural concerns. They are probably the only letters to be released because the law has been changed to make correspondence by senior members of the Royal Family exempt from FOI requests. Mr Cameron echoed Clarence House's views yesterday, saying: 'This is a disappointing judgment and we will now consider how to release these letters. This is about the principle that senior members of the Royal Family are able to express their views to government confidentially.' A spokesman for the Prince said: 'Clarence House is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld.' David Cameron said the ruling was 'disappointing' and argued that senior Royals should be able to communicate with ministers 'confidentially' But senior royal sources also insisted that Charles and his team were quite 'sanguine' about the decision. 'This has come down to quite a narrow legal principle and was not about the content of the letters,' one said. The source rejected descriptions of the future king as a meddler, insisting he was an 'advocate' simply trying to shine a light on issues raised with him by members of the general public. Asked whether the ruling would stop the Prince writing to ministers, the source said: 'This is a small loophole in the law that the government have very quickly closed. I can't imagine it [the decision to publish] would impact on the Prince of Wales as he undertakes his public duties and service.' Letter lover: Prince Charles is said to have sent 1,000 letters a year at peak periods in his life . A defiant Prince Charles has always maintained he has the right  to express his forthright views to ministers even after he becomes King. At peak periods, his passionate words have poured out at the rate of 1,000 letters a year to ministers and other public figures. As the furore over his 'black spider' letters peaked in 2012, the heir to throne was said to be unrepentant about the row furore sparked by the Government's decision to stop 27 'particularly frank' letters written to ministers in the last Labour government to be revealed. Courtiers told the Mail that it is the prince's 'right and absolute duty' to correspond with politicians over issues that affect his country and future subjects. And sources close to the prince made clear that Charles will continue to air his opinions, even during his private meetings with the Prime Minister after he accedes to the throne. 'The Prince of Wales absolutely sees it as his duty to make his views known to ministers,' they said. 'He is a man of passionate belief and will always strive to make his views clear.' As a self-confessed 'interfering busybody', Charles has become renowned for expressing his strong views on a huge variety of issues ranging from youth opportunity to architecture and the environment. His prolific missives are known as 'black spider memos' because of his scrawled handwriting. Explaining his willingness to get involved in issues and causes he said himself: 'The trouble is, I always feel that unless I rush about doing things and trying to help furiously, I will not (and the monarchy will not) be seen to be relevant and I will be considered a mere playboy.'","Attorney General made a final attempt to block release of Charles' letters .

"A Missouri teenager sparked a massive online campaign to change his school's strict dress code after he was left in tears when teachers told him to change out of the 'special' ensemble that he wore on his birthday and questioned whether the effeminate look of the outfit meant he had 'gender issues'. Morgan Ball, 17, was called into the office at Lee's Summit North High School on Friday morning, after turning up to class wearing 'jeans, a T-shirt and shoes, a shawl, a necklace, jewelry... and a corset' and was immediately told to remove the more flamboyant parts of his clothing, before being asked whether he had 'gender identity issues'. The news of the school's reaction to his birthday outfit sparked fury among his friends and peers, many of whom took to social media to share their outrage at the situation, using the hashtag #clothinghasnogender in order to generate further interest. Scroll down for video . Fighting back: Morgan Ball, pictured on his birthday last Friday, was asked by his teachers whether he had 'gender identity issues' because he wore jewelry and make-up to school . Totally normal: According to a close friend of Morgan's, who made a video about the incident, the outfit was just like any other outfit that Morgan would normally wear . Shortly after the incident, one of Morgan's closest friends, Lizzie, also created a video, using the popular hashtag as the title, in order to explain in detail what had happened between the teenager and the teachers. 'Morgan is gay but not a lot of people judge him for it... there are a select few in the school,' the high school student said. '...It was his birthday and he had dressed up for his birthday. He wore jeans, a T-shirt and shoes. He also wore a shawl, a necklace, jewelry, he had his nails painted, he had a glove on and a corset. 'He also put on make-up.' Lizzie continues by stressing that this type of outfit is completely 'normal' for Morgan, and for his friends who know him well. 'He was called down to the office and they told him - they asked him actually - if he had gender identity issues. They also said that it was a ""distraction to the learning environment for the children"" and they told him to take it off and he took it off.' Speaking out: Morgan's story quickly turned his #clothinghasnogender campaign into a viral social media sensation. The teenager is pictured here speaking to a local news outlet in his hometown . She adds: 'Morgan was really upset, he was crying at the end of the day. I've never seen him so hurt before, and I want to do something about it. The young girl goes on to explain that Morgan received an overwhelming amount of support from his classmates, reading out several of the tweets posted by pupils at the school using the hashtag #clothinghasnogender. 'I admire what Morgan did today, he is such a brave soul and I fully stand behind him,' one tweet read. Another said: 'Many students and faculty disagreed and have voiced their opinion that not allowing him to wear things that are allowed by the dress code is unfair and discriminatory.' And it seems that the viral campaign has already managed to make a change. Earlier today Morgan and his parents, Cheri and Jason Ball, met with school administrators to discuss the incident and talk about what changes the school would be willing to make to its dress code to avoid any similar incidents from occurring in the future. Ready for change: Morgan and his parents, Cheri and Jason Ball, met with teachers at the school (pictured) earlier today in order to try and make a positive change to its dress code . Excited: Both Cheri and Jason (pictured) said that they felt very positive about the steps that the school are taking to try and change the situation . 'I felt they heard us, we heard them. I'm really excited about working with them in the future,' Cheri told local news channel KCTV5. 'The fact that what he was wearing didn't break policy, it was more on the ambiguous side of it's distracting,' Morgan's father Jason added. The Ball family are now working on drafting up a new dress code policy in the hopes that the school's administrators can get it approved by the school board. 'I say just continue to be yourself,' Morgan said to KCTV5 after meeting with the school. 'It's very important as long as you feel you are following the school policy, they cannot take that away from you. 'And whatever makes you feel comfortable is what everyone else needs to realize.'","Morgan Ball, a student at Lee's Summit North High School in Missouri, arrived at school on Friday wearing jewelry and make-up .

"A university lecturer is suing his ex-wife for £83,500 after she allegedly swapped his sperm for an ex-lover’s while undergoing fertility treatment. The respected academic claims he was led to believe that he was the father of a child born through in vitro fertilisation (IVF). He subsequently paid thousands of pounds in child maintenance after he and his wife divorced. A DNA test eventually revealed the child was not his. In the first case of paternity fraud involving IVF in the UK, the lecturer claims that when his former wife travelled to a fertility clinic in Spain with her ex-lover – a visit his ex-wife admits took place – the ex-lover pretended he was her husband and donated sperm . A university lecturer is suing his ex-wife for £83,500 after she allegedly swapped his sperm for an ex-lover’s while undergoing IVF (file picture) The case will come to the High Court this week, with the parties referred to by pseudonyms. The Mail on Sunday knows their identities but they cannot be named for legal reasons. The couple married in 2002, and the husband – who already had two children by a previous marriage – had his vasectomy reversed so they could have a baby. But the wife failed to conceive and turned to the ex-lover for comfort. A family source said: ‘The marriage was turbulent. His wife got bored with her husband and had long conversations with her ex-lover.’ In 2004 the husband and wife visited the IVF clinic where the lecturer provided sperm for use later. But the following year, his wife returned with her ex-lover and he donated sperm. During a third visit, she had a fertilised egg implanted with the clinic using her ex-lover’s sperm. Seven months after the baby’s birth, the husband and wife separated and were divorced in 2007, with the lecturer sharing custody of his son, now aged nine. The 60-year-old academic has launched a High Court (pictured) action in a bid to get £83,500 damages, including the return of child maintenance payments . As the child grew older, the academic noticed he looked like his wife’s ex-lover. A DNA test carried out when the boy was five confirmed he was not the lecturer’s son. His wife, now aged 53, said there must have been a mix-up with his sperm at the fertility clinic, but denied intentionally deceiving her ex-husband. But by then the lecturer had already paid thousands of pounds in maintenance. Now the 60-year-old academic has launched a High Court action in a bid to get the money back. His claim for £83,500 damages in the Queen’s Bench Division is for fraudulent misrepresentation and the return of maintenance payments, plus interest. Professor Allan Pacey, a fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, said: ‘It’s extremely unlikely the clinic mixed up the sperm. It’s a bizarre case.’ The lecturer’s solicitor, Ellen Windsor, said: ‘I have been involved in two previous landmark cases covering paternity fraud in the High Court, both of which were successful.’","Lecturer suing ex-wife over claim she swapped sperm for ex-lover's in IVF .

"The pound is heading for a 13-year high against the euro in a boost to British holidaymakers travelling to the Continent . The pound is heading for a 13-year high against the euro in a boost to British holidaymakers travelling to the Continent. Sterling soared above 1.39 euros yesterday – its strongest position since late 2007 and up from around 1.27 in January and 1.20 a year ago. Experts said the pound could rise to 1.55 euros in the coming months – the highest level since late 2002 – in a shot in the arm for British families travelling to Europe. ‘All of a sudden a price of 1.55 doesn’t seem too far away,’ said Harry Adams, managing director of currency specialists Argentex. A family changing £500 would now get 79 more euros than they did a year ago and 109 more euros than two years ago. Figures from currency exchange firm Travelex show £500 would now buy 674 euros compared with 595 euros in March 2014 and 565 euros in March 2013. Tracy Bownes, retail director at travel money specialist Moneycorp, said: ‘British cash is going further in the eurozone than it has in almost a decade. Now is a great time for Brits to be travelling in the eurozone.’ It is feared, however, that the strong pound will damage exports by making British-made goods more expensive for foreigners to buy. The pound has been driven higher by the rosy outlook for the British economy as it bounces back from the Great Recession. The UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 last year – leaving the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy in its wake. At the same time, the euro has been hammered as the threat of stagnation and deflation hang over the single currency bloc. Experts said the pound could rise to 1.55 euros in the coming months – a boost for British families travelling to Europe . Lee McDarby, an executive director at banking group Nomura International, said: ‘The euro is falling like a hot knife through butter against the pound.’ The European Central Bank will next week start pumping billions of euros of emergency funds into the ailing economy in a desperate effort to stimulate growth. The Frankfurt-based institution will print £43.5billion of new money a month until September 2016 or possibly later – totalling at least £825billion. The prospect of a flood of euros being created through so-called quantitative easing has lowered the value of the single currency. The euro sank below $1.09 against the US dollar yesterday – its lowest level for nearly 12 years. Kathleen Brooks, research director at currency firm Forex.com, said the euro could soon reach ‘parity’ with the dollar – meaning one euro buys just one dollar. ‘The downtrend is strong and broad-based,’ she said. ‘It would be a braver trader than I to stand in its way. It will take a big effort to change sentiment towards the euro at this stage.’","Sterling soared above 1.39 euros yesterday - strongest position since 2007 .

"A top grammar school has been fined £10,000 after a 14-year-old boy was smashed in the head during a shot put event and left with life-changing injuries. The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal shot at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent. The year nine student then underwent emergency brain surgery for 'potentially fatal' injuries after fragments of skull went into the teenager's brain. A top grammar school has been fined £10,000 after a 14-year-old boy was smashed in the head during a shot put event and left with life-changing injuries. The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal ball at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent . The boy, who was formerly a keen rugby player, has been told he will never play again. The victim had been part of a class of 24 Year nine pupils taking part in a multi-sports PE lesson on June 20 last year hugely over-subscribed grammar school. The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put. But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time. The pupil suffered a severely fractured skull and was rushed to Kings College Hospital in London. He was due to have an operation to alleviate the swelling in his brain but it was decided the surgery could have worsened his condition. A few days later his condition deteriorated and he underwent emergency brain surgery to remove fluid from the brain. The school's governing body was hauled in front of Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court today charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil. The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson . Prosecuting, Kevin Golding said: 'It's unclear what the long term impact will be. 'He has recovered sufficiently to return to school but we don't yet know the long term impact on his memory, intellect, mood, personality and his future employment prospects.' The court heard the teacher in charge, David Joseph, has taught at Judd for 10 years, and has been a teacher for 28 years overall. He was in the centre of the sports field overlooking the javelin throwing pupils when the incident happened. The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson. But the pupil who threw the shot says he didn't hear the whistle, the court heard. He started the throw with his back to the landing area the victim was stood beside, and it hit the victim on the head. Defending, Dominic Adamson said that although the boy's injuries were the result of an unfortunate accident, the health and safety procedures in place were not conducive to a serious risk of it happening. The court heard the victim was a very keen sportsman and particularly enjoyed rugby. Because of the injuries he sustained and the indentation to his skull, it was said that he will never play again. Mr Golding said: 'The victim was seriously injured and fortunate not to have suffered fatal injuries. 'He has sadly suffered life changing injuries which could have been avoided. 'He was a very keen sportsman, particularly his love of rugby, and the damage and indentation he still has at the base of his skull means he can't play rugby anymore. 'He and his family have endured a difficult nine months and face more difficult times ahead.' Chair of the bench Nick Bensted-Smith said the victim had suffered a 'very serious and devastating injury' as a result of the incident and the school received a fine of £10,000, legal costs of £1,375 and a victim surcharge of £120 . Chair of the bench Nick Bensted-Smith said the victim had suffered a 'very serious and devastating injury' as a result of the incident and the school received a fine of £10,000, legal costs of £1,375 and a victim surcharge of £120. The teacher is not facing any disciplinary action by the school and has not been charged with any criminal offences. The Judd School pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to ensure that a child in their care was, so far as is reasonably practicable, not exposed to risks to their health or safety. They suspended their athletics lessons until a full audit was done and revised health and safety measures had been put in place. Head teacher Robert Masters said: 'The Judd School expresses its deepest regret over the serious accident which took place in a PE lesson on 20 June 2014, when a student was hit on the head by a shot put thrown by another student. 'It is a relief to all that the injured student has been attending school full-time since September. 'The Judd School accepts the verdict of the Magistrates' Court today that it has breached the Health & Safety at Work Act. 'In particular the school's organisation of the PE lesson in which the incident occurred did not fully comply with the guidance of the Association for Physical Education. 'The safety record is exceptionally good; however this incident has led to a major review of safety by staff and governors. 'We have re-examined all our safety procedures in PE and are in the process of doing the same across the whole school. We have also shared the lessons from this incident with other secondary schools. 'Whilst accepting that we cannot eliminate accidents altogether, we are as confident as we can be that a similar accident will not happen again in future.'","Pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on back of the skull .

"Foul-mouthed: Jeremy Clarkson (pictured last night) told guests at The Roundhouse Gala in north London that his bosses were 'f****** b*******' Jeremy Clarkson last night launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala. The Top Gear star,  speaking in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. Clarkson - whom the BBC has suspended over claims he punched a producer - told guests at The Roundhouse Gala that the driving series 'was a great show and they've f***** it up'. A video of his speech emerged as it was claimed last night that Clarkson visited his producer's home to apologise for their Top Gear altercation - but was given the cold shoulder. In footage obtained by the Daily Mirror, he spoke to the Roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his 'last ever lap' on the Top Gear track - which later went for £100,000. Clarkson said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me. 'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.' He added: 'There was an 18-year waiting list to be in the audience of Top Gear, but the BBC has f***** themselves.' Last night, a report claimed that the BBC probe into the row had been told producer Oisin Tymon refused to even open the door to Clarkson after he turned up at his house. Sources said the incident happened four days after 54-year-old Clarkson allegedly punched Mr Tymon during an argument after filming over a hot meal at a North Yorkshire hotel. The claims emerged as it was revealed Clarkson and his co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week. Rant: Clarkson speaks on stage, next to Pink Floyd's Nick Mason, during The Roundhouse Gala last night . Support: This evening Clarkson thanked all the people who have called for him to remain as presenter . The top-rating show was pulled off air and Clarkson was suspended while an inquiry was launched. It has also been claimed that Clarkson has sent at least one apologetic email to Mr Tymon. Ken MacQuarrie, the BBC executive in charge of the inquiry, has reportedly been shown the contents of the emails. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'In the hours before he reported the matter to the BBC, Clarkson seemed increasingly desperate to apologise to Oisin and persuade him to let the matter blow over. 'When he arrived on the doorstep that Sunday, Oisin was not feeling ready to face him so didn't answer. He just didn't want to speak to him after what happened. Bids: Clarkson (centre), sitting next to journalist Christa D'Souza (left) and Nettie Mason (right) - wife of Pink Floyd's Nick Mason - during the live auction at the gala, to raise money to help disadvantaged youths . Guests: Clarkson (left) with Sally and Ronnie Wood (right) at The Roundhouse Gala in north London last night . 'Clarkson could be heard saying that he just wanted to talk. He was asking for the door to be opened but it didn't work. He tried for up to five minutes but in the end had to walk away.' Today, the BBC was given another reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank. The vehicle, apparently driven by the motoring show's enigmatic professional driver The Stig, made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street. Fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the Change.org petition, started by political website Guido Fawkes. The petition, launched last week, reads: 'We the undersigned petition the BBC to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson. Freedom to fracas. #BringBackClarkson'.' Although Top Gear is now off air, tickets are still on sale for the four performances of the live show in Norway, next Friday and Saturday. Up to 5,000 people are expected to attend each one.

Petition is delivered: A man dressed as The Stig is pictured leading a tank charge to the BBC offices in London today to hand over one million signatures to bring back Jeremy Clarkson . City route: The vehicle made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street . Meanwhile, it was also revealed last night that Clarkson's future on the BBC is likely to be decided next week when the corporation's internal probe into his behaviour is given to the director-general. A BBC Worldwide source told The Daily Telegraph: 'At the moment we are taking things on a day by day basis and as things stand the [Norway] shows are scheduled to run as billed. 'It is not happening tomorrow, it is happening in eight days' time, so we are waiting to see what the investigation delivers. 'No-one is really sure about the timing of the investigation's decision, so before we disappoint 20,000 fans in Norway, at the moment we are going ahead with the show.' Clarkson has been suspended since it emerged he was involved in what the BBC called 'a fracas' with one of the show's producers. It was reported this week that Clarkson's Top Gear co-hosts declined an offer to continue the rest of the series without him. The last episodes of the series have been postponed, causing the BBC to lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints.

"A behavioral checklist that the Transportation Security Administration uses to help identify airport travelers they believe could be potential terrorists  has been revealed. The Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques system, nicknamed SPOT, breaks down body language and demeanor the TSA believes indicates either 'stress' or 'deception'. Mannerisms are assigned points based on their severity and are assessed by trained 'Behavior Detection Officers', who observe passengers as they go through the security checkpoint. Behaviors are given points based on their perceived severity. If you walk through security with a 'face pale from recent shaving of beard' or happen to be yawning or whistling, you can be assigned one point. Scroll down for video . It has been revealed that the Transportation Security Administration uses a behavioral checklist, nicknamed SPOT, to help identify potential terrorists among airport travelers (file photo) A strong body odor, sweaty palms and a bobbing Adam's apple can also get you one point, according to the checklist obtained by The Intercept. Having 'widely open eyes' will get you two points, as will showing 'unusual' interest in a security officer's work routine or having 'identical luggage or dress' to an individual who does not seem related to you. Appearing to be in disguise will get you three points. But you can also get points shaved off. If you appear to be a member of a family or part of a married couple, you get two points deducted from your score. Being a female over 55, or a male over 65, gets you a one point reduction. The checklist includes a list of items and behaviors to look out for if a passenger is pulled aside for  inspection. 'Suspicious' items range from blueprints to liquids 'in excess of 3.4oz'. Further signs of deception include excessive yawning or perspiration and lacking details about the purpose of one's trip. The SPOT program, which has cost more than $800million since its inception in 2007, was deemed ineffective by both the Department of Homeland Security and the Government Accountability Office last year. SPOT breaks down body language the TSA believes indicates 'stress' or 'deception', including sweaty palms, a strong body odor, widely opened eyes or a bobbing Adam's apple (file photo) The GAO found that there was no scientific evidence to support the SPOT's claim that terrorists can be picked out via 'behavioral indicators', and said the human's ability to 'accurately identify' suspicious behavior is 'slightly better than chance'. The Department of Homeland Security report said that the TSA had not assessed the effectiveness of the SPOT program or designed a 'comprehensive training program' for it. It concluded that the TSA could not 'ensure that passengers at United States airports are screened objectively' with SPOT and did not believe the administration could 'justify the program's expansion'. TSA was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union last week for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request regarding the SPOT program. The ACLU is alleging that the program leads to racial profiling. A spokesperson with the TSA told the Intercept that 'behavior detection' was just 'one element' of the administration's efforts to 'mitigate threats against the traveling public'. 'No single behavior alone will cause a traveler to be referred to additional screening or will result in a call or a law enforcement officer.' 'Officers are trained and audited to ensure referrals for additional screening are based only on observable behaviors and not race or ethnicity'.","The Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques system breaks down body language the TSA believes indicates 'stress' or 'deception'
Mannerisms are assigned points based on their severity and are assessed by trained 'Behavior Detection Officers'
Other traits the TSA watch for include a 'face pale from recent shaving of beard,' yawning or whistling, a strong body odor and 'widely opened eyes'
Points are shaved off if you are married, a member of a family, a woman over 55 years of age, or a man over 65 .
Both the Department of Homeland Security and the Government Accountability Office have found the program to be ineffective ."
"A woman's stowaway Chihuahua was discovered by airport employees before it could depart New York with its owner. The traveler 'had no idea the pup had crawled into a suitcase until TSA officers detected the dog inside the woman's luggage' according to the Transport Security Administration's Lisa Farbstein. The beige and brown dog would have flown from La Guardia Airport to a layover in Chicago before arriving at its owner's final destination of Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to the Queens Courier.

However, the checked, hard-shell case set off the TSA alarm, and employees found the woman before she boarder her flight. Ms Farbstein said that owner was 'shocked' that her covert canine had decided to join her on the West Coast. Her husband came to the airport and picked up the Chihuahua. It is not known whether the woman made her flight. Social media users reacted on Twitter by calling the dog 'the most adorable stowaway' but also expressing concern that the animal could have suffocated if not found before being put in the baggage hold.","Beige and brown chihuahua was stowed away in hard-shell suitcase .

"Beth Cowan pushed herself to the brink, living on just an apple a day. But now the 19-year-old, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, has fought back to fitness and is in the running to be crowned Miss British Empire 2015. The brave teenager even took to the stage at a recent beauty contest to tell crowds how she had battled eating disorders and hoped her participation would inspire others fighting the illness. Beth Cowan, 19, of Chester le Street, County Durham, struggled with anorexia and bulimia, at one point tipping the scales at just 6st 3lbs. Now, she is a healthier 8st 2lb (pictured) Beth has fought back to fitness and is currently in the running to be crowned Miss British Empire 2015 . During a Q&A round, she told the host how she'd love to win to send a message of hope to others in the same boat. Beth has now shared a shocking snap of the way she used to look in a bid to convince other young people not to take the path she chose. Beth, who suffered bulimia and anorexia, would spend hours running on a treadmill in her bid to shrink her body to a tiny size. Weighing just 6st 3lb and standing at 5ft 8in, she had a BMI of 13.2 and was classed as dangerously underweight. Beth said: 'I was 16 and still at school. I do not know how it started - there was no specific cause. At 5ft 8in, Claire had a BMI of 13.2 and was classed as dangerously underweight . 'I just started restricting what I ate. I would go on a treadmill for an hour and eat an apple a day. 'Then, I was in Newcastle's Marks and Spencer when I walked past a mirror and I could not believe how skinny I was. 'People used to say I looked like I was dying. I went to the doctors - I knew I needed to do something or I would not be able to have kids. 'The disease took everything away from me. It was my way of gaining some control, everything else was out of my control.' Her condition became so dangerous she could no longer attend school and had to be home tutored. Miraculously, Beth still managed to earn As and Bs in her GCSEs and now hopes to be a teacher. Threatened with the prospect of hospital, Beth started to see an eating disorder specialist who helped her get her life back on track. 'They said to me if I did not do something right now I would be an inpatient tubed up because my weight was too low,' she said. 'I used to cry at the thought of going into hospital - I was absolutely terrified.' After being scouted at the Miss Bijoux beauty competition for Miss Newcastle, Beth will now take part in Miss British Empire. It's a long way from the days when she would live off one piece of fruit a day - and she is urging other girls in her situation to seek help. 'People used to say I looked like I was dying.

"They are the foods we hear horror stories about, and have been told to avoid at all costs. Coffee, eggs, coconut oil and whole milk are just some of the items which have been on the receiving end of bad press over the years . But it’s now time to dispel the myths and embrace these real foods. Scroll down for video . Whole milk is good for you and contains more nutrients than skimmed or semi-skimmed milk . Eggcellent news: Eggs are an essential breakfast food for those who want to lose weight . Nutritionist and author Sarah Flower told FEMAIL:‘For years we have been told that fat is bad for us, eggs aren’t healthy and instead we have been following a diet rich in refined and processed foods. ‘It’s time to kick back and start to enjoy real food - eggs, whole milk, butter, cheese, peanut butter - all of which are good for you if you follow the simple rule - eat it in its pure state. Ms Flowers said that refined foods, rather than the fat content of the food itself is what makes us ill. ‘It is not the food that is making you ill or fat, it’s all the refinements,’ she explained. ‘So change the way you think, ignore the low fat, skinny, light and calorie counts and opt instead for a diet of rich wholegrain and real food,’ she continued. Homemade popcorn (left)  is an inexpensive and low calorie snack for everyone. Potatoes (right) contain vitamin C, B6, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and zinc . Drinking coffee in moderation can improve brain health, aid weight loss and enhance performance . And whilst consuming a lot of any sort of food in excess is bad for you, some of these items have got such bad press in the past that we’ve all but stopped eating them out of fear. For instance we’ve steered clear of high-fat foods like peanut butter, whole milks and yogurt as we’re worried that they will make us fat. ‘Eating fat does not make you fat,’ Ms Flowers clarified. ‘It’s extras like sugar which will make you pile on the pounds.’ FEMAIL has worked with Ms Flowers to identify the 10 supposedly unhealthy foods which are actually good for you. Coffee . Too much can make you jittery, upset your digestion leaving you with gas, IBS and can have a laxative effect, gives you bad breath and can increase your stress and anxiety levels.However, coffee in moderation has also been shown to improve brain health, aid weight loss, enhance performance and has even been shown in some studies to protect you against Alzheimer’s and dementia. Potatoes . A starchy food that converts to glucose raising your blood sugar but did you know it was also packed with additional nutrients. One medium potato can provide you with up to 50 per cent of your daily vitamin C, 30 per cent of your B6 and 25 per cent of your potassium requirements. It also contains calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, B vitamins and zinc. New potatoes have a much lower GI (glycaemic index) than old potatoes so opt for them if you are watching your weight or try using antioxidant rich sweet potatoes! Eggs . Scared of salmonella and high fat foods? Shake off these misconceptions and dust off your egg poacher, it’s time to embrace eggs. High in protein and good fats, they keep you fuller for longer. Ditch the breakfast cereals, this is essential breakfast food for those who want to lose weight. Peanut Butter . Too high in fat? Ignore this as fat does not make you fat. Peanuts of packed with protein, magnesium, potassium, vitamin E, antioxidants and essential fibre. Choose your peanut butter wisely, cheap varieties contain sugar and other added extras. All you need is peanuts on your ingredient list! Meridian are a good choice. Canned beans . Canned beans can be higher in sodium from the liquid they are stored in, so choose wisely and read the labels. They are however a fantastic protein and fibre source helping to keep your bowel in tip top condition. They they are also cheap and help bulk a meal. Choose wisely: Opt for peanut butter which doesn't contain sugar and isn't stuffed with extras.   Replace low fat, sugary yoghurts with full fat natural and Greek yoghurt (right) Switch to Himalayan crustal salt (left) when preparing good at home (right) as this salt contains 84 minerals . Popcorn . We are not talking about the processed, sugar laden stuff, but homemade popcorn. A brilliant, inexpensive and low calorie snack for everyone. Add your own flavourings and you won't ever buy the processed versions again. You can pop these in a saucepan (with lid) or a microwave. The popcorn is ready in minutes and children will love helping you make them. If you have a sweet tooth but don’t want sugar, add some grated dark chocolate whilst warm before leaving to set – a fantastic treat. Whole Milk . We have had it drummed into us since the early 1990’s that fat is bad. While we have all been ditching the fat and replacing it with refined carbs we have been getting fatter. Whole milk is good for you and contains more nutrients than skimmed or semi-skimmed milk. It won’t make you fat but it will fill you up making you want to snack less. Best of all its in its natural whole state – something your body loves! Yoghurt . The problem with yoghurt isn’t actually the yoghurt but the multitude of extras the food manufacturers add to them – like sugar! Replace low fat, sugary yoghurts with full fat natural and Greek yoghurt. You will benefit from the natural probiotics as well as no sugar or additives. Eat this with some fresh fruits or your own fruit compote. Delicious! Salt . There is no getting away from the fact that we consume too much salt, but that is primarily from processed foods. Switch to home cooking and you will reduce your salt intake. Switch to Himalayan crystal salt, which is unrefined, and this contains 84 minerals (compared to just 4 minerals for table salt). Coconut Oil . Unless you have been living under a stone, you can’t fail to hear about Coconut oil – but it’s a saturated fat! Well, it’s a medium chain fatty acid which is easily digested and converted into the fat burning ketones we love. Embrace it has it has been shown to have huge health benefits from boosting the immune system to aiding weight loss. Versatile and delicious and no, it doesn’t leave your food tasting of coconut!

"The A&E four-hour waiting target will be missed for the whole of 2014/15, the Department of Health today said. Repeated failure to achieve the target of 95 per cent of patients waiting four hours or less at A&E departments in England means it is no longer possible for the NHS to meet the standard for the year. The latest figures, for the week ending March 8, show the gold standard was missed for the 23rd week running. It comes as a report warns even top performing hospitals are showing signs of buckling under the immense pressures faced by the NHS. 'Warning signs are flashing' across hospitals with experts advising the Government there is 'no quick fix' to the troubles plaguing the health service. The Department of Health today said the four-hour A&E waiting time will be missed for the whole of 2014/15 after the latest weekly figures showed the target was not achieved for the 23rd consecutive week . Today NHS England revealed 92 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital. It marks a four-week high, but still falls short of the 95 per cent target. It came in spite of higher numbers of patients attending emergency departments, with 434,800 patients visiting A&E - up by more than 8,000 from the previous week and a four-week high. A round-up of the winter's figures show unprecedented demand on A&E, with two weeks in December having the two highest attendance figures ever recorded for a winter period. Emergency departments across England dealt with more than seven million attendances from November to February - an increase of 190,000 on the same period last winter. And demand in November and December was particularly high, with attendances up by 6.2 per cent over the two months. The highest peak was seen before Christmas in the week ending December 21, when there were 446,000 attendances - up 9.3 per cent on the same week last winter. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'We know the NHS is busier than ever before and despite missing the A&E standard for the year, over nine out of ten patients are being seen, treated and discharged within four hours. 'We've given a record £700 million this winter for almost 800 more doctors, 4,700 more nurses and 6,400 more beds and are backing the NHS long term plan which focuses on joining up care and doing more to prevent illness, and have provided an extra £2 billion in funding next year to build a service fit for the future.' Meanwhile a new report by the Nuffield Trust suggests the problems facing the NHS go far deeper into hospitals than just the front door at A&E. They warn a 'deteriorating access to services is starting to affect patients attending even the best-performing hospitals'. Meanwhile those at the bottom end of the performance pile have seen a 'marked deterioration'. The think tank has warned that not only are patients waiting longer to be seen in A&E, access to key services across the hospital is being affected by 'systemic' declines in performance. Patients arriving at A&E have often had to wait longer than the four-hour target, according to the Nuffield Trust's analysis of how all 156 hospitals trusts in England have performed against six national targets over the course of the Coalition government. It comes as a report warns even top performing hospitals are showing signs of buckling under the immense pressures faced by the NHS. It found the problems facing the NHS go far deeper into hospitals than just the front door at A&E, affecting access to planned treatments . But the report highlights the problems with today's NHS go further than A&E. It found the majority of hospitals breached a target on at least one of the six measures - most notably the A&E waiting time, the 18-week target for a hospital bed, and the six-week target for scans and other diagnostic tests. Co-author Holly Dorning, said: 'The vast majority of patients are still receiving care within the target times, but our analysis shows that deteriorating access to services is starting to affect patients attending even the best-performing hospitals. 'We've known that hospitals have been struggling to meet the four-hour A&E target for a while. 'But the fact that we are starting to see problems in other areas, like access to planned treatment, is a real concern. 95 per cent – the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in A&E before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital. 92 per cent – average performance against the four-hour target by major A&E departments in 2014. Three hours 43 minutes – the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving A&E. Two hours 17 minutes – the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is sent home after leaving A&E. More than one hour, four minutes – how much longer on average a patient over the age of 75 spends in A&E compared with those aged under 75. 'As this study makes clear, warning lights are now starting to flash across the wider hospital system.' The Nuffield Trust's analysis also questions the assumption that access to care deteriorates as hospitals are asked to treat more patients. While extra activity in A&E, outpatient treatments and cancer care is matched with poorer performance against access targets, the NHS has absorbed an additional 240,000 diagnostic tests and an additional 45,000 urgent cancer referrals in the past year with little impact on performance against the associated targets. Criteria monitored by the trust also included the 18-week target for an outpatient appointment, the two-week target for urgent cancer referral, and the 31-day target for cancer treatment. Co-author Ian Blunt warned there is no 'quick fix' to the problems. He said: 'While looking at a narrow set of targets can only tell us so much about the quality of care, this analysis does suggest that some of the recent reductions in performance are systemic. 'The response to declining performance must be dictated by a deeper understanding of its causes, and political leaders should be aware of their system-wide nature. 'There are no quick fixes for growing waiting times and we need to be prepared to see further breaches of targets in the future.' The report states that longer waiting times could simply be the result of hospitals having to carry out more procedures. Nuffield Trust analysis shows that increases in hospital activity are not always associated with a decrease in waiting time performance. The report adds: 'Failure to meet, for example, the four-hour A&E target appears to have very little bearing on performance against other measures. 'This again suggests that these problems may be systemic and that applying extra pressure at hospital level is not the best approach to reversing the recent performance drop.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'We know the NHS is busier than ever  and despite missing the A&E target for the year, over nine out of 10 patients are being seen, treated and discharged within four hours. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'The NHS is busier than ever, as innovative treatments and medicines mean people are living longer with complex conditions like heart disease or diabetes. 'We've increased the NHS budget by £16 billion over this Parliament but ultimately we want to reduce pressure on services through our plans to increase access to primary care and look after people better in the community.' Responding to the latest A&E figures, Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, director of operations and delivery for NHS England, said: 'This winter NHS staff in England pulled out all the stops and, compared with last year, provided care for an incredible 190,000 more people coming to A&E and 51,000 more being admitted to hospital as an emergency. 'These record numbers - up by between six and nine per cent some weeks - mean that although the NHS won't have met the A&E average 95 per cent target for the full year, staff continued even during this busiest winter ever to treat more than nine in ten people within four hours. 'And most patients were, in fact, treated in under an hour. This is not only the best performance in the UK but probably of any major country internationally. 'These winter pressures underline the importance of the wider work under way as part of the NHS Urgent and Emergency Care Review which will deliver care in a more integrated way, better helping people get the right treatment, at the right time and in the right place.'","Repeated failure to meet four-hour target means it cannot be achieved for the year 2014/15, the Department of Health said today .

"A mother has fled to Syria with her two young children to join Islamic State. Rehana Begum Islam abandoned her husband of 14 years, vanishing overnight with her eight-year-old son and three-year-old daughter. The 33-year-old travelled from Heathrow to Istanbul on February 14 and then took an internal flight to Gaziantep, a city on Turkey's border with Syria. She is believed to have been helped by a Syrian who was arrested last week on suspicion of getting three east London schoolgirls across the border. Runaway: Rehana Islam with husband Azizul and their two children, whose identities are protected . Her passport details were found on his laptop – showing she and her children have been with Islamic State fanatics for five weeks. Mrs Islam's devastated husband Azizul says he has not stopped crying since police revealed she had travelled to Gaziantep, a popular gateway to Syria for foreign fighters and jihadi brides. 'It's really hard for me,' said the 36-year-old minicab driver last night. 'I haven't seen my kids for more than one month. I can't even sleep without my kids. 'My question is why did she go there? She has two kids, she has a family, and this house is in her name. Why has she left everything? This is really unbelievable. 'When the police told me she travelled to Gaziantep – I've seen it in the news, so many British people are trying to travel there – it came into my mind that maybe she's gone to Syria but still I can't believe it.' Last night Turkish intelligence sources revealed her ID documents were found on the laptop of Mohammed al-Rashed. He was arrested on suspicion of helping Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, become jihadi brides in Syria. All three attended Bethnal Green academy in Tower Hamlets. Al-Rashed, 28, is said to have told detectives he has mainly helped British fighters but also South Africans and Australians. The details of two other Britons, aged 19 and 29, were on his laptop. Mr Islam said: 'He must've also helped her to get there. 'I'm worried about my kids, I hope she comes back with my kids. Please. She's going to destroy my two kids' lives. 'IS is killing Muslim people as well. My religion doesn't say anything about killing people. 'If you're Muslim you should know that the Koran doesn't say this. These people are dangerous.' Scroll down for video . Intelligence revealed Mrs Islam's documents were found on Mohammed al-Rashed's laptop, who  was arrested on suspicion of helping Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase (pictured) become jihadi brides . The Bangladeshi-born father said he had no idea how his wife, who suffers from depression, had become radicalised. He did not know that the former RBS clerk posted frequently on Facebook about Islam. But he said she spent a lot of time on her smartphone. Mrs Islam took her laptop with her when she disappeared. Her husband added: 'If I knew anything I would do everything to stop my wife, especially my two kids. I do everything for my kids since they were born. I look after the kids like I'm their mother. 'I play the role of mother because my wife can't handle them sometimes. When I married her she wasn't religious, she was like a normal girl, she didn't even cover herself. But a couple of years ago she started covering up and praying five times a day.' Mr Islam, who works nights in Enfield, north London, said he suspected his wife was missing when he came home in the early hours. 'I couldn't see anyone in the house but most of the weekends she spends at her sister's house, it's not far, it's round the corner,' he said. 'I tried calling her big sister but she said she wasn't there. We called her friends, relatives and made phone calls, but no one knew so we called the police. 'The police told me she took a flight from Heathrow to Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam to Istanbul. When they found out that she flew to Gaziantep maybe then they thought she went to Syria. I don't have any clue.' Schoolgirls Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and  Amira Abase, 15, (pictured at Gatwick airport) fled to Turkey before crossing the border into Syria where they are believed to have become ISIS jihadi brides . Turkish intelligence sources said British authorities did not inform them that Mrs Islam might be travelling to Syria until February 23 – nine days after she landed in the country. Turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with Syria, but has accused European states in turn of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place. There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the war zone in Syria and Iraq. Security services estimate that more than 600 Britons have gone to join militant groups since the explosion of violence in the region began. They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become jihadi brides.","Rehana Begum Islam has fled to Syria with son, eight, and daughter, three .

"The village of Aird Uig on the Isle of Lewis will be the best spot to view Friday's solar eclipse - and the only B&B in the area still has a room available for the spectacle. The west side of Lewis is the best place in the country to view the event, and Stornoway Astronomical Society has already received nearly 500 enquiries from people across Britain and Europe wanting to visit the islands for the eclipse. Eclipse viewing glasses have been selling out fast - and guest houses and B&Bs are opening up seasonally early to cope with the tourist demand. Scroll down for video . Visitors to the Isle of Lewis will be hoping the clouds stay away on Friday for the solar eclipse . Friday's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind 16 years and the best place to witness it is set to be in the Isle of Lewis . The tiny and remote hamlet of Aird Uig on the isle's west coast has been named as the best place in the UK to experience the deepest part of the solar eclipse - and shadow fever is starting to grip the area. Seacroft is Aird Uig's only B&B. Proprietor Sarah Taylor-Gerloch had sold both her spare rooms - but one, costing £75-a-night, was to a couple of Dutch eclipse chasers. 'They have had to unfortunately cancel. He wanted to treat his wife to a surprise 50th birthday experience to watch the eclipse but it turned out there was a clash of birthday surprises. So the room is free,' said Mrs Taylor-Gerloch. Aird Uig is set to be the best place for viewing Friday's solar eclipse - and there are still rooms to rent . The village of Aird Uig has only one B&B, and one couple's cancellation has freed up a room for the eclipse . The Isle of Lewis is als famous for the Callanish prehistoric stone circle whis is said to be over 5000 years old . 'Ironically the other people who have booked did not know about the eclipse until I told them. They were coming for an outdoor break so this is a real bonus for them. 'We have a glorious view all the way to the Butt of Lewis but the eclipse has helped put Aird Uig on the map. It will all depend on the weather - if people know it will be clear for the eclipse there will be lots of tourists. But it is a long way to come on the off chance. Aird Uig is a village on the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Aird Uig is within the parish of Uig. Known for its stunning location with a picturesque bay that offers spectacular elevated views of the surrounding seascape. Aird Uig is mainly a former Cold War camp, high above sea level, used by the RAF to man a vital communications post. The giant mast has been removed and now residents want a community buyout of the military land - with plans including an astronomical observatory and getting Aird Uig listed as an official dark skies spot. Richard Leparoux, who runs the small four star hotel Auberge at Carnish in Uig, said he had booked out half his four rooms to eclipse seekers from England - paying £135-a-night. 'I think nearer the time there will be a late rush when people know for sure the weather will be good to see the eclipse,' he said. Pupils at Uig primary school have made special eclipse viewers to protect their eyes. Ian Fordham, chairman of Outer Hebrides Tourism, said the isles were a black spot for all the right reasons. 'Many of our members have opened up in March especially for the eclipse,' he said. 'We have inquires coming in from all over the country and we are expecting a frantic late rush once the weather seems ok. Cornwall had something like one million visitors when it had the eclipse. We are not expecting anything like that but it should give the season a once-in-a-lifetime early boost. 'People coming from the mainland have to catch a ferry - it is not like Cornwall where people just hopped in a car. 'We have the best view in the UK and these eclipse enthusiasts will travel far distances to see it - and we will be ready to welcome them.' A spokesman for the Western Isles Council added: 'It is just another good reason to come to the islands to enjoy some of the best scenery in the world - or not, in this case.' Aird Uig is a vital communications post, but residents want a community buyout of the military land . The moon will travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over the Earth and darkening the skies across Scotland and across Europe in the morning of Friday (20 March). It is a chance in a lifetime for many to see such a dramatic sight. The partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will start around 8.30am and will last until about 10.45am. The further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland is the place to be on this list . Dr Steve Bell, head of the HM Nautical Almanac Office said: 'The path of totality lies well to the northwest of the UK making landfall over the Faroe Islands and Svalbard as totality moves towards the North Pole. 'The UK will see this eclipse as a deep partial eclipse. 'The place that sees the deepest partial eclipse of the sun in the UK is the west coast of the Isle of Lewis close to Aird Uig. 'Here 98 per cent of the sun will be obscured at mid-eclipse at around 9:36am. 'Skies will darken for any location where the maximum obscuration exceeds 95 per cent which includes north-western Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and Shetland Islands.' Stornoway Astronomical Society are staging a special observing session at the 5,000 year old Callanish Stones - thought to have been an ancient observatory. Society president Donny Mackay said it had received a deluge of inquiries about the eclipse and were expecting a large number of visitors. 'The Isle of Lewis is the best location in the UK for viewing the eclipse - marginally better than in Shetland and the Orkney isles. We are hoping the weather will be in our favour on the day,' he said. A team from BBC Breakfast will be broadcasting live from Callanish too. David Warrington, resident astronomer at the Scottish Dark Sky Observatory added: 'It will suddenly get dark for half an hour or so with an eerie false dawn. 'From the Borders upwards you should get this noticeable darkening and the further north you travel the darker it will appear to be as more of the sun will disappear behind the moon.' Birds can be fooled by the sudden darkness and are likely to fly off to find refuge. Experts warned people not to look at the sun for too long and use eclipse glasses or a pinhole viewer.","The west side of the Isle of Lewis set to be the perfect viewing spot .

"German shepherds were bred specifically for their high levels of intelligence and as a result are commonly used as police and guard dogs around the world. However their desire to learn, which clearly overpowers their desire to just accept what is, can sometimes lead them to become a source of amusement, as this dog's owner recently found out. Filmed in a garden, the German Shepherd named Sonja stares down at its shadow being cast on the floor before giving its owner and his friends a laugh. The dog initially stares down at its shadow being cast onto the patio before making an attempt to paw at it . Wagging its tail, the dog initially seems to try and lose its shadow by hopping around and making a sharp turn. As it gets back to its original position it realises that the shadow is still there, and it stamps on it with its left paw. Suddenly the German shepherd leaps into the air and jumps down onto the shadow, before hopping three more times in quick succession. Attempting to lose the shadow, the dog jumps up into the air and lands back down onto it below . The German Shepherd called Sonja later jumps onto the shadow three more times in quick succession . The people standing around watching can be heard laughing and one of them notes: ‘He’s playing with the shadow. He sees the shadow.’ The dog then circles its shadow once more, as if deciding on the most strategic plan of action – its tongue sticks out in concentration. Before leaping into the air – leaving the ground with all four legs – and landing back down onto it several more times. The dog circles its shadow, as if deciding on the most strategic plan of action, before jumping on it . The people watching can be heard laughing as the German shepherd attempts to lose its shadow .

"Researchers have mapped dark matter in several colliding galaxy clusters more than a billion light-years away. And one outcome of the research is that dark matter might not actually be composed of particles, as previously thought. Instead, a number of theories ranging from it being a fluid, to not existing at all, have been presented by researchers - who also say it is likely 'weirder than we first thought.' Researchers in Switzerland and the UK mapped dark matter in clusters (shown in blue), and discovered that dark matter might be 'weirder than we thought'. Clockwise from top left, the galaxy clusters are: MACS J0416.1+2403, MACS J0152.5+2852, MACS J0717.5+3745, ZwCl 1358+62, Abell 2744 and Abell 370 . The research was carried out by scientists from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, the University of Edinburgh and Durham University. They used data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory to measure galaxy clusters - collections of hundreds of galaxies. Surprisingly, the study discovered that dark matter ‘particles’ may simply pass through each other when galaxy clusters collide. ‘This work looks at the way dark matter interacts with itself when massive clouds of it are smashed together with other massive clouds,’ lead author Dr David Harvey from EFPL told MailOnline. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. ‘We find that when this happens, the dark matter does not get affected at all and it carries on unimpeded.’ This implies that dark matter particles do not interact with themselves, which would have caused dark matter to slow down. Instead, it appears that while dark matter could interact ‘non-gravitationally’ with visible matter, this is not the case when it interacts with itself. More importantly, the study challenges the view that dark matter consists of proton-like particles - or perhaps any particles whatsoever. ‘The implications for dark matter are that it rules out some models of particle dark matter, for example it challenges the idea that dark matter is made of an equivalent 'dark proton' that is exchanging 'dark photons’,’ said Dr Harvey. ‘To say we can conclude that dark matter is not a particle is too far, but we are challenging many models of dark matter, and it remains to be seen whether dark matter is a particle as many lines of research are yet to prove this.’ Using the Hubble Space Telescope (shown from Space Shuttle Atlantis in 2009), the team observed distant galaxies that were more than a billion light-years away. They were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter, and make maps of where it should be . Harvey's data came from the Chandra X-ray Space Observatory and the Hubble telescope, and included the famous Bullet Cluster collision (shown), a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet. This particular collision is the best current evidence for the existence of dark matter . Dr Richard Massey, one of the authors on the study, told MailOnline that it was most likely a different type of particle to what scientists had been looking for so far. ‘But there are those very weird theories that also might be able to replace this,’ he said. One theory is that perhaps the theory of gravity, first proposed by Einstein, is wrong - and dark matter doesn’t actually exist at all. All of our evidence for dark matter so far comes from its supposed gravitational effect on galaxies - but if our models of gravity are wrong, then this could be false evidence. ‘Alternatively, dark matter could be some kind of fluid, rather than a particle with a property in space,’ Dr Massey said. Another theory is that dark matter is made out of ‘glue balls’, which are a conglomeration of smaller particles ‘glued’ together in an ensemble. The researchers created the maps by studying the effects dark matter had on extremely distant galaxies. While dark matter can’t be seen directly, it’s presence can be predicted based on these interactions. ‘We can’t observe wind, but you know it’s there because leaves are floating around,’ said co-author Dr Richard Massey from Durham University's Institute for Computational Cosmology. ‘Dark matter is similar, we can’t see it, but it pulls things around a bit.’ Using the Hubble Space Telescope, the team observed distant galaxies that were more than a billion light-years away. They were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter, and make maps of where it should be. But the fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or, perhaps, even other matter - in ways we would think. ‘If you hit your head against a wall of dark matter, your head would go straight through,’ explained Dr Massey. ‘This makes it very difficult stuff to work with.’ ‘Dark matter is all around our own galaxy, all around Earth, and is passing through us right now, but it doesn’t have an effect on us.’ He added that it was ‘embarrassing’ that we knew so little about dark matter, despite seeming to be a ‘parallel universe’ that was far more important than our own. And from their study, the researchers conclude that dark matter is even ‘weirder than we first thought.’ The scientists also used data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (illustration shown) to measure dark matter in the distant galaxies. But it is very difficult to find. ‘If you hit your head against a wall of dark matter, your head would go straight through,’ explained co-author Dr Massey . The fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or, perhaps, even other matter - in ways we would think possible. Shown is the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1+2403 and its dark matter distribution, shown in blue, based on its gravitational interactions . Although it accounts for 90 per cent of all matter in the universe and more than a quarter of its energy, scientists still know very little about dark matter. After a two-year shutdown and upgrade, the multi-billion dollar Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is about to ramp up for its second three-year run. Scientists are promising nearly twice the energy and far more violent particle crashes this time around - and hope to get a glimpse of dark matter. The team at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, or Cern, say if nature cooperates, the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe. Beams should start running through the giant machine later this month, with the first high energy crashes probably coming in May, accelerator director Frederick Bordry said in a news conference in Geneva. Scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics, including a first ever glimpse of dark matter, one of the chief focuses of the experiment. 'I want to see the first light in the dark universe,' said Cern General Director Rolf Heuer. 'If I see that, then nature is kind to me.' One major idea among astronomers is that dark matter consists of a new subatomic particle that we haven't discovered yet. More exotic theories want dark matter to be a quantum defect from the birth of the universe, extra-dimensional mass, or even a modified form of gravity. What we do know is that dark matter interacts with cosmic structures through gravity, shaping and molding them. For example, dark matter bends light that passes through it, distorting images of distant space objects. In addition, dark matter speeds up the motion of galaxies inside galaxy clusters, which are collections of hundreds of galaxies, containing literally astronomical amounts of stars, planets, and gases. Galaxy clusters are also 90 per cent dark matter, which makes them ideal for studying it, especially when they collide into each other and force their respective dark matters to interact. Based on this knowledge, Dr Harvey and his colleagues studied data from 72 galaxy cluster collisions. These cosmic crashes happen over the course of billions of years when galaxy clusters attract each other because of their gargantuan masses. When this happens, the dark matter in each galaxy cluster interacts with that of the other, offering a unique opportunity to study it. The team's data came from the Chandra X-ray Space Observatory and the Hubble telescope, and included the famous Bullet Cluster collision, a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet. And so far, this particular collision is the best evidence for the existence of dark matter, based on its interaction with the clusters. In the coming years, scientists will be hoping to directly observe dark matter particles in a number of detectors - including the LHC at Cern. What form it will take, though, or whether it is really there, remains to be seen.","Researchers in Switzerland and the UK mapped dark matter in clusters .

"Many millions have suspected it all along, but now the genie is out of the smoked glass bottle, the unvarnished truth laid bare on the pink and orange kitchen units. Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has hideous taste. Hideous. Final proof of this comes in the fact that no one wants to buy his six-bedroom, Grade II-listed, 16th-century Cotswold farmhouse. He says would-be buyers have been put off by the ‘shifting sands of Government policy’. But I believe it was because they’d rather sleep in a sheep ditch than live with his wallpaper. And who could blame them? Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, 50, pictured here in his kitchen with wife Jackie is having trouble selling his six-bedroom, Grade II-listed, 16th-century Cotswold farmhouse. Why? Jan Moir suspects it may be the decor . The £1.6 million property just outside Cirencester has been on the market for more than a year. The retina-punishing interior, with every last primped and tweaked corner of it designed by Laurence himself, must take the blame. Buyers take one look at his work — the neon-hued kitchen, the gravy-coloured drawing room, the tree-painted bedroom, the giant peony print wallpaper, the stone lions by the front door (I could go on) — then head for the Cotswold hills. In a humiliating climbdown, the outrageously camp Llewelyn-Bowen has had to dismantle his own designs and redecorate the place with the kind of bland neutrals he loathes. Ooh, his feelings must be hurt — but surely the only person surprised by the antipathy to his exuberant individual style must be Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen himself? For the evidence of his frightful taste has been there, for all to see, for years. It is not so much his studiedly gaudy everyday appearance, with his tan leather jackets, polka dot shirt’n’tie combos, Guy Fawkes beard and unquenchable fondness for a ruffle — although all that does not help. It is more his murky history as an interior designer and style expert on television shows such as the hit BBC series Changing Rooms. Before it ended in 2004, Laurence had a reputation for making people cry by forcing his vision of grand living on to what he described as their ‘dark, drab and depressing’ homes. Laurence and his flamboyant taste had a reputation for making people cry on BBC hit TV series Changing Rooms. 'The evidence of his frightful taste has been there, for all to see, for years,' says Jan Moir . This usually involved the great man insisting that they threw out their neutral, ‘suburban’ colour schemes and replace them with blood-red walls, furniture made from repurposed fruit crates painted in Liquorice Allsorts colours and perhaps a dado-height glitter frieze of unicorns and dodos. ‘Fabulous!’ he would shriek, as innocent housewives sobbed in the wreckage of their living rooms. Meanwhile, the flamboyant designer would never miss an opportunity to lecture on his phobia about magnolia. He has always been very grand about not being bland. Appearing on the BBC’s Room 101 television show last year, LLB, now 50, launched into a passionate diatribe against the colour beige. ‘In all its gory, in all its understated, delusional blandure,’ he fumed. According to him, beige is ‘always wrong, never sexy’ and is ‘just colour with the volume turned down’. According to Laurence, beige is ‘always wrong, never sexy’ and is ‘just colour with the volume turned down’. But the interior designer has been forced to tone down the decor of his home, in a bid to appeal to buyers . The message was clearer than a coat of Dulux Gentle Fawn. Those of us who love to take refuge in neutrals are deficient in taste and style. We lack the courage and discrimination of design arbitrators like him. He is right and anyone who disagrees is wrong and pitiable. And, of course, it is not really about paint — an undercoat of snobbery pulses through everything people like Mr Llewelyn-Bowen advise and recommend. Yet I love neutrals! What could be nicer than a cool, quiet room in pale cream, a Swedish-style template of white and grey, a ‘greige’ — grey-beige — horizon on a rolling wallscape of Farrow & Ball’s eternally popular paint shade Elephant’s Breath? There are many times when I long for a world without colour, without someone like LLB pummelling the eyeballs with their bullying, hectoring, god-awful taste strictures. And don’t you think that after being creamed and buffed, his mansion looks a thousand times better — a place a person would actually want to live in without throwing themselves out of a bedroom window? Following on from his television work, Laurence now designs a range of furniture and soft furnishings for Littlewoods. His latest addition being a sconce, 'a typically Renaissance way of bringing in romantic light' So where does this leave our Laurence? Exposed as a taste fraud, with fifty shades of egg on face? How did he ever become an arbiter of national taste in the first place? Like many television experts, his credentials appear scant: a fine arts degree and a stint with an interior design company before forming his own company and launching himself on the world. Following on from his television work, he now designs a range of furniture and soft furnishings for Littlewoods. In an advert for them, he enthuses about the texture of one of his rugs, which ‘feels like standing on a sea of soft cherubs’. Squelch and ugh! Anything new? Yes. ‘For the first time ever in my collection, I have incorporated a sconce,’ he says, ‘a typically Renaissance way of bringing romantic light into an environment.’ In one episode of Changing Rooms, Daniel and Natascha from South London complained that Laurence’s scarlet walls (similar to his own bedroom, pictured) , zebra-patterned panels and leopard-print cushions turned their lounge into ‘a w****’s palace’. ‘It’s going to have to go. All of it. Every single bit,’ said Daniel. Or ‘lighting a candle’ as I call it. One wonders how he has the nerve. In 2010, Laurence became a ‘celebrity ambassador’ and designer for Dolphin Bathrooms. He advised its customers to paint their bathrooms black and ‘take a cold bottle of white wine’ with them when they had a bath in the evening. Dolphin went bust the following year. Of course, his greatest creation is himself. With his curls flapping and his certitude of opinion, Laurence was made to paddle in the shallows of light entertainment television. Particularly in the highly sensitive area of interior design, where a great number are unsure of their own instincts and desperate for the benediction of an expert. Laurence, with his definite views on colour (‘purple is sex personified’) and his flowing cravat, was the man for the job. Even if his reputation as a taste monger always seemed far from deserved. On Changing Rooms in 1998, poor Sue Dukes had to be comforted by her husband Russell after Laurence turned their dining room into something that looked like a snack bar in a crematorium. He opted for a ‘Queen Anne style’, featuring a mock fireplace and portraits of Sue and Russell as royal mistress Nell Gwyn and diarist Samuel Pepys. (Oddly enough, it all looked very similar to his own Cotswolds drawing room.) Sue thought that he was having a joke at their expense. ‘I thought she would really like it. I was very upset when she didn’t,’ he said at the time. The £1.6 million property owned by Laurence, just outside Cirencester, has been on the market for over a year . In another show, Daniel and Natascha from South London complained that Laurence’s scarlet walls, zebra-patterned panels and leopard-print cushions turned their lounge into ‘a whore’s palace’. ‘It’s going to have to go. All of it. Every single bit,’ said Daniel. And Jo Thompson from Kent fell out with LLB in 1999 when he turned her playroom into a ‘brown death trap’, complete with a piano painted in orange and brown stripes and a toy box ‘the size of a coffin’. Punches weren’t pulled when the cameras stopped rolling. ‘I kicked him out and called him a pretentious, frilly-sleeved prat with a paintbrush,’ said Jo at the time. It is rather thrilling to know that even with all the time and money at his disposal, Laurence still managed to make his own house look like a stage set for an am-dram remake of Phantom of The Opera. So let us don our dark glasses and take a retrospective tour around the home where Laurence, his wife Jackie and two teenage daughters have lived since 2007. One style writer called it ‘a witty homage to the Age of Enlightenment’, but the house-hunters who have trooped through its portals have been less than impressed. Perhaps it was the orange and pink Manuel Canovas toile wallpaper in the kitchen? Costing £63 a roll, it depicted courting couples at play. It came with a matching fabric, with which LLB had covered the seven lampshades in the kitchen. There was matching orange shelving, ornate mirrored sconces and a kitchen table covered with a red daisy Marimekko print. If he was aiming for the effect of being trapped inside an inflamed tonsil, he succeeded. Before Changing Rooms ended in 2004, Laurence, pictured here with co-star Handy Andy (real name Andy Kane), had built himself a reputation for making people cry upon seeing what he'd done to their front rooms . The bathroom was black, the bedroom had trees painted along the wall, the drawing room looked like a passageway in a country house hotel called Flouncy Towers. It was packed with heavy, shiny drapes, chocolate walls with a nude over the fireplace, burgundy leather chairs, knick-knacks on radiator shelves and elaborate branches of faux coral used as curtain tiebacks. It was exhausting to look at. In the new version, all the clutter and grandiose touches have been swept away. The fancy-shmancy has been ripped out, replaced with acres of cool beige and some John Lewis Berkley hotel lamps. It must have killed him to do it, but it is a vast improvement. After all this time, perhaps the frilly-sleeved, sconce-loving king of clutter should consider a career doing makeunders rather than makeovers. He might even sell his house at the same time.","Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen's home has been on the market for over a year .

"At least 52 dogs have died after being struck down by an horrific kidney disease, vets have warned. In the first recorded outbreak of Alabama rot to be reported in Britain, dogs have fallen ill and died up and down the country. Pet owners are warned to look out for lesions on their dogs' legs as vets continue to search for the cause of the disease. The disease was unknown in this country until November 2012, when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the New Forest, Hampshire . Outbreaks of Alabama rot, which attacks blood vessels in the skin and kidneys, have affected dogs in the US as long ago as the 1980s. But the disease was unknown in this country until November 2012, when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the New Forest, Hampshire. The results of an investigation into the outbreak, published last night in the journal Veterinary Record, reveal the full horror of the disease. Although the initial cases were reported in Hampshire, incidents have since been confirmed across England and Wales, from Somerset in the South West to County Durham in the North East. Unlike the US cases, which have only affected greyhounds, the British outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds. It has affected English springer spaniels, flat coated retrievers, whippets, Labradors - dogs of all shapes and sizes from a cocker spaniel to a Doberman. There have been 103 suspected incidents reported by vets, lead researcher David Walker told the Daily Mail last night, although only 52 of those have been confirmed by postmortem examinations. All those dogs died - either killed by the disease or put down by their vets. Unlike the US cases, which have only affected greyhounds, the British outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds, including this retriever Erin who died from the disease . Mr Walker, a vet who practises in Hampshire, said the team's investigation had not established why the disease had so suddenly sprung up, how it had arrived in Britain, or why certain dogs had been affected. But he warned pet owners to remain alert to symptoms. 'The main message is that we are still seeing cases spring up. Although the numbers are relatively small, continued vigilance is the best thing. People should look out for skin lesions when the dog hasn't obviously been cut on something.' He admitted much remains unknown about the problem. 'We don't know whether this is a condition that has been in the UK for a while, but just was unrecognised, or whether it had recently emerged,' he said. One of the many dogs struck down the disease was Tegan, a three-year-old fox terrier cross, who died in February 2014 after walking near Ashurst in the New Forest. The scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus, or whether the problem was genetic - this spaniel, Jess, died of the disease . Her owner Sarah Thairs, of North Baddesley, Hampshire, took her to the vet but her condition worsened and Tegan died soon afterwards. She said at the time: 'My poor little girl had been through so much. 'Tests showed the disease had gone to her pancreas. I had to make the decision to put her down, which is heartbreaking.' The investigation found no obvious link between any of the dogs - even those who became ill within a few days in the New Forest. Mr Walker said: 'When we looked at all their walking routes and other factors, we could find nothing in common.' The results rule out early theories that the dogs had been poisoned by contaminated food. They also ruled out a link to the E.coli shiga toxin, another early theory. The scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus, or whether the problem was genetic. They are comparing it to a similar human disease of the kidneys, called Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome, which is genetic but can be caused by exposure to certain medications, to see whether it can offer any clues.","At least 52 dogs have died after being struck down by Alabama rot .

"He once joked that his only phobias were magnolia paint and woodchip wallpaper. But it appears that famously flamboyant interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has had to swallow his pride after his garishly-decorated Cotswolds farmhouse failed to find a buyer in more than a year. While the hated woodchip is nowhere to be seen, the walls have now been painted a bland but inoffensive shade of what looks suspiciously like magnolia. Garish prints: Laurence and Jackie Llewelyn-Bowen at their former family home, which has been toned down in their attempts to find a buyer . Ornate: Dark colours and heavy furnishings gave the drawing room a baroque feel but it was not tempting anyone to make an offer . Modern: Now the Llewelyn-Bowens have stripped back the furniture and have given the room a lick of magnolia paint to open up space . The couple's Cotswolds farmhouse failed to find a buyer in more than a year, but the makeover may help sell the £1.6million home . Meanwhile the price of the father-of-two’s former family home near Cirencester, Gloucestershire has also been dropped by more than £150,000 to £1.59million. Llewelyn-Bowen, 50, rose to fame with the BBC1 home improvement show Changing Rooms in the late 1990s, in which his unmistakeable handiwork did not always meet with the client’s approval. Famously, he once decorated a room entirely in animal print to which the shocked homeowners responded by calling it ‘a tart’s boudoir’. His own six-bedroom house is an elegant, grade 2 listed 16th century farmhouse, but the interior – a riot of clashing prints and brightly-patterned wallpaper – is certainly not to everybody’s tastes, and has led to it being dubbed ‘Poshington Manor’.

The grade 2 listed 16th century farmhouse is on the market for a cool £1.6million and has been on the market for more than a year . Yesterday he admitted that after several prospective purchasers pulled out ‘at the 11th hour’ due to ‘the shifting sands of government policy’ he had opted to whitewash the interior – although he insisted it wasn’t because buyers did not share his trademark style. ‘Devoid of furniture, our house looked a tad tired and scruffy,’ he explained in the Sunday Times. ‘And we discovered incidents of “I hate Dad and Mum” graffiti and puppy chew-marks.’ He added: ‘My long-held faith in selling your home with LLB character and design personality intact remains unbroken.’ Llewelyn-Bowen, who is now working on a 10,000 sq ft barn conversion nearby along with his wife, Jackie, and daughters Cecile and Hermione, said his advice for fellow vendors was that first impressions mattered far more than individual taste. ‘If you want to attract the right sort of buyer, make sure the property looks as good as possible,’ he added. In a 2007 magazine profile, Llewelyn-Bowen said his twin phobias were ‘magnolia and woodchip wallpaper’. Explaining how he had received such bizarre briefs from clients that there was little which could now shock him, he added: ‘I think the most outlandish thing they’ve ever asked me to do is paint a room magnolia.’","Flamboyant interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen failed to find a buyer for his £1.6million home for a year .

"A man from the NSW Hunter region who killed a litter of puppies by smashing them over the head with a rock has been slapped with an extra nine animal cruelty charges. It comes amidst news that the sole pup to survive the attack, nicknamed 'Lucky', is 'stable'. Earlier this month an advertisement was posted on website Gumtree selling a litter of bull terrier puppies. When the 11 pups failed to sell in a week, the seller offered them for free, police said at the time. Scroll down for video . The only pup to have survived the attack on a litter of bull terriers near New Castle last month -nicknamed 'Lucky' is doing well in RSPCA care . Police allege Nathan Thompson, 25, collected the animals on March 11 and took them to bushland at Kurri Kurri, near Newcastle. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock before throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove away from the area. An RSPCA inspector was called to the bushland and found five dead pups and another two still clinging to life. Nathan Thompson (pictured) pleaded guilty to nine extra animal cruelty charges in court on Thursday . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' The only pup to survive the ordeal has since been named 'Lucky' and is being cared for by the RSPCA, who last week confirmed she was doing well. 'There are rumours flying around about Lucky, the sole survivor of the horrible animal cruelty case in Kurri Kurri last week, that she isn't doing well. We are happy to quell these rumours and let you know that she is still stable and under close veterinary surveillance,' the RSPCA wrote on their Facebook page. He allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Only one of the animals survived (pictured) 'Her condition has not deteriorated. If her condition does change, we will let the community know.' Thompson fronted court earlier this month and pleaded guilty to three animal cruelty charges and resisting arrest. On Thursday he pleaded guilty to another nine animal cruelty offences. He was granted bail on the condition he not have custody of any animals or even be around another animal without an adult present, for a decade. Thompson will be sentenced at Newcastle Local Court in May. Thompson was granted bail on the condition he not have custody of any animals. He will be sentenced at Newcastle Local Court in May . According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail following his first charges, saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. He added that he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated.

"Fiona Cullum is facing jail after she sheltered one of the killers of an innocent nursery teacher hours after she was gunned down as she celebrated her 24th birthday . A mother who sheltered one of the killers of an innocent nursery teacher hours after she was gunned down while celebrating  her 24th birthday is facing jail. Fiona Cullum, 25, provided cover for Hassan Hussain, 30, as he and fellow murderer Yassin James, 20, were hunted by police. She also lied when asked by police about Hussain after he was arrested on 2 October 2013 over the murder of Sabrina Moss on Kilburn High Road, northwest London. The men sprayed bullets at a bar while mother-of-one Miss Moss and her friends sheltered from the rain in their party dresses. Her friend Sabrina Gachette, 24, was lucky to survive after being blasted in the back with a sawn off shotgun during the attack outside Woody Grill, in South Kilburn. The Old Bailey heard the shooting was part of an ongoing rivalry between gangs in South Kilburn gang and Kensal Green. Hussain, James and their getaway driver Martell Warren, 23, were jailed for a total of 111 years at the Old Bailey last year. Cullum claimed she was so ‘out-of-it’ on drink and drugs she had no idea Hassan was sheltering in her small north London flat. ‘It is at least a possibility that in this sort of state that Hussain entered... and stayed there for however long, entirely without her knowledge, while she was sleeping off the effects of the night before,’ her barrister Rebecca Randall said. But an Old Bailey jury found her guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice for sheltering Hassan and providing a false statement to police. She was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice for sheltering James after the jury could not reach a verdict. She was standing trial alongside Reid Daniel, 24 and Matthew Bouzemada, 22, who were both convicted of assisting getaway driver Martell Warren, 23. Rakheed Daniel, 21, was found not guilty of the same offence. The men sprayed bullets at a bar while mother-of-one Sabrina Moss (left and right) and her friends sheltered from the rain in their party dresses . Her friend Sabrina Gachette, 24, was lucky to survive after being blasted in the back with a sawn off shotgun during the attack outside Woody Grill, in South Kilburn . Ms Gachette punched the air as the verdicts were read out while Bouzemada and Reid Daniel hugged Cullum as they were remanded in custody to be sentenced on 17 March. Judge Stephen Kramer QC told Cullum ‘be under no illusions, the likely sentence is one of custody’ as he bailed her to be sentenced on 10 April. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said: ‘This case is not concerned with who was involved in the plan to seriously harm members of the South Kilburn gang, or the shooting of Sabrina Moss and others when that plan was carried through. ‘This case, rather, is concerned with events after that dreadful incident because in the period immediately following the murder, each of these defendants took steps to assist those responsible for the shooting to evade apprehension and to deny the police evidence relating to Warren in the form of the mobile phones he had been using in the run up to and during the period of the murder, and relating to the car he had been driving.’ Fiona Cullum, 25, provided cover for Hassan Hussain (right), 30, as he and fellow murderer Yassin James (left), 20, were hunted by police . CCTV captured the moment two of the killers walked along the road towards the bar before the shooting unfolded . The grainy footage shows the men standing in the road (centre) and opening fire as people dive for cover . ‘In the case of Fiona Cullum, she provided such assistance to Hussain and James by sheltering them in the hours after the murder when the police investigation on and around Kilburn High Road was at its most intense, and then lied to the police about them when she was spoken to shortly after Hussain and James were arrested.’ She told police she did not remember speaking to Hussain and that he had not been at her address. Two of her co-defendants were found guilty of helping Warren, who fled the country shortly after the murder, to distance himself from two mobiles that tied him to the attack. Reid Daniel passed the phones on to Bouzemada before Warren was arrested on 27 August 2013 as he tried to re-enter the country, but the phones have never been found. She was standing trial alongside Reid Daniel (right), 24 and Matthew Bouzemada (left), 22, who were both convicted of assisting getaway driver Martell Warren, 23 . ‘He [Warren] resolved, as his actions later on 24 August demonstrate, to flee before he was caught and he needed to distance himself from those items, his phone and car, so that he could do so,’ said Mr Atkinson. ‘Equally Hussain and James had used two firearms with an intention to kill.. ‘Although hooded when they approached the group, of which Sabrina Moss and Sabrina Gachette were a part, there was clearly a risk that they might have been recognised or that they might be connected to the Vauxhall Corsa. ‘It would clearly have been prudent for them to know whether they were now police targets before returning to their normal address.’ Cullum, of St Johns Wood, north London, denied harbouring Hussain and James and making a false statement to police. She denied three charges of perverting the course of justice. Bouzemada, of  Harlesden, Reid Daniel, of Hayes, and Rakheed Daniel, of Willesden, denied perverting the course of justice by concealing or destroying Warren’s phones. Warren, of Kensal Green, northwest London, Hussain, of Willesden Green, northwest London, and James, of Wembley, northwest London, were previously convicted of murder and attempted murder.","Fiona Cullum provided cover for Hassan Hussain and Yassin James .

"Rosamund Pike should be the next James Bond, Ed Miliband said today . Ed Miliband has called for the next James Bond to be a woman – and tipped Rosamund Pike to take on the role. The Labour leader said the classic British films should 'move with the times' and said the former Bond girl would be a good replacement for Daniel Craig. He said Ms Pike was a 'great British actress' and could take on the iconic role even the character she played in the 2002 film Die Another Day died. Mr Miliband said: 'I think she's a great British actress, she'd make a great Bond. This is 2015, I think we can move with the times.' Speaking to the Evening Standard, Mr Miliband also spoke about his taste in music during the interview – revealing that he was 'a bit of an 80s fan' adding: 'I like bad taste - things like A-ha Take On Me.' Mr Miliband added: 'I'm aware of both Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith. I've heard them on radio and both of them are huge exports - they're great artists. 'It's brilliant we have a great number of great British artists, it makes us incredibly proud.' He said singer Ellie Goulding invited him to a charity concert recently where the band Bastille caught his eye. Mr Miliband is facing an uphill battle to become Prime Minister – with polls showing David Cameron marginally ahead with just five weeks of campaigning left before voters cast their ballots. But the Labour leader could be swept into Downing Street with the backing of the Scottish and Welsh nationalists who have both vowed to block Mr Cameron staying on as PM. Mr Miliband today admitted he would not win a 'photo opportunity contest', but said the election should not be about that. He said: 'Politicians can get obsessed with themselves - it becomes a personality contest. 'It's not about us, but the British people. If this is a contest to see how someone can eat a bacon sandwich elegantly, I'm not going to win. 'It's about putting working people first in this country - I'm not going to win a photo opportunity contest.' The Labour leader, pictured on the campaign trail in Manchester today, said James Bond should 'move with the times' and said Ms Pike would be a good replacement for Daniel Craig . On attacks from Mr Cameron, he said: 'I don't see it that way. It's the rough and tumble of politics. 'My opponents are going to be really personal in the next five weeks. I'm much more worried about another five years of David Cameron. I don't care what people throw at me. 'You get a lot thrown at you, it comes with the territory. The question isn't what's thrown at you - it's your resilience. I'm in this because I want to change the country - if you're in the public eye, then you have to take the brickbats.'","Labour leader said the classic British films should 'move with the times'

"An Indian man who made headlines around the world after he opened a plane’s emergency exit and jumped 15ft to the ground says he was trying to pull off a stunt like his Bollywood idol. The passenger, Akash Jain, told a Mumbai news agency that he was influenced by his adoration for Akshay Kumar, one of the most famous Indian actors of all time, and dismissed claims that he made the dangerous leap because he was impatient. The 30-year-old told Mid Day: ‘I wanted to perform a stunt like Akshay Kumar because I am his fan, and hence I jumped off the aircraft.’ Scroll down for video . Passenger Akash Jain said he jumped off the plane to perform a stunt like actor Akshay Kumar . Friday’s incident sparked a security scare at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and raised serious questions about how Mr Jain was able to elude police and airport security officers. Mr Jain opened the emergency exit moments after the Boeing 737, carrying 144 passengers and five crew, pulled up to a gate after arriving from Chandigarh. After leaping off the plane in front of stunned passengers on flight 9W469, he entered the arrivals terminal after asking a ground crew member for directions and left the airport without being apprehended. The passenger who leaped from the plane said he was imitating his idol, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar (left) Having missed his connecting flight, Mr Jain travelled by bus and taxi towards his destination in Goa, but returned to Mumbai after he spoke to his mother by telephone and learned that his father was not feeling well, Mid Day reported. Mr Jain, who works as a medical representative, planned to travel home to Jalandhar, but was arrested by police in Mumbai on Saturday night after a CCTV image from the airport was circulated by local media and someone reported his whereabouts, the news website reported. The amateur stuntman is being held in custody for a week, but he may spend more time in custody if he is not granted bail. Akash Jain entered the arrivals terminal after he asked a ground crew member for directions to an exit . An airport police officer told Mid Day: ‘He told us that he had seen Akshay Kumar performing stunts in the movies and wanted to perform one himself. ‘He added that the fact that passengers are repeatedly told to open the emergency doors only in case of an emergency made him want to open it more.’ The incident sparked a furious response from airport bosses, who accused Jet Airways of failing to immediately alert the proper authorities. An airport spokesperson said: ‘If the incident took place after the aircraft landed, why didn’t the airline security staff inform the security agencies immediately? ‘Why did they need 35 minutes to do so?’ A Jet Airways spokesperson denied the claim, telling MailOnline Travel that security agencies were notified immediately. The airline spokesperson added: ‘A guest travelling on Jet Airways flight 9W469 from Chandigarh to Mumbai opened the emergency door and disembarked, alighting onto the aircraft’s wings after the aircraft had come to a standstill at the parking bay at Mumbai airport.’","Passenger Akash Jain told Indian media that he is a big fan of the actor .

"Thousands of infertile couples could realise their dreams of becoming parents thanks to a new test that allows IVF treatment to be tailored to a woman's individual fertility cycle. For the first time, scientists believe they are able to identify the point in a woman's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant in the womb. Repeated rounds of fertility treatment can prove emotionally and financially draining for couples desperate to become parents. There are more than 60,000 IVF cycles performed in the UK each year. Yet, just 24 per cent lead to live births. Meanwhile in the US, 175,000 IVF cycles were performed in 2013, according to the CDC. There, success rates ranged from 16 to 47 per cent, depending on a woman's age. Experts at the IVI fertility clinic in Madrid believe a new test, which identifies the point in a woman's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant, will help thousands of infertile couples realise their dream of becoming parents . While the NHS offers the treatment, strict guidelines mean many couples are forced to use private clinics, incurring bills that runs into thousands of pounds. The current treatment involves doctors performing an ultrasound to check the appearance of the lining of the womb, to assess its general health. It is known that for most women, there is a two to four day time period when the lining gives out the key chemical signals that allow the embryo to attach, leading to a pregnancy. But a team of scientists, led by Professor Juan Garcia Velasco at the IVI fertility clinic in Madrid, said they believe failed attempts often happen because an embryo is implanted at the wrong time, missing a woman's crucial window of fertility. They hope their new study will improve success rates for couples undergoing IVF, after they identified a test which can predict each woman's individual fertility window. Professor Garcia-Velasco, told MailOnline: 'The trial we are currently undertaking is trying to answer if the ERA test may help all couples from the first day they attend a fertility clinic, to detect endometrial defects. 'Or, if it will benefit only those with repeated implantation failure as the test does now. 'My hope is that this test will explain why some women do not get pregnant when good quality embryos are transferred, and thus, avoid repeated IVF failure. 'If we are able to select a good embryo and place in the uterus at the right time, success rates should be significantly higher. 'These tests are helping us doctors understand why IVF can be unsuccessful and ultimately reduce patients' frustration of unanswered questions.' He estimates around 15 per cent of cases of implantation failure 'are simply due to bad timing'. He added: 'I think it will make a significant difference in the expectations of couples and how we can explain failures. 'Until now, the endometrium was kind of a black box. Now we can say this was the problem and this is what we can do about it.' The test involves taking a biopsy of a woman's womb lining. Experts then analyse 238 genes, allowing them to determine when the woman's endometrium - the womb lining - will be most receptive to an implanted embryo. The test involves taking a biopsy of the womb lining, pictured under a microscope. Scientists are then able to analyse 238 genes to identify when the lining is at its most receptive and able to accept the embryo. A pilot study of 17 women, who had endured failed IVF attempts, saw nine become pregnant after the test . A case report detailing one woman's experience, followed by a pilot study involving 17 women, showed success rates were significantly improved after using the test. In the pilot study, none of the 17 women had become pregnant despite repeated (between one and six) rounds of IVF, when traditional techniques were used. But after the test was used to determine each woman's window of implantation, nine of the 17 became pregnant and went on to have a baby. It has previously been assumed that the window of implantation was 'constant in all women,' the researchers note. During IVF, an egg is surgically removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg, or embryo, is then returned and implanted back into the woman's womb to grow and develop. Embryo transfer is the final part of the treatment process, and as a result women will still have to go through a rigorous treatment programme to reach the point where they may benefit from the new test being trialled by Professor Juan Garcia Velasco. Step one . A woman is given a drug to suppress her natural menstrual cycle, often in the form of a daily injection or nasal spray, for around two weeks. Step two . A fertility hormone is given, again in the form of a daily injection for between 10 and 12 days. It increases the number of eggs a woman produces, to allow experts to collect and fertilise more eggs, to try and improve the success rate. Step three . Doctors then monitor the woman and around 34 to 38 hours before her eggs are due to be collected she will be given a final hormone injection that helps your eggs to mature. Step four . For the egg collection a woman is sedated and her eggs are collected using ultrasound as a guide. A needle is inserted through the vagina and into each ovary. The eggs are then collected through the needle. Step five . The collected eggs are mixed with the woman's partner's sperm and after 16 to 20 hours they are checked to see if any have been fertilised. If the sperm are few or weak, each egg may need to be injected with individual sperm. The fertilised eggs, embryos then continue to grow in the laboratory for one to five days before they are transferred back into the womb. Once the woman's eggs have been collected she is given medication, including progesterone, to help prepare the lining of the womb to receive an embryo. Step six . The embryos are transferred back into the woman's womb. It is at this point that the test being trialled by Professor Garcia Velasco could be used to determine a woman's opportune fertility window. But their study has instead found that each woman has her own, individual window of implantation, when she can expect the best results from IVF. 'Understanding the ""molecular clock"" at play, regardless of the presence or absence of an embryo during the window of implantation could help to identify biomarkers of endometrial receptivity useful to create an objective personalised diagnostic test for this function,' the researchers said. Their case report details how a 39-year-old woman attended the clinic, reporting she had endured two failed attempts at IVF. Each round of IVF involved the transfer of two good quality embryos that failed to implant and a routine infertility assessment was normal. After counselling, the couple decided to pursue further rounds of IVF. But two subsequent rounds proved unsuccessful. The next step saw experts giving the woman hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as well as progesterone replacement. Three days after ovulation, triggered by the hormone therapy, another attempt failed. Another attempt five days after hormone therapy also proved unsuccessful. Despite the repeated failure, the couple remained determined to become pregnant. The researchers then attempted to diagnose the woman's window of implantation, using the endometrial receptivity array test (ERA). The test is based on the expression of 238 genes that are related to how receptive the womb lining is, established after a biopsy. 'The test identifies ""personalised"" window of implantation in women with recurrent implantation failure,' the report said. The team took a biopsy of the woman's womb lining five days after hormone therapy - the point at which the previous attempt had failed. It revealed her 'endometrium was pre-receptive', leading them to conclude they had been implanting the embryo too early. The report notes: 'A two-day displacement of her window of implantation was diagnosed, and this determined the need to repeat the ERA test in a further HRT cycle after seven days of progesterone replacement.' As a result, two embyros were implanted at the key seven-day point, after progesterone replacement, and the woman became pregnant with twins. The pregnancy was uneventful and twins boys were delivered by Caesarean section at 36 weeks. A pilot study followed with 17 patients taking part. Each had suffered between one and six implantation failures. The researchers diagnosed each woman's window of implantation and instead of routine embryo transfer, each woman underwent implantation according to her cycle. Of the women taking part nine became pregnant and gave birth. For one of the 17 women, six rounds of IVF had previously failed. Yet after performing the test, the researchers discovered all previous implantation attempts had been two days premature. After two further rounds of IVF, based on her individual cycle, the woman became pregnant and gave birth to her baby. Professor Garcia-Velasco is now leading a clinical trial of the test, with around 2,500 women who have suffered two or more failed attempts, in more than 10 countries taking part.","Experts at the IVI fertility clinic believe a new test could transform IVF .

"Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez's DNA matched genetic material found on a cigarette butt at the scene of a murder, a crime lab scientist testified on Friday. Hernandez is on trial for murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd's body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's home, and prosecutors have said previously a marijuana cigarette was found near his bullet-riddled body. Former Pats player Aaron Hernandez sits in court during his murder trial on Thursday in Fall River, Massachusetts. A crime lab scientist testified today that his DNA matched DNA found on a cigarette butt at the crime scene . Diane Fife Biagiotti of the state police crime lab told jurors that she received rolling paper from a 2-inch-long cigarette butt to test for DNA. She said she found it had the DNA of at least two people on it. She said she first compared it with Lloyd's DNA and discovered he could have been one of the people whose DNA appeared on the butt. She said she then was able to use Lloyd's DNA to deduce the second DNA contributor. 'I did a comparison between the profile I deduced and the profile of Aaron Hernandez,' she said. 'I found that the profile from Aaron Hernandez matched the deduced DNA profile.' She then ran a statistical analysis and determined the likelihood it was someone else is one in more than a quadrillion. 'How many zeros does a quadrillion have?' prosecutor William McCauley asked her? 'One with 15 zeros after it,' she replied. He then asked her the world's population: 7 billion - and pointed out a quadrillion is one million times a quadrillion. But Hernandez lawyer James Sultan went after other DNA evidence in the case, including some collected from a spent shell casing found inside a car Hernandez rented. All smiles: Shayanna Jenkins, fiancee of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, leaves the courthouse during his murder trial on Friday . Police found the casing in a trash bin at an Enterprise rental car, stuck to some blue bubble gum. An Enterprise employee said she found both items under the driver's seat of the car and threw them away. Biagiotti testified she found Hernandez DNA on the shell casing, but she also acknowledged she did not know the gum had been stuck to the shell before she did her test. 'Would you agree with me, Ms. Biagiotti, that there is a high likelihood that the DNA contained in the saliva on a chewed blue chewing gum would be transferred to that shell casing?' Sultan asked. 'Yes, I would agree with that,' she said. She also acknowledged that it is uncommon to find a testable amount of DNA on a spent cartridge casing and that the lab had never tested the chewing gum for DNA. Sultan also asked her if she had received a DNA profile for Hernandez co-defendant Ernest Wallace to compare it with evidence in the case. She said she had not. Terri Hernandez, mother of the defendant, listens during his murder trial on Friday. Also listen, at left, is Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee . Wallace and another man, Carlos Ortiz, have also been charged in the killing. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. The court heard on Thursday that a tread mark found near the body of a man allegedly killed by Aaron Hernandez was made by a tire from a car rented by the ex-NFL star. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Todd Girouard, who specializes in tire track analysis, said the rear passenger side tire of a Nissan Altima that prosecutors say was rented by Hernandez matched a track found at a North Attleboro industrial park where the body of Odin Lloyd was found in June 2013. Ursula Ward, mother of victim Odin Lloyd, listens during the trial . Girouard, the state police trooper, said four small stones lodged in the tire of the Altima corresponded to tracks from the industrial park, based on his analysis, which included comparing photographs and test prints of the tire. He said the believed the tire on the Altima 'made the impression.' Lloyd's sister testified earlier she saw her brother getting into a silver Nissan outside their home in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood hours before he was killed. Prosecutors have shown surveillance video of Hernandez and Ortiz getting out of a silver Altima at a gas station in Canton, Massachusetts, hours before the murder. Also on Thursday, Patrick Quinn, a T-Mobile engineer, identified the locations of cell towers that connected with Lloyd's phone, beginning in Boston and moving to the coverage area of the North Attleborough industrial area, in the early morning hours of June 17, 2013. Earlier, Carol Martin Bailey, a resident of a condominium complex where Hernandez rented a unit in Franklin, Massachusetts, said she met a man she identified as George who appeared to be Ernest Wallace. The man told her he was moving into the next door unit with his cousin, she said, describing him as 'extremely nice'.

"More than 100 NHS hospitals in Britain contain fast food outlets, shocking new figures have revealed. Critics argue the presence of Burger King, Costa Coffee and Greggs around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis. There are 128 outlets in British hospitals selling junk food, plus a further 32 branches of WHSmith, which sells confectionery - often at a discounted price. Scroll down for video . More than 100 NHS hospitals in Britain contain fast food outlets, worrying new figures have revealed. Addenbrooke's in Cambridge operates a food court with a Burger King (pictured) There are also dozens of coffee shops - with 27 Starbucks and 92 Costas (such as this one at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford) - selling calorie-laden treats . The fast food branches include two Burger Kings, six Subways and one Greggs, an investigation by The Sun revealed. There are also dozens of coffee shops selling calorie-laden food and drink - with 27 Starbucks and 92 Costas. This is in addition to all the smaller, independent retailers in hospitals selling junk food. The news comes as figures from Public Health England show that in Britain, 64 per cent of adults are either overweight or obese. And experts estimate treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the NHS around £6 billion every year - or five per cent of the entire NHS budget. It spends a further £10billion on diabetes. To make matters worse, some of the UK's major hospitals have more than one outlet selling junk food. Addenbrooke's in Cambridge operates a food court with a Burger King, Costa Coffee, Starbucks and pizzeria, while and University Hospital Southampton Foundation trust also hosts a Burger King and a Costa Coffee shop. Earlier this month, it emerged the Greggs bakery at the New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, is the fast-food chain's second busiest outlet in Britain . Earlier this month it was reported that the Greggs bakery based in an NHS hospital is the fast-food chain's second busiest outlet in Britain. The counter at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton is often so busy selling steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas that ropes have to be used to separate queues of hungry customers which can reach 20 people deep. The Sun investigation found customers could buy four sausage rolls for £2.40, each which contained 25g fat. The total recommended daily amount of fat is 75g for women and 90g for men. Those with a sweet tooth could buy three sugar and fat laiden doughnuts for £1. However a spokesman denied the hospital branch was the chain's second biggest outlet. She said: 'There has been a Greggs shop at New Cross Hospital for over 10 years. 'While popular with customers and providing a wide variety of products, this shop is not Greggs’ second busiest shop.' Critics argue the presence of Burger King (pictured in Addenbrooke's hospital), Costa Coffee and Greggs around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis . But David Loughton, chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals, said he had heard on good authority that the bakery at the hospital was the chain's second busiest. He said: 'There is a cafe in site that sells all healthy food but it gets nowhere near the footfall that Greggs gets. 'You can understand the appeal. It is relatively cheap.' Earlier this week, MPs called for a ban on fast-food outlets such as McDonald’s and Burger King from hospitals. The move is part of several measures to tackle the growing number of Britons who are becoming dangerously overweight. As fast-food concessions come up for renewal, hospitals should demand healthier, tastier, affordable alternatives, experts say . The report on the impact of physical activity and diet on health endorses the views of Professor Theresa Marteau, an expert in public health at Cambridge University. She states that hospitals are being negligent by allowing such firms to operate in places that promote good health. In her evidence to MPs, she said: 'It is at best anomalous- and at worst negligent - that NHS properties continue to serve foods high in sugar, fat and salt, as exemplified by McDonald’s and Burger King outlets in some of our most prestigious hospitals, including Guy’s hospital in London and Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridge.' Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, backed the MPs’ call and criticised hospitals for permitting the sale of fast food. He said: 'The NHS is being pennywise but pound-foolish selling junk food that ultimately just lands more people in hospital with expensive, preventable, obesity-driven illnesses. 'So as these fast-food concessions come up for renewal, hospitals should demand healthier, tastier, affordable alternatives.' The chain sells a range of sandwiches, pies and pasties - such as the cheese and bacon wrap, a chicken fajita slice, and beef and vegetable pasties - ranging from 300 calories to almost 600. The hospital trust has joined forces with Wolverhampton Council to tackle the obesity crisis locally. But Mr Loughton said banning the chain from the site would not solve anything. He said: 'People say ""ban the fast-food places"" but I don't think that will ever work. We have to change people's mentality regarding the food they eat.' In Devon, hospital chiefs have told staff not to allow deliveries from a new Pizza Hut - despite it being built in their own multi-storey car park. The move was revealed a month after the chain opened just 100 yards from the walls of Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. Staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant, with bosses steering them towards 'healthier' sandwiches in the hospital's smoothie bar instead. And a hospital in Surrey has came under fire when it emerged it had paid £24,000 to close a Burger King branch inside its own walls. Croydon University Hospital had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years, sparking the ire of health campaigners. It finally managed to close the outlet - which was next to posters promoting healthy eating - in 2011 and replace it with a Costa Coffee branch. But in order to terminate the contract it had to pay £24,000 to Compass UK, the company operating the fast food franchise. Croydon Health Service admitted the 'world had changed' since it signed the original deal in 1997. The news comes after the NHS announced last week that 700,000 overweight staff will be told to take part in free slimming classes to shed the pounds, in order to set a better example to their patients. The drastic scheme could help nearly half of NHS England's 1.3 million workforce, who currently struggle with their weight. In a drive to 'practice what we preach', the NHS will sign employees up to one of three slimming classes, depending on the amount of weight they have to lose. Staff will be put on personal eating plans and be offered cognitive behavioural therapy to help reassess their relationship with food. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, who announced today's initiative, said: 'Today the NHS is starting to practice what we preach - helping our own staff get healthier and prevent illness. Dr Sally Norton, an NHS consultant specialising in weight loss  surgery, says the NHS is contributing to the obesity crisis . Coffee shops offering sugar-laden drinks and cakes to hospital patients, visitors and NHS staff should be banned, a leading weight loss surgeon has said. Dr Sally Norton, an NHS consultant specialising in weight loss and upper gastrointestinal surgery, said she no longer shakes the hands of her patients - more often than not because they arrive clutching a Costa take-out. In the place of these popular coffee shops and fast food outlets, Dr Norton - who works at Bristol Royal Infirmary and Southmead Hospital - has called for restaurants and cafes championing local food producers and offering healthy and tasty snacks. 'We read every week, in The BMJ and other leading medical journals, of research detailing the perils of sugar and fizzy drinks,' said Dr Norton. 'We frequently hear laments about the cost to the NHS of the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which is threatening to engulf us. 'And yet, the NHS, which I understood to be an organisation that promotes and supports health (rather than just treating disease), is actually contributing to the problem. 'As a weight loss surgeon, I find it frustrating and, frankly, embarrassing to spend time in clinic, explaining to my patients how sugary drinks and snacks are one of the biggest drivers of obesity, when I know that just outside in our hospital foyer are not one, but two Costa coffee shops, as well as vending machines stocked full of coke and chocolate. 'When I try to grab a quick coffee from Costa, an obedient employee always tries to tempt me into buying one of their huge, sugar-laden and calorific cakes to go with it... hard to resist after a stressful morning in theatre or a busy night on-call. 'If I did need a snack, I would be hard pushed to find much that you could describe as healthy —there is very little fresh, nutrient-rich food and next to nothing that doesn't involve a load of refined carbs.","More than 100 NHS hospitals in Britain contain national fast food outlets .

"Singer Cher has petitioned a court to allow a 96-year-old woman to return to her home in northern Virginia. Edith Hill was taken away from her new 95-year-old husband last year after a court accepted she did not have the mental capacity to enter into a marriage. However, the 68-year-old singer was so moved by the story of Mrs Hill and Eddie Harrison that she has pledged to help Mrs Hill return home. Cher was moved to act after she saw a documentary on Edith Hill and her husband Eddie Harrison . A court ruled that Edith Hill, left should be removed from her home and transferred to Florida. Her husband Eddie Harrison remained at home in Virginia but later died a couple of weeks after they were split apart . Unfortunately Mr Harrison died several weeks after his wife was taken away. However, Cher was inspired by the story and decided to act on behalf of Mrs Hill and see whether it was feasible to return her to her long-term home. A judge in McClean, Virginia has ruled that Mrs Hill should be returned home following Cher's commitment. Mr Harrison died in December, just weeks after Hill was taken away to Florida on the recommendation of a court-appointed guardian, but a custody dispute continued over who should care for Hill and where she should live. Cher said she will help pay for needed upgrades to Hill's family home in Alexandria. In a telephone interview, Cher expressed frustration that Eddie and Edith had been split up against their wishes. She said: 'This whole thing is a travesty, what happens to old people. Once they do the repairs and she comes back home, it's going to be bittersweet because she only wanted to be with him.' Earlier this month, after Cher offered to pay for the home improvements, a judge ordered that Hill should return to Alexandria once repairs are complete. Mrs Hill's daughter Rebecca Wright said: 'Mom's coming home!' Mrs Hill was in favour of her mother's marriage to Mr Harrison. Mr Harrison and Mrs Hill had been companions for more than a decade before they got married. In December, the court ruled that Mrs Hill should be moved to Florida and later that same month, Mr Harrison died. Mrs Wright said: 'He actually gave his life to this effort.' She said Mr Harrison became depressed after Mrs Hill was taken away as he thought it was unlikely that they would ever see each other again. Cher became aware of the case when a TV news broadcast showed the couple dancing. The singer said she would pay for any repairs inside the Alexandria home and ensure it was suitable for a 96-year-old woman. She also pledged to help with her ongoing medical bills. Cher saw a documentary about the couple when Mrs Hill was taken to Florida. She said she was impressed by how in love the pair seemed to be and was outraged over their treatment. She added: 'I think this is an important story. It's not right what is going on.'","Singer Cher, 68, has vowed to help a 96-year-old woman move back home .

"A JetBlue Airways pilot who had to be restrained during a 2012 flight after shouting about Jesus and al-Qaeda  sued for more than $16 million Friday, claiming the airline failed to recognize and address his mental condition. The suit filed by former captain Clayton Osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from New York to Las Vegas, comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a Germanwings . Osbon, 52, claims in the lawsuit that officials at JetBlue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight, noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented. Scroll down for video . Restrained: Clayton Osbon, 52, pictured here being taken off a New York to Las Vegas flight after his breakdown, is suing JetBlue for failing to recognize he was mentally ill . Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.' The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.' There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit. The lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members' impairment, whether by alcohol, drugs or mental and emotional distress, in order to protect their careers. Hospitalized: Osbon, right, is led out by FBI agents after being released from Northwest Texas hospital in Amarillo following his mid-air breakdown . Veteran captain: Osbon, left, was an experienced pilot but a 'complex partial brain seizure' impaired his brain functions and caused him to hallucinate, according to the lawsuit . Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity. Among other conditions of his sentence, Osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer. Osbon remains suspended on medical leave, no longer collecting what once was a more than $300,000 annual salary. The lawsuit states he has not suffered a seizure since beginning a regimen of prescription medication.","Clayton Osbon, 52, claims in a lawsuit the airline failed to recognize signs he was in mental distress before a flight in which he broke down shouting .

"Alfio Anthony Granata, 45, pleaded guilty on Monday to raping, assaulting and threatening a Dutch backpacker during a six-week ordeal . A Dutch backpacker was violently raped, beaten with a meat tenderiser and repeatedly bashed during a six week ordeal which ended with her attempting to take her own life. The woman was held captive in a Melbourne hotel room during 2012, during which time she was forced to sleep in the shower naked and ordered not to speak, or complain. Alfio Anthony Granata, 45, pleaded guilty in the County Court of Victoria on Monday to raping, assaulting and threatening the backpacker on multiple occasions in a Preston’s Rydges Bell City hotel room where he and his partner Jennifer Mary Peaston lived, and his victim was held. Police attended the hotel room twice during the extended ordeal, but failed to rescue the fearful victim, the Herald Sun reported. The court heard the backpacker met Granata and his partner at a mutual friend's birthday party in St Kilda in November 2012. The three soon became friends and began a consensual sexual relationship. After using copious amounts of the drug ice, Granata became violent - and paranoid that his girlfriend and the victim were conspiring to run away together. The court was also told backpacker was held captive and suffered daily beatings and numerous violent rapes over six weeks. The saga ended on Christmas Day, 2012, when the woman fought back, stabbing Granata in the shoulder and threatening self harm. Scroll down for video . The Victorian Country Court heard the backpacker met Granata and his partner at a mutual friend's birthday party in St Kilda in November 2012 . Police were called and the extent of her abuse was uncovered. The first time police attended the hotel before the backpacker was rescued, the victim told police there had been an altercation but that she was okay. The second time officers visited Granata's hotel room during the hostage period they did not enter the room, instead speaking to the man and his de facto partner Peaston in the hallway. Dressed in prison greens on Monday, Granata sat calmly in the dock, as a video played of his victim detailing how her kidnap and ongoing torture had affected her life. 'I still suffer panic attacks, I'm still afraid of people, I feel like I'm in a black hole,' she said. The Dutch woman was held in a Preston’s Rydges Bell City hotel room which police visited twice during the time she was held hostage . 'I am disgusted by the things you did to me, I think you are a sick person.' The court also heard Granata told his victim he had killed 248 people, and threatened to take the lives of her parents, who live in Holland. The Dutch woman was also reportedly punched in the face, burnt with a gas torch lighter and banished to the bathroom. She was forced to sleep in the shower or on the wet floor naked, sometimes left there for days on end. The hearing continues.

"A senior surgeon who sparked controversy after telling aspiring female doctors to go along with sexual abuse at work for the sake of their careers, has said she stands by her advice. In an ABC radio interview on Friday, Dr Gabrielle McMullin, a top vascular surgeon in Sydney, said sexism is so rife among male surgeons in Australian hospitals that young women would do best to grin and bear it. Her comments follow a warning she issued to young women at Sydney's Parliament House on Friday, during the launch of a book she co-authored on gender equality. 'What I tell my trainees is that, if you are approached for sex, probably the safest thing to do in terms of your career is to comply with the request,' she said. Sydney vascular surgeon Dr Gabrielle McMullin says sexism is so rife among surgeons in Australia that young woman who want a career in medicine would do best to 'comply' At the  launch of  'Pathways to Gender Equality in Australia' on Friday, Dr McMullin advised female trainees to avoid putting themselves in vulnerable situations. But giving in to unwanted sexual advances is easier than pursuing perpetrators, she warned, because the sexism is so entrenched. Dr McMullin told ABC's AM program the story of Dr Caroline Tan, a young doctor who won a sexual harassment case in 2008 against a surgeon who forced himself on her while she was training at a Melbourne Hospital. Dr Tan didn't tell anyone what had happened until the surgeon started giving her reports that were so bad they threatened the career she had worked so hard for. But McMullin warns complaining to the supervising body is the 'worst thing' trainees could do. 'Despite that victory, she has never been appointed to a public position in a hospital in Australasia,' she said of the case. 'Her career was ruined by this one guy asking for sex on this night.' 'And realistically, she would have been much better to have given him a blow-job on that night.' 'Her career was ruined by this one guy asking for sex on this night'. Dr McMullin, who contributed a chapter titled 'Women in Medicine: Sisters doing it for themselves' to a new book on gender equality, has stood by her comments warning aspiring female medics to comply if approached for sex in the workplace . Dr McMullin's comments have been roundly criticised by others in the medical profession, women's rights and sexual abuse support groups as 'appalling.' The president of the Australian Medical Association of Victoria,  Dr Tony Bartone, 'strongly disagrees' with Dr McMullin's advice. 'This old view of acceptance needs to be eradicated,' he told Fairfax media. 'Sexual assault is a crime and will not be tolerated by our society. The medical profession is not exempt from this maxim.' Despite the attacks, Dr McMullin stood by her comments on Saturday, saying her advice was practical and true, and it was offered because she is 'so frustrated with what is going on.' The public response on social media has been mixed, with many in the community expressing dismay at the remarks. 'We live in a world where we want our girls to have an education so they can have a career and they can look after themselves independently. I sure am saddened by these comments,' wrote one facebook user. Many social media users are angry at Dr McMullin's comments and have taken to Facebook to express their disgust . But responses from the community have been mixed . But many others have applauded Dr McMullin for drawing attention to the pervasive nature of sexual harassment at work. 'I think the problem is that she's probably right. This behaviour is not limited to surgeons, it pervades so many professional fields,' writes one Facebook user. 'Don't shoot the messenger, fix the situation!' said another. 'If anyone would know how things work in that system, it would be someone in her position.' Many Facebook  users have also come out in support of Dr McMullin for exposing the sexism . Dr McCullin has told Fairfax she's received many phone calls since Friday from women to say 'thank you.' 'It's been hidden and suppressed for so long and it's only when it comes out in the open that you can do something about it. So, I guess this is my attempt to air it,' she said.","Dr Gabrielle McMullin has been criticised for telling aspiring female surgeons they should put up with unwanted sexual advances at work .

"The days of gooey toothpaste tubes, bottles of stubborn ketchup and sticky glue pots are numbered. After unveiling its super slippery LiquiGlide coating last year, a team of Massachusetts-based scientists has signed its first deal to bring the technology to supermarket shelves. Elmers Brand Glue an Adhesives is the first firm to publicly announce a deal, and there are rumours a mayonnaise brand, and toothpaste company are also on board. Scroll down for video . After unveiling its slippery Liquiglide coating in a ketchup bottle last year (pictured), its inventors have signed a deal to bring the technology to supermarket shelves. Elmers Brand Glue an Adhesives is the first firm to sign up, and reports claim a mayonnaise brand, and toothpaste firm, are also on board . LiquiGlide was invented at MIT and its designers call it 'the first and only permanently wet, slippery surface technology'. It is based on previous super-hydrophobic technology, but takes this a step further. A conventional super-hydrophobic surface is similar to a lotus leaf - it is a highly textured surface that creates a cushion of air for the product to sit on. But LiquiGlide replaces this 'cushion of air' with a layer of liquid. This so-called 'liquid-impregnated surface' is a multi-layer surface consisting of a customised solid texture and a liquid. The solid surface is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid, and the liquid is held in place to create the permanently slippery surface. As a result, the ketchup, detergent or other product slides on the liquid layer, in a so-called 'liquid-to-liquid interface'.

The surface (illustrated) is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid and keep it in place . The solid surface is made up of spaces that are sufficiently close to each other to contain the impregnating liquid and the liquid is held in place within the texture, creating a permanently slippery surface. As a result, the ketchup, detergent or other product slides on the liquid layer, in a so-called 'liquid-to-liquid interface'. And by changing the material used, and the structure of the coating, the researchers can also control the the speed at which liquids slide over the surface. The coating can also be made up of different materials, depending on the application. For example, when fitted inside ketchup bottles the liquid is plant-based, while other non-food stuffs can use non-edible chemicals. The firm said: 'First, we identify liquids that are compatible with the chemical and physical properties of our client’s product. 'Once we have found a suitable liquid, we select solid materials that are promising to adhere to the client’s surface and that will form a suitable porous structure. 'The porous solid entraps the liquid through capillary forces. 'These forces are sufficient to hold the liquid in place against forces greater than 50g. 'Once we have a prototype in place we create a scalable and commercially viable application process. 'The end result: A durable and high performing coating that meets all the requirements of our client.' And by changing the material used, and the structure of the coating, the researchers can also control the the speed at which liquids slide over the surface. The non-toxic lubricant can be used on both plastic and glass containers and can be adapted for different applications. A prototype LiquiGlide ketchup bottle came third in the inaugural Visitor Vote for the Design Museum’s Designs of the Year 2013. According to the inventors, each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers cannot be scraped from jars and bottles, with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container.

Not only does the product save waste and reduce the need for packaging, but it can also stop beer and fizzy drinks going flat. The smoother surface created by coating the inside of cans and bottles for carbonated drinks with the substance slows the release of carbon dioxide bubbles from a drink, keeping it fizzy for longer.

"A grandmother from Italy has accidentally poisoned herself, her partner, their son, grandchildren and one of their friends by making them hot chocolate from sachets that was 25 years out of date. The 77-year-old woman, named only as Mrs. Rosetta, from the northeastern town of Vicenza, made the drink after her grandchildren and their friend, aged between nine and 12, asked for it, making extra cups for her son, her husband and herself. Shortly afterwards, all of them were taken to hospital with stomach upsets and vomiting, which authorities traced to the sachets, which expired in 1990, according to Il Giornale Di Vicenza. The woman, named as Mrs Rosetta, 77, was taken to hospital with vomiting and a stomach upset along with her husband, son, two grandchildren, and their young friend . It is thought that Mrs Rosetta bought the drink some time in the late 80s, before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Tiananmen Square protests, and while Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister. The chocolate powder had then laid at the bottom of her cupboard, forgotten, until one day earlier this month when one of her grandchildren asked for it to drink. Discovering the sachets at the back of the cupboard, she promptly mixed it into warm milk and served it, with disastrous results. According to Il Mattino her husband began suffering from vomiting and a stomach upset around an hour after drinking the chocolate, followed by herself, the children, and finally her son. The pensioner, from the town of Vicenza, is thought to have bought the sachets some time in the late 80s - before the fall of the Berlin Wall and while Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister . All of them had to be rushed to the emergency room for treatment, with one of the youngsters being kept in for 20 days, reports Corriere Del Veneto. While it appears to have been an accident, the grandmother has been charged with causing injury, with a file passed to prosecutors for consideration. Hot chocolate mix usually contains powdered cocoa and sugar, which do not usually go off but will decrease in quality over time, and powdered milk, which can go off after long periods. Powdered milk is particularly prone to curdling over long periods if exposed to heat or moisture, or if the packaging is torn.","Woman, named as Mrs Rosetta, 77, made drink using chocolate sachets .

"A man in China has been sentenced to six years in prison for 'provoking trouble' because he grew a beard. The 38-year-old from the Uighur minority received several warnings before attending court in Kashgar, local newspapers reported. His wife was also given a two-year sentence for wearing a veil that hid her face. In China authorities widely discourage growing a beard because they say it is linked to extremist ideals. The Uighurs vehemently dispute this claim. A Uighur man in China has been sentenced to six years in prison for 'provoking trouble' because he grew a beard. Above, a rare photo of two men from the Uighur minority who were not involved in the court case . The unnamed man started growing facial hair in 2010 before being accused of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' by officials. A campaign dubbed 'Project Beauty' similarly encourages women to leave their heads bare and abandon wearing the veil - a relatively widespread practice among the Uighurs. Speaking after the court case officials  said: 'Since the beginning of the year, a certain number of people breaking the regulation on beards, veils and burqa have been prosecuted and sentenced.' The repression of the Uighurs has been fanning tensions in the region for more than a year. The 38-year-old's wife was also given a two-year sentence for hiding her face. Above, a stock image of a woman defying officials by wearing a colourful veil . In 2013 Chinese authorities flooded into the region after a wave of unrest caused tension between the Uighurs and the Han Chinese, the majority ethnic group . Violence increased last year and at least 200 people were killed in a series of bombings and deadly clashes with security forces. In April authorities in Xinjiang's Shaya county offered cash to informants to report on neighbours with excessive facial hair. And in August authorities in Karamay city banned people with large beards or Islamic clothing from travelling on public buses. The origins of the Uighur tribe lie deep in the Altai mountains of Mongolia - or in Turkmenistan, depending on which version of the story you believe. According to the Uighurs, their origins are Turkic and date back more than 5,000 years. They now reside in the Xinjiang region. By contrast, the Chinese say the Uighurs are descendants of the Tiele tribes of Mongolia, who by 842, had coalesced into the Uighur people and moved to the Tarim Basin in what is now modern China. Either way, the debate around the origins of the Uighurs is yet another skirmish in the ongoing battle between the majority-Muslim tribe and the Han Chinese, the country's majority ethnic group. Mainly tolerated during the long rule of the Chinese emperors, the real problems for the Uighurs began in 1949. After a failed bid for independence, the Chinese cracked down on the fledgling state. Activists accuse the Chinese government of steadily eroding the minority's freedoms, as they have curtailed religion, commercial and cultural activities. Beijing has also been accused of seeking to dilute Uighur influence by arranging the mass immigration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang. According to China, their activities are justified because of the terrorist threat posed by Uighur separatists. The Uighur themselves vehemently dispute this claim.","38-year-old Uighur received several warnings before attending, official said .

"To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee rarely talks directly to journalists, so when a US reporter received a note from her telling him to 'go away', it was considered a major coup. Connor Sheets had been chasing an interview with her for weeks, in part to try and establish that she is lucid. Since publisher HarperCollins stunned the literary world with news that Lee is publishing a second novel, controversy has raged about whether the reclusive, 88-year-old novelist is of sound mind. To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee rarely talks directly to journalists, so when a US reporter received a note from her telling him to 'go away', it was considered a major coup . The blunt reply she gave to Sheets has seemingly put these worries to bed. The writer concluded that this reply could only have come from someone who's of sound mind. Sheets wrote: 'It appears that Nelle, as her friends call her, is very much with it, that she is still lucid and that her acerbic, press-averse side is fully intact.' Lee had mesmerizing success with her book To Kill A Mockingbird, released over half a century ago, and fans and writers were both delighted and taken aback to hear that Lee was releasing another novel. They were even more surprised to learn that it was a manuscript written 60 years ago and hidden away after an editor told the young novelist to recast the book into what would become Mockingbird. Go Set a Watchman, finished in the mid-1950s, features many of the same characters as Mockingbird and was discovered last year among her papers by lawyer Tonja Carter. But she was quoted by gossip blog Gawker as saying last July that her client sometimes signed things 'she did not understand'. Since publisher HarperCollins stunned the literary world with news that Lee (pictured in 2007) is publishing a second novel, controversy has raged about whether the reclusive, 88-year-old novelist is of sound mind . Go Set A Watchman is already number one in the best-seller list at online bookstore Amazon, where the 304-page hardback is available for pre-order ahead of its July release. Pictured right is US investigative journalist Connor Sheets who was lucky enough to receive a hand-written note from Lee . Could Lee, who had a stroke in 2007 and so often said she would never publish again, really be happy that a manuscript, long since discarded, was going to see the light of day? Mr Sheets hasn't been able to answer that question, but has confirmed that she seems to be mentally focussed and harboring a familiar contempt for journalists. It is well known that Lee has poor eye sight and is deaf. She has lived since 2007 in a nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, where all requests for visits reportedly go through her lawyer. Mr Sheets described how he made repeated attempts to talk to her, eventually writing a two-page letter to her on February 5. This week that letter arrived on his doormat, with four words scribbled at the bottom in black pen - 'Go away! Harper Lee'. Sheets said: 'She may have softened her language as she has advanced well into her golden years, but the thrust is the same: leave her alone.' Carter took on the role of Lee's gatekeeper after the author's fiercely protective sister Alice died last summer. Tongues started wagging and Carter has been on the defensive, telling The New York Times that Lee is 'extremely hurt and humiliated' by allegations that she has been manipulated. 'She is a very strong, independent and wise woman who should be enjoying the discovery of her long lost novel,' Carter told the newspaper through emails and text messages. 'Instead, she is having to defend her own credibility and decision-making.' In February Carter released an earlier statement telling fans that Lee is 'happy as hell' about the new book. US media has fallen on the story, quoting alleged friends and associates of Lee as attesting to her excitement and lucidity, or raising doubts and speculation. Lee, who rarely speaks to the media, said via HarperCollins that she was 'humbled and amazed' the manuscript was to be published after so many years. Go Set A Watchman is already number one in the best-seller list at online bookstore Amazon, where the 304-page hardback is available for pre-order ahead of its July release. NPR reported that Lee's friend, Wayne Flynt, visited her the day before news of the book came out and said she was of sound mind. 'Does she understand what's going on? If you make her hear, she can understand what's going on,' he said on NPR. 'Can she give informed consent? Absolutely, she can give informed consent.' To Kill A Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Price for its tale of racial injustice in the Great Depression-era South. Published in 1960, is has become standard reading in American classrooms and has been translated into more than 40 languages, as well as adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Gregory Peck. Roberts said that regardless of its merits, Go Set A Watchman will be of important literary and scholarly value. 'What's in a writer's mind is always interesting,' she told AFP. 'Anything that makes people read is good and anything that makes people talk about race in this country is good.'","Reporter had written Harper Lee interview request posted back to him .

"Sarah Mills with cat, Spot, who got stuck up a tree for six days and fire crews refused to rescue her . Firemen refused to risk their safety by rescuing a cat that had been stuck in a tree for six days – so two young men stepped in to save the day. The pair climbed about 50ft to bring down Spot from a leylandii in Stroud, Gloucestershire, after firefighters said the branches were too thin to support their weight. Several attempts were made to lure her down and the fire service visited the scene twice, after the RSPCA was called. Gloucestershire’s deputy chief fire officer, Andy Hermiston, said: 'This is the second time we were called out because a cat was stuck 50ft up a tree. The first time, a month ago, the cat managed to get down itself. 'On both occasions, we quickly discovered that the branches at the top of the tree where the cat was stuck were too thin to support the weight of a firefighter. 'While rescuing animals is an important part of our work, it cannot be at the risk of our firefighter's safety. 'Although the service cannot condone members of the public putting themselves at risk we're pleased the cat has been safely returned to its owner and that the young people involved were not injured whilst carrying out the rescue. 'However, we must also be mindful of the fact that the rescuers may have put themselves at serious risk and, as we have seen in the past, would-be rescuers can become victims, sometimes with tragic consequences.' Spot's owner Sarah Mills was relieved and eager to thank the rescuers, who climbed the adjacent trees with torches at around 8pm, and plucked the tortoiseshell to safety. 'I would like to thank them, I don't know who they are,' she said, adding that she will be keeping Spot indoors and will take her to a vet for a check-up. 'She is a bit thinner but I think she will be OK.' When firefighters arrived at the scene they realised branches of the leylandii tree (stock image) were too thin to support their weight .","Two men stepped in to rescue Spot from a tree in Stroud, Gloucestershire .

"Britain's dramatically ageing population means that within two decades one in 10 people will be over the age of 85 in some areas, a new study showed today. At the same time, the proportion of people who are under 16 is also projected to fall, putting added pressure on the state to support growing numbers of elderly people. Campaigners seized on the report to call for urgent action to improve care for the elderly and support them to stay in work for longer. Scroll down for interactive map . A new interactive map from the Office for National Statistics reveals how in some areas almost 10 per cent of people will be over 85 by 2037 . The Office for National Statistics today released an interactive map showing how populations will age in different parts of the country. By 2037, almost 10 per cent of people in West Dorset, North Norfolk, East Devon and East Dorset will be over 85. At the same time, the proportion of children under the age of 16 in these areas will fall below 14 per cent. Nationwide, at present 2.5 per cent of people are over 85, but by 2037 this is forecast to double to 5 per cent. Among under-16s the figure will fall from almost 19 per cent to 17.7 per cent. The proportion of people aged 85 in the UK as a whole will double from 2.5 per cent now to 5 per cent within 20 years, while the proportion of under-16s is falling . Between 1992 and 2037, average age in the UK will rise from 36 years to 42.8 years. In Rother, in East Sussex, the average age is forecast to hit 57.5 years by 2037, the highest in the country. By contrast, in Oxford the average by 2037 will be 31.5 years. Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: 'This surge in longevity should be celebrated and is testament to the huge strides we have made, particularly in medical care over the last half century. 'But to prepare for it, as a society we need to take measures such as continuing to improve our health and social care systems, helping older people stay in the workplace for longer and tackling the risks of loneliness and isolation in older age. 'Otherwise we run the risk of squandering the rich potential of our ageing society.' Minister for Pensions Steve Webb said: 'These figures really bring home how important it is to plan ahead for retirement. Many millions of us will be spending around a third of our lives or more in retirement in the future. 'Our reforms will ensure the state pension will remain strong for future generations and I am proud we have protected today's pensioners with the Triple Lock meaning the basic State Pension is at the highest percentage of earnings since 1992.'","By 2037, almost 10 per cent of people in West Dorset, North Norfolk, East Devon and East Dorset will be over 85 .

"The step-mom of a woman who died following a botched black-market cosmetic procedure on her buttocks has recalled how the victim was obsessed with having a larger bottom. Wykesha Reid, 34, was found dead on a massage table at the Deep Ellum salon in Dallas on February 19, with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt. Patricia Kelley, 70, who had raised Reid since she was a baby, said the victim had always 'wanted a big booty.' Wykesha Reid, 34, was found dead on a massage table at the Deep Ellum salon in Dallas on February 19, with her pants partially pulled down and a blood-stained gauze on her butt . The nursing home staffer had already gone to the salon three times for the injections without experiencing any problems before she decided to go back a fourth time. 'Your butt's getting too big,' Kelley recalled telling her. 'But she got hooked on them booty shots,' she told the Dallas News. Reid 's fourth visit took place on February 18 and police found her body inside the business at 7am the next morning. The building had been cleaned out and her purse and cellphone were missing. Police believe the victim suffered a medical emergency while having injections in her buttocks. Suspects: Dallas police are hunting Denise Rochelle 'Wee Wee' Ross (left) and Jimmy Joe Clarke - also known as 'Alicia' - (right) who are linked to botched butt injections carried out on two women, one of whom died . Police issued arrest warrants on Wednesday on charges of practicing medicine without a license for Denise 'Wee Wee' Ross, 43, and Jimmy Clarke, 31, who also is known as Alicia. The body was found by Clarke at 7.50 a.m. and Reid's daughter, Keira, told police that her mother had booked a session to have 'butt injections' and that a woman who goes by the name of 'Wee Wee' and a transgender person were going to carry out the procedure. Clarke told police that she had no idea how Reid had died. She claims that Reid arrived at the business on February 18 complaining that she 'was not well and wanted to lay down', so she locked her in the building overnight and discovered her body when she returned in the morning. The Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office reported that it found injection marks and a silicone-type substance on Reid's buttocks, according to Wfaa.com. Reid's family are calling for the pair to be brought to justice. 'I want to see them on trial for murder,' said Keaira Reid, 20. 'I'm very mad because anybody could have called 911.' Wykesha Reid had always 'wanted a big booty' and the nursing home staffer had already gone to the salon three times for the injections without experiencing any problems before she decided to go back a fourth time . The death follows a complaint to police by a 27-year-old woman who said that she visited the salon on February 9 and paid $520 to have buttock injections, but ended up screaming in agony when 'unknown' substances were used on her. The holes were then closed with superglue, she said. She later identified Ross and Clarke as the people who carried out the operation. The suspects' whereabouts are currently unknown. Neither are registered with the Texas Medical Board. Dallas County court records show Clarke has convictions for prostitution, lewd public conduct and possession of cocaine. Ross has convictions for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, assault, possession of drugs and theft.","Wykesha Reid, 34, was found dead on a massage table at the Deep Ellum salon in Dallas on February 19 .

"At nine months old, babies, if they are really advanced, might be crawling around on the floor, or shuffling from A to B. However, this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard. Jorge Tirado, 43, captured footage of his son riding the waves for the first time on a GoPro camera, and uploaded online. Like a pro: The footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board . The footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves, and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave. Although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water, it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves. Tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in Puerto Rico. Not impressed... Jorge's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave . The baby is visible at the height of a huge wave, bracing himself for impact, with his father propped up over him . The baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave, but handles the impact well . Although there was some criticism over the stunt from online viewers, the dad defended the decision to take his son who he did not name into the water saying: 'My son first try. Thanks to everyone. 'I encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean, after all the ocean is the place where it all began. 'By far, this is the best sport for your spiritual, mental and physical health.' In the video, Jorge can be seen holding his son, who is unnamed, and getting him ready for a day's surfing. As the two ride ride through the middle of the tube of a wave, the baby is all smiles at the motion . Just chilling: Jorge Tirado, 43, floats with his son in preparation before entering the waves . Beginner's nerves: At first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water, but he soon learns to love the movement through the water . The baby is then seen in the water, with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board. At times, the tot doesn't look impressed, as the water cascades over him. But he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer. While taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous, it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age. Pro-surfer John John Florence, 22, for example, has said that he was only six-months-old when his mother put him in a life vest and sat him on the nose of her surfboard as she paddled into waves.","Jorge Tirado, 43, takes his son surfing in Puerto Rico .

"When an Indiana man spotted a ratty old painting  at a yard sale, even one dollar seemed like too much. So he haggled the price down and bought it for 50 cents. Fast-forward 10 years later and he could be auctioning that same painting for $10,000. Jesse Ronnebaum isn't sure what exactly it was about the painting of seven men playing pool that captured his attention a decade ago - just that it 'jumped out' at him. Scroll down for video . Jesse Ronnebaum bought this artwork for 50 cents at a yard sale a decade ago. But last week he discovered it was painted by esteemed artists from Chicago's Palette and Chisel Academy of Fine Arts . 'That one just stood out to me,' he told WTHR. 'Don't know if it was the oldest, rattiest one or what it was.' In the painting all seven men are holding cue sticks, pointing at billiard balls scattered across the table. An artist's palette with a first and last name hangs over each man's head. It was just last week that Ronnebaum, who lives in Batesville, realized the bottom of the painting was signed 'Palette and Chisel Club 1910'. Ronnebaum said he went on 'the almighty Google' and found out the artwork had been painted by esteemed artists from Chicago's Palette and Chisel Academy of Fine Arts. In fact, seven members of the organization had come together to paint each other for the piece. The Palette and Chisel Academy was founded in 1895 by students at the Art Institute of Chicago's night school. According to the academy's quarterly, the Cowbell, the students could not use paints because of the terrible electrical lighting and were tired of creating their work solely with charcoal. Some founding members mortgaged their own homes so that the group could afford to purchase a mansion, where they held Sunday morning sessions that gave students the opportunity to paint a live model using natural light. Realizing the history that was hanging on his wall, Ronnebaum (pictured) contacted a gallery owner. The painting is now being restored and will go up for auction in May in Chicago . Seven members from the renowned artists organization came together to paint each other for the artwork, which could fetch up to $10,000 . Realizing the history that was hanging on his wall, Ronnebaum contacted Curt Churchman, a gallery owner in Indianapolis. The painting is now being restored and will go up for auction in May through Leslie Hindman Auctioneers in Chicago. Although Churchman said the auction 'seemed perfectly timed,' he believes the fact that the painting was created by seven different artists could make it a hard sell. 'On a good day I think it would bring $10,000,' he told Fox 59. 'You need someone who is dialed into Palette and Chisel or turn of the century Chicago art,' he said. 'It becomes more of a completionist piece for a collection I think.' In comparison, Churchman said if the painting had been created by just one of its artists, such as renowned painter Victor Higgins, it could have fetched 'hundreds of thousands of dollars'. But Ronnebaum is hardly complaining. He's still shocked a piece of history has been staring him in the face for the last decade. 'Years of struggling...barely making bills, not even able to consider living check to check,' he said. 'And the whole time there's fifty grand hanging over my head, literally.' The Academy (pictured today) was founded in 1895 by students at the Art Institute of Chicago's night school. Some founding members mortgaged their own houses so that they could buy the studio that still stands today .","Jesse Ronnebaum originally haggled the price down from just one dollar .

"Lord Justice Beatson has criticised the RSPCA during a court case over the investigation of a pair of a dog breeders whose animals were unlawfully inspected by the charity's officers . The RSPCA has been rapped by a High Court judge over a botched investigation into dog breeders suspected of causing unnecessary suffering to animals. The trial of Deborah Fuller, 55, and Phil Sheldrake, 59, collapsed after it emerged the animal protection agency  used the wrong warrant to enter the couple's property in Lawford, Essex. Senior judge Lord Justice Beatson today threw out an application by the RSPCA for judicial review of the decision to close the case - insisting it was important 'officers of the state' respected the restrictions on their powers. The RSPCA was challenging a decision of district judge Kenneth Sheraton at Colchester Magistrates' Court in June last year blocking the prosecution. Judge Sheraton excluded evidence obtained during a search of premises owned by Deborah Fuller, 55, and Phil Sheldrake, 59, who pleaded not guilty to 16 charges of causing unnecessary suffering to dogs and failing to take reasonable steps to meet their needs. The case related to 42 Ridgebacks and two Hamiltonstovare seized from Fuller and Sheldrake's house in  Lawford, Essex, in August 2013, when RSPCA inspectors accompanied officers from Tendring Council and the police on to their property. The search led to RSPCA allegations that some 17 of the dogs were emaciated, six of them severely so, and one was suffering from a facial tumour. All the dogs are currently being looked after by the RSPCA. The trial was halted when it emerged that council officers had only obtained a search warrant to investigate complaints that the couple had caused a 'statutory nuisance' because of the noise of the dogs barking and the smell coming from faeces that had not been cleared up. Judge Sheraton found there was no warrant issued allowing an inspection of the condition of the dogs. The judge put down to 'inexperience and misunderstanding rather than malicious intent' that Fuller was advised that the EPA warrant permitted inspection of the dogs when it clearly did not. The RSPCA applied to the High Court in London for judicial review, arguing that even if the 'dominant purpose' of the warrant granted under the EPA was to investigate a possible statutory nuisance, there was still scope for dogs found to be in poor condition to be seized and a criminal prosecution brought. The RSPCA went to the High Court  to have the botched prosecution reviewed, but its claims were rejected . Dismissing the argument Lord Justice Beatson, sitting with Mr Justice Blake, said local council officers and the RSPCA had gone on to premises 'intent on carrying out a search for purposes for which they had not been authorised'. Lord Justice Beatson said it was the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta and important to continue observing legal restrictions on 'officers of the state' - and bodies like the RSPCA acting with them - entering private land. He said the case involved 'officers of the state aided by a well-funded charity, which does excellent work in many cases, using the power of the state to compulsorily enter land'. He added: 'It is incumbent on officers of the state, and those who assist them in this way, to take care that the principle of legality that has protected us well over many centuries is observed'.","Trial of two dog breeders accused of neglect collapsed over warrant row .

"Sydney Siege survivor Marcia Mikhael has revealed she contemplated suicide after she was the victim of an online hate campaign, where people accused her of cashing in on her terrifying ordeal. Ms Mikhael was one of 18 people who were held hostage on December 15 by gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours inside the Lindt cafe at Martin Place in Sydney's CBD. She and other victims of the siege were reportedly paid to tell their stories on rival networks Channel Seven and Channel Nine in January. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikhael appeared in an interview on Channel Seven back in January and told of her ordeal during the Sydney Siege . Man Haron Monis held 18 people hostage inside the Lindt cafe in Sydney on December 15 . Ms Mikhael told the Blacktown Sun was bullied online after her lawyer told media she wanted a six-figure sum to tell her story in a television appearance. 'I went from being a victim and a hero to a villain, police basher,' the mother-of-three said. 'When all the bullying started I actually thought about killing myself. 'Every single one of the hostages received a payout from either Channel Seven or Nine. So why am I the only greedy monster?' Ms Mikhael said she had donated an unspecified amount of money from her television appearance and magazine interview to mental health service Lifeline. The Westpac project manager also revealed she had flashbacks and nightmares about the siege. Ms Mikhael said she had been slammed on social media, accused of profiting out of her terrifying experience . Katrina Dawson (right), who died in the siege, and Ms Mikhael were forced to stand side-by-side in the window on December 15 . She said she did not trust people anymore and was 'terrified' to go out. The 43-year-old added she had undergone two surgeries on each leg to remove more than 200 pieces of shrapnel. One of her comments during her interview on Channel Seven, which drew the most controversy, was how she thought the army could have handled it better than the NSW police who she said could have been more proactive in their approach. Ms Mikhael told the Blacktown Sun those comments had been taken out of context, adding she had thanked the police for saving her early on in the interview. Hostage victim Elly Chen (pictured running from the cafe on December 15) appeared alongside Ms Mikhael on Channel Seven in January . Jieun Bae was also interview who said Marcia Mikhael was a brave woman during the Sydney Siege . The former bodybuilder believes her road to recovery will be a long one but she was forcing herself back into her old routine. In January during her Channel Seven appearance, Ms Mikhael told reporter Mel Doyle how she shouted out to officers to let them know where she was on the floor, next to Katrina Dawson. When Monis fired the deadly shot to the back of Tori Johnson's head, Ms Mikhael and Ms Dawson were side-by-side, and also in the firing line. 'As soon as the second shot took place, and she looked at me, and then she puts her hands on her face and she puts her face down, like to protect her face. 'And I kind of go into a foetal position, you know, and my legs get hit. Both legs were in agony.' Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson were two of three people killed during the siege. Monis was the third person who died when police stormed the building after hearing gunshots.","Marcia Mikhael, 43, has spoken out about how she has been cyber bullied .

"His father was one of Italy's most notorious fugitives and dubbed 'The Tractor' on account of all the people he had mown down. But now, an American travel company has sparked outrage by recruiting the son of former mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano to give talks about his father's criminal life. Angelo Provenzano, 39, is now earning a living from talking to holidaymakers in Palermo about his childhood on the run after being signed up with the Boston-based Overseas Adventure Travel. Angelo, the son of mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano, is earning a living discussing his father's life to tourists . The notorious 'boss of bosses' was eventually captured after being caught in a farmhouse in April 2006 . A poster from 2005, a year before he was caught - Bernardo spent 43 years on the run before he was caught . His father, now, 82, is serving a life sentence for mafia crimes, including his involvement in the murders of the magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992. He spent 43 years on the run before being arrested in 2006 near his birthplace of Corleone, the name immortalised in The Godfather Hollywood movies based on Mario Puzo's books. He is said to have carried out 40 murders himself and ordered the deaths of at least 120 others in a career spanning more than 60 years after he joined the mob as a teenager. When the then chief Totto Riina was captured in 1993, Provenzano eventually became the 'capo di tutti capi' ('boss of bosses') of the 'Cosa Nostra'. Overseas Adventure Tour offer on their website 'an enlightening discussion about the Sicilian Mafia' But furious campaigners have denounced the move by the travel company, describing it as a story that 'still drips with blood'. Dino Paternostro, an anti-mafia campaigner from the Provenzanos' home town of Corleone, told the Times: 'I don't know what Angelo Provenzano tells the tourists, but I'm sure he doesn't tell them of the unspeakable acts of violence committed by Cosa Nostra and by a ferocious boss like his father. 'His performances may be building up negative heroes, who dramatically reduce the perception of the dangerousness of the mafia phenomenon.' Maria Falcone, the sister of the murdered anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, said: 'It's true that the sins of the fathers should not fall on the sons, but it's not right to exploit the mafia, a story that still drips with blood.' A group called Addiopizzo, set up to provide support for people in Sicily forced to pay protection money, has been left outraged by the revelations. Dario Riccobono, from the organisation, told the Guardian: 'He's the son of the most famous mafia boss in Sicily, the director of the worst period of slaughter in the Italian mafia. 'It's clear that a person can't pay for their father, no one's asking for him to go to prison, but if he wants a normal life he should act in a certain way.' The mafia boss, pictured in 1963, when an arrest warrant was issued against him and (right) in 2006 after he was finally captured . The brother of Giuseppe Impastato, also known as Peppino, was a political activist who opposed the Mafia, which ordered his murder in 1978 - campaign groups have condemned the move by the travel agent . The talks take place at the Hotel Opera Plaza, in Palermo (pictured) and take place on the third day of the 15-day trip to Sicily offered by Overseas Adventure Travel . Bernardo Provenzano was born on January 31 1933 in Corleone, a Sicilian town synonymous with mafia activity (and which gave its name to the fictional family in the Godfather films). He is said to have joined the mafia in his late teens, after the Second World War. In 1963, as he rose up the ranks, Provenzano went on the run when an arrest warrant was issued against him for the murder of one of his rival's (Michele Navarra) men. Over the next five years, Provenzano helped his ally Luciano Leggio hunt down and kill many of Navarra's surviving supporters. In 1974, Leggio went to prison, leaving Toto Riina in charge with Provenzano his right-hand man. Riina was captured in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison. Provenzano took the helm. During his time as a fugitive, he corresponded with his family via 'pizzini' - small pieces of paper - instead of taking the risk of meeting them in person. Provenzano was convicted in absentia of a string of murders, including the 1992 killings of two judges, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, for which he was sentenced to life in jail. He was finally captured on April 11, 2006 in a Sicilian farmhouse in Corleone at the age of 73. Angelo, Bernardo's eldest son, defended his new job for the travel company. Speaking to Italin media, he described the matter as a 'personal affair' and asked: 'Do I have the right to a normal life or not?' He told La Repubblica newspaper: 'For me, it's only a matter of an important job opportunity in a sector, tourism, in which I have always thought there's potential.' He added: 'Meeting people from another culture, who are free of prejudice, is a very stimulating adventure for me.' Angelo, who spent the first 16 years of his life living in hiding, said people in Sicily and elsewhere were prejudiced against his family. He has previously described his life as being similar to a 'Big Brother contestant'. 'We have lived, and continue to live, as if we were Big Brother contestants. We have been actors in the biggest reality show on Cosa Nostra. 'I always try to make myself known by my Christian name, and not by my surname. I always introduce myself as Angelo and only if it is necessary do I add the rest.' Discussing his upbringing, he said: 'I was born and brought up in captivity'. In 1992, Angelo, his younger brother Francesco, now 32, and their mother Saveria Benedetta Palazzolo returned to their home town, Corleone, when 'my growing-up began', he said. He acknowledged he had found it 'difficult' to integrate with society and his family were closely watched. 'They monitored every setting, every space - the living room, the car, the bathroom, the windows. Whether they still monitor us, I don't know. We certainly behave as if we were [under surveillance].' According to reports, Angelo gave a talk to about 15 tourists charting his childhood on the run with his father. On a description of the third day of its $2995 (£2017) 15-day Sicily trip, the tour company invites the group to 'gather for an enlightening discussion about the Sicilian Mafia (also known as Cosa Nostra) with one of the sons of a former Mafia boss.' Salvo Cascino, from Overseas Adventure Travel, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Our guests, who are all over 60, want to truly get to know the country they're visiting. 'We also help them to meet fisherman in Portopalo and immigrants that have newly arrived in Sicily. There is also this mafia tour. We help them to understand Italy's South and all its problems.' Another tour guide said: 'If he is not allowed to work, how can Provenzano support himself honestly?'","Angelo Provenzano, 39, now earning a living from talking to holidaymakers .

"Police previously released this CCTV footage of a man they wished to speak to in connection with the assaults . A man has been arrested over a string of assaults on elderly victims who were slapped after they sneezed in public. Five women and one man, aged from 65 to 82, complained to police that they had been slapped while sneezing in Carlisle city centre in the past month. Earlier this week police released CCTV footage of a man wanted in connection to the assaults after the elderly shoppers were left feeling 'confused and upset' after being hit. A spokesman for Cumbria Police said: 'Police in Carlisle have arrested a man in connection with assaults that occurred in the city centre on elderly members of the public who had sneezed. The spokesman said the 49-year-old was 'currently helping officers with their enquiries'. Police were informed about the first attack by witnesses and later released CCTV footage of a man thought to be in his mid-to-late 50s wearing a plush, tweed jacket. A week ago, shoppers in Carlisle said they were concerned by the eccentric's behaviour. Nicola Dawson, 48, a dental receptionist, said: 'I have come here shopping on my day off and actually have a cold. 'If anyone smacked me for sneezing I would smack them back. 'If anyone saw someone do something like that I would be surprised if they did not do something as you wouldn't stand for it if you witnessed it.' Trainee shop assistant Gemma Prosser, 19, added: 'We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird. 'When you think about it, it is really awful because anyone can sneeze at any time and it's not your fault.'

"A brain-damaged man accused of starting a 1996 fire at an Ohio fireworks store that killed nine people died earlier this month at a mental health facility. Todd Hall died March 8 in Athens where he had been getting treatment for the last several years, according to the Lawrence County Prosecutor's Office. A cause of death for the 43-year-old couldn't be immediately confirmed Monday. Suspect: Todd Hall, center, miles before leaving court in Ironton, Ohio (2002 file photo).  Hall was accused of starting a 1996 fire at an Ohio fireworks store that killed nine people . Hall, of Proctorville, was 24 when prosecutors say that, as a prank, he threw a lighted cigarette on a shelf crammed with fireworks at the Ohio River Fireworks store in Scottown, about 100 miles southeast of Cincinnati. The blaze on July 3, 1996, killed nine people and eleven people were injured. Five of the victims were from Ohio; the four others were from nearby West Virginia. According to court testimony, Hall had part of his brain removed after suffering a serious injury in a 1987 skateboard accident and had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old . The Daily Independent reported that victims included 24-year-old Ryan Aldridge; 3-year-old Shelbi Cron; 21-year-old Misti Cron, 31-year-old Candy Lee, 14-year-old Matt Sansom, 8-year-old Ona Tolliver, 34-year-old Floyd Tolliver, 9-year-old Jason Wallace, and 71-year-old Kathlene Wilks. According to court testimony, Hall had part of his brain removed after suffering a serious injury in a 1987 skateboard accident and had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. Charged with aggravated arson and nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, he repeatedly was ruled incompetent to stand trial in the years since then. In recent years, he had shown severe impairments in his ability to control his behavior, regulate his mood and take care of himself and was deemed incapable of living outside a facility, according to the last court-ordered evaluation a few years ago. The Daily Independent reported that Hall giggled and sang the Star-Spangled Banner in court. Authorities initially thought three friends challenged Hall to set the fire, but they all passed polygraph tests and were never charged. About 40 people were in the store at the time and ran for the exits when fireworks started going off.","Todd Hall was 43 when died March 8 in a behavioral health facility in Athens, according to the Lawrence County Prosecutor's Office .

"The former US Marine who killed American Sniper Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield has been moved into a psychiatric prison for evaluation of whether he should be moved into the general prison population. Eddie Ray Routh was transferred on Monday to Jester IV Unit, a psychiatric facility in Richmond, about 25 miles outside Houston. Routh was convicted on February 28 of double murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Scroll down for video . This new picture of Eddie Ray Routh shows him after he was admitted to the Texas prison system following his February 28 conviction for the murders of 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield . Routh, pictured here during his trial, argued that he was insane and not criminally liable when he killed Kyle and Littlefield in 2013 . His lawyers argued that he suffered from mental illness, including PTSD from his time serving in the military, even though he never saw combat. A jury rejected his insanity defense that he should be put in a psychiatric treatment facility instead of prison. However, because of his psychiatric state, Routh could still be kept out of the general prison population and be kept in a mental facility in the prison system instead. He was transferred from a state prison near Abilene, where he underwent an initial evaluation, to Jester IV Unit, which has more advanced medical facilities. Chris Kyle (left) and Chad Littlefield (right) were gunned down after taking Routh to a shooting range . When Routh was transferred from county jail into the state prison system on March 6, a new booking mugshot was released by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The Marine veteran appears thinner since he last appeared in public on the day of his murder conviction. The 2013 murder of Kyle, a Navy SEAL who wrote the best-selling book American Sniper, and his friend Littlefield drew nationwide attention. Kyle is the deadliest sniper in American history, with 160 confirmed kills. His trial took place not long after the release of 'American Sniper' the movie, an Oscar-winning biopic that starred Bradley Cooper as Kyle.","Eddie Ray Routh was transferred to Jester IV Unit, a psychiatric prison in Richmond, Texas .

"The tactics used by Tory chairman Grant Shapps to convince people to hand over cash so he could get them 'stinking, filthy rich' have been revealed. Mr Shapps, posing as his business guru alter-ego Michael Green, used online leaflets to boast of his wealth and status in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions. Using pictures of himself in his private plane and six-bedroom mansion, the future Tory minister offered his 'friends' the chance to learn how to make their fortune –as long as they handed him $197, worth £130. Scroll down for video . Mr Shapps used pictures of himself in his private plane with his son in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions . Mr Shapps said his wealth was 'hard-core' evidence of that he could help people get rich. The revelations come just days after Mr Shapps, 46, faced calls to quit after being forced to admit he had continued to offer get-rich-quick advice after becoming a Conservative MP despite vehement denials to the contrary. The Tory minister had insisted he had not had a second job since being elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in May 2005, but was later forced to admit he had 'screwed up' by denying the allegations 'over firmly'. It comes after a recording emerged from 2006, a year after he was elected to Parliament, capturing the MP selling self-help guide Stinking Rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a 'ton of cash'. The full extent of his toe-curling sales pitch was published in the Sunday Mirror today after pictures were published on the website Political Scrapbook. In it he offers punters the chance to buy his toolkit on 'How To Become Stinking RICH Online' for $197 – even though he claimed it was worth $100,000. The toolkit, he claimed, would make those who bought it '11 to 22 times more successful than the crowd as a result'. Mr Shapps boasted about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his HowToCorp firm and other projects. Pictured in his sports car he wrote: 'That's me... and I'm sitting in my brandspanking-new Crossfire Convertible 3.2L' But he warned punters they would have to move fast because he had taken the 'difficult decision' to limit supply to just 250 copies, saying: 'I will delete the webpage and the mastercopy of this toolkit'. Mr Shapps offered his online kit to people throughout the UK and across the world from his HowToCorp business based in North West London. He wrote: 'Since owning an online business has enabled me to live in a $2m home... to drive 3 high-end luxury cars and to own and operate my own aircraft, I suppose a toolkit that exposes every secret used to build that kind of wealth should rightfully sell for say $100,000.' Mr Shapps boasts about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his HowToCorp firm and other projects. The letter, published in 2004, featured Mr Shapps posing in his luxury sports car with the caption: 'That's me... and I'm sitting in my brandspanking-new Crossfire Convertible 3.2L (delivered Saturday July 24). It's one of the first dozen on the road here in the UK.' Tory chairman Grant Shapps faced calls to resign last week after admitting he had had a second job while working as an MP . But he revealed he and wife Belinda also own a 'wonderful Elan Turbo'. The car, he says, is 'complete with in-car DVD, SatNav and just about every other refinement you could imagine in a vehicle. Why it even has a fridge!' He also boasts about his lavish six-bedroom house in Hertfordshire and its new extension. Next to a picture of him sitting in a plane with his son, he writes: 'Everyone a hobby. Mine's flying. But buying and maintaining an aircraft (and this is my second machine) isn't cheap! 'But I just hate to rent... So I took out my pocket-book and bought a plane. That's me and my son in the cockpit. (One of us is a three-year-old with a passion for flying :)' Revelations about Mr Shapps' methods comes just days after he was branded a 'liar and a bully' for threatening a constituents with legal action for highlighting the fact he had a second job. Dean Archer, 50, said he had feared losing his family home after Mr Shapps warned he would take him to court over a Facebook post that mentioned his internet sales sideline as Michael Green. Despite the revelations David Cameron last week insisted he had full confidence in the Conservative party chairman. He said: 'Grant did have another job when he first became an MP and he declared that in the Register of Members' Interests which is what you are meant to do. 'But he obviously made a mistake by saying in some interviews that the work had stopped earlier than it had. He's put that right so I think we can put that behind him. He's doing a good job.'","MP posed as business guru Michael Green to offer keys to making cash .

"Investigators searching for the gunman who shot two police officers in Ferguson, Missouri, were no closer Friday to arresting anyone, and a top police official admitted that he was no longer sure if the shooter specifically targeted cops. St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar appeared to have stepped back from his earlier statement, in which he described the attack in no uncertain terms as 'an ambush' on Ferguson's police force. Belmar also told reporters Friday that he 'honestly couldn't tell you for sure' whether the mystery shooter was associated with the protesters who were picketing the Ferguson Police Department Wednesday night. Scroll down for video . Uncertainty: St Louis County Chief Jon Belmar backed away from his earlier statement, in which he described the Wednesday attack on police officers as 'an ambush' Aftermath: Police crime scene tape lies in the gutter outside the Ferguson Police Department at the spot where two police officers were shot during protests March 12 . Stymied: Dozens of tips have come in linked to the shooting, but police were no closer to identifying and apprehending the suspect or suspects . Doubt: Chief Belmar told reporters Friday that he 'honestly couldn't tell you for sure' whether the shooter was associated with protesters . Grateful public: Residents who support the police and city government show their appreciation as they stand in the rain outside the Ferguson Police Department Friday . Despite 'working around the clock' over the past 48 hours and following up on dozens of tips, police so far have made no headway in identifying and arresting the person or people responsible for the bloodshed. 'I cannot tell you at this point that an arrest is imminent. There is certainly nobody in custody,' Belmar said. 'When we get to the point where we feel like we have active leads, if we can do anything through you to have the community assist us, we will certainly let you know.' Ferguson hit the headlines in August when a white policeman fatally shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, setting off protests that spread to major cities across the United States and triggered a national debate about police tactics, especially in relation to African Americans. Last week a scathing US Justice Department report faulted Ferguson for using its police and municipal court to generate revenue by targeting the African-American majority in the St. Louis suburb of 21,000. Wednesday night's shooting came hours after Ferguson's embattled police chief Thomas Jackson resigned. The city manager and municipal judge have also quit. One of the police officers was hit in the face, the other in the shoulder, sparking a manhunt for those responsible and putting the flashpoint town on edge once more. Neither police officer was seriously hurt, and both have since been released from the hospital. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Chief Belmar told reporters the officers, a 41-year-old county police officer and a 32-year-old colleague from a nearby police department, were attacked 'just because they were police officers' by someone 'embedded' among the protesters. He added: 'I would have to make an assumption that these shots were directed exactly at my police officers.'

Martez Litte (left) and Iresha Turner (right) were among the three people questioned and released as part of the investigation . But on Friday, Belmar seemed far less certain of the circumstances of the incident. 'It’s kind of really hard to speculate what kind of nexus may or may not have existed between the shooters and any individual who would have been out there,' said Belmar. The chief also said during the press conference that the department has received more than two dozen tips, although he conceded that not too many people saw what exactly happened that night. 'The detectives are working around the clock,' Belmar told reporters Friday. 'They will not rest until they get to the point where we have a conclusion to this investigation.' Police raided a red-brick bungalow Thursday and took in three people for questioning. Lamont Underwood,47,  Iresha Turner, 22, and Martez Little, 25, were later released, and no charges were filed. On Friday, the chief confirmed that the trio of people, whose home on Dade Avenue was searched by a SWAT team Thursday, were not suspects in the shooting. 'Please appreciate the fact that we have a situation where many leads come in to us,' Belmar said. 'There were several leads that came in to us regarding that specific house. We were able to investigate that.' Since Thursday, St. Louis County Police and Missouri's highway patrol have taken over responsibility for monitoring the nightly protests outside Ferguson's police station. Tense: Wednesday night's shooting came hours after Ferguson's embattled police chief Thomas Jackson resigned, setting off a protest outside the town's police headquarters . A protester yells at police outside the Ferguson Police Department, Wednesday, March 11 . Bloodshed: One of the police officers was hit in the face, the other in the shoulder. Here, police shine a light on their wounded colleague's blood-spattered helmet . President Barack Obama condemned Wednesday's shooting during an appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live late-night TV talk show. 'What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest,' Obama said, referring to Brown's death and the findings that black Americans were targeted by overzealous policing in the town, where most of the force is white. 'But there was no excuse for criminal acts,"" he said. Calls for Ferguson's Republican mayor James Knowles to resign have been growing, but he told CNN that he intends to remain in the office that he won by acclamation last year, prior to Brown's shooting. 'There are ways to remove me if that is the will of the people,' Knowles said, referring to the ability for local residents to petition for the recall of a disliked elected official. Knowles told National Public Radio that Ferguson remains tense. 'Officers are concerned for their safety. Residents are concerned for their own safety right now,' he said.","St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said Friday they were no closer to making an arrest in Wednesday's shooting of two officers .

"A Queensland grandmother, banned from any contact with children after being charged with the attempted murder of her two step-grandchildren, has moved into an apartment across the road from two schools after being released on bail this week. The woman, 58, allegedly tried to kill the two boys, aged nine and 11, by setting fire to their bedroom with an accelerant and 'intentionally impeding' their escape route. She has been been charged with four counts of attempted murder of children, attempted arson and interfering with a corpse in a Morayfield home, north of Brisbane, between April 2013 and September 2014. The Courier-Mail has now revealed the grandmother has moved within metres of Ipswich West Primary School and a special school, after her release from Brisbane Women’s Correctional Centre on bail this week. Scroll down for video . 'The last photo of me and my grandson': The grandmother of the youngest child who died in Queensland's 'house of horrors' claimed he was murdered . The alleged crimes all occurred at a home in Morayfield, north of Brisbane, when the grandmother was present . In January, the Queensland Magistrates court granted the woman bail on the condition she find somewhere to live where she would have no contact with anyone under the age of 18. According to the the Courier Mail, angry parents outside the Queensland schools yesterday were demanding to know why they hadn't been informed and for the grandmother to be moved. The woman's laywer, Michael Bosscher, said one of the conditions of his client’s bail was that she had no direct contact with children but said the court didn't consider the move a risk. 'The court, when hearing her bail application, was aware of the proximity of the primary school and, given the nature of the charges, doesn’t consider her to be any particular risk to children,'  Mr Bosscher said. Horror scene: Queensland police recreated the moment the children, aged nine and 11, were nearly murdered in their beds by a deliberately lit fire . Firefighters remove the bed from the makeshift home. Police believe the children were deliberately blocked from exiting their bedroom . Detectives allege the grandmother tried to kill her two step grandsons, aged 9 and 11, by using an accelerant to set fire to a bed and holding their bedroom door closed. The children survived the fire with burns to their lower limbs, but a forensic recreation of the arson attack led detectives to believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape route from the bedroom. Police say the woman had twice before tried to suffocate the 11-year-old with a pillow and a tea towel as he slept. 'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mind-boggling,' said Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen of the crimes. Police have also accused the grandmother of killing a three-year-old boy in 2013, and a seven-month old baby, her grandson, in the same 'house of horrors' in 2014. At the time, the younger children's deaths were explain as SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome] but police say the grandmother, who was present at the Morayfield home when both children died, had moved the baby from her own bedroom to make it look like he had died in a cot. The father of the three-year-old, who had separated from the boy's mother, pleaded in 2013 for anyone with information to come forward and help police. '(My son) was a really healthy little boy,' he said at the time. 'When I got the call that night he was at the hospital, something didn’t add up - he was a healthy three-year-old boy. 'How did my little buddy die?’ Asked previously by Seven News  if she had killed her grandchildren, the woman replied: 'Absolutely not. I’m not a heartless person. Someone with no heart would do that. Father and son: The father of the three-year-old boy police believe was murdered by his step grandmother wants justice for the dead toddler . The father of a toddler police believe was murdered on July 27 last year at the birth of his son. All four boys are  children of the same mother, but her most recent partner was father to the seven-month-old boy who died in September 2014. The two boys who survived the fire remain in the care of their mother and stepfather under supervision. Police say the pair are not suspected of being involved. But the father of the boys, who sees them sporadically, said he 'feared for their lives' every day they are in the house. 'Just mindboggling': Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific . The incidents, described by police as 'mind-boggling' each occurred on the 27th day of different months.

"Most children can be prone to temper tantrums if they don't get their own way but Sapphire Bubb, nine, has become so aggressive, even her own mother is terrified of her. Single mother, Pauline, 47, from Southampton, says her daughter's behaviour can be so unpredictable she dreads outings and special occasions like birthday parties, and she feels like a victim of domestic abuse because of the daily barrage of abuse she gets at home. 'Her behaviour has deteriorated from being a normal child to attacking me on a daily basis. Very few people have seen her that way as it's behind doors,' Pauline told Channel 5 show My Violent Child.

During one outburst, she is seen shouting at her mother: 'It's not f***ing working, don't f***ing talk to me' over a toy and when her mild-mannered twin sister, Jorja, tells her to 'stop being silly' she retorts: 'Shut up you b****!' Pauline is at the end of her tether as after Spencer was diagnosed, Sapphire then started acting violently. 'It feels like I am in domestic violence with my kids,' she said . In another shocking scene, she bites her mother's face during a meltdown over homework and then sobs in her arms because she's sorry for what she's done. 'I don't understand why I get angry, I hurt people and I kick them,' Sapphire said. It's not the first time Pauline has experienced physical abuse at the hands of one of her children. As previously reported by MailOnline, Pauline found raising her son, Spencer, now 11, a real challenge as he was prone to regular violent outbursts and he once stabbed her with some scissors. At the age of five, he was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and put on anti-psychotic medication. 'Before the diagnosis he could be really violent, he stabbed me with scissors, he tried to strangle me, he could be violent punching, kicking and swearing,' Pauline recalled. Sapphire hugs her mother after regretting biting her in the face during one violent outburst filmed by the Channel 5 documentary . Spencer has calmed down thanks to his diagnosis but Pauline now faces another violent battleground with Sapphire. After the problems she experienced with Spencer when he was younger and now Sapphire, Pauline said: 'It feels like I am in domestic violence with my kids. 'They have taken the role of the abusive partner. This can't go on, I don't know how to deal with it. 'I try my hardest I put my all into everything for them and they just seem to fight me all the way.' Pauline often has to retreat her to bedroom in fear of her children's behaviour and is left in tears over what she can do to bring harmony to their home. 'I do worry that it's me, where did I go wrong? I do the best I can do at as a mum but I worry it's down to my parenting skills,' she admits. Caught in the firing line is her other daughter, Jorja, who often retreats to sit on her own when her sister's tantrums begin and is often at the receiving end of her verbal abuse herself. Trying to play a simple games of cards with her sister can result in her being sworn and shouted at. The single mother-of-three often retreats to her room to hide from her aggressive children . Islay Downey, a parenting practitioner who helped Pauline when she struggled with Spencer, returns to help the family again now Sapphire is causing problems. She said Pauline needs to establish a routine, set more ground rules and be more assertive. She advised Pauline to work on her own self-esteem as her lack of confidence in her parenting is holding her back. 'At the moment the children are on control and that's a very unsafe place for children,' she said. She observed that Jorja was often the victim as she withdraws to find a corner to sit on her own while her mother and sister fight. Islay said: 'Sapphire has learnt a pattern of behaviour that if she wants attention, this (being violent and aggressive) is the way to get it. Pauline is urged by a parenting practitioner to be more assertive and self-confident - she has let her children take too much control . 'It's like a dripping tap, little by little we have to get mum to be more assertive. Pauline needs to focus more on Jorja, that retreating isn't good for her.' The family are taken for 'intensive weekend intervention' at an outdoor activity centre in the New Forest to help them. Islay said: 'From experience, it helps to taken them away from a familiar environment where they have to break familiar patterns of behaviour.' During the weekend, the family do role play exercises where they recreate arguments taking the part of each other so they can see the situation from the other person's perspective. They also take part in survival activities in the forest and games where they have to work together. A weekend away with her twin girls proves a revelation as Pauline finally starts being the boss . The activities all work towards Pauline reestablishing control instead of letting Sapphire take charge. The mother is amazed by the transformation in her children's behaviour when she is the boss. She said: 'When I have made a suggestion they haven't kicked off and have listen to what I have said which is a good thing. Now I'm in my element, I'm really happy. 'The one thing I will take home is positivity, their behaviour has been amazing.' Islay says she's hopeful Pauline 'will now go from strength to strength' and take what she had learnt back into the home environment.

"Anyone struggling to decide on a venue for their upcoming nuptials, take note. American couple, Cheetah Platt and Rhiann Woodyard, have come up with the ultimate way to celebrate their love: by getting married in as many places around the world as they can in just under 90 days. The adventurous pair first came up with the globe-trotting plan after getting engaged last year - and finding themselves unable to come up with one specific theme or idea for the big day. Cheetah Platt (left) and Rhiann Woodyard (right), from Los Angeles, have decided to get married in 12 countries around the world . Their round the world adventure first began on February 8, when they packed two big backpacks and headed to Bogota, Colombia. During their three month journey, the couple hoped to visit 12 countries to have 38 wedding ceremonies in 83 days. Platt and Woodyard, who live in Los Angeles, admit that they did look for a traditional venue in their hometown, but nothing felt special and many they saw were simply outside of their price range. 'A lot of women spend a whole lot of time and stress and money on their one day and then it's over,' Woodyard told Buzzfeed. 'I love that I get to marry [Platt] over and over again. 'It's exciting that it's not just done in one day.' One of the couple's most recent stops? Egypt, where they tied the knot in front of an audience of camels and pyramids in the background . Platt and Woodyard first embarked on their round-the-world trip on February 8, flying to Bogota, Colombia . With the help of generous donors, Platt and Woodyard are scheduled to have 38 ceremonies in just 83 days . During their trip, the pair have decided to wear white at all times - and they will be married in the same outfits during each ceremony . One of the first few stops, the couple stopped in Spain for a beautiful ceremony amid the dramatic architecture . When they aren't officiating their stunning ceremonies, the couple takes in local experiences, like the Giraffe Center in Nairobi, Kenya . One of their favourite ceremonies took place in Mumbai, India. 'What a wonderful wedding!' Platt wrote. 'This ceremony meant so much.' With the help of honeymoon registry website, Honeyfund, the two were able to raise funds for this once in a lifetime journey. Posting the costs of the hotels they hoped to stay in and flights they hoped to take during their travels, Woodyard and Platt sourced the amounts needed to jet from the United States to Europe, Africa, Asia and everywhere in between, before returning to Los Angeles for a ceremony with friends and family in May. And forget paying for officiants in dozens of cities around the world, Woodyard and Platt were ordained online through the church of Spiritual Humanists so that they could marry each other. 'We're so excited for this once in a lifetime opportunity and we can't wait to make these dreams come true,' the pair wrote online. And the couple, who are both talented aerial performers, will also be using the experience as an opportunity to mix business with pleasure. 'We will be teaching, training and performing partner acrobatics all over the world,' they continued. 'It's such an incredible way for us to share our skills, our passion and our talents with others.' 'Wedding in front of the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, Spain,' Platt captioned this snap on Facebook. 'How did I get to be so lucky?!' The couple's second ceremony, also in Colombia, took place in the lush greenery for which the South American country is known . In Ireland, the pair had three ceremonies in one day! Here, they are standing in Glendalough Cathedral in the Wicklow Mountains . Passersby often snap photos of the couple, who usually take their own photographs afterwards showcasing their aerial skills . In between weddings, the pair carved out some time to take a stroll in one of Madrid's most famous parks . While in Africa, the couple got married again in a 'romantic Casablanca wedding,' which took place in the evening . The first wedding took place in Colombia. 'Many more to come,' Platt posted on Facebook. 'I have finally married the woman of my dreams!' Woodyard made her own bouquet - using dollar store flowers and old costume jewellery. 'She is amazing,' Platt captioned the photo. So far, Platt and Woodyard have visited Spain, Ireland, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, India, and Thailand. Although they had originally hoped to be married on all seven continents, due to the cost associated with travelling to Antarctica, they opted to scrap that plan. With careful budgeting, the couple was able to to find 'round-the-world flights landing in 11 countries for less than $3,000 USD per person.' 'A lot of people say you should travel with the person you're going to marry,' Woodyard added. 'We get to learn about each other everyday more and more and I love that it's brought us close.' For those looking to follow the couple on their journey, they are posting photos and updates on Facebook.","The couple first began their trek on February 8, flying from Los Angeles, California to Bogota, Colombia .

"The off-duty New Jersey police officer who was behind the wheel during a wrong-way crash that killed two on Staten Island last week had eight previous accidents and a DUI on his record. Linden Officer Pedro Abad Jr. killed Officer Frank Viggiano and friend Joe Rodriguez - both 28 - when he drove the wrong way after a night at a  strip club and collided head-on with a tractor-trailer. Abad had his license suspended for seven months starting in October 2013 after an alcohol-related accident in Rahway, New Jersey, in February of that year. Scroll down for video . Pedro Abad Jr. (pictured both) had eight accidents and a DUI on his record before the Staten Island crash . Abad was driving four people including himself when he crashed into the truck on Staten Island on March 20 . Off-duty officer Frank Viggiano, 28 (left), was in the rear right seat and died in the crash. Patrik Kudlac, 23 (right), is now in a critical condition. He was also off duty at the time. His license was taken after a a judge found Abad refused to submit to a chemical test and was driving under the influence. Before that crash, Abad had been involved in six accidents dating back to 2005, the New York Daily News reported. He was reportedly involved in another accident, his eighth, four months after the Rahway incident. It is unclear if he was determined to be at fault in the accidents. The fatal crash on the West Shore Expressway on March 20 on State Island was his ninth accident. Abad's license was restored in March 2014, but he had to use an ignition lock until September 2014, according to New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission spokeswoman Elyse Coffey. The 27-year-old cop, who was hired as a police officer in 2008, was on the force at the time of the suspension. Abad and 23-year-old Officer Patrik Kudlac were in critical but stable condition after the crash. Abad (left) posted a photo of three whiskey shots (right) to his Instagram  just hours before the deadly crash . Abad's car was traveling in the wrong direction on the southbound West Shore Expressway at about 5am . The crash occurred after the three off-duty New Jersey cops and their friend left this Staten Island strip club . The truck driver suffered injuries that are not considered life-threatening. Hours before the crash, Abad had posted a photo on his Instagram page of three shot glasses filled with what he identified as 'Jack Daniels Fire on the house.' Investigators have applied for a warrant to test Abad's blood-alcohol level. New Jersey officials said there was one other violation on Abad's record. He was cited for driving with a cellphone in August 2012. A funeral for Rodriguez will be held at on Wednesday and Viggiano’s funeral will be held  on Thursday.","Linden Officer Pedro Abad Jr. had his license suspended in October 2013 .

"Nicola Sturgeon has vowed to join forces with Labour after the general election to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street'. In a speech  in Glasgow tonight, she said that Scots MPs would vote to stop a Tory government 'even getting off the ground' in the event of the SNP getting a majority north of the border. Speaking to 3,000 delegates Ms Sturgeon also put forward policies which would increase public spending, including an end to austerity, a rise in the minimum wage, and increased payouts to youngsters who stay on at school past the age of 16. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon pledged that SNP MPs would vote to stop a Conservative government 'even getting off the ground' after the general election, and asking Labour to make the same promise . She also reiterated the SNP's longstanding pledge to scrap the Trident nuclear programme, abolish the House of Lords, and plough more money into the NHS. In echoes of Conservative adverts showing Ed Miliband in the pocket of Alex Salmond, she also talked about the SNP 'forcing Labour's hand' and giving the Labour party 'backbone and guts'. She said: 'Let me said it loud and let me make it clear - the SNP will never put the Tories into government. Not now. Not ever. 'As long as there are more anti-Tory MPs - Labour or SNP - than there are Tory MPs in the House of Commons, we can keep them out of government. 'If there are more anti-Tory than Tory MPs after the election, the only way the Tories get back into power is if Labour lets them back in. 'So in the interests of total clarity, let me make this promise today. If there is a hung Parliament, SNP MPs will vote to stop a Tory Government even getting off the ground. She also said that the SNP would 'force Labour's hand' in government, giving Ed Miliband's party 'guts and backbone' 'I call on Labour, today, to match that pledge - to make clear that if Labour and the SNP combined have more seats than the Tories, they will join forces with us in a vote of confidence to lock David Cameron out of Downing Street.' Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was 'a vote to make sure that the Tories are replaced with a better alternative.' She told the conference: 'If you want a Labour government to have backbone and guts, you need to elect SNP MPs to provide it for them. 'And if you want a Labour government that won't just be a carbon copy of the Tories, but will instead deliver the real change Scotland needs, then you must elect SNP MPs to force Labour's hand and keep them honest.' SNP MPs at Westminster would back a £2 rise in the minimum wage, taking it to £8.70 by 2020, the end of the next UK parliamentary term. She also set out her goal of making Scotland a 'Living Wage nation', with a target of having 500 companies paying this to their workers in the next 12 months. To help youngsters stay on at school and college, she announced the Educational Maintenance Allowance would be extended. While 35,000 teenagers currently receive the payments of up to £30 a week, she said more school pupils and part time college students would be eligible for the grant. 'From next year a total of 57,000 16 to 19 year olds will be entitled to receive and Educational Maintenance Allowance,' she stated. She also announced a new fund of £20 million would be set up in Scotland in a bid to tackle violence against women. Ms Sturgeon also talked of offering 'the hand of friendship' to the rest of the UK after the bitter independence battle of last year. She said the SNP's goal was still to make Scotland indepedent, but until that could be achieved she was eager to work with 'like-minded' parties throughout the country. She added: 'To people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, I make this promise. The SNP stands ready to work with you in making that positive change for all of us.' Addressing Scottish voters, she said: 'We will work every day to protect Scotland's interests and to make your voice heard. 'We will seek to use whatever influence you give us to call a halt to ever deeper austerity, to protect our NHS and to say loudly and clearly that the precious resources of our country should be invested in the future of our children, not in nuclear bombs. 'We will use our influence to win for our Scottish Parliament the full financial and social powers that it needs to grow our economy and create more jobs. 'And we will work in a spirit of friendship and co-operation with others who share our ideals - we will work with everyone, wherever they may be in the UK, who wants to see greater fairness and prosperity at the heart of their communities too.' While her speech was met with a six-minute standing ovation in Glasgow, her critics rounded on her policies saying they would 'wreck the economic recovery', adding that she 'hadn't learned the lessons' of previous years. Scottish Liberal Democrat party president Malcolm Bruce MP said: 'Nicola Sturgeon's £180 billion borrowing plans threaten to wreck the economic recovery across the UK. In an effort to put the bitter campaigning of the independence referendum behind her, she said she was 'extending the hand of friendship' to the rest of the UK, while still advocating Scottish independence . 'We know that the cost of interest repayments alone would be equivalent to a new secondary school every other day. They haven't learnt the lessons of the last economic crash. 'It is not liberal or progressive to leave an ever growing mountain of debt for future generations to pay. We will not spend today what our children should have tomorrow.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy added: 'No-one will be fooled by Nicola Sturgeon's claims to be the UK's best friend when the SNP's entire purpose is trying to break up Britain. 'There was no mention today of the austerity max that would be inflicted on Scotland if the SNP were to follow through on their policy of full fiscal autonomy. 'The First Minister knows, but won't admit, that SNP sums don't add up and her economic plans would lead to a £7.6 billion black hole in tax revenues.'","Ms Sturgeon called on Labour to vow to keep the Tories out of government .

"Eco warriors who have built a 20ft high tower as they prepare for eviction by bailiffs have warned they 'will not go quietly.' The activists were ordered to leave their community farm by today after losing a long-running legal battle with millionaire entrepreneur and landowner Brian Bennett. But members of the Yorkley Court Community Farm appear to be preparing for battle. Scroll down for video . Eco warriors at Yorkley Court Community Farmhave built a 20ft high tower as they prepare for eviction by bailiffs . The activists claim the tower is 'an art exhibition' but a message on their website warns 'We are here, we are determined and we will not leave quietly' The row began after a group of squatters moved in on the dilapidated land in the Forest of Dean two-and-a-half years ago and began growing vegetables. Activists, who are affiliated to the ‘Reclaim the Fields’ network, have run the ecologically friendly community farm ever since with the aims of 'teaching people about access to land, building communities and re-localising the food system.’ But Mr Bennett, who bought the land for development, had objected to the unauthorised set-up and last month the group were finally ordered to vacate by Gloucester and Cheltenham County Court. Since the eviction notice, the squatters have built a giant defensive tower out of wood and corrugated metal, and have appealed for ‘useful’ items including climbing rope, camouflage netting and jerry cans as well as for supporters to join them on the site. Protesters can be seen preparing for battlein a tower at Yorkley Court Community Farm near Yorkley, Gloucestershire . The protesters, who have been occupying the site for two-and-a-half years, have been threatened with eviction . Eco warriors daub 'Corruption stinks' across their homemade tower in black graffiti in response to their eviction threat . One of the eco farmers, Lucy Winters, warned: ‘We are here, we are determined and we will not leave quietly.' Make-shift towers have been used before by protesters to hinder bailiffs. At the notorious Dale Farm travellers’ site near Basildon, Essex, activists built a 40ft scaffolding tower and some chained themselves to it. But yesterday Gunter Tyrson, 33, spokesman for Yorkley Court Community Farm, claimed the tower was an 'art instillation'. He said: ‘We have a tower as an art installation. It is to raise awareness of our cause.' Mr Tyrson added: ‘It’s an homage to our ancestors, to those who came before us and gave their lives trying to get access to the land, to men like John Ball a leader of the Peasants’ Revolt. Land is the basis of all human wealth, but it most of it is owned by a very few people. The squatters have built a giant defensive tower, which stands at around 20ft tall, out of wood and corrugated metal . Gloucestershire Police arrive at the Yorkley Court Community Farm as protesters gear up for their eviction . Activists carry planks of wood across the site near Yorkley as they prepare to defend it against bailiffs . ‘We started the tower on Sunday and built it in three days. It is made from all natural materials and recycled wood. It is called ‘Community Before Profit Tower’ and evokes memories of the land rights struggle in this country.’ Mr Tyrson said all those living on the farm, who range from age two to 50, are waiting to see what the bailiffs do. ‘We are ready to talk to them as human beings. We have always been peaceful and inviting to the local community,’ he said. Mr Tyrson, who has lived there since the community farm was first set up, said ‘gaining access to land’ allowed him to pursue his ‘career path’ as a ‘professional vegetable grower’. A local resident who agrees with the protesters brings food to their site after the eco warriors lost a long-running legal battle with the landowner . More than 1,100 people have signed an online petition backing the group, who appear to be chaining the gates to the site closed . A spokesman for the group said the towering wooden structure was built it in three days and had been called the ‘Community Before Profit Tower' ‘We remain committed to our belief that sustainable farming for the benefit of the local community is more important than greedy developers seeking profit with little regard for local people,’ he added. More than 1,100 people have signed an online petition backing the ‘community farm’. Some local residents have also voiced support for their vision of sustainable farming. Mr Bennett, chairman of Vantage Point Business Village in Mitcheldean, Forest of Dean, has not put in any planning applications for use of the land and intends to keep it for agricultural purposes, his spokesman said yesterday. Gloucestershire Police is making preparations ahead of tomorrow's eviction and have asked the National Police Air Service to carry out occasional overflights to observe the size of the community on site. The group have appealed for ‘useful’ items including climbing rope, camouflage netting and jerry cans as well as for supporters to join them on the site . Members of the Reclaim the Fields group at Yorkley Court Community Farm prepare for battle . Activists have been running Yorkley Court Community Farm for two and a half years on the land in the Forest of Dean . The group grow produce and say their aim is to teach people about ‘access to land, build communities and re-localise the food system' Another homemade tower at the infamous Dale Farm site . The tactics being employed at Yorkley Court Community Farm appear to be similar to those used during the infamous eviction of the Dale Farm traveller site. Families, who had been illegally living on the site, had been ordered to leave the site in Essex by Basildon Council which voted to bring enforcement action in 2005. By 2011 a lengthy legal battle between the High Court and Court of Appeal had been carried out. By the time it came to finally evict the group in October 2011, protesters had turned Europe's largest illegal traveller site into a fortress. Police had to scale scaffolding, despite facing a hail of bricks and being threatened with spades as two caravans were set on fire. In some cases officers had to use a cherry picker to get to the top of 40ft towers erected by the travellers. Protesters had strapped themselves to buildings and scaffolding and some were chained by their necks to ruined vehicles filled with concrete. Officers had to hacked through shabby fences and break through gates to get into the site but eventually, the protesters were removed.","Eco warriors have been ordered by courts to leave their community farm .

"Militants fighting for Al Qaeda in Syria have released a chilling new propaganda video in which a young British jihadi describes life fighting on the frontline. The unnamed man, who speaks with a southern English accent, is filmed complaining about a lack of toilets as he stands in a trench - believed to be somewhere in the forest outside Lattakia city. Wearing digital camouflage and wielding a large assault rifle, the Al Qaeda militant reveals that although it is his ambition to die as a 'martyr', acting recklessly in order to achieve that is forbidden and he must avoid being hit by the sniper rounds heard popping and cracking in the background. Scroll down for video . Jihadi: The unnamed man, who speaks with a southern English accent, is filmed complaining about a lack of toilets as he stands in a trench - believed to be somewhere in the forest outside Lattakia city . Radical: The British Al Qaeda fighter says that despite the difficulties of being covered in mud and 'having to go natural' due to the lack of toilet facilities, he considers it 'an honour to defend the Muslim blood' Titled 'A Moment in Ribaat: Standing Guard in the Way of Allah', the two minute video does not feature the logo of any terror group, but it is understood the militant is a fighter for Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as Nusra Front - a branch of Al Qaeda operating in Syria. He is not thought to be fighting for the Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS. Described as 'A short reminder from the blessed land of Shaam', the propaganda footage is clearly designed to advertise the sacrifices Al Qaeda members are making in the name of their religion. The clip begins with a short burst of religious chanting before cutting to HD-footage of the unnamed fighter sitting in a trench in a wooded area - believed to be on the frontline of fighting between the Al Qaeda-affiliated militants and soldiers fighting on behalf of the Syrian regime. 'It's a foggy, cold day. The enemy is quite close and you can hear their shots coming - heavy machine gun fire,' the jihadi says, as the crack and pop of AK47 rounds ring out in the background. 'That is fitnah of the head,' he adds, using an Arabic word meaning distress or mentally challenging. He adds that despite the difficulties of being covered in mud and 'having to go natural' due to the lack of toilet facilities, he considers it 'an honour to defend the Muslim blood'. Conflict: The clip begins with  HD-footage of the unnamed fighter sitting in a trench in a wooded area - believed to be on the frontline of fighting between the Al Qaeda militants and soldiers of the Syrian regime . Heavily armed: Wearing digital camouflage and wielding a large assault rifle, the Al Qaeda militant reveals that although it is his ambition to die as a 'martyr', acting recklessly in order to achieve that is forbidden . Professional: Titled 'A Moment in Ribaat: Standing Guard in the Way of Allah', the two minute video does not feature the logo of any terror group, but it is understood the militant is a fighter for Jabhat al-Nusra . The video is the first to be uploaded to a YouTube account titled 'Brit in Shaam', which suggests it may well be part of a series of Al Qaeda propaganda releases featuring the fighter. The use of high-definition cameras and the use of a British fighter apes the professionally shot and edited video releases by the Islamic State terror group - which have included the sickening filmed beheadings of several Western hostages, including two Britons. In the Al Qaeda release, the militant is seen standing up in the trench, saying 'From time to time you have to keep peering up. The only problem is if you stick your head up for too long, a sniper can take your head out'. 'Of course we all want shahada [martyrdom] but we can't be reckless about these things. If it comes it comes but the priority of the mujahideen is to protect his life and stand guard,' he adds. The militant goes on to add that 'while villages and towns in that direction live their ordinary lives, we are here on the frontline, the mujahideen Alhamdulillah [thanks be to God]'. One of at least four airmen captured by Al Qaeda militants after their Syrian Air Force helicopter crash-landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric. The pilot, who was captured near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province, is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle. Al-Muhaysini, who has long been affiliated with Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria, suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the Syrian regime releases notorious jihadi Abu Mus'ab as-Suri, who is wanted in Spain for suspected links to the 1985 El Descanso and 2004 Madrid bombings. Fear: The captured pilot is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle . The video shows the airman looking dazed as he sits on the floor of a darkened room with the notorious black and white banner of Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra behind him. Clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash, the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head. The footage is decidedly amateur, is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick, professionally edited videos put out by Nusra's rival jihadi group Islamic State. Nevertheless, the sight of Al-Muhaysini standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any ISIS release. 'Technical malfunction': People gather around a helicopter reportedly belonging to Syrian regime forces that crashed in Jabal al-Zawiya yesterday . Al-Muhaysini's primary demand is that the Syrian regime release Abu Mus'ab as-Suri - a notorious Al Qaeda linked militant who was arrested in Pakistan in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland. Aleppo-born As-Suri - who holds Spanish citizenship remains a wanted man in Spain on suspicion of taking part in the Islamic Jihad Organization's 1985 bombing at Madrid's El Descanso restaurant, which left 18 dead. He is also wanted as a possible witness to the Al Qaeda-inspired  coordinated bombings on the Madrid's train system, which killed 191 people and left more than 2,000 injured in March 2004.","Unnamed militant in Al Qaeda film speaks with a southern English accent .

"An old housing commission terrace is just one of several recent harbourside properties sold under the hammer as hundreds more are expected to follow. Located in one of Sydney’s exclusive suburbs, the three-bedroom home in Millers Point is the tenth of 283 state-owned properties to go under the government’s plan to sell off heritage-listed public housing and relocate 600 tenants. Built in the 1860s, the  47 Kent Street home was recently sold in a private sale for a cool $1.64 million – taking the total proceeds of 10 property sales to more than $23.5 million. CEO of Government Property NSW Brett Newman said the NSW government was committed to divesting the remaining government-owned properties in the precinct over the next two years. But Barney Gardner from the Rocks Public Housing Tenants Group told Daily Mail Australia that  relocating Millers Point residents will affect the state's social housing waiting list. The 47 Kent Street terrace is just one of several recent harbourside properties sold under the hammer . ‘How can they [government] offer us all these homes to relocate to when the waiting list is still growing?’ Mr Gardner told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Why aren’t they offering these homes to the people on the list first? I don’t understand what the rush is for when there are others who need a roof over their heads more. ‘I have lived here most of my life and if they want to evict me – they'll need to fix the waiting list first - then I’ll move.’ However, last September, the Minister for Family and Community Services Gabrielle Upton said the sale of the Millers Point properties will return hundreds of millions of dollars to the public housing system to help the 58,000 people currently on the housing waiting list. 'This is all about reinvesting money back into the public housing system by selling properties that are very costly to maintain,' Ms Upton said. 'The age and heritage nature of the Millers Point properties mean they often cost four times as much to maintain as the average social housing property.' The government said that for every house sold in Millers Point, it can build three houses elsewhere. Built in the 1860s, the sale of the latest Millers Point home was sold in a private sale for a cool $1.64 million . The elegant Georgian-style sandstone terrace on Kent Street is one of several recent heritage listings offered for sale for the first time in more than a century . The latest sale comes after the first heritage-listed home at 119 Kent Street  went under the hammer last year for $1.9million. The second at 23 Lower Fort Street sold for $2.685million. The elegant Georgian-style sandstone terrace on Kent Street is one of several recent heritage listings offered for sale for the first time in more than a century. With prime views of harbour views overlooking East Balmain and easy access to the tourist hot-spot the Rocks and the CBD, the terraces are hotly sought after by developers. But Mr Gardner, who has lived in the area for more than 65 years, said the heritage of Sydney’s first neighbourhood will be lost with the sales with critics claiming it is a 'social cleanse'. ‘The thing we’re really angry and upset about is the fact that some of these properties have been vacant for as many as seven years,’ he said. ‘There are properties on Kent Street that have been vacant for so the last three to five years – meanwhile we have all these people sleeping rough on the streets who are still waiting.’ ‘The government is calling it “relocation” but I call it “eviction by dereliction”.' The three-bedroom home in Millers Point is the tenth of 283 state-owned properties sold under the government’s plan to sell off heritage-listed public housing . With prime views of harbour views  and easy access to the tourist hot-spot the Rocks and the CBD . Mr Gardner said the Millers Point residents have all been issued with an eviction notice but he hopes more people will ‘stand up and fight with us to the end’. ‘We’re delaying removal as best as we can. We’ve been here for a long time and all we’re asking is to leave us alone and let us live our lives,' Mr Gardner told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We’ve repeatedly asked the government to come down and talk to us - tell us why they’re doing this but they won’t consult us. ‘How can anyone treat vulnerable people like this? We just want people to know who we are and what this area means to us. 'I remember spending my childhood days in this area - going fishing in the harbour and doing races on the streets. It's a great neighbourhood and now we're slowly losing our homes. 'It's hard for some of the more elderly people here, they don't have the energy, but I'll fight this to the end, it's my home.' 11 Fort Street in Millers Point sold for $3.95 million in September, setting new record for terraces in the suburb .

"Margaret Challis was on her way back from a night out at the theatre when she died in a head on car crash which also killed three teenagers . A grandmother who died in a horror car crash had recently told her family she had 'everything to live for' after receiving the all clear from a brain tumour. Margaret Challis, 66, from Methyr Tydfil, South Wales, was on her way back from a night out at the theatre to celebrate when she was killed in a head on crash with new driver Rhodri Miller, 17, who died along with his girlfriend Alesha O'Connor and friend Corey Price. Her heartbroken son Jason Webber, 41, said his mother had recently told her six children and 20 grandchildren that she felt like she had 'everything to live for' after being successfully treated for the brain tumour. He said: 'She just went out for the night and didn't come home. 'Kids were her life. She didn't go out, didn't drink, didn't smoke. She just loved her family and would cook a Sunday lunch for 17 most weekends.' Mr Webber said he feels sorry for the families of everyone killed in the crash, which happened on a notorious winding stretch of the A470 through the Brecon Beacons National Park. He said: 'It's tragic that one moment in a night can take away your life just like that. 'I feel sorry for the families of the others who lost their loved lives that night and are suffering like we are. 'I will miss my mother's shy smile and having someone to turn to.' Scroll down for video . It is the second tragedy to hit her family after two of her siblings died in the 1966 Aberfan colliery disaster. Mrs Challis witnessed the horrific incident as a 16-year-old and was just yards away when her eight-year-old brother and seven-year-old sister were tragically killed along with 116 other school children and 28 adults. A bunch of flowers were left on the side of the A470 where the crash took place on Friday night . Mrs Challis was standing at the bus stop on October 21, 1966 waiting for her lift to school when she saw the enormous colliery slag heap which loomed above her siblings' school collapse and destroy the classrooms. More than 40,000 cubic metres of discarded rock, shale and mud covered the village in minutes, and the classrooms at Pantglas Junior School were swallowed by the mud slide - crushing and suffocating the school children and teachers inside. Mrs Challis's neighbour said: 'She had talked about the disaster and it still moved her to tears. 'She remembered the day vividly as does everyone caught up in the tragedy. It is so sad the way her life ended.' Rhodri Miller (pictured left) had only passed his test three days before the fatal crash and was killed along with girlfriend Alesha O'Connor (centre) and friend Corey Price (right). All were aged 17 . Friday's tragedy happened when A-level pupil Rhodri celebrated passing his driving test three days previously by going for a cruise with friends in his green VW Golf. He was in a six-car convoy with other teenages on a dangerous mountain road when he lost control on a bend. The victims' families paid tribute to them on Monday as friends lay flowers outside Ysgol Bro Morgannwg in Barry, the school where Rhodri and Corey were pupils. The families of the three teenagers said they were struggling to come to terms with their loss. Rhodri's parents described their son, a season ticket holder at Cardiff City FC, as 'a bright, talented' A-level student 'who had so much to live for'. Alesha's mother and father, Sharon and Paul, said: 'She was the perfect daughter and friend and has left a massive void in our family. 'Alesha was beautiful, intelligent and artistic and had her whole life ahead of her. We as a family would like to pass on our sympathy to the other families who have lost loved ones.' Corey's famiy added: 'The family of Corey Price are devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of their wonderful gentle and caring son, brother, uncle and grandson. 'No words can explain how we are feeling but we are truly grateful of the support of our family and friends at this tragic time.' Seven teenage boys, aged 17 and 18, have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and bailed by police. Superintendent Chris Curtis, of Dyfed Powys Police, said: 'This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families at this difficult time. 'We are working with South Wales Police in order to provide support to the families affected and also the communities they live within. We will work with partners to ensure that the incident is fully investigated.'

"The pain for the Prince of Wales must be considerable. In the early days of his son William's courtship of Kate, the waspish Duchess of Cornwall would jokily refer to the Middleton family as 'meet the Fockers', a reference to the Hollywood comedy about unconventional in-laws. How completely that joke has now been vaporised by Carole and Michael Middleton. As they play a major role in the upbringing of the soon-to-be 20-month-old future King George, Charles complains that he 'almost never' sees his grandson. The Mail's Shakespeare diary revealed this week that Charles is becoming increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he plays in the young Prince's life. Scroll down for video . Sought after: Prince Charles revealed he doesn't get to spend much time with his grandson Prince George . Specifically, it's said that he is frustrated by the amount of time George spends with his Middleton relatives, with whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole's 60th birthday. Well, the situation could get even trickier. For there is a 'definite feeling' among friends of the Duchess of Cornwall — George's step-grandmother — that Kate's parents could be thinking of buying a place in Norfolk, where William and Kate will soon be living virtually full-time at Anmer Hall, near the Queen's Sandringham Estate. Kate's new baby is due to arrive next month, and William will be starting his new job as a helicopter pilot with East Anglian Air Ambulance in the summer. The Middletons have often stayed with their daughter and son-in-law at ten-bedroom Anmer — they spent Christmas there, fracturing the tradition of the normal royal get-together at Sandringham House when William and Kate were absent from the Queen's lunch. But Carole, a miner's granddaughter raised in a council house, and founder and driving force of the family online shop Party Pieces, is a formidable, self-made woman of independence. Getting a place of their own nearby would, of course, mean she could see lots more of Kate and her children without people thinking she was installing herself at Anmer. She is, after all, the only mother, and grandmother for George, that Kate and William have. For Prince Charles, though, the dismay of seeing much less than he expected of his first grandson is heightened by his dreams of 'mentoring' the future king. In-law rivalry: Friends of Prince Charles claim he is frustrated by the amount of time George spends with his Middleton relatives ith whom he recently holidayed in Mustique for Carole's (pictured left) 60th birthday . Just a few days before George was born, Charles was jovially asking a ladies' circle in Wales for 'any hints' on being a grandfather. 'Spoil them and enjoy them — but give them back at the end of the day,' he was told, amid much laughter. On that day it was obvious to the ladies that here was a man anxious to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never had for very long himself. Charles was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip's dissolute, playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944. The Queen Mother stepped into her husband's empty space and became Charles's counsellor and mentor, a vital sounding board in his life, until her death in 2002 at the age of 101. It is not difficult to see how all of this kindled a desire to closely oversee the development of baby George, a need that is now apparently unfulfilled, despite the fact that the Prince has a special connection with his grandson, which, he believes, brings them even closer. The truth is that he feels an empathy with his grandson because he knows that, like himself, the little chap is going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he can fulfil his destiny. It is a unique and extraordinary situation that three generations of heir to the throne, aged 66, 32 and 20 months, are all living at the same time. For his part, Prince Charles has always recognised that the pull on Kate by her mother would be strong. As an aide puts it: 'Of course, he acknowledges that the mother-daughter thing is natural, and he's aware it's likely to be just the same when the new baby arrives.' Young : Prince William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their son Prince George . One has to wonder, however, how different things would have been if Princess Diana were still alive to balance Carole's pull on her daughter. Camilla is little help in this respect and she has no special bond with Kate or, for that matter, much of one with William. But is Carole Middleton really the only issue here? Friends of hers say it's unfair to put the blame on her for Charles seeing so little of his grandson. The fact is, Kate has rushed home to her mother at every opportunity — not just when she was suffering from morning sickness — and she and William have been endlessly taking George at weekends to spend time with Carole, 60, and husband Michael, 65, at their £5 million manor house in Berkshire. Yet they have rarely, if ever, been seen at Highgrove in Gloucestershire. 'All Carole has ever wanted was to give as much guidance and help to Kate and George as any other grandmother,' says a family friend. 'She'll be horrified to learn that William's father is apparently upset because he is not seeing enough of George. She would never want that.' When Kate was first pregnant, Carole would have been all too aware of the demands that were bound to be made on the baby prince by the palace and, it's clear, she fully accepted it. But she would also have known that William would defend the Middletons' right to be involved — he'd repeatedly insisted this should be the case. William's role was always going to be crucial because, until now, in-laws have traditionally found themselves frozen out in the Royal Family. After Princess Anne married Captain Mark Phillips and gave birth to Peter and then Zara, her mother-in-law, Anne Phillips, complained she and her husband had been 'completely forgotten by Buckingham Palace'. What even Carole Middleton didn't anticipate, though, was that William would not only make sure she had a 'say' in the early years of her first grandchild, but he would, indeed, be the driving force behind Prince George spending many days under the informal, unroyal influence of his self-made, middle-class in-laws — people whose outlook is so different from the stiffly royal approach of his father. Of course, this was more in line with an experience and understanding of life outside palace walls to which his mother Diana had pointedly introduced him and his brother Harry at an early age. Radiant: A pregnant Duchess of Cornwall looks well as she steps out this week for lunch at the Goring hotel. Prince Charles will be keen to see his second grandchild as well as more of Prince George . So, how often does Charles see his grandson? The answer is not very often at all. Our understanding is that he would love to see more of George, but does not want to have to ask. This shines an interesting light on the relationship between father and son. There are very real tensions between the two of them, and Charles often disagrees with William. But if there is an argument, friends say, Charles backs down every time. 'It's very different when William has an argument with Kate,' reports a figure from their own circle. 'She's eloquent and stands her ground. It's been a sharp learning curve for William, especially through the rougher passages of Kate's two pregnancies.' Handling his father, it seems, is so much easier. 'Part of William is a rebel who just doesn't want to be another version of his father, or have a stuffy, traditional royal role,' says a family friend. 'It's one of the reasons why he's taken the Air Ambulance job. 'I'm convinced he wants to show Charles that he can be not only a royal, but also a 'Middleton'. His message is that he's part of their family — a family that gave him a proper home life.' Could it be this that lies behind Prince Charles's complaint that he doesn't see enough of his infant grandson? Charles is understandably happy that William has found a loving wife and a new family. But he must surely resent any suggestion that the Middletons give William what he himself hasn't been able to. After all, how could he, in the aftermath of Diana's death? Meanwhile, Kate and William have settled into Anmer and are doing things their own way — which might not suit some traditionalists. Just the other day, it emerged that Kate's housekeeper at Anmer, Amy Wood, had handed in her notice, together with her husband, Colin, who worked as the gardener. Both were previously employed by the Queen at Sandringham and had agreed to switch to Anmer to work for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Now, they are believed to be going back to what the locals refer to as 'the big house'. No reason has been given for their departure from Anmer, which Carole Middleton has been visiting on a very regular basis — even though it is a three-hour-plus journey from her Berkshire home. Carole's regular presence there only serves to highlight Charles's absence — and the growing sadness he is said to feel at the lack of regular contact with his grandson, as well as William's apparent loosening of his royal roots. Whether or not this 21st-century, middle-class nurturing will ultimately turn out to be the correct preparation for a future king is impossible to say. One thing seems probable. With William and Kate living in Norfolk, her parents thinking of buying a place down the road and Charles spending most of his time 170 miles away at Highgrove, it appears unlikely that the Prince of Wales will see very much more of his grandson — not to mention the new arrival next month — than he has been.","Prince said to be frustrated at time George spends with Middletons .

"A Jehova's witness who had sex with a schoolboy was caught out when the child’s suspicious mother hid a tape recorder in his bedroom. Mother-of-two Kelly Richards admitted having sex with the 15-year-old during a three-month affair but was spared prison by a judge yesterday. The 36-year-old met the boy after he befriended one of her sons at church and she invited the teenager to her home for sleepovers with her children. Kelly Jane Richards, 36, was spared jail despite being described as having groomed the 15-year-old boy by inviting him to her home after meeting him at their Jehovah's Witness Church . During their encounters, Richards had told the boy: ‘Don’t tell anyone because I might get done for this.’ But their relationship was uncovered after the teenager’s mother placed a tape recorder in her son’s bedroom to discover why he had started hiding his mobile phone and why he was spending so much time with the Richards family. After the tape recordings revealed explicit phone conversations between Richards and the boy, his mother called in police. The boy admitted to officers that Richards had had sex with him, giving him alcohol, asking him for massages and ‘leading me on’. Prosecutor Roger Griffiths told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court the pair had sex after Richards had an argument with her husband, Paul. He said: ‘Mrs Richards was in her bedroom crying and [the boy] went into the room to comfort her. The woman was given a suspended two year prison sentence at court today. Prosecutors told of how she told the 15-year-old that she loved him during one of their exchanges . ‘The boy and Mrs Richards’ son went in to stop her from crying and were supportive. But her son left and Richards started kissing the boy which led to full sexual intercourse. ‘Mrs Richards was in her nightie, the boy was in his clothes…It was over very quickly.’ The pair then began talking on the phone and over Facebook. The court was told the boy’s housebound mother became suspicious about her son’s contact with Richards and took away his mobile. But Richards gave the boy a new SIM card and he was able to carry on the calls and texts on a different phone. Mr Griffiths said: ‘There were also suggestions of leaving home when he was 16 – which greatly upset his mother.’ Richards, of Mountain Ash, South Wales, sobbed as she admitted one count of sexual activity with a child between October and December 2012. The mother of two hid her face as she arrived at court today. Among letters attesting to her 'good character' that were submitted was one by written by her husband . Sarah Waters, defending, said Richards had been looking after the vulnerable 15-year-old because the Jehovah’s Witness community were asked to look after each other. She said: ‘She took him out with her family to go shopping and ice skating and do all the things a young boy wants to do with a family. ‘Their relationship obviously developed into something it shouldn’t have.’ Judge Richard Twomlow told Richards her victim was ‘vulnerable’ and she had ‘developed a strong influence over him’. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court (above) heard glowing character statements written by the Jehovah's Witness community . He told her: ‘Despite the fact you knew his age you had sexual intercourse with him at your home. That happened after a period of what might be described as grooming. ‘When you were arrested you denied any sexual relationship. You did plead guilty, although on the day of your trial.’ Judge Twomlow told Richards he had decided ‘with some hesitation’ not to send her to jail. Richards was sentenced to a two-year suspended jail term and a sexual offences prevention order. She will also have to sign on to the sex offenders’ register for ten years. Among letters attesting to her ‘good character’ was one written by her carpenter husband of 13 years, Paul, 34. He helped her cover her face as she arrived at court for yesterday’s hearing. The pair hugged following the sentencing and he is understood to be standing by his wife.","Kelly Jane Richards met the teenager at their local church in South Wales .

"Mother and daughter Wendy Perry (right) and Nicola Manson-Perry (left) swindled nearly £50,000 in identical disability benefit scams but have escaped jail . A mother and daughter who swindled nearly £50,000 in identical disability benefit scams  have escaped jail. Wendy Perry, 66, pocketed £28,500 of taxpayers' cash over a five-year period while employed as a medical secretary for the NHS, Wolverhampton Crown Court was told. At the same time her daughter Nicola Manson-Perry collected £20,404 while working as a hospital accounts clerk in a carbon copy fraud, which lasted nine years. The pair had denied charges of benefit fraud but were found guilty by juries in two separate trials in February. Both Perry and Manson-Perry received the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) payouts after claiming they could hardly walk unaided, the court was told. Perry, who worked for Sandwell General Hospital in West Bromwich, claimed she had to hold on to a wall for balance to ensure she didn't fall. She also claimed she had difficulty communicating and filling in forms, and even increased the pay out by stating she needed constant care both day and night. But she was rumbled when Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) investigators spent four days secretly filming her walking to her car at a hospital in April 2013. The clear footage shows Perry, who even parked in a disabled bay, strolling to her vehicle quickly without any aids and with no sign of a limp.

Perry (right), 66, pocketed £28,500 of taxpayers' cash over a five-year period while employed as a medical secretary for the NHS . Investigators then widened their probe to include her daughter and it was discovered Manson-Perry, who is married without children, was also picking up DLA payouts. The 48-year-old, who has worked for the NHS since 2004 as a £22,000-a-year accounts clerk, was claiming it took her ten minutes to walk two metres. Both women were arrested by police at the home they share in Wednesbury, West Midlands, on August 21, 2013. Joseph Millington, defending Perry, said Manson-Perry had now been sacked from Birmingham's City Hospital and her mother expected the same fate. Perry was handed a nine-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months,  on Friday. Her daughter was given a 34-week sentence, suspended for two years, last month. Perry was filmed walking briskly to her car by Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) investigators . The clear footage shows Perry, who even parked in a disabled bay, strolling to her vehicle quickly without any aids and with no sign of a limp . Recorder Julian Taylor showed sympathy with the mother, who has worked for the NHS since 1995, because 'life had dealt her a bad hand' and she had a long history of health problems. He said: 'This offending does cross the custody threshold but she is sitting here staring at me and I want her to know she will not be going to prison today.' Judge Robin Onions, sentencing Manson-Perry, told her: 'At some stage your mobility significantly increased and I am satisfied you knew that. 'Two work colleagues said they did not notice any restriction to your mobility. 'At no stage did you need mobility aids as you walked from your car to the office and walked along corridors to meetings. Recorder Julian Taylor showed sympathy with the mother, who had been working at Sandwell General Hospital, because 'life had dealt her a bad hand' and she had a long history of health problems . 'You convinced yourself that because you had other medical problems this, in some sense, justified you in continuing in this unjustified claim. 'You should now discuss with your mother how you are jointly going to pay back the debt you owe to the state.' A spokesperson for the DWP said: 'Benefit payments should go to those who really need them. 'We know it's a small minority of people who commit benefit fraud, but deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. 'Don't wait for our fraud investigators to find you - tell us of a change now. If you suspect someone of fraudulently claiming benefits, then call our National Benefit Fraud Hotline on 0800 854 440.'","Wendy Perry and Nicola Manson-Perry said they could not walk unaided .

"A Labour MP has received a dressing down from his own party after he described Nicola Sturgeon as ‘the wee lass with the tin helmet on’. Party whip David Hamilton was accused of sexism after he made the ‘disgraceful slur’ about the First Minister in a speech at Scottish Labour’s spring conference. The remark, which is thought to be a reference to the SNP leader’s height and haircut, was greeted with laughter by party members in the audience. Fury: Party whip David Hamilton (left) was accused of sexism after he made the ‘disgraceful slur’ about Nicola Sturgeon (right) Mr Hamilton, who is a whip at Westminster, was later ‘pulled up’ about his comments by deputy Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale at a women’s event. During an address to the meeting in Edinburgh on Saturday, Mr Hamilton said the party ‘has got to change’ in Scotland. Speaking about the General Election campaign, he said: ‘We’ve got to go out there and not just be negative about the SNP because that’s very easy to do when you see the wee lass with the tin helmet on.’ He finished the speech, which he said would be his last to the party’s conference as an MP, by saying: ‘Let’s stick it to the SNP.’ SNP politicians immediately demanded that Mr Hamilton be disciplined. Scottish health secretary Shona Robison wrote to Miss Dugdale on Twitter: ‘Not impressed with David Hamilton MPs sexist comments today, were you?’ Scottish Labour deputy leader Kezia Dugdale later 'pulled up' Mr Hamilton for his controversial remark . Miss Dugdale replied: ‘No and he was pulled up about it at the women’s reception’. She added that Mr Hamilton had attended the event to ‘hear the feedback’. Owen Thompson, the SNP candidate who is hoping to become the MP in Mr Hamilton’s Midlothian seat, said: ‘This sexist comment - and the reaction in the hall at Labour Conference - proves that the dinosaurs are sadly still roaming the Labour Party in Scotland.’ A spokesman for Miss Sturgeon added: ‘It’s disappointing to see Labour are stuck in the past - no wonder more and more Scottish women are planning to vote SNP on May 7.’ Mr Hamilton worked as a miner for 19 years after leaving school and spent two months behind bars during the 1984-85 strike before being cleared. He was one of 206 workers sacked during the dispute that left him unemployed and blacklisted. In January he announced that he would be stepping down at the election from his seat in Midlothian where he has been the MP since 2001. In his resignation letter, he wrote: ‘I believe that it is the right time for me to stand aside to allow the Labour Party in Midlothian to select a younger member, with fresh ideas and the hunger to meet the challenges of this changed landscape.’ He also said that he wanted to spend more time with his wife, children and grandchildren. Miss Sturgeon, who is thought to be around 5ft 4in, became Scottish First Minister last year after Alex Salmond stepped down following the independence referendum . Last night a Scottish Labour spokesman said: ‘David Hamilton acknowledged his comment was inappropriate immediately after he made it.","Party whip David Hamilton made remark about Nicola Sturgeon in speech .

"Blaze: A fire at a family home is thought to have been caused by can of hairspray left next to a warm hairdryer . A fire swept through a family home after a can of hairspray left next to a warm hairdryer was thought to have exploded. The woman homeowner, who had been getting ready for work, described hearing two loud bangs moments before she discovered the blaze. Firefighters battled their way through thick black smoke to tackle the flames in Mapperley, Nottingham, after being alerted to the blast by neighbours. The woman, her two children and their pet dog escaped the fire, that destroyed their home, unharmed. Today their charred possessions, including a cabinet and wicker basket, could be seen scattered outside the home. 'The cause is possibly a hairdryer that was left on in a bedroom,' said fire brigade watch manager Paul Meadows. 'The woman was using the hairdryer - we think she put it down and went downstairs. 'She then heard a bang and thought something had fallen. She heard another louder bang and came upstairs to discover the fire. 'She had no smoke alarms so she's been really lucky. 'The bedroom is totally gutted - part of the ceiling is damaged and the floorboards, as well as the hallway. 'There's smoke damage to the rest of the house and downstairs is damaged by water we used.' Next door neighbour Daniel Douglas, 26,  woke up  around 8am yesterday with smoke coming through his window. 'Someone was knocking on my door telling me there was a fire so I got out straight away,' he said. 'I could just see a lot of smoke but couldn't really see the flames. 'It's pretty shocking - I'm gutted for the family. They haven't long moved in.' Bangs: Two loud bangs were heard moments before the blaze started, tearing through the Nottingham house . Safe: The homeowner, her two children and the pet dog escaped - but their possessions were left charred . Another said: 'I was having breakfast when I heard a large explosion. At first I thought car had crashed outside but when I saw smoke pouring out of the house down the road. 'It's a freak accident really. Who would have thought a hairdryer could cause that?' The family has now been forced to seek alternative accommodation while their home is accessed. Remains: The burnt items could be seen in the street the next day, along with the blackened window .","Hairspray left next to warm hairdryer explodes causing fire in family home .

"Driving ban: Alison Baker, 60, was allowed by a judge to attend the classes she used to run . A motorist who ran drink-drive awareness classes has been banned from the road after being caught three times over the limit. But Alison Baker, of Pinhoe, Devon, was allowed by a judge to attend the course she used to run - which would see her ban reduced by a quarter if completed. The 60-year-old had twice driven to her local petrol station to buy bottles of wine within a couple of hours of one morning last May. But the garage cashier was concerned she was not in a fit state to drive on the second visit and told police, Exeter Magistrates’ Court heard. Officers turned up at her home, and when she eventually answered the door she was so drunk she had to grip walls and furniture to stand up. Baker had denied drink-driving but was convicted after a trial last month, before being banned from the road for two years yesterday. In an account rejected by a district judge, she blamed the high reading on post-driving consumption and said she had downed one and a half bottles of wine in about ten minutes before the police came to her home. Yesterday, Sonia Croft, prosecuting, said Baker was a trainer on drink-drive courses and should not be allowed her to attend such classes. She claimed that Baker would know all about the course and gain nothing from it. But Vanessa Francis, defending, said this claim by prosecutors was 'spiteful and unnecessarily punitive'. Sentencing: Exeter Magistrates’ Court (pictured) was told that when Baker eventually answered the door she was so drunk that she had to grip walls and furniture to stand up . She said this was Baker's first drink-driving offence and it would be unfair to refuse a first-time offender the chance to go on the course. District Judge Stephen Nicholls accepted this request. He banned her from driving for 26 months - but that could fall by 26 weeks if she passes the course by August 2016. She was also given an 18-month community order and told to pay £430 in costs. Miss Francis said Baker was involved in drink-drive courses in the local area for three years - but was made redundant three years ago because of the rise in the number of privately-run providers. During her trial Baker - who ran the classes for Devon County Council - denied using her intimate professional knowledge of alcohol units and driving to 'tailor her defence'. Vehicle: Baker claimed a defence of drinking after she had parked her blue Chevrolet Kalos car (file) She did not contest the high reading - 104mg of alcohol in her breath when the legal limit is 35mg - but claimed a defence of drinking after she had parked her blue Chevrolet Kalos car. Baker admitted decanting wine from bottles so she could hide them from her husband. She said she used alcohol for pain relief for arthritis and suffered problems with her knees, legs and wrist. The defendant said she drank herself into 'oblivion'  and would down alcohol until she passed out. Baker hid the empty bottles of wine - placing some of them in equipment she used for her drink drive awareness courses. She denied being over the limit, saying she only had two units of alcohol between trips, but admitted: ’I can't remember the police coming to the house.’","Alison Baker's ban will be reduced by a quarter if she completes course .

Treatment: An American who contracted Ebola was expected to arrive Friday at the NIH research hospital in Bethesda after being transported to the United States in isolation on a chartered plane (file photo) The patient is the 10th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. and the second admitted to the NIH Clinical Center, which has one of the few containment facilities nationwide set up to treat Ebola patients. The patient had been volunteering at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone, but the NIH did not release any further details about the patient. Previously, an American nurse was treated there after she contracted Ebola while caring for a Liberian man, Thomas Duncan, who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. The nurse, Nina Pham, survived and is Ebola-free. 'The NIH Clinical Center also admitted two individuals who experienced high-risk exposures to the Ebola virus while working on the Ebola response in West Africa, but who were ultimately found not to be infected,' the agency said in its statement.

"Australian babies have the highest instances of food allergy in the world, with a recent study finding that one in 10 children suffer from the condition. The study, by Professor Katie Allen from the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, was based on children from Melbourne aged 12 months who suffer from a food allergy. And the paediatric gastroenterologist says emerging evidence of an increase in anaphylaxis rates caused by eating nuts suggest it's a health issue that's only getting worse. But Prof Allen says there are some factors to acknowledge that may help Australians avoid developing food allergies. This includes our modern lifestyle, ditching our obsession with cleanliness and ensuring an adequate supply of vitamin D in our diets. Shocking figures have revealed that Australia has the highest record of food allergy in the world. Some of the most common food allergies in Australia are nuts . A seafood allergy which may include fish and shellfish is also common among Australians . Pregnant women and new-born babies don't need avoid cow's milk as a means of trying to prevent such food allergies . In 2011 Prof Allen conducted the study which reported the highest incidence of food allergy in the world, she told Daily Mail Australia. In the same study, it was also revealed that one in 30 Australians had a peanut allergy. 'I was astounded by the figures,' Prof Allen said. 'And I'm a little embarrassed by how high they are. I thought food allergy was all a bit of a beat up by the media. 'But the evidence speaks for itself and this has become a public health concern.' Professor Katie Allen at Murdoch Childrens Research Institute is also allergic to peanuts . Prof Allen says food allergy is getting worse in Australia. Professor Katie Allen shares her 'five Ds' which may help prevent food allergy: . 'Emerging evidence of rising anaphylaxis rates also show that food allergy among Australians continues to be a growing problem,' she said. Although the causes of this increasing concern is unknown, Prof Allen says research shows that one of the main problematic factors could be our modern lifestyle. This includes our diet. Prof Allen recommends that recent study shows that pregnant women no longer need to avoid eating peanuts, eggs or cow's milk in a bid to avoid developing a food allergy. 'In fact, such foods such be introduced to infants in their first year soon after they've started on solids,' she said. The allergist adds that there's a higher risk of food allergy among those who lack vitamin D - not just from sun exposure but in food. 'The quality of vitamin D in our foods like the way eggs and fish are farmed has changed over time,' she said. 'Also I think it's worth saying that we are being too clean. That includes our water supply and the over use of antibiotics. As a result, this shows the darker side of public health.' Prof Allen also suggests that dogs and siblings offer protection against allergic diseases while those with eczema are more likely to have food allergy. An EpiPen, often carried by people with severe allergies, particularly to peanuts, and who are at risk of anaphylactic shock . Prof Allen says her perspective on food allergy changed, particularly when she developed a peanut allergy during her pregnancy. She says although the common food allergy among children - such as eggs, soy, milk and wheat - can be outgrown, there are others that can be developed at a later stage in life. 'Tree nuts and seafood is most commonly developed during adulthood,' she said. 'And these can be the most concerning as they can be the ones that stick around - like allergies to peanuts, tree nuts and seafood. 'In my case, I developed my peanut allergy when I became pregnant as that can reset the immune system. 'I had also moved to the US and I was exposed to different environment of foods and microbes. 'There was also possibly different levels of vitamin D and all of these could have been causes to the development of my allergy.' Overall the most common food allergies among Australians include cow's milk, soy, egg, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, fish and shellfish, Prof Allen said.","Studies found about one in 30 Australian children has a peanut allergy .
Also one in 10 children from Melbourne aged 12 months has a food allergy .
This has been found to be the highest record of food allergy in the world .
Professor Katie Allen says vitamin D deficiency and cleanliness could be the cause of such allergies .
She also says pets, particularly dogs, could help prevent food allergy ."
"As heir to the Formula 1 empire, Tamara Ecclestone's childhood was no doubt a luxurious one. And it seems that she wants the same for her daughter Sophia, who celebrated turning one today with a lavish and extravagant birthday party in her honour. Tamara, 30, and husband Jay Rutland clearly wanted to give their only daughter a first birthday to remember - and they pulled out all the stops by creating 'Sophia's farmyard' in the garden of their London mansion. Scroll down for video . Happy birthday, Sophia! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland celebrated daughter Sophia's first birthday by creating a farmyard for the tiny tot in the garden of their London mansion . Birthday girl: Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pyjamas on Instagram with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life' Zebras, sheep, puppies and ponies were just some of the animals that were seen arriving at the family home, which had been kitted out with pink balloons crafted into 'S' shapes in honour of the youngster. Each animal had its very own station complete with a gazebo and pink name sign and a balloon artist was also seen making his way into the family home. On Tuesday morning, Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pajamas on Instagram. The picture of the tiny tot wearing the outfit, which was emblazoned with her name and the number '1', was captioned with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life.' Fit for a princess: The entrance to the house was transformed into a balloon castle emblazoned with giant 'S' letters in the child's honour . Welcome to the farmyard: Each animal had its own station complete with a pink sign with its name on and a princess crown . Enjoying her special day: Tamara's little daughter Sophia seemed to be enjoying her special day in this Instagram shot of her playing with her new presents . Which was is the party? Guests and animal experts made their way into the event armed with little puppies on leads . Disneyland comes to London: Tamara even invited a real life princess along to join in the celebrations at her family home . Speaking about the event, Steven Duggan, who didn't organise this event but has organised events for the likes of Elton John and Adele, believes the event could have cost around £70,000. He said: 'This is a beautiful setting for Sophia on her birthday. 'We have done similar 1st birthday parties for high end clientele like Tamara Ecclestone before where our clients spent upwards of £70,000. It's a first birthday, if you can spoil them why not! It looks magical; a perfect fairytale party!'. Formerly of the party-girl persuasion, Tamara is embracing a more quiet life with open arms, confessing that 'parenting is so much better than going out partying'. And although Tamara  is clearly loving having a little girl, she does admit that it does come with its less-than-glamorous challenges. Speaking to new! magazine about the joys of being a parent, she admitted that there are moments that are rather embarrassing. 'After having a baby, all your dignity goes out of the window!' she joked, adding that some of her most mortifying moments in her first year of having a baby include 'breast leakage' and 'poo on her jeans'. Special guest: A zebra was spotted being led into the Ecclestone/Rutland home ahead of their daughter's party . Coming through! An adorable cage load of puppies were also dragged into the family home to join in the lavish celebrations .

A luxury London zoo: Zebras made their way into Sophia's farmyard ahead of the little girl's first birthday party celebrations . However, the more disgusting 'perks' of having a young one aside, the 30-year-old is thoroughly enjoying her life as a mother, admitting that she's put her former lifestyle behind her for a more wholesome, honest living. 'The love that you feel is so much deeper,' she said. 'I don't have tolerance for bulls**t now. I don't waste time with fakeness. Sophia's my priority. She's really turned my life upside down – for the better.' The beautiful brunette socialite also opened up about the fact she and husband Jay Rutland are still sharing a bed with their tot, but that it's not a problem for them. Speaking in an interview with Hello magazine last year, Tamara - who gave birth to Sophia last March, her first child - revealed that she was a 'hands-on' mother even though she admitted it can be tiring. 'I'm totally exhausted all the time, but I don't care because it's a happy exhaustion,' she explained. 'I'm not drinking or having coffee and I'm being so healthy for Sophia. 'I'm sorry, but I'm completely obsessed with Sophia. I love her so much I'm like a crazy woman.' Tamara and her daughter were last week spotted enjoying a day out in Hyde Park, where they were duck spotting. Their little outing came just before Tamara and husband Jay and their daughter flew out to Milan for another of their many getaways, before also taking a 24-hour round-trip from the city to the glorious Lake Como in the north of Italy. Little Sophia was blissfully unaware of her luxury surrounding as she boarded a private plane with her mother. Jay, to whom Tamara has been married since 2013, chose to celebrate his 34th birthday with the quick getaway in the idyllic location, where they enjoyed a night at the Villa D’Este Hotel .

"The young Royals have been ordered to change their personal email addresses amid growing fears that they are being targeted by online hackers. Harry, Kate and William, as well as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, have been told to make the urgent changes after security officials detected a new threat of corporate and government snooping – most probably coming from Russia – aimed at the Royals. The younger members of the Royal family are seen as particularly vulnerable because of their use of social media. And the espionage risk is being taken so seriously that Prince Harry is believed to have also been told he must close down his Facebook page. Scroll down for video .

I'm told the threat has been picked up over the past five weeks and comes from hackers looking to expose state secrets and details of multi-million-pound deals, as well as Royal gossip. It is thought that snoops are offering huge rewards to anyone who can manage to hack into the Royal accounts. The young Royals have all been warned that just one careless or unguarded remark could be enough to jeopardise lucrative contracts. A source told me: 'Younger members of the Royals, Harry, Kate and William, even Beatrice and Eugenie, have been warned they are targets of electronic hackers attempting to intercept their emails. 'They are after any useful information about high-level Government plans that could affect major companies or industries. In the financial world, advance knowledge is worth millions. One slip could cost millions in business. Harry, Kate and William have been told to make the urgent changes after security officials detected a new threat of corporate and government snooping . 'And they have been warned to be on guard. They have to report anything strange that pops up immediately.' The warning has apparently come as quite the shock to the young Royals, who – perhaps naively – had 'no idea' they could be a target. A threat from closer to home was exposed last year, when Clive Goodman, former Royal Editor at the now defunct News Of The World admitted in court to hacking the phones of William, Kate and Harry almost 200 times. And when Harry was in Afghanistan, elaborate security precautions had to be put in place so he could communicate with his then girlfriend Cressida Bonas while he was away. Harry, known as Captain Wales at work, had a specially encrypted 'Batphone' so he could call her without being overheard during his second, 20-week tour that ended in January 2013. Security issues aside, some of Harry's close friends will be joking that there's another reason behind the change in address. In typical laddish style, his previous account included the figures '69' – a suggestive allusion to a sexual position and a sure-fire way to raise a few eyebrows. When Harry was in Afghanistan, elaborate security precautions had to be put in place so he could communicate with his then girlfriend Cressida Bonas while he was away . The NHS could see an unexpected Royal arrival as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge prepare for the birth of their second baby. With Kate living at the couple’s Norfolk estate, Anmer Hall, aides have been sent to check out local hospitals ‘just in case’ she can’t make it to the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s in London in time for the birth next month. Among those closest to Anmer Hall is the world-renowned Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge. ‘If there is a sudden emergency in Norfolk and there is no time to get Kate to London, she will go to the nearest hospital,’ reveals an insider. ‘If the nearest one is an NHS hospital, then that’s where the fourth in line to the throne will be born.’","Young Royals have been ordered to change personal email addresses .

"Whether you use it to share news and emotions, or to complain about brands, what you write on Twitter may say more about you than you think. Now, an interactive tool can analyse your most recent tweets and its creator claims it can reveal your personality, by looking at how you use words. Called Analyse Words, it generates a user’s emotional style and says whether they are upbeat, worried, angry or depressed, as well as revealing someone’s social and thinking styles. Try the interactive tool below . Use the interactive tool above to analyse your most recent tweets and reveal your personality . The tool is created by James Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who studies the link between language and personality. To get results, users simply have to enter their Twitter handle and press a button that says 'Analyse Tweets'. A results page is then generated that counts the number of recent words studied and lists the latest tweets. But most intriguingly it tells users how upbeat, worried, angry and depressed they are, in terms of percentages. Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet, whereas the tweets of people who are predominantly worried contain anxious words and nervous questions. The tool is created by James Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who studies the link between language and personality. These are the results for Barack Obama, which show he is very upbeat and quite analytical . By inputting a Twitter handle, such as a celebrity's a result page is generated that counts the number of recent words studied and lists the latest tweets. It can be used to show the difference between people's emotional, social and thinking styles. For example, President Obama (left) is upbeat, while Katy Perry (right) is depressed . Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet. Tweets by worried users are dominated by anxious words and nervous questions. Angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals. Depressed people make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. Angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals and people who have a high depression score make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. The tool also analyses a user's social style and says whether they are plugged in, personable, arrogant or spacy. 'Plugged in' tweeters are socially engaged and use social words as well as talking to specific friends, according to the tool. Personable people use positive emotional words, pose questions and reference others frequently, while those who are 'arrogant or distant' tend to be well-read with 'an arms-length approach to socialising'. 'You scored high in this category if you discuss actions instead of emotions, use big words and don’t reference yourself much,' it says. Twitter users who score highly in being a 'spacy valley girl' are excitable and have a habit of tweeting LOLLLLLs, the tool says. It also analyses user's thinking styles and tells them to what extent their tweets show they are analytical, sensory or how they seem to live in the moment. Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet, whereas angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals, while depressed people make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. Singer Katy Perry's results are shown, which says she is depressed . Dr Pennebacker has previously developed a computer program called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) which looks at the choice, frequency and context of words to gauge a person’s psychological state, Maria Konnikova writes for the New Yorker. 'Since the creation of the LIWC, in 1993, studies utilising the program have suggested a close connection between our language, our state of mind, and our behaviour,’ she writes. For example, one study showed that the words used on a date can predict people’s desire to be with someone, or in another situation can indicate a person’s importance at work or even their sex and mental state. The tool also analyses a user's social style and says whether they are plugged in, personable, arrogant, meaning distant, and or spacy. Kanye West's results are shown above, which show he is mostly personable . A study by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania last month revealed that words used in social media profiles can help determine parts of the US that are more likely to have high numbers of deaths due to heart disease. Psychologist Johannes Eichstaedt led a team that analysed 826million tweets from 1,400 counties in the US for words associated with anger, anxiety and other emotions, to emotionally profile users. They found that counties where people’s tweets included hostile, aggressive and lazy words, such as ‘jealous’ and ‘bored’ had higher rates of death from heart attacks and strokes, whereas places with more positive tweeters had less. This suggests that negative and angry language used on social media could be used to predict medical conditions, but the field of research is young.","Interactive tool analyses recent tweets to create a user's profile .

"From exam stress and homework struggles to friendship woes, middle school can be a difficult time. But last week, nearly 150  eighth graders in Massachusetts had their spirits lifted after walking into school in the morning - only to find kind-hearted Post-it notes stuck to each one of their lockers. The handwritten notes, reading 'You are beautiful', were placed on lockers around Ipswich Middle School in  Ipswich last Friday by a mystery well-wisher. Not a single eighth grader was left out.

One of these students was Eric Anderson, whose family home at 62 Central St burned down three weeks ago. Speaking to CBS Boston, Eric said of the gesture: 'It’s still good that people care'. Before Friday morning, the anonymous messenger had asked teacher Christina Ciarametaro if they could write and stick the notes to eighth graders' lockers without any security issues, it is reported.

"A British Muslim fashion vlogger called Dina Torkia, 25, will appear in a documentary tonight about her entry into the international Muslim beauty pageant, World Muslimah. Contestants are subjected to a two-week boot camp where they take one numerous tasks, including entertaining orphans, medical exams and a psychological test where the women are quizzed on aspects of their personality. The contest, which first ran in 2011, judges women on dedication, reputation and concern for Islamic values and community development. Scroll down for video . Dina Torkia is pictured in Yogyakarta, where she took part in the Muslim Miss World pageant . It is held exclusively for Muslim women, who are assessed not only their appearance (in Islamic dress) but also their piety, religious knowledge and understanding of the Koran. Hundreds of women enter the contest online and 20 finalists are then chosen by judges. In previous years, entrants were asked to talk people through their path to the religion and what wearing a headscarf meant to them. The founder of the competition Eka Shanty says that she started the event to empower women. She tells the TV cameras: 'This is about mind, body and soul. 'Women are supposed to be highly educated and well appreciated - my duty as head of World Muslimah is to empower them. 'It is about the ideal Muslim. I've been thinking about how to put Lady Diana into an Islamic personality.' Dina introduces herself to the other contestants . The event is run as an international charity event by the World Muslimah Foundation (WMF) to benefit relief of Muslim women in food crises, wars, conflicts and natural disasters. After travelling to Jakarta in Indonesia from her home in London for the event, Dina and the rest of the 18 contestants are woken at 3am to recite the Koran on the first morning. They are then put through a rigorous medical exam which includes giving blood and urine samples. The results of the test are then given to the judges, who will include the information when weighing up who will win. According to the organisers, the reason for the test is to make sure that the winner will be healthy enough to complete her duties as Miss World Muslimah. The women are then given a 'psycho test' to complete to rate their personality (Dina pictured with some of the other contestants) The women are then given a 'psycho test' to complete, which is a multiple choice exam designed to rate their personality. Dina is astonished at some of the questions and reads one of them out for the cameras. She says: 'One of the questions in the multiple choice are: ""I like to participate in discussions about sex and sexual activities,"" or, ""I like to predict how my friends will do in various situations.""' She adds: ‘I think I’ll just circle any old s*** because I’m pretty sure this means nothing.’ The women are then taken to one of the city's slums so they organisers can see how their interact with underprivileged people and how it affects them. The next day they take the train to Yogyakarta and indulge in some karaoke en route, which Dina is shocked to see because Muslim women are traditionally not supposed to sing in front of men. She says: 'Women aren’t supposed to sing in front of men because their voice is part of their aura.' The pageant is judged by a panel of men and women, but the final decision between the best two contestants is made by 100 child orphans. Dina with Miss Iran . When the women arrive in Yogyakarta they are asked to entertain a group of children, who later turn out to be some of the boys and girls who will be judging in the competition. Dina is unimpressed, telling the cameras: ‘I feel like they’re exploiting kids to make us feel like good Samaritans. 'They were taken for their home to be photographed for this competition.' In another task, the women are given 150,000 rupees (£7.50) and asked to buy three presents for elderly women who live in a local residential home. After a few more tasks, the eve of the grand final arrives and a last minute entry to the competition is announced - from Trinidad And Tobago. In the day of the competition, all of the women arrive at the studios to take part. Dina and Miss Iran on the train to Yogyakarta . The pageant has several rounds, including a section where they mime a reading of the Koran that they pre-recorded. They are also asked series of questions by the judges, but unfortunately many of the children have started to fall asleep. Dina gets through to the penultimate round but the two contestants chosen for the final are from Miss India and Miss Tunisia. The children then each vote on who they prefer and first place goes to Miss Tunisia, who got 51 votes compared to Miss India's 49 votes. As Dina heads back to the UK, she reflects on how the competition made her feel about her religion and nationality. She says: 'It helped me religiously a little but mainly it taught me that I’m a very honest person. I also didn't realise how British I am. My British side came roaring out of nowhere.

"An authentic Gaucho cowboy has staked his claim, being named the ‘World’s Most Talented’ after performing some incredibly controlled yoga with a horse. Martin Tatta from San Antonio de Areco, Argentina, is revered for his spiritual connection to horses through the art of yoga and showcased his unique talent for the TV series. Featured at his ranch at the start of the clip, the 32-year-old explains what it is exactly that he does with one of the show’s presenters David Brain. Martin attaches his hat to the horse's hoof before getting the animal to point its legs out straight . And goes into brief detail about what Indian breaking in involves. He says: ‘It’s called Indian breaking in, it takes a lot of time working with the horse on the ground, but I trust animals more than anything. ‘You shouldn’t trust people, but you should trust animals. And as for my wife, sometimes I don’t trust her either.’ After sharing a quick hug with the presenter, Martin introduces him to his family and his mentor Alberto, who took him under his wing when he was aged 14. After turning the horse over onto its back, the Gaucho cowboy climbs on top of it and holds it hoofs . Relaxing the animal, Martin holds onto the horse's front hoofs before performing a spectacular head stand . Despite this however, Alberto takes little credit for Martin’s unique talent and claims that his ability with horses is something that cannot be taught. He says: ‘Authentic Gauchos have many customs, he [Martin] learnt some of that stuff, but not this. He learnt this on his own.’ Riding his horse into position to begin the routine, Martin is filmed by David as he slowly stands up on the animal’s back. Next he lays down on top of the horse and rubs his head against its neck. Descending to its knees the animal rolls over onto its side and Martin begins caressing its stomach. Martin performs the horse yoga at his ranch in San Antonio de Areco for TV show 'World's Most Talented' Martin then moves the horse onto its back and after placing his hat on its hoof, gets the animal to point its legs. Straddling the horse, Martin returns to lay on its stomach and after moving its front legs into place performs an impressive head stand. David and Alberto look on in amazement as Martin turns the horse back onto its legs before bringing it to the ground once more, jumping up on it, and standing up as the horse ascends. Martin was taken under the wing of his mentor Alberto when he was just aged 14 and he has been training ever since . Reacting with a laugh of disbelief, David remarks that the performance was incredible. He says: ‘I have never been more confident that that is going to blow people away. If that horse had taken one step in the wrong way it would have really hurt.’ Martin will represent Argentina against Japan when the programme is broadcast at 9pm on Tuesday April 21. The show's presenter David watches in disbelief as Martin completes his routine by standing on top of his horse .","Relaxing the horse, the Gaucho cowboy brings it slowly to the ground .

"Blackpool Pier is facing an uncertain future after being put up for sale for £4.8million. The historic attraction is one of three piers which have been put on the market by owners Cuerden Leisure for a collective asking price of £12.6million. Blackpool Central Pier - home to the famous 33 metre high (108ft) Ferris wheel and the closest of three piers to Blackpool Tower - Blackpool South Pier and Llandudno Pier in Wales, were all constructed in the 19th century. Scroll down for video . Up for grabs: Blackpool Central Pier is on sale for almost £5million, along with Blackpool South Pier . But Llandudno, which is 695 metres long (2,280ft), is the only pier which is grade two listed, meaning any future owners would require Listed Building Consent to make changes to the structure. Blackpool Central Pier, which stands at 341 metres long (1,118ft), and Blackpool South Pier, which is 150 metres long (492ft), do not benefit from listed status, despite opening in 1864 and 1892 respectively. But Richard Baldwin, a director at Bilfinger GVA, who are selling the piers for Cuerden Leisure, said it would be very unlikely that a new owner would make significant changes. He said: 'In order to sustain their value and ensure that value appreciated, they would not change dramatically under new ownership. 'In our opinion, the value is in the existing use and this is unlikely to change at either of the Blackpool piers.' The Victorian piers, which were constructed using cast iron piles, steel frames and wooden decking, all boast amusement arcades and rides and generate a collective income of around £1.6 million a year for Cuerden Leisure through annual concession agreements. Grade two listed: Llandudno Pier is also on sale - and altogether they can be bought for £12.6million . St John Stott, director at Cuerden Leisure - which also owns Eastbourne Pier - said the group was selling three of the four piers as it was 'restructuring its assets'. He said: 'These assets are jewels in the crown of the UK's coastline and we are delighted to offer them to the market either as separate lots or collectively.' Mr Baldwin added: 'Each of these piers are truly iconic structures, having been popular visitor attractions in two of the UK's best known resorts for over a century. 'Each pier is being offered for sale freehold, subject to the various concession agreements in place. 'As profitable attractions, we're confident this sale will attract major interest.' A spokesman for the National Piers Society, which promotes the preservation and continued enjoyment of seaside piers in the UK, said: 'These piers are all in good order and trading successfully, and, given that Easter is almost upon us, I have no doubt that they will quickly find a buyer or buyers.'","Famous 341 metre landmark is being sold along with Blackpool South Pier .

"Glee star Harry Shum Jr.has been showing off some riveting new dance moves – which he performed while on a moving treadmill – in a post on his Facebook page. The talented 32-year-old made working out seem effortless as he danced along to Michael Jackson's Love Never Felt So Good. Harry, who is best known for his role as Mike Chang on the television show Glee, performs a variety of complex dance moves during the routine, including a number of moon walk-style steps which are reminiscent of the moves once favored by the late singer. Scroll down for video... Gleeful: Harry Shum's workout lasted for almost five minutes as he performed to Michael Jackson's Love Never Felt So Good . Working out: The video will delight fans of Glee who are feeling glum at the show's finale . Harry, who appeared on Glee from the very first season, before seeing his character role reduced in recent the more recent episodes, often showcased his impressive dance skills on the show. In this particular video, which was filmed last year in the gym at his Atlanta apartment, Harry manages to perform for a full five minutes, completing a variety of intricate moves and, at times, using the treadmill as a prop to showcase his skills. Treadmill dancing began making a comeback earlier this year after choreographer Carson Dean posted his moves to Bruno Mars' Uptown Funk earlier this month. Shum's upbeat Facebook post comes after his former co-stars paid an emotional farewell to Glee last week. Getting down: After appearing in Glee since it began, Harry has been starring in digital series Caper and is in the next Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon movie . Copycat: Harry managed to pull off some of the late Michael Jackson's signature moves, although it was the treadmill that was helping him moonwalk! Although Shum wasn't in last week's finale, it is the end of an era for a program which had become part of popular culture while addressing issues of teen pregnancy, sexuality, suicide, bullying and also showed the first transgender character's transition on network television. Glee leaves behind a remarkable legacy. It dared to try something that had seldom if ever succeeded in television history, blending episodic narrative with musical production numbers. The serie did something else few would have thought possible: It helped make glee clubs cool while it promoted arts programs in schools. And it served as a platform for new talent, launching such stars as Lea Michele (Rachel) while giving wide exposure to veterans like Matthew Morrison (Will) and Jane Lynch (Sue), with guest appearances by a broad range of celebrities that included Helen Mirren, Lindsey Lohan and Ricky Martin. Pop music - both new and well-established - reached new audiences, both on the show and through sales of more than 50 million songs and 13 million albums under the Glee signature. Fans of show are excited to see what their much-loved starts go on to do next.

"A woman accusing  NFL player Warren Sapp of assault in his hotel room the night after the Super Bowl has denied prostitution. Britney Osbourne, 23, claims the former defensive tackle picked her up at a bar, demanded a strip tease by throwing money at her in his hotel room, then pushed her to the ground when she protested. Pleading not guilty to prostitution, she denies Sapp's claim that she was paid $300 for her to perform sex acts on him on February 2 in the Renaissance Hotel of Phoenix, Arizona, TMZ reported. If guilty Osbourne, who has previously been arrested for prostitution, faces time in jail. Scroll down for video . Denial: Britney Osbourne, 23, denies prostitution and claims she was assaulted by Warren Sapp last month . Former NFL player Sapp (left) also claims he paid Quying Boyd (right) $300 to perform sex acts on him in his hotel room after the Super Bowl on February 2. Boyd has pleaded not guilty to escorting without a license . The other woman detained in connection with the incident is 34-year-old Quying Boyd, who has been charged with not having a license to escort. Boyd, who has also pleaded not guilty according to TMZ, was arrested in 2014 in Manhattan for allegedly luring rich male clients to steal thousands of dollars at a time. She was released without charge. She denies performing sex acts on Sapp for money. Sapp, 42, attempted to strengthen his story by showing police officers video of the women performing sex acts on him, the New York Post reported last month. He is charged with assault and soliciting prostitution, for which he faces six months in jail. Sapp said that one of the women demanded more money and both women started screaming at him when he said no. 'He told her several times that she needed to leave, but she was irate,' says a police report. Career: Sapp played 13 NFL seasons, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers then with the Oakland Raiders . The incident allegedly took place in the early hours of February 2 at Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix . 'At one point, she used Warren’s phone to call security to his room.' During the argument Sapp allegedly tossed one of the woman out of his room, knocking the other woman down. Sapp was fired by the NFL Network after the story broke last month. Sapp, a member of the Football Hall of Fame, was in town covering the big game for NFL Network. Sapp's biography has since been pulled from NFL Network's On-Air Talent list on its website. The football analyst was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution and assault. He has since been released from custody without bail after a judge ruled that he was not a flight risk. According to reporting by AZ Central, police were called to Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix at around 2.30am Monday after the incident in response to a noise complaint. A woman told officers that she and another woman were working as escorts and an argument over money in Sapp's room turned physical and spilled into the hallway. Sapp admitted to investigators he had paid one of the women for sex but he denied any assault. Investigators said both escorts sustained minor injuries consistent with a struggle. The women involved in the incident were cited by police and later released. Warren Sapp has been in trouble with the law several times in recent years. In 2010, he was arrested on a domestic battery charge, which was later dropped. The 42-year-old Hall of Famer was covering the game for NFL Network. He has been suspended without pay . Light on his feet: Sapp was the runner up on season 7 of Dancing With The Stars . As recently as last June, the 42-year-old football analyst and one-time contestant on Dancing With The Stars was picked up on a separate domestic battery charge in a Miami hotel. Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders. He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. In recent years, Sapp, a divorced father of two, has been struggling with financial problems, which culminated in 2012 when he filed for bankruptcy listing $6.7million in debt, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid child support, property and IRS taxes. In November of that year, the Super Bowl champion was forced to sell his palatial home in Florida for $2.1 million. Months earlier, Sapp auctioned off a 240-pair collection of rare Air Jordan sneakers worth $6,500 to pay his creditors.","Warren Sapp allegedly threw money at two women then pushed them over when they objected in his hotel room after Phoenix, Arizona, Super Bowl .
