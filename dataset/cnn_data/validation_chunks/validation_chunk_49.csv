"At least one lab employee has tested positive for a deadly bacteria used to make bioweapons that mysteriously escaped a Louisiana research center in November. Additionally, the number of monkey's infected by the bioterror bacterium at the Tulane Prime Research Center has increased from eight to nine and are expected to continue rising, officials say. Three of the monkeys have already been euthanized after showing signs of Burkholderia pseudomallei, which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre facility. The test results showed the employee was 'just at the threshold for a verified positive result' and has not shown any symptoms of the diseases the bacteria can bring on, such as tuberculosis, according to NOLA.com. Despite thorough investigations by bothb federal and state authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the cause of the contamination is still unknown. Concerns: Monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened . Reach: Worryingly, the center is close to a river (top left), homes and a school. Although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria, further tests are required . The name of the employee has not been released. Questions also remain over how far the bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has spread around the complex and surrounding areas. Animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas. The bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure, but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals, according to USA Today. The monkeys, rhesus macaques, had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages, where around 4,000 macaques are kept. It is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages. Worryingly, the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes. And only yards behind the facility, there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges. The contaminated primates were all at the center's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall, leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there. Infected: At least seven rhesus macaques (file picture) have shown signs of exposure and three have died . Potentially deadly: Burkholderia pseudomallei . The bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever, headache, appetite loss, muscle and joint pain. The illness may not develop for days to years. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis, and if left untreated, it is fatal. Several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. The bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has never been found in nature in the U.S. Last week, tests by the CDC determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria, bring the number of infected monkeys to seven. The CDC will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital, the agency said. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, previously told USA Today that the release was worrying. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he said. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. 'The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' State officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners, veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed. Authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area, suggesting there was no public health risk.","At least nine rhesus macaques at Tulane National Primate Research Center were exposed to Burkholderia pseudomallei, a deadly bacteria .

"A Manchester United footballer offered a student £10,000 for a threesome with a team-mate. Brazil star Andreas Pereira had asked Kelly McKinney for sex in a  text and then suggested that his first team friend Paddy McNair join them. In a series of lewd messages Pereira said they would pay her £5,000 each, 'if u do it well', but Miss McKinney was disgusted and refused. Cash deal: Brazil star Andreas Pereira met Kelly McKinney, right, at the Manchester United Christmas party, left, and then offered to pay her £10,000 for a threesome with a friend . Messages: These texts show how Pereira said he and first team friend Paddy McNair would pay £5,000 each for sex . She told The Sun: 'I nearly fell off my chair when he offered me £10,000 for a threesome. What kind of low-life does that? I'm not that kind of person at all and found it very, very insulting. 'He's clearly desperate and struggling to find anyone that he doesn't have to pay for a sex'. There is no evidence that Mr McNair knew of, or was involved in sending the messages from Pereira's phone. Miss McKinney said she met Pereira at the Manchester United Christmas party and was invited to the VIP area to drink with the other players. She described Pereira and McNair as being like 'naughty schoolboys' and said later the footballer tracked her down on Twitter and they then exchanged numbers. But the messages soon turned towards sex and he asked: 'U want to do something next week me u and paddy?' She then asked what he meant and he replied: 'Threesome. Will take care of u. U want? How much. Tell me. We were ready to pay 5each.' After she refused he then texted again to say he and Paddy McNair wanted to meet her for sex and she asked: 'Just you?' and he replies: '1 friend'. Friends: Pereira said that his team-mate Paddy McNair, right, was keen to meet Miss McKinney for sex but there is no evidence Mr McNair was involved in sending the messages . Born in Belgium, Pereira has represented Brazil at U20 level and plays regularly for United U21s but is struggling to make an impression on Louis Van Gaal who is well stocked in that position. Pereira made his debut for United's first team, coming on as a substitute in their 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat to MK Dons early this season . The 19-year-old is unlikely to sign a new contract at Old Trafford and is poised to leave in the summer - and may now me in trouble with the club's manager Louis van Gaal.

Video footage shows emergency workers swimming out to Cooper the Goldendoodle as he sits shivering  on a sheet of ice on the Charles River in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is then grabbed by his collar and hauled back to shore in a sleigh before being wrapped up warm in a blanket. At the end of the clip Cooper's owner, Jared Bartels, is seen bounding up to give the eight-year-old pooch a big hug. 'Thank you, guys, I appreciate it,' the father-of-three tells the animal's rescuers. The recovery mission took place on Sunday morning with temperatures around freezing.

"How did iron become scattered throughout Earth's 2,000-mile (3,200km) thick mantle more than four billion years ago? That's a question that has puzzled scientists, with most thinking asteroid impacts were the cause, but now a new theory has been presented - iron rain. By re-analysing the vapourisation point of iron, a study has determined that conditions on early Earth would have caused iron to rain down on the ground. Scientists in New Mexico have a new theory for the origin of Earth's iron. Research suggests iron would have turned into vapour when meteorites hit the young Earth, as shown in the artist's impression above. The vapour would then have drifted up in plumes, condensed and then rained down on the surface of our planet . The research was conducted with the Z machine at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The machine is the most powerful producer of pulses of electrical energy on Earth. By studying the shock pressure required to vapourise iron, they found the value was 40 per cent less than previously thought. Astrophysicists say this lower pressure - 507 gigapascals (GPa) compared to 887 GPa - was easily achieved during the latter stages of Earth's formation. 'Because planetary scientists always thought it was difficult to vapourise iron, they never thought of vapourisation as an important process during the formation of Earth and its core,' said principal investigator Dr Rick Kraus. The researchers created a target - consisting of an iron plate 0.008in (5mm) square and 200 microns thick - against which they launched aluminum flyer plates travelling up to 16 miles (25km) per second. At this impact pressure, the powerful shock waves created in the iron cause it to compress, heat up and vapourise. The results showed that the vapourisation threshold for iron is 40 per cent lower than previously thought. 'But with our experiments, we showed that it's very easy to impact-vapourise iron.' The result of this would have been that a solid piece of iron, after impacting Earth perhaps as part of an asteroid, would disperse into an iron vapour due to the force of the impact. Earth is thought to have been pummelled by asteroids during the Late Heavy Bombardment period, 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago. Forming clouds across the surface, the vapour would then rain down onto the ground and mix with the mantle, which was molten at the time. 'This changes the way we think of planet formation, in that instead of core formation occurring by iron sinking down to the growing Earth's core in large blobs (technically called diapirs), that iron was vapourised, spread out in a plume over the surface of Earth and rained out as small droplets,' said Dr Kraus. 'The small iron droplets mixed easily with the mantle, which changes our interpretation of the geochemical data we use to date the timing of Earth's core formation.' The research, which found iron vapourised at values 40 per cent lower than thought, was conducted with the  Z machine (pictured) at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The machine is the most powerful producer of pulses of electrical energy on Earth . In previous theories, it was thought that iron arrived from collisions between Earth and planetesimals - rocks ranging in size from several metres to hundreds of kilometres in diameters. This would have happened in Earth's late formative stages more than four billion years ago, with the iron being sent bullet-like into the region between the core and crust - the mantle. But if that were true, then the moon would also have similar amounts of iron in its mantle, as it underwent the same bombardment - but this does not appear to be the case. This led the scientists to their new conclusion - and they add that the moon's gravity would have been too weak for it to have held onto iron rain-bearing vapour, like Earth. This accounts for the lack of iron seen scattered in the moon's mantle. According to the scientists, the moon's gravity would have been too weak for it to have held onto iron rain-bearing vapour, like Earth, during the Late Heavy Bombardment period (artist's impression of moon shown).

"Relatives of those killed on the Germanwings flight have been offered up to £40,000 from Lufthansa immediately, amid speculation they could receive multi-million pound compensation settlements eventually. The German airline, which owns the budget carrier, offered to pay up to 50,000 euros per passenger, for immediate financial assistance. However, the relatives could receive multi-million pound compensation settlements if they can prove that Lufthansa knew about the co-pilot's mental health difficulties. Sicknotes found at Andreas Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf by German police could form a key part of any legal case launched by the families. Legal experts claim that the level of awareness the passengers had in advance of the crash would also influence any compensation payments. Scroll down for video . German president Joachim Gauck, left, joined relatives at a public mourning service in Haltern . Friends of 16 students killed in Tuesday's disaster hugged each other outside the emotional memorial service . Andreas Lubitz, pictured, is believed to have hidden a mental health illness from his employers . German newspaper Bild reported that Lufthansa's Aeromedical Centre has passed internal documents to investigating authorities which claimed that Lubitz suffered from depression and anxiety during training and went through a 'serious depressive episode'. Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, has so far refused to comment on whether they had any concerns over Lubitz's mental health. Ordinarily, the families of air disasters are entitled to a maximum of around £100,000 under international agreements. But if a family decides to sue, this figure could rise dramatically depending on the degree of negligence by the airline and the level of awareness their loved ones would have had on their impending doom. As well as looking at Lubitz, lawyers for the families could question the airline's policy of not requiring at least two crew on the flight deck at all times once the aircraft is airborne. Relatives of some of Tuesday's victims have reacted angrily to the discovery of the torn up sick note and questions over Lubitz's mental health. Lufthansa's Chief Executive Carsten Spohr refused to respond to questions about Lubitz's mental health . Christian Driessens, whose 59-year-old brother, Claude, died in the crash said: 'When you first learn that, you don’t believe it, we try to tell ourselves that it’s not possible. 'Looking back, I slowly start to be angry. I don’t understand how a serious company can let a depressed man pilot a plane. ‘Because the boy was depressed, it was necessary to say he was. On this point I am opposed to the company not having introduced rules saying there must always be two people in the cockpit. ‘I’ve fallen over backwards. It’s not normal to leave somebody by himself in charge, and who shuts the doors, I’m very angry.' Passengers would have been soon aware of captain Patrick Sonderheimer's attempts to break into his own cockpit after Lubitz deliberately locked him outside. Lubitz enabled a post-911 safety system designed to stop hijacking to bolt the cockpit door shut. Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr admitted yesterday that Lubitz had broken off his training in 2008 for several months, however, he refused to elaborate on the details. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, second right, said the airline should release all information on Lubitz . The latest revelations come as air crash investigators continue to search for the second 'black box' French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the airline must hand over all information they have on Lubitz to investigators. Mr Valls held a crisis meeting this morning where Tuesday's disaster was the main item on the agenda. He told iTELE: 'We must wait for the end of the inquiry. I am careful when there is a judicial inquiry, but everything points to a criminal, mad, suicidal action that we cannot comprehend. 'It is up to this company to provide a maximum of information so that we can understand why this pilot committed this dreadful act.' Air crash investigators confirmed that Lubitz, 28, programmed the Airbus A-320's autopilot to descend from 38,000 to just 100 feet, while the aircraft crossing the French coast towards the Alps, after his captain Patrick Sonderheimer left the flight deck to go to the toilet. However, French pilots' union SNPL said it is suing prosecutors who leaked information on ongoing developments in the case to the press. Pilots fear that they will lose the public's confidence after it emerged that Lubitz deliberately flew into a mountain. Hundreds of students from the Joseph-Koenig Gymnasium school arrived at a memorials service today . Guillaume Schmid of France's SNPL union told The Associated Press on Friday that the lawsuit is over violating a French law on keeping information about investigations secret while they are ongoing. The lawsuit doesn't name an alleged perpetrator, a method in French law that leaves investigators to determine who is at fault. Mr Schmid said: 'We can understand there is a certain pressure, a wish to know.' He warned that leaking information too early can mislead the public instead of informing accurately. European Cockpit Association also expressed concern about the leaks and urged further investigation before drawing final conclusions. In a statement, the ECA said: 'Our thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. As trusted professionals, who invest a lifelong career in making air travel safe, this is a very difficult day for us.' Relatives of the victims have been all asked to give DNA samples in an effort to identify their loved ones who died in the crash. Lubitz, from Montabaur in western Germany learned to fly gliders in his teens before starting work with Germanwings in September 2013. Klaus Radke, head of the flying club said: 'I got to know him, or I should say reacquainted with him, as a very nice, fun and polite young man.' However, one friend said he used to go to movies and clubs together, but had noticed a considerable change over the past twelve months. The friend said: 'Flying was his life. He always used to be a quiet companion, but in the last year that got worse.' Randy Knipping, a Toronto-based specialist in aviation medicine, said it was extremely difficult to conduct screening for psychiatric problems among pilots, in part because they can put their careers in jeopardy by admitting to such problems. He said: 'If somebody wants to withhold or conceal, there's no reasonable test.' Mr Knipping said unless a family member comes forward and reports their concerns, then it is possible for cases such as Lubitz to 'slip through'. Meanwhile, the grieving family and friends of the 150 people on board Germanwings Flight 9525 when it crashed leaving no survivors on Tuesday have placed touching tributes to their loved ones at a memorial. Photographs, flowers and candles have been left at the new monument, installed by French authorities in front the mountain where the plane crashed in Le Vernet to honour the victims. Special flights had been laid on for the next of kin to allow them to visit the crash site in the French Alps. Tributes have been left at a new monument, in front the mountain where the plane crashed in Le Vernet . French authorities have already installed a large memorial stone at the site of the disaster . Relatives placed candles featuring photographs of some of the victims at the scene of the crash . Others put simple passport-style photographs on white roses in a moving tribute . The plane was carrying six crew and 144 passengers, including 16 German teenagers returning home from a school trip, who had reportedly won the trip in a lottery of their classmates. It was the deadliest air crash on the French mainland since 1974 when a Turkish Airlines plane crashed, killing 346 people. Lufthansa said the aircraft was carrying citizens of 18 countries. Three Americans and three Britons were confirmed among the victims. They included Julian Pracz-Bandres, from Manchester, who was just seven months old, was flying back from Spain with his mother, Marina Bandres, when the disaster unfolded.

French prosecutors revealed that the chilling screams of passengers could be heard just seconds before the doomed flight smashed into a mountain, . Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'. Family members Germanwings plane crash victims, pictured leaving Barcelona's El Prat airport to visit the crash site in southern France . Lufthansa, the owner of budget airline Germanwings, put on two special flights and a bus to transport families of the victims, escorted by French motorcycle policemen, to Seyne-les-Alpes . In a ceremony believed to be for relatives of the deceased of the crashed Germanwings flight emergency workers hold flags of the nations of those who died . Mr Brice said that earlier in the flight Lubitz's responses, initially courteous, became 'curt' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane. 'There is no distress signal or Mayday signal. No answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower.' Lubitz had just 600 hours of flying experience after joining Germanwings in 2013 straight from training. He was, however, highly regarded, having won an award from the Federal Aviation Administration in 2013 for his outstanding flying skills. The investigation is now a full-blown criminal inquiry. Recordings from the flight's black box revealed that the plane had been deliberately crashed on Tuesday, killing all 150 passengers and crew members . Pilot Andreas Lubitz apparently took the controls of the Airbus A320, locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately set it veering down from cruising altitude at 3,000 feet per minute . French gendarmes and investigators are continuing to work amongst the debris of the Airbus A320 at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes .

"A radical extension of Margaret Thatcher’s flagship housing policy is set to be included in the Conservative manifesto as Tories bid to woo working-class voters. The Right to Buy would be extended to up to 2.5million housing-association tenants, transforming the lives of many. The reform, backed by senior Conservatives including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson and David Davis, is expected to be included in a ‘big doorstep offer’ on housing from the Tories. Scroll down for video . The Conservatives are set to include Margaret Thatcher's flagship housing policy in the party manifesto in a bid to woo working-class voters. Pictured, Mrs Thatcher at the Conservative Party Conference in 1989 . The party is also considering plans to force councils to sell large, expensive council homes in order to fund higher numbers of cheaper properties. A Number Ten source said: ‘The Prime Minister has been a big supporter of Right to Buy, so that more people can own a home of their own. But our manifesto will be announced nearer the election.’ Enabling housing-association tenants to buy their homes would likely require major changes to the 1996 Housing Act, forcing associations to sell properties at discounts set by government. The Coalition has increased Right to Buy discounts, meaning more council homes are already moving to the private sector. Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured left) is a big supporter of Right to Buy, a Downing Street source said, and the reform is backed by senior Conservatives, including the Mayor of London Boris Johnson (right) But housing associations have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing. They are autonomous, not-for-profit bodies that provide low-cost homes using public money and loans from the private sector. Right to Buy, introduced in 1980, led to more than 1.5million council homes being sold at discounted rates. Senior Tories believe a ‘right to own’ would attract more ‘C2 voters’ – the skilled working classes that helped deliver Lady Thatcher’s election victories. It would promote home ownership as well as drastically reducing the housing benefit bill. At the moment, taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower paid workers who live in properties provided by housing associations. Current Right to Buy rules let most council tenants buy their homes at a discount. But housing-association tenants have limited discounts and can only buy a property acquired by an association since 1997. Britain's Secretary for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith set up a think-thank in opposition to rules limiting the discounts housing association tenants can receive under the Right to Buy scheme . The Centre for Social Justice, the think-tank set up by Mr Duncan Smith in opposition, has suggested housing-association tenants should be offered discounts of up to 30 per cent of a property’s value. Tory policymakers are said to be keen to ensure money raised from property sales is ploughed into more social housebuilding, which would be spread out rather than concentrated on estates. A criticism of the original scheme was that it undermined the number of social houses available.","The reform is expected to be included in a ‘big doorstep offer’ on housing .

"A gang that allegedly specialized in organized, armed and violent crime that were often referred to as 'Joloperros' - Spanish for 'stick-up guys' - will finally go to trial this summer for their role in the elaborate kidnapping and assault of two men in Boston. The FBI says the 'Veloz Crew' - headed by Danny Veloz, who is known as 'The Maestro' - went to elaborate lengths to kidnap a man they believed to be a major dealer of homemade Percocet pills, which deliver a heroin-like high. The plot was one of many underground kidnappings that police say targeted dealers in order to obtain large ransoms of cash or drugs, believing that going after criminals reduced the risk of involving authorities. The Joloperros tagged the victim's car with a GPS tracker and monitored his movements for months on a big-screen TV inside Veloz's house,The Boston Herald reported. Scroll down for video . Elaborate plot: The FBI says the 'Veloz Crew', headed by Danny Veloz  (left), planned the July 2012 kidnapping for weeks, targeting a man they believed was a major dealer in homemade Percocet and pretending to police and wearing skeleton masks when they abducted the victim . 'Kidnap bag': The gang would pose as police, or use skeleton masks to disguise themselves, before swiping their targets off the street, sometimes in broad daylight . The tracking device would call Veloz's cellphone once the target's car started moving. On July 12, 2012, they were ready to pounce. The gang had a kidnap bag full of police shirts, skeleton masks and guns. According to The Herald, Jose Guzman, Henry Maldonado, Thomas Wallace, Luis Reynoso, and Gadiel Romero all suited up and got into  a white Toyota minivan. Veloz, the leader, was on the phone to Guzman from another location. As the victim pulled into his driveway about 7 p.m., the abductors pulled in behind and came out with guns. Both the target and the man he was with were abducted. The target was hit in the head with a handgun, causing 'blood to spray throughout the van,' according to an affidavit. The two were taken to Maldonado’s apartment in Manchester, N.H., where the crew demanded payment. The target victim refused to cooperate, and was beaten and burned with a hot iron, the affidavit said. He suffered several burn injuries. Scene: The tracking devices would call Veloz's cell phone once the cars started moving, and The Maestro would track the cars from a television in the living room of his Lawrence home (pictured) However the victim was lucky enough to escape through a bathroom window and found his way to a neighbor's house for help. Police descended on the property arrested three suspects who were leaving the premises. Another suspect was found hiding, according to Fox 25. Inside the alleged kidnapper's apartment, authorities found their tools of the trade: police gear, a mask and guns. Four irons were also seized, one of which ""appeared to have human flesh on it,"" records show. Police in Boston have been focusing on this case and others like for over two years. Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera told The Herald: 'Today we are adding more police officers and we’re making this place inhospitable for those guys to do business here. ... We have to fight the crime that we have every day, but in order to ensure that this doesn’t ever happen again, we have to create an environment where every family feels safe by putting enough police officers on the street.'","Specialty gang known as 'Joloperros' - Spanish for 'stick-up guys'

"This is the moment a three-time Rubik's Cube world champion pushes his skills to the limit as he races against the clock in shark-infested waters. Kevin Hays, 20, from Renton, Washington, took to the shores of Honolulu, Hawaii, for a spot of puzzle solving while cage diving. Footage shows him submerged underwater, wearing a snorkel mask, quickly shifting the multi-colored squares of a 3 x 3 cube around. He told Daily Mail Online that he held his breathe for the duration instead of using an oxygen tank. Caught on camera: This is the moment a three-time Rubik's Cube world champion pushes his skills to the limit as he races against the clock in shark-infested waters . Novel idea: Kevin Hays, 20, from Renton, Washington, took to the shores off Honolulu, Hawaii, for a spot of puzzle solving while cage diving . In the video, it appears that Hays' nerves got the better of him the first time around. As a shark swims behind him, he swiftly stops what he's doing and watches the sharp-toothed animal glide by. The maths whizz then gears up for a second attempt. This time he has no problem completing the puzzle. In just 15 seconds the Rubik's Cube is pieced back together and Hays happily shows it to the camera. He then goes up for air. Hays said that along with the sharks, the ocean's current added an element of difficulty. Quick fingers: Footage shows Hayes submerged underwater wearing a snorkel mask quickly shifting the multi-colored squares of a 3 x 3 cube around . Up for air: He told Daily Mail Online that he held his breathe for the duration instead of using an oxygen tank . 'The shark tank was really rocky since the waves were pushing it around a ton, so that made it pretty hard to do the solves.' It's not the first time Hays has solved a Rubik's Cube underwater. Last year he completed three puzzles - a 2x2, a 3x3 and a 4x4 - in one minute. However, he stuck to the safety of a swimming pool on that occasion. As a result of his endeavors, he went on to earn the nickname: 'Genius fish human.' Hays started puzzle solving as a high school freshman and, at one point, trained up to three hours a day. Record-breaker: Hays started puzzle solving at high school  and, at one point, trained three hours a day . Well-earned: Now in his final year of a math and computer science degree at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, Hays plans on taking a break from speed-solving after the summer . He is currently the world champion in the 5x5, 6x6 and 7x7 Rubik's Cubes and has smashed 11 world records. Now in his final year of a math and computer science degree at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, Hays plans on taking a break from speed-solving after the summer. However, before his hiatus he will participate in a number of contests including championships in Tennessee, South Carolina and Brazil. Offering tips to other Rubik's Cube enthusiasts, Hays previously said: 'It’s not as much math as you might think. 'It’s more pattern recognition and muscle memory execution. 'You need the kind of mind that can see something and then immediately associate it with what you have to do.'","Kevin Hays, 20, from Renton, Washington, took to the shores of Hawaii .

"A simple wooden bottle that can 'age' cheap booze in less than a day, could make humble plonk taste like vintage wine, inventors claim. While expensive vintages develop their flavour over years in oak barrels, the makers of the Oak Bottle promise their gadget will replicate the ageing process in just 24 hours. It means drinks lovers could  enjoy the oaky flavours of premium tipples without having to fork out the high prices they demand. Scroll down for video . The Oak Bottle can turn cheap booze into fine wine with a vintage oak taste, its makers claim . All users need to do is pour their favourite wines in the bottle, which is made of sustainably sourced American oak, and then leave it for up to two days to take on the flavour of the receptacle. The bottle, which costs $79.99 (£50) from oakbottle.com, can also be used to improve the flavours of brandies, bourbons and even tequila. It's the brainchild of Canadian entrepreneur Joel Paglione, who came up with the idea after growing up on his parent's vineyard. Mr Paglione, 30, who now lives in Chicago, spent three years developing the Oak Bottle, which he says is the world's smallest and fastest way to infuse drinks with oak. Eight other versions which are flavoured with the likes of cherry, vanilla, maple and coffee are also available. He said: 'The Oak Bottle is a revolutionary device that makes cheap wine or spirits taste like an expensive vintage in just 24 to 48 hours. The Oak Bottle can also mellow the flavour of whisky, brandy and even tequila . 'What took months or years in oak barrels before takes just days now with Oak Bottle. 'My family has a vineyard and winery in Canada so I grew up in the wine making industry. 'Once I was old enough to help, I asked why we spend so much time filling small barrels of wine for oak ageing versus pouring it all into a giant barrel like we do the fermentation tanks. 'The answer, my father told me, was the smaller the oak barrel we use the faster the oak infusion and the faster we can achieve the desired oak tannin we are looking for in our wine.' The best wines spend years ageing in oak barrels . He then spent three years developing the Oak Bottle, which he claims is the 'smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made'. Mr Paglione explained: 'It's all about the perfect amount of interaction with oxygen available for the liquid to ""breathe"" through the wood, and the perfect mount of oak contact of the liquid inside.' He said the most popular wines for oak bottle ageing are Chardonnay, Cabernet and Merlot. 'In just 48 hours an unoaked Chardonnay will taste like an expensive oaked Chardonnay vintage that has been aged in oak barrels for years,' he claimed. 'Whiskies, bourbons and brandy are also great for ageing with the Oak Bottle. He also thinks the bottle is good news for whisky makers as this will speed up the process. He said: 'Allowing people who perhaps could not afford a 20-year aged whiskey or that ten-year old wine vintage the ability to enjoy it but at a fraction of the time and cost. 'We are not saying that the Oak Bottle will make a boxed wine into a £50 bottle, but it can make an average wine much better and less insulting to your taste buds.' Despite just being launched, the Oak Bottle has already been given the thumbs up by top chefs including American TV personality Elizabeth Karmel. Miss Karmel, the star of US cooking show Iron Chef, carried out her own independent test of the Oak Bottle on tequila. She said: 'It is remarkable how this toasted Oak Bottle made by coopers has transformed the raw blanco tequila. 'The proof is in the tasting. It is layered with complexity - round, sweet and predictably oaky. I'd say that the experiment was a success.'","Wooden bottle can improve the taste of cheap wine in up to two days .

"In addition to the human remains uncovered along an Alaska trail near the home of a family of four who vanished a year ago, police revealed Monday that a handgun and a dog were uncovered at the site as well. Police in the town of Kenai, population 7,100, say the dog's description matches that of the missing family's springer spaniel. They also say the recovered gun likely came from their home less than two miles from the shallow mass grave. Brandon Jividen, 38, his girlfriend Rebecca Adams, 23, her two children Michelle, 6, and three-year-old Jarraca and their dog Sparks had not been seen for 10 months, prompting massive police searches with help from the FBI. Police said they believe the gun came from the family home based on a serial number match.

Their bodies were discovered along with the family dog's in a pit a few miles from their Alaska home . Family dog: The family was found dead after nearly a year with the remains of their springer spaniel Sparks . So who did it? Along with the family and the dog, police found a handgun registered to the family. They said there was no indication they were moved to the mass grave where they were found and that no outside party was suspected in the slayings . Kenai police Lt. Dave Ross said Monday the bodies haven't been identified by a coroner, but police have every indication it's the missing family. 'The clothes, the remains, the handgun all appear to match the missing family,' Ross told KTUU. Ross provided few other details, saying the investigation remains open, however he hinted that the gruesome fates met by the family members may have been at the hand of one of their own. He said there's no reason to believe another person was involved in the deaths or that the bodies were moved. 'We don't have any reason to believe from what we've collected that they were transported there,' Ross said. Died at the site? Responding officers found remains and items reported missing from the home of Brandon Jividen, 38, and girlfriend Rebecca Adams, 23. Adams two daughters were found as well. Police say their is no indication the family was moved to the pit where they were found . Clothes and human remains were found on the trail near their home, pictured, that may finally reveal what happened after the family vanished from their home . A map showing exactly where he remains and items of clothing were found on a trail near to the family home . The grim discovery came after a person driving down a west Kenai trail on Saturday spotted items, which were reported missing from Miss Adams and Mr Jividen's home. FBI officials are travelling to the area to help with the investigation. Police added that it would take time to positively identify the remains and to complete the investigation. The family, along with their pet dog, were last seen on May 27 last year with relatives saying it appeared that they had left their home without packing. Their two vehicles remained parked outside their apartment and their rent for June had not been paid.

Miss Adams sister, Lanell Adams said that the young mother had been 'very distressed' during a phone call in the week before she went missing. Miss Adams who travelled to Alaska from Washington State to look for her sister, said: 'She sounded very distressed. She just told me: 'Know that I love you' and that she had to get off the phone very quickly. Investigators begin to comb the woods close to where the remains were found. On Saturday, a person driving down a west Kenai trail spotted clothing and what appeared to be human remains . The family's disappearance last May prompted massive searches led by Kenai police with help from the FBI . 'Growing up we always had this thing, we say 'Thou shall not lie'' and you always have to tell the truth. 'I asked her, ''Thou shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?'' She said, ''Don't ask me that right now. Just know that I love you.'' Meanwhile her uncle Dennis Giffords told the Alaska Dispatch News: 'You have a shred of hope that they will be found. And that shred has been taken away.' Kenai is a city of 7,100 about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage at the mouth of the Kenai River, Alaska's most popular sport fishing attraction.

"The scene in the Gibraltar apartment where a British father was stabbed to death alongside his partner and two young daughters in a suspected murder-suicide was so horrific that the police officers who found their bodies have been offered counselling. A 31-year-old man, who is reportedly from Liverpool, and his 37-year-old Spanish girlfriend were found dead yesterday morning, alongside a four-year-old Spanish girl and a six-week-old baby. It is understood that all four were found with stab wounds, while the woman and the girls reportedly had their necks slashed. Now a police officer working on the investigation has revealed he expects the majority of the team who found their bodies to accept the offer of counselling because the seen 'was that disturbing'. Scroll down for video . Guard: A police officers is  this morning seen standing outside the building where the family were found dead . Tribute: Flowers, messages, photographs and a teddy bear have all been left outside the bulding . Acting superintendent Wayne Tunbridge (right) confirmed that all the officers who attended the scene have been offered counselling, with a large number opting to take it - including himself . Acting superintendent Wayne Tunbridge, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We are not looking for anyone outside of the family at this stage  but we have numerous lines of enquiry. 'We are in communication with the family members of the four deceased who now must come to Gibraltar before we release any details about the individuals. 'We have welfare officers helping the officers who have been to the scene. We are offering every officer counselling and any support they require. 'We have had many take up this offer including myself.' Speaking about the progress of the case, he added: 'The four deceased are a family unit and they are connected, but I can't tell you anymore than that. 'We had to move the children because of the warm conditions, I took that decision, they are now at St Bernard's hospital. 'In a case of this magnitude we have to assume the worst. We are working with the UK and Spain on this and they have both been extremely helpful.' Police on the British enclave say they are not currently looking for any suspects in connection with the deaths. The family, who have been identified by police but will not be named until next of kin have been informed, were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am yesterday. Spanish media reported that they had been living in Spain and had only arrived in Gibraltar a few days earlier. Police confirmed the man was of British nationality while the women had Spanish nationality but was originally from Cuba. No entry: A Gibraltar police officer stands guard outside the murder scene earlier this morning . Police officers begin investigations in Gibraltar after a British man, his Spanish partner and two young girls, including a six-week-old baby, were found stabbed to death inside a flat in an apparent murder-suicide . Local newspapers reported that the man was from Liverpool and that the four-year-old girl was the woman's daughter from a previous relationship, while the baby girl had been born in Spain. Police were called to the scene at 11am after a member of the company which owns the property went to the flat. The person did not get any response from knocking on the door but noticed that the property was locked from the inside, police said. Spanish newspaper El Mundo quoted police sources saying the door to the flat had not been forced and the three females all had cuts to their necks. A major police investigation has now been launched and detectives and forensic officers are working in the flat while the area remains cordoned off. A nearby restaurant owner said: 'We have all been told not to say anything. There was a real panic around the streets when the news broke with lots of policemen.' 'This is Gibraltar, where nothing like this normally happens so we are all looking out for each other at this horrible time,' he added. Police on the British enclave say they are not currently looking for suspects in connection with the deaths . A major police investigation has been launched and detectives and forensic officers are working in the flat while the area remains cordoned off (pictured) A policeman told The Olive Press that when they went in there and found the bodies, the kitchen light was still on. A male neighbour added: 'They moved in three or four days ago. I was out this morning but when I got back there were police officers everywhere with plain-clothed officers going in and out of the house all day and some officers came and spoke to me but I had nothing to say.' 'It´s such a shock, it´s almost unthinkable.' A high level Gibraltar government source insisted the family found dead in Gibraltar  had only been there for five or six days and confirmed that he believed that the man murdered his family before taking his own life. 'Put it this way, we don't believe children of four and six weeks could slash their own throats,' he said. Two Home Office pathologists - one of them specialising in child cases - are flying out from the UK today to conduct the post-mortems. The bodies have not yet been moved from the dwelling so as to preserve the evidence of the murder scene. Spanish media reported they had been living in Spain and had only arrived in Gibraltar to stay in the rented flat (pictured) a few days ago. Police said it was not clear if they were there in transit or had moved to the area . The family, who have been identified by police but have not yet been named, were found in the rented flat in the Boschetti's Steps area at 11.35am yesterday . Chief Minister Fabian Picardo last night led a minute's silence at the Parliament of Gibraltar following the horrific news. He said until the police have completed their investigation, the Government can't comment any further. But he added: 'As a husband and father, I'm shocked by this terrible crime, as, I am sure, are all residents of Gibraltar. Gibraltarians aren't used to these types of events in our peaceful community, respectful of the law. 'Words are not enough in moments such as this and all we can do is keep the victims and their families in our thoughts and trust that justice will prevail.' Police spokesman Superintendent Richard Ullger said tonight: 'We are trying to contact close relatives and for that reason we cannot give out any names. 'But I can tell you that the man came from the United Kingdom and the woman had Spanish nationality and was of Cuban extraction. The four year old also had Spanish nationality.' He added: 'The deaths are not natural deaths and we are carrying out a major investigation lead by Acting Superintendent Wayne Tunbridge from the Serious Crime Unit. The family had reportedly been living in Spain and had only recently arrived in Gibraltar to visit a family friend . Police on the British enclave on the Iberian Peninsula are not searching for any suspects in the stabbing . 'Police found the bodies after responding to a call from a member of the public. At the moment we are still investigating the relationship between the four people and the circumstances of their deaths. 'We are still trying to reach some family members and won't be revealing the identities until the next of kin have been informed. We are not speculating on the cause of deaths.' A spokesman for the Royal Gibraltar Police also described how the force had been alerted to the incident. They said: 'A member of staff of the company that was letting out the flat, which is a rental property, attended the residence. 'They got no answer from within but noticed that the house was locked from inside and that sent a few alarm bells ringing and they decided to call the police. 'At the moment what we are doing is trying to get as much background information from both the Spanish and the UK sides of the family.' None of the deceased are thought to have been known to police or social services in Gibraltar. The spokesman added: 'These people had only been in Gibraltar for a few days, I think it was either last Thursday or Friday that they arrived. 'We are trying to discover if they were here in transit to the UK or whether they were planning on staying for any length of time in Gibraltar.' A Home Office forensic pathologist is expected to travel to Gibraltar in the next couple of days to perform post-mortem examinations on the bodies. The Commissioner of Police Eddie Yome also described today's tragedy as a 'unique event for Gibraltar'.","Bodies of British man, 31, and his Spanish girlfriend, 37, found yesterday .

"Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been invited to speak at the Oxford Union despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group . Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been invited to speak at the Oxford Union despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group. The notorious rabble rouser received his invitation from the debating society a day before Home Secretary Theresa May announced a crackdown on Islamic extremists. The letter said it would be a 'great privilege' to have Choudary appear as the star guest. Choudary, who once said that Woolwich terror victim Fusilier Lee Rigby would 'burn in hellfire', was even offered a choice of days on which to attend the debate entitled: This house believes that radicalism is born at home. Britain's most notorious hate preacher proudly showed off his invitation after launching a hate-filled rant against Western society outside the Houses of Parliament yesterday. He said: 'I am still on police bail after being arrested by Scotland Yard in September last year. 'But the police can't stop me from speaking. They can't stop me from going to the Oxford Union where I've been invited to speak.' He was one of nine men held in a series of co-ordinated dawn raids by counter terrorism police in September last year. All the men were held on suspicion of being a member of, or backing a banned terrorist group and supporting terrorism. The alleged offences, which come under two counter- terrorism acts, carry a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment. Choudary, 47, was arrested at an unknown location after fleeing his home in the middle of the night in the wake of threats from far-Right groups. Just hours before he was held, he posted a burst of nine inflammatory messages on Twitter, branding US bombing raids in Syria as a 'rallying call for Muslims' and labelling the actions of Western governments in Muslim countries as 'terrorism'. Since then he has remained on bail and must next attend a police station at the end of April when police can either charge him, release him or extend his bail. Choudary, who founded the radical Islamic group Al-Muhajiroun 20 years ago which was later banned, is seen as a recruiting sergeant for Britain's radical Muslims. He has played a cynical cat-and-mouse game with British authorities and has been careful to keep his incendiary speeches on the right side of Britain's hate law. Worryingly, he has warned that jailing him will give him access to a new, captive congregation to radicalise inside prison. The Oxford Union is famous for its normally high-minded debates, in which Britain's academic elite and their often very distinguished guests discuss the key issues of our time . Speaking after a Home Office banning order, the preacher said: 'If they arrest me and put me in prison, I will carry on in prison. I'll radicalise everyone in prison.' Despite this, the Oxford Union are willing to invite him to take part in a debate alongside impressionable young undergraduates. The invitation also flies in the face of the numerous studies highlighting the problem of radicalisation at some of Britain's universities. Yesterday Choudary launched a tirade of venom at the British establishment after Mrs May said the Home Office is drawing up a blacklist of extremist individuals and organisations with whom the government and public sector should not engage. He said the David Cameron and Mrs May have committed more atrocities than members of Islamic State. Choudary also said he would be happy to travel to Syria to live with the terror group if the police gave him his passport back. 'I believe people should be allowed to travel where they want to and go to ISIS controlled territory to live under Sharia law,' he said. 'I would love to travel to Syria and take my wife and children with me, not to commit terrorism but to live under Sharia law. I had my passport taken away from me in September. If you give me a passport, I will go. 'In Britain women who don't have their basic needs fulfilled are having to prostitute themselves. Elderly people are having to choose between food and heating their houses. In ISIS territories they are given food and water and have gas.' He said that was only a matter of time before Sharia law is enshrined in the British constitution. 'There is nothing anyone can do to prevent it,' Choudary said. 'A few years ago the government said if you don't want to live by our laws then you can go. If you stop people leaving and take away their passports they have no choice but to bring Sharia law here. It is better to let them go. 'Communism is dead, capitalism is dying, Islam is the future. Islam is the fastest growing religion. I have no doubt that one day the whole of the world will be governed by Sharia and the flag of Islam will fly over Big Ben, when justice prevails.' The Union is famous for its normally high-minded debates, in which Britain's academic elite and their often very distinguished guests discuss the key issues of our time. One of the Union's most notorious debates came in 1933 - when Adolf Hitler was beginning his rise to power - and was anything but light-hearted. Undergraduates passed the controversial motion, 'This house would not in any circumstances fight for King and country'. It was criticised at the time by Winston Churchill as 'abject, squalid and shameless'. Last night it declined to comment on Choudary's invitation.","Hate preacher Anjem Choudary invited to speak by debating society .

"Mr Xie, a teacher in China, has been sacked after punishing two students by making them kneel on the floor and act as his footstool (above) A teacher in China has been sacked after punishing two students by making them kneel on the floor and act as footstools. Mr Xie told the male pupils from Nanguang High School in Fujian to stay behind after class on Thursday because they were being too loud. He made the students crouch on the floor while he played on his phone and put his bare feet on their backs, People's Daily Online reported. Mr Xie, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was dismissed after the Nan'an City Education Department saw a picture on social media. The image shows both students being made to kneel on the ground in their school uniforms in front of a crowd of pupils. Mr Liu, headteacher, said Mr Xie, who is in his 40s, was supervising a small self-study group around 7.30pm when the two students were too noisy. The Year One pupils - thought to be aged between six and seven - were taken into a different room and told to kneel on the ground. Mr Liu said the footstool photo was taken as a joke and added that Mr Xie, who was in charge of disciplining the male students at the school, 'performed well in his work and was extremely talented'. Nan'an City Department of Education said it took immediate action. It requested the school apologise to students and parents, and said that student counselling should also be offered. Stronger ethics and appropriate styles of teaching would be implemented at the school, the department added. Mr Liu said that a school representative had already gone to the homes of the two students to apologise formally. Boys and girls sit in lines outside Nanguang High School in Fujian, where the incident happened . He said: 'Mr Xie’s actions were in violation of our policies and there had to be some form of punishment by the school.'

"Taron Stead, 17, was cycling to work when he was hit by a car in Sheffield. The driver got out but told him she would be late so left him at side of the road . A mother who hit a teenage cyclist in her car while on the school run refused to help him because she 'didn't want her children to be late'. Taron Stead, 17, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was cycling to work in early morning rush hour traffic when he was hit by a silver car and knocked off his brand new mountain bike. The woman then got out of the car and reportedly told him her children were inside and would be upset by the blood, before driving off without exchanging details. The IT apprentice was left at the side of the road  with cuts and bruises to his hands and face and was cared for by staff from nearby Sheffield University until paramedics arrived. His furious mother, Naomi Pickard, 45, has released a photograph of his injuries in that hope that it will encourage witnesses to come forward. She told the Sheffield Star: 'Taron said the woman in the car got out looked over at him, told him she had children in the car who were upset and she didn't want them to be late for school, then the car drove off. 'I can't believe anyone would leave an injured child at the side of the road after a crash, but it was rush hour and it would have been busy so I am hoping that witnesses come forward and help the police trace the driver. 'Fortunately he was wearing a helmet, or I dread to think what might have happened.' The teenager had only bought the bike three weeks ago with money from his first apprenticeship wage. A nearby Halfords store has since offered to repair his bike free of charge after hearing about the accident. A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: 'On Friday, March 6, it is reported that a cyclist was travelling towards Brook Hill, along Crookes Valley Road, onto Winter Street . He was hit at the junction of Mushroom Lane in Sheffield and Crookes Valley Road (pictured) and left at the side of the road covered in blood.

Much of the summer will be spend in Africa, where the Prince will occupy himself with charity work, much of it conservation focused, according to Kensington Palace. Returning to the UK in the autumn, Harry will then join the core team of five wounded veterans taking part in the Walk of Britain which gets underway on the 22nd August in Scotland. The epic trek, which, it is hoped, will result in wider public awareness of veterans' needs, will end in London on the 31st October. Unfazed: Harry smiled and clutched his speech as he listened to veterans talk about their experiences . Long association: Harry has accompanied injured servicemen on two previous expeditions . One of the boys: Harry was on typically cheeky form and enjoyed chatting to soldiers at the reception . Harry is no stranger to the charity's lengthy expeditions, having previously taken part in walks to the North Pole in 2011 and another to the South Pole in 2013. For the latter, the Prince was joined by a star-studded crew that included Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård, as well of wounded veterans - some of whom were at the Mandarin Oriental for the launch. Watched by an audience that included Walking With the Wounded co-founder Ed Perkins, Harry made an impassioned speech about the need to help veterans and outlined his hopes for the trek. 'Walk of Britain will cover all parts of the country,' he explained. 'Walking through the communities in which our service personnel and veterans grew up and now live. 'In doing so, Walk of Britain will give everyone the opportunity to meet these remarkable men and women. Achievement: The five-strong team will walk 1,000 miles through the UK, starting at the end of August . Helping out: Harry's last trek with Walking with the Wounded took him to Antarctica . Race: The 2013 expedition saw the Prince join wounded servicemen as they walked to the South Pole . 'People up and down the country will get to see first-hand the determination and resolve of those who have served, and in particular those who have been injured or suffer hidden wounds. 'They will see that whatever their circumstances these men and women are looking to the future. They are looking to employers to give them the chance to keep making a contribution to our communities. 'These men and women want to continue to serve their country in whatever way possible. PTSD and mental injury can make life a daily struggle, but we should not assume that everyone leaving the military faces these challenges. 'It's also important to keep mental health issues in perspective. We should remind people that nearly all cases end well, whether it be total cure, adjustment of life, or the ability for the individual to accept and admit the issues that face them, amongst a tricky culture of stigma. Involved: Harry, pictured arriving at the Mandarin Oriental, has long championed wounded soldiers . Projects: As well as Walking with the Wounded, he also spearheaded the Invictus Games . Retirement: Harry will be seconded to the Australia Defence Force for a month before he leaves the Army . 'It is a delicate balance between being ready to support those who need it and recognising the valuable role those who have served in the military can play in civilian life.' Harry's work with Walking With the Wounded echoes his previous efforts, most notably last year's hugely successful Invictus Games. Although the event will not take place this year, aides are keen to emphasise that Prince Harry's championing of wounded servicemen will continue post-retirement. He will also continue to take part in military events, beginning with a trip to Turkey next month to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign next month. The battle was one of the bloodiest of World War I and resulted in the deaths of approximately 43,000 British soldiers, 8,709 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders. Harry, who will be based in Australia when the event takes place, will fly to Turkey and will be joined by Prince Charles for a memorial service.","Prince Harry has announced that he is to take part in a charity trek .

"The skeletons of a mother and her child buried side-by-side are among those which are to be excavated from an ancient burial ground after being disturbed during construction for London's Crossrail. Archaeologists have started excavating 3,000 skeletons from Bedlam burial ground, which is at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network. Used from 1569 until at least 1738, including during the Great Plague in 1665, the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow. It was situated in close proximity to Bethlem Royal Hospital - the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe – and was used to bury London’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as inmates from the asylum. Scroll down for video . Skeletons of a mother and child (pictured above) are among those which are to be excavated from the Bedlam burial ground, which is the site for the new Liverpool Street station that will serve London's Crossrail network . Other skeletons at the burial site include that of a mother and her two children (above). Most of the remains are unidentified since the site did not keep its own burial records when it was used between 1569 and 1738 . Archaeologists have started excavating 3,000 skeletons (pictured) from the ancient Bedlam burial ground . These two adult skulls were among thousands uncovered at the Bedlam burial ground, which was used during the Great Plague in 1665. The remains will be removed over the next week by a team of archaeologists . A team of 60 archaeologists will work in shifts, six days a week, to excavate the skeletons and gather any other remains at the burial site. The skeletons (pictured above) will then be reburied on consecrated ground . The site, which was uncovered by Crossrail workers who are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial ground, is thought to contain the remains of a former lord mayor of London, a notorious criminal and political activists. The skeletons will be excavated over the next four weeks by a team of 60 archaeologists who will work in shifts, six days a week. They will carefully remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be, in archaeological terms, London's most valuable 16th and 17th Century cemetery site. After the excavation, the workers will then dig through medieval marsh deposits and Roman remains including a road that runs under the site, which has already yielded several interesting Roman artefacts such as horseshoes and cremation urns. The skeletons will then be reburied on consecrated ground. Archaeologists are expected to finish on site in September, after which construction will proceed on a new eastern ticket hall by contractor Laing O'Rourke. Jay Carver, Crossrail lead archaeologist, said: 'This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners. 'The Bedlam burial ground spans a fascinating phase of London's history, including the transition from the Tudor-period city into cosmopolitan early-modern London. 'This is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in London. 'Bedlam was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city.' Archaeologists at the new Livepool Street station (pictured) are expected to finish on site in September . The remains were uncovered during Crossrail construction work, which is set to be completed by 2019 . Bones and skeletal remains could be seen at the Bedlam burial site today as workers began excavating them . The Bedlam burial ground opened during London’s response to the plague crisis in the 16th Century . The burial site was the first in London which was not associated with a parish church and so many remains are unknown. Workers could be seen carrying out excavations at the site today ahead of the Crossrail work . The Crossrail project has already unearthed a number of exciting discoveries, including more than 10,000 artefacts at more than 40 construction sites. In 2013, workers made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' in tunnels underneath Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows. The Crossrail team unearthed about 20 Roman skulls which were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary. The Crossrail team unearthed about 20 Roman skulls in 2013, which had been buried in clusters at Bedlam . Working under the direction of archaeologists, the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls, as well as a collection of ancient Roman pottery. For safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground. The discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century. Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. Prior to the discovery of the Roman skulls, workers also found about 4,000 skeletons buried in the Eldon Street area. These skeletons were found in August 2013 and were carefully removed during major archaeological excavations last year . The archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street are being undertaken by Museum of London Archaeology on behalf of Crossrail. Scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern Londoners. Bedlam burial ground was established in 1569 to help parishes cope with overcrowding during outbreaks of the plague and other epidemics. As well as being used to bury those who were struck down with disease, it also became the site for those who passed away at the nearby Bethlem Royal Hospital - which is thought to have been the world's first mental asylum. However, with mental patients showing no physical symptoms of illness, determining which of the remains belonged to those treated at the hospital will be near impossible for experts. Earlier this year, Crossrail-led research identified the names and backgrounds of more than 5,000 people buried at the site. Names include Sir Ambrose Nicholas, who was lord mayor of London in 1575, and Dr John Lamb (also known as Lam or Lambe), an astrologer and advisor to the First Duke of Buckingham. Scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of Londoners . To date, the Crossrail project has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. Pictured: Workers have started excavation work at the Bedlam site . The archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street are being undertaken by Museum of London Archaeology . Preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street station site have already uncovered more than 400 skeletons . Lamb was said to have been stoned to death by an angry mob outside a theatre in 1628 following allegations of rape and black magic. Others identified in the research, carried out by 16 invited volunteers, include victims of riots by 'Fanatiques', noted in the diaries of Samuel Pepys in January 1661. To date, Crossrail has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. It is the UK's largest archaeology project. Preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street site in 2013 and 2014 have already uncovered more than 400 skeletons and numerous artefacts. After the skeletaon excavations, the workers will dig through medieval marsh deposits and Roman remains . Jay Carver, Crossrail lead archaeologist, said: 'This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners.' Pictured: Excavations beneath Liverpool Street . An artist's impression of how the new Liverpool Street Crossrail station will look when it is completed . The Bedlam burial ground, also known as the New Churchyard, was situated near the notorious Bethlem Royal Hospital which opened during London’s response to the plague crisis in the 16th Century. The burial site was the first in London which was not associated with a parish church and it did not keep its own burial records. Instead, the City’s parish churches recorded which of their parishioners were buried at Bedlam in their own records. Bethlem Royal Hospital was founded in 1247 and was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe . The graveyard, built on Bethlem Hospital’s vegetable patch in the 1560s after churchyards around the city started to overflow, was used to bury London’s poor and religious non-conformists as well as inmates from the asylum. Bethlem Royal Hospital, which quickly became pronounced ‘Bedlam’ by Londoners, was founded in 1247 and was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe. It was founded by Goffredo de Prefetti, who had been elected Bishop of Bethlehem, and was originally located just outside the London city wall, on the site of what is now Liverpool Street station. By 1403, the majority of its patients suffered mental health issues. Others suffered from epilepsy, learning disabilities and dementia. Bedlam: The scene inside Bethlem Hospital, as depicted by William Hogarth in The Rake's Progress . Due to the hospital's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane, a bastardised version of its name - 'Bedlam' - came to signify madness and chaos more generally. Although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly, most were free to walk around the grounds. Inside the single-storey building that housed 12 cells, a kitchen, staff accommodation and an exercise yard, inmates were manacled and chained – and treated as a tourist attraction by Londoners who paid a penny to stare at them. Patients, usually poor, were given treatments including restraint, dousing with water, beatings and isolation. Conditions inside Bedlam were depicted by William Hogarth in his 18th century drawings A Rake’s Progress, charting the decline of a merchant’s son from wealthy heir to asylum inmate, via debtor’s jail. In 1674, the hospital's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to Moorfields, with the area's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises. Bethlem moved again in 1815, to St George's Fields in Southwark, which is now the site of the Imperial War Museum. A final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of Bromley. It is now run by the NHS and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital.","Work underway to excavate remains from burial site disturbed by Crossrail .

"A sprawling country estate with 600 acres of grounds, two chocolate-box cottages, and it own wooded island has gone on sale for just £8million. Green Farm, near to the village of Ashton in Northhamptonshire, also features a seven-bedroom farmhouse and it is the first time the property has been on the market for 150 years. Andrew Meikle, from estate agents Bletsoes, said this is a chance for people to own a picturesque piece of England 'as beautiful as anything in the Cotswolds', but for a fraction of the price. Sprawling: Green Farm estate features this seven bedroom Grade II listed farmhouse which is set in 600 acres of grounds and farmland . Hertiage: The estate has been passed down through the generations of the Rothschild family, and this is believed to be the first time it has come up for sale in 150 years . Bargain: For £8million the buyer will also get this three-acre wooded island situated in the River Nene which is accessible by weir (left) The estate was initially owned by the Rothschild family and is currently occupied by their descendants, having been passed down through generations. During the 19th century, when the family were believed to hold the largest private fortune in the world, they helped to remodel the village of Ashton for the workers they employed on the estate. The Grade II listed farmhouse is in a secluded location on the edge of the picturesque village. There are also two listed thatched cottages on the land - the three-bedroom West Lodge and one-bedroom Shepherdess Cottage. The farmland is spread out between Polebrook, Ashton and Oundle with 500 acres of arable land for growing crops, 70 acres of pasture land for keeping livestock and almost 60 acres of woodland. The buyer would also get their own private island - three acres of woodland in the middle of the River Nene, which you can access by a weir. Mr Meikle said: 'As far as we know this is the first time the property has come on the open market in 150 years. It's a Rothschild property, it belongs to descendants of the family and has been handed down for generations. Huge: A satellite image showing the entire 600 acre estate.

'We're very open-minded about how it might sell. There are a number of properties, lots of land and it's even got an island. It's the perfect opportunity for someone to buy a bit of England. 'It's in Northamptonshire, a really picturesque, forgotten part of the country - it's as nice as places in the Cotswolds but for quarter the price. 'A local farmer who came to look at it said he can't remember anything of this size being available in the last 20 years. 'It's got some great commercial land, a lovely frontage on the river, meadows, woodlands and development potential. There's pasture land that could be used for traditional livestock, or might appeal to the equine market as well. It's got absolutely loads of potential. 'The island is three acres of mature woodland and sits in the middle of the River Nene. You cross to the island by weir.

"The seven young actors who became part of cinematic history when they were cast as the von Trapp children in Rogers & Hammerstein's The Sound Of Music in 1965 have grown to become lifelong friends in the fifty years since the famous film's release. Known as The SoM 7, they formed their own sort of family over the months of making the musical. Their parents befriended one another as the young performers traveled to Austria for filming, and the actors themselves have remained close for decades. 'We're beyond friends. We're second family,' said Kym Karath, who played the youngest von Trapp, Gretl. 'As adults, we were deeply bonded, so our lives have really interwoven with each other.' As The Sound Of Music celebrates its 50th anniversary, here's a look at what the SoM 7 are doing now: . The 1965 Oscar-winning film adaptation of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical The Sound Of Music, starring Julie Andrews and the actors who played the von Trapp children, is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year .

"Swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker has found herself accidentally tangled up in the Oklahoma racist fraternity scandal after fans discovered that she tweeted at one of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers last summer. In one of the most bizarre twists in the story, the Sports Illustrated covergirl responded last April to a tweet from Levi Pettit - a University of Oklahoma student who was identified by his parents on Tuesday as one of fraternity brothers caught on video signing 'there will never be a n***** SAE.' Pettit sent Decker a tweet that reportedly said: 'My mom loves you!' That tweet - along with Pettit's entire Twitter account - have since been deleted. Scroll down for video .

"For most of us sticking to a diet plan, the likes of Bolognese and spaghetti carbonara are strictly off limits. But thanks to a new kitchen gadget which transforms everyday fruit and vegetable into low-calorie ‘pasta’ dishes, this has all changed. Sales of the spiralizer - a cutting device that creates nutritious, low-carb pasta and noodle-like ribbons from fruit and vegetables - have spiralled through the roof. Amazon has seen a 1,400 per cent year on year jump in sales of the device, while shops such as Aldi are facing an increase in sales of courgettes and carrots due to the popularity of the product. Kitchen magic: The spiralizer turns fruit and vegetables into noodles  in less time than it takes to peel a spud . Championed by trendy health-food chefs such as Deliciously Ella and the Helmsley sisters, the gadget enables health-lovers to integrate guilt-free hearty 'pasta' and 'noodle' dishes into their diet. Ella Woodward — otherwise known as 23-year-old foodie Deliciously Ella — is an advocate of courgetti – ribbons of courgette boiled and used as a pasta substitute. Miss Woodward – who can be seen eating courgetti on the cover of one of her cookbooks - recently wrote on her blog: ‘Courgette pasta itself is just incredible, so quick and easy to make. ‘It really does taste like spaghetti too, especially if you cook it for a few minutes which softens it. ‘I use this machine [spiralizer] to make my pasta and it is amazing, very small, light and inexpensive. 'It also slices numerous other fruit and veg in countless ways. A really perfect tool for anyone looking for new healthy alternatives.’ In the latest move from carbohydrates and wheat, the spiralizer can make dishes from various boiled fruit and vegetables including potatoes, cucumbers, cabbage, onions, celery, radish, beetroot, apples and pears. The product took America by storm last year and sales suggest the same is taking place in the UK. An Amazon spokesperson said: ‘Spiralizers are a great way to get more vegetables in your diet. ‘Courgettes transformed into “courgette” seems to be very popular, but customer reviews tell us that the nation has also been experimenting with sweet potato ribbon crisps and even carrot ramen noodles.’ At Aldi, carrot sales are up 23 per cent year on year, while courgettes have risen 34 per cent. The supermarket says the reason behind this is the new trend for health-conscious consumers to turn vegetable into ribbons. An Aldi spokesperson said: ‘By buying veg for spiralizing at Aldi, shoppers are making the most of our everyday low prices, while buying the other ingredients they need to make fantastic, and healthy, meals at home. ‘Customers are able to experiment with a variety of quality fresh fruit and vegetables, available in store as part of Aldi’s extensive fresh produce offering.’ Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, otherwise known as female food duo Hemsley + Hemsley, have launched their own spiralizing machine. The pair, who run a blog and a bespoke food delivery service, include various spiralize recipes in their cookbook The Art of Eating Well, including beef ragu courgetti and sesame chicken salad with cucumber noodles. Spiralizers retail at between £14.99 and £46.99.","The spiralizer turns vegetables into guilt-free, low calorie 'pasta'

"Millions of women are not taking enough exercise because they are afraid of being ‘judged’, MPs warn. They worry they will be ridiculed for being sweaty, out of breath or struggling at the back when jogging or at the gym. Some women have taken to running in secret on treadmills installed in sheds in their back garden because they are too ashamed to do it in public. Scroll down for video . Millions of women across the UK are not taking enough exercise because they are afraid of being ‘judged’, a new report by MPs on the Commons’ Health Select Committee has found (file picture, posed by model) A report by MPs on the Commons’ Health Select Committee also highlights how girls as young as ten shun PE classes because they worry about their body image. Figures show that just over two thirds of women, 68 per cent, do not take the recommended level of exercise of two and a half hours over the course of a week. This is much higher than the 56 per cent of men who do not do this weekly amount. Experts have warned that a lack of exercise is as harmful as tobacco and contributes to up to one in six deaths in the UK. Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, chairman of the committee, said: ‘It is unacceptable that this gender gap has been ignored for so long. We need to be out there ensuring that girls can access the type of sport they want to take part in.’ Labour MP Barbara Keeley said girls aged ten, 11 and 12 were dropping out of games lessons because they were worried about showing ‘puppy fat’. One woman interviewed by the committee was told by her male GP she was too fat to do the London Marathon even though she had run 18 miles the week previously. Julie Creffield, a campaigner who encourages women to exercise, said she was determined to ‘prove him wrong’ and finished the event in 2013. Mrs Creffield, 36, a mother who works as a motivational speaker, said many women were afraid to join running clubs or attend gym classes because they didn’t want to be the one ‘struggling at the back.’ This is particularly true if they are overweight or have gained a few pounds after having children. She told the MPs: ‘I have women who tell me they run on a treadmill in their shed because they just don’t want to be seen in public, and that’s part of the problem. Because we don’t see many overweight women exercising in public, other women don’t think exercise is for them.’ The committee – which is also investigating obesity – spoke to an expert who accused hospitals that sell fast-food on their premises as being guilty of ‘negligence.’ Professor Theresa Marteau, of the Department of Public Health at Cambridge University, criticised Guy’s in London, where there is a McDonald’s and Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge, which houses a Burger King. She said: ‘It is at best anomalous and at worst negligent that NHS properties continue to serve foods high in sugar, salt and fat.’ Separately, the health watchdog NICE today publishes new guidelines urging GPs to tell adults to start walking when they undergo their NHS health checks, between the ages of 40 and 74.","Millions of women are not doing enough exercise as they fear being judged .

"A prominent GOP fundraiser and her family accused of setting their mansion alight in a $20 million fraud scheme have headed to court - just three weeks after her husband took his life. The week-long preliminary hearing underway in Bucks County, Pennsylvania will determine whether Claire Risoldi, her two adult children, her daughter-in-law and two others will face trial. Risoldi's husband, Thomas French, was also charged with his relatives in January but he took his life in February and left behind a note saying he couldn't handle the stress of being falsely accused. An investigation into the family's claims began after a 2013 fire at the stately home in Doylestown. It was the third blaze in five years at the property, which the Risoldis dubbed Clairemont. Accused: Claire Risoldi, left, is in court for a preliminary hearing into accusations that she fraudulently claimed $20 million in insurance payouts. Her husband Thomas French, right, took his life last month . After the fires, the family allegedly lived large on trumped-up insurance claims and attempted to intimidate witnesses when they learned that investigations into the payouts were underway. On Tuesday, friend Tina Mazaheri, a lawyer, told the court that Risoldi visited her to ask what she would tell a grand jury if she was questioned about the fires, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. When Mazaheri said lying would violate her professional duty, Risoldi erupted in anger and shouted at the woman, Mazaheri told the court. Also on Tuesday, a jewelry expert was called to testify against the family as prosecutors intended to show Risoldi claimed losses for jewelry that later turned up in her bank deposit box. Risoldi had falsely accused volunteer firefighters of stealing 55 pieces of jewelry worth more than $10 million while battling the flames, according to a grand jury presentment earlier this year. Family ties: Risoldi's son, Carl A. Risoldi, 43, a public relations and marketing specialist, and his wife, Sheila M. Risoldi, have been charged with multiple offenses, including theft by deception . Accused: Clarie's daughter Carla Risoldi, a former Bucks County prosecutor and now a private attorney, and private investigator Mark Goldman, 54, have also been charged on multiple counts . Scene: An image taken last month shows the family's mansion, which suffered three suspicious fires in five years. Prosecutors said the family lived large on trumped-up insurance claims following the fires . The collection had included two items valued at $106,000 only four months earlier, officials said. Authorities said they  uncovered a decades-long pattern of questionable insurance claims by Risoldi. She still possessed jewelry she reported stolen in 1993, according to investigators, and had reported another jewelry theft from a different home in 1984 and a house fire in 1977. The family appeared in court sitting behind their lawyers on Tuesday but declined to comment. Risoldi's son, Carl A. Risoldi, 43, and his wife, Sheila M. Risoldi, 43, are also charged as well as private investigator Mark Goldman, 54, and fabric vendor Richard Holston, 51. Defense attorneys said they do not expect the family to testify in this hearing. Their defense lawyers said the causes of the fires were 'undetermined' and not classified as arson. They also pointed that the payouts were made after insurers' investigators looked into the claims. Blaze: An image from October 2013 shows firefighters  fighting the house fire at the family's estate. Risoldi accused firefighters of stealing her jewelry as they battled the flames . Officials previously said that large amounts of highly flammable material had been placed near the origin of each blaze. After the preliminary hearing, the judge will decide if there's enough evidence against each defendant to bring charges. The Philadelphia Inquirer previously reported that Risoldi has donated tens of thousands of dollars to the county's Republican Party, state lawmakers and a county judge. She also has organized political fund-raisers for local candidates, that were held at her New Hope mansion. As a result of the investigation, authorities seized about $7 million in family assets, including $3 million in bank accounts, $1.2 million in jewelry, six Ferraris and two Rolls-Royces.","Claire Risoldi, 67, her adult children, daughter-in-law and two others have been charged in an extensive insurance fraud scheme .

"From the endless chocolate blocks passed around the office, to the glaring supermarket aisles and the family relatives who miraculously appear with baskets of eggs, Easter can be a minefield to navigate  if you're trying to watch your waistline. But according to new research, there's no need to go easy on the eggs this week, with a Roy Morgan study revealing there is no direct connection between chocolate consumption and an increasing Body Mass Index (BMI). This should come as sweet relief for chocoholics when according to Roy Morgan, two thirds of Australians admit to munching on chocolate at least once a month. Scroll down for video . Eggsellent news: A chocolate a day is found to not affect your Body Mass Index . While chocolate has long held a reputation for being an 'unhealthy' snack, evidence now indicates cocoa packs more for its punch than what we've been giving it credit for. The research lead by Roy Morgan discovered while 67 per cent of Australian adults  agree that they restrict how much  fattening food they eat, they  still will sneak some kind of chocolate into their diet over a four week period and 74 per cent will consume it at least once in a month. Interestingly, 68 per cent of those who ticked the ‘I’m constantly watching my weight’ statement and  the ‘prefer to eat healthy snacks’  still meet the once a month quota. The results also indicated there isn't one demographic in Australia who eat the most chocolate - there are a variety of groups with chocoholic tendencies. Firstly, those who ‘tend to snack throughout the day’ were considered by far the most susceptible chocolate consumers. Also those considered underweight were just as likely to eat  chocolate  in four weeks as those who were overweight (with overweight scoring slightly higher). Munch for mood: Chocolate has also been proven to boost your mood and reduce stress levels . This research only adds to the reputation amongst medical studies that now suggest chocolate is good for you in a myriad of ways. It's been found to help your heart by reducing the risk of atherosclerosis (thickening and hardening of the arteries), boost your brain power by enhancing blood flow to the brain (associated with enhancing memory) and also reduces stress levels by correcting chemical imbalances related with stress. So as for those Dark chocolate Lindt bunnies? Eat away, your body will thank you. A previous version of this article made reference to a German study which claimed a link between cocoa diets and weight loss. We have removed this reference as the study was subsequently revealed to be incorrect.","New research from Roy Morgan reveals there's no  proof that chocolate consumption affects BMI .

"A detailed search for Indian Ocean rubbish on the south west coast of Tasmania might have indicated that the hunt for missing flight MH370 is in the wrong place. Volunteers have scoured beaches, rocks and shallow waters along a 60-mile stretch of coast in the lower corner of the island state, located to the south of the Australian continent, picking up no less than 80,000 pieces of rubbish. Some of the debris has drifted 6,000 miles across the Indian Ocean from as far away as Madagascar and South Africa but there has been nothing that appears to be from the Malaysia Airlines jet. Yet the official search area for the aircraft, some 1200 miles south west of Perth in Western Australia, lies virtually in the path that the rubbish from the other side of the ocean has drifted along. Doomed: A detailed search for Indian Ocean rubbish on the south west coast of Tasmania might have indicated that the hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 (pictured) is in the wrong place . If nothing more, the discovery of rubbish from Madagascar and South Africa confirms that the ocean tides will carry debris many thousands of miles, passing close to the MH370 search area, to the shores of Australia - and perhaps onwards into the Pacific Ocean. There have been numerous suggestions that despite complex mathematical calculations the search for the aircraft, which vanished more than a year ago on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew, is in the wrong area. And while the rubbish clean-up by a team of volunteers along the remote beaches of Tasmania was not conducted to look for debris from the aircraft, the ocean currents have brought nothing in to suggest that the aircraft lies at the bottom of the sea somewhere out to the west. If there was anything in southern Tasmania from the jet, the team would have found it, for they have been picking up minute pieces of plastic as small as a grain of rice. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported today that 27 people spent eight nights at sea in a fleet of fishing boats, travelling from Low Rocky Point to the mouth of Port Davey in an annual effort to clean the beaches of rubbish floating in from the vast ocean. Tragic: Tourists sign a wall of condolence for the victims of MH370 at Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur airport . In late January, Malaysia's government formally declared the plane's disappearance an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead. Pictured is a screen at the departure hall of Kuala Lumpur airport . No-one reported finding anything that suggested discovered debris was from the jet - but they uncover a great deal of other items that could be traced back to boats and even to Madagascar and the African continent. ‘We found a roll of tape from Madagascar that’s from a vanilla bean manufacturer,’ said expedition leader Matt Dell. ‘We found a bit of stuff from Africa washing around. We found a drift card from Durban (South Africa) that’s like a fish tag - oh, and a set of dolls’ plastic shoes.’ Mr Dell said the volunteers had been visiting the beaches for a number of years ‘and we’re slowly willowing out that big stuff and now all that’s left is the big stuff what washed up between our visits and the small stuff below the sand.’ Most of the rubbish has come from commercial fishing boats such as ropes, floats and pieces of net, but Mr Dell told the ABC that more and more plastic items like drink bottles had been washed up. But so far, nothing from MH370. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .","Volunteers have been cleaning a 60-mile stretch of the Tasmanian coast .

"When Tania Clarence killed her three young severely disabled children – overwhelmed by the terrible strain of looking after them – their tragic deaths shocked the nation and inspired a wave of sympathy for her and her family. Four months ago she pleaded guilty on the grounds of diminished responsibility to the manslaughter of her three-year-old twin sons and four-year-old daughter. She was sentenced by an Old Bailey judge to be detained in a psychiatric hospital until her recovery was complete. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that she has been allowed to return to the family home where the killings took place. Tania Clarence, who is being treated for depression,  has been seen at her £1.2million family home with a girl believed to be her surviving daughter just four months after admitting killing her three terminally ill children . At the court hearing in November, Mrs Clarence was described as a loving and caring mother who had smothered twins Max and Ben and daughter Olivia while in the grip of a severe bout of mental illness brought on by what Mr Justice Sweeney called the ‘unbearable pressure’ of caring for them. Mrs Clarence’s solicitor said it was one of the saddest cases to come before the criminal courts. Her client’s plea was accepted by the prosecution and the judge imposed a sentence known as a Hospital Order. He ruled that the 43-year-old would need psychiatric treatment and therapy ‘for the foreseeable future’ and would not be released until she had recovered from her illness. Last week she was photographed for the first time at the house in New Malden, Surrey, where the killings took place. Wearing blue jeans and a dark top and looking like any other mother on the afternoon school run, she arrived at the £1.2 million detached property in a Hyundai people carrier with a small suitcase on wheels and what appeared to be a bag of shopping. She was accompanied by another woman and a young girl – thought to be her only surviving child, who was eight years old when the terrible events occurred last April. All three went into the seven-bedroom house and the unidentified woman left half an hour later, driving off in a silver Mazda. Mrs Clarence declined to comment when she was approached by a Mail on Sunday reporter but her husband Gary, when told that an article about the family was being prepared for publication this weekend, said: ‘Okay, fine.’ Family man: Gary Clarence with his three-year-old twin sons Max and Ben. Mr Clarence, 45, is standing by his wife . The South African-born investment banker was on a trip to his home country with their eldest daughter when the killings took place. It is understood that his wife was given a temporary licence several weeks ago to leave the hospital where she is being treated and has been returning home on a regular basis at weekends. Max, Ben and Olivia all had spinal muscular atrophy, which is a devastating muscle-wasting illness sometimes referred to as ‘floppy baby syndrome’. The surviving daughter does not have the condition. Mrs Clarence, who was severely depressed at the time, lied to the family nanny so she could be alone with the three youngest children while her husband and older daughter were away. After asphyxiating them in their beds, she made what was described in court as a ‘determined effort’ to kill herself. The judge said the evidence of her diminished responsibility for the children’s deaths was ‘clear and convincing’. Psychiatrists had explained ‘in compelling detail’ that her mental illness had substantially impaired her ability to form a rational judgment. The judge said she was a dedicated and caring mother who loved her children but had been overwhelmed by the challenge of caring for them. Last night the NHS trust responsible for Mrs Clarence’s treatment declined to comment on the grounds of patient confidentiality. The hospital where she is being treated also cannot be named for legal reasons. Up to 60 therapists, doctors, nurses and other specialists had been involved with the family over the years, sometimes arriving at the house unannounced and leaving Mrs Clarence feeling insecure and upset, the court was told. She had frequently clashed with doctors over the children’s treatment and there was criticism during the hearing of the way that health professionals had dealt with the family. It emerged that Mrs Clarence felt she was being pressed into agreeing to intrusive operations and medical procedures for the children that she thought were inappropriate. She and her husband were said to want to put quality of life above longevity for Ben, Max and Olivia but some medical experts in contact with the family disagreed. Tragic: Floral tributes left last April at the family home in Surrey where Mrs Clarence killed her three children . Court date: Mrs Clarence shown as she enters her guilty plea at the Old Bailey. A judge told how the killings were the result of her mental illness . The standard of care and support the family received is now the subject of a serious case review by Kingston-upon-Thames Council. After smothering the twins in their beds and surrounding their bodies with toys, Mrs Clarence wrote a letter to her husband telling him that she also intended to kill Olivia. ‘Gary, I need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take Liv’s life...The boys were bad enough. I am struggling with Liv. ‘I waited until the boys were asleep, the same with Liv. If I could take my own life and leave her to wait for you, I would.’ Mr Clarence, 45, is standing by his wife. He left the Old Bailey saying the killings were ‘a tragedy from which lessons need to be learnt’. He said at the time: ‘Tania’s depression was certainly not assisted by the constant pressure placed on the family by some individuals within the medical profession and social services.’ The South African couple met at university in Stellenbosch. She was training to be a graphic designer. His family owns a hotel and conference centre in Johannesburg. As an adult Mrs Clarence had suffered from depression – which also affected several of her relatives. She had also been involved in an ‘abusive’ relationship with a longstanding boyfriend before her marriage. The Clarences moved to Britain 20 years ago and settled in South-West London before moving to New Malden, where they spent thousands of pounds adapting the house to the needs of their disabled children. Imposing the Hospital Order at the Old Bailey in November, Mr Justice Sweeney told Mrs Clarence: ‘This was [not] a mercy killing in the sense in which that phrase is normally used. ‘The children did not ask to be killed and you did not, and do not, seek to justify your actions as being justified in mercy. What you did was the product of your mental illness.’","Tania Clarence killed her three young severely disabled children last year .

"Thousands of users of an online prescription service have had their data sold without their knowledge, a Mail investigation can reveal today. Their names and addresses have been handed to companies that target the sick. Many of the patients used the Pharmacy 2U service because they were disabled or too ill to travel to their nearest surgery. Others used the firm’s online doctor consultations. Scroll down for video . Pharmacy 2U, an online prescription service, has sold patients information to marketing companies without their knowledge . Pharmacy 2U, which is the country’s leading NHS approved online pharmacy, even gave the patients’ email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to a marketing firm. MPs said the company was putting thousands of patients at risk and should face a police probe. The revelations come amid a growing outcry over the Mail’s reporting on how sensitive medical and financial data is being sold to conmen and criminals. Today we can also reveal that: . Following a major investigation, the Mail this week revealed how financial details of thousands of people – including details of their incomes, investments and pension pots – were being sold for as little as 5p to cold callers and fraudsters. The prescription company even gave the patients’ email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to firms . And our disclosures yesterday included how undercover reporters were also able to buy private medical details – including names of people suffering from arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and even bladder problems – for just 19p each. Some of this information on sick and disabled people is ending up in the hands of conmen and criminals who prey on the most vulnerable. Now it can be revealed that details of NHS patients who have bought prescriptions online are also being offered for sale. The details sold to Alchemy Direct Media by Pharmacy 2U, which has a turnover of £17million a year, include the names and addresses of people who have requested online doctor consultations using the site. On its website, Alchemy described those on the list as people who had used Pharmacy 2U to ‘place their GP prescriptions and have them delivered to their home address’. Andy Burnham, Labour's health spokesman, has described this as an 'extremely serious matter' The details appear to have been passed on without the proper consent of patients. When registering for online prescriptions, patients using Pharmacy2U have to agree to terms and conditions but these do not cover anything about their information being passed on to third parties. That is only stated in the small print of the website’s privacy policy. Pharmacy2U admitted to the Mail that it had sold the names and addresses of ‘up to 5,000’ patients on three occasions, refusing to say how much it had charged. It said it had decided to stop selling the information and stressed no medical data had been passed on. But Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘This is an extremely serious matter. The Government must initiate an inquiry and call in the police to see if a crime has been committed. Pharmacy2U should immediately be suspended as an approved distributor. ‘Jeremy Hunt has failed in his primary duty to protect vulnerable patients. He must make an urgent statement to set out how widespread this practice is, whether there have been other breaches and what action is being taken against Pharmacy2U.’ Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the health select committee, called for a criminal investigation into Pharmacy2U. She said: ‘This is awful. It is just beyond belief that anyone working for this company could have thought it reasonable to sell these records. If people forward their prescriptions to a pharmacy they should never expect that to be anything other than totally confidential. ‘The CEO of this company should be personally held to account. Did he know about this? People should never use this online service again. ‘I just can’t see how this could be legal. It is a whole other level. I hope the police will investigate.’ Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘This is the most disgraceful breach of trust. ‘People access NHS services with an expectation that everything about it will be private. ‘Patients would never expect that when using an NHS approved pharmacy service their details would then be sold on. The Mail’s undercover team contacted Data Bubble, which is run by Mrs Clayton, and found its selling sensitive pension details for as little as 19p . ‘This is putting our most vulnerable people at risk. It is a complete outrage and must stop immediately.’ Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who sat on the health select committee, said the fact that NHS patients’ details were sold on was ‘incredibly concerning’. She said that firms should not be selling data without ‘people’s explicit knowledge and their explicit consent.’ The Mail’s revelations on the sale of medical and financial data have sparked a major inquiry by the office of the Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham. Nick Sayer, a director of B2C Data, offered to sell details of 15,000 people to undercover reporters in a Mail expose this week . Yesterday Mr Graham praised the Mail’s investigation and rubbished the firms’ claims that people ‘opted in’ to having their medical details sold on. He said: ‘It’s just beyond belief that people have signed up to be col called about their bladder problems. ‘What the Daily Mail team appear to have discovered is that there’s a nice little trade going between different commercial companies where our personal info has value to others.’ A spokesman for Pharmacy 2U said: ‘Only name and address information has been sold and no permission for any other data to be sold has been provided by Pharmacy2U. ‘Alchemy Direct Media (UK) Ltd work for Pharmacy2U under a strict agreement and other data was provided to them under that agreement for internal purposes, such as understanding the recency of the data, but not for sale to external parties. ‘This type of data processing for companies by their agencies is normal business practice. No medication information or data relating to medical conditions has been shared with Alchemy Direct Media (UK) Ltd.’ Michael Smith, managing director of Alchemy Direct Media, said: ‘We are an ICO registered company and are satisfied that the information held on this database complies with current data protection and ICO regulation.’","Names, addresses and dates of birth among information sold off to firms .

"David Cameron today puts the prospect of Alex Salmond ‘calling the tune’ in a deal with Labour at the centre of the Tory election campaign. As he launches a poster showing a tiny Ed Miliband in Mr Salmond’s pocket, the Prime Minister warns of the ‘chilling and real prospect’ of Labour being propped up in government by the Scottish National Party. His offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament. Scroll down for video . Pocket-size: Ed Miliband is dwarfed by Alex Salmond in the new Conservative election poster . Polls last week suggested the nationalists could win 50 out of the 59 Westminster seats in May, including those seen as the safest Labour strongholds such as Gordon Brown’s in Kirkcaldy. This would sink any prospect of Mr Miliband winning a Commons majority. Mr Cameron says today: ‘Britain needs to wake up to a chilling and real prospect – Ed Miliband as prime minister, propped up by Alex Salmond who says he’ll call the tune. ‘Again and again, Ed Miliband refuses to rule out this possibility. He is so weak, everyone knows he would be in Alex Salmond’s pocket. On every vote, every budget, every decision, the SNP would exact a high price for his support. ‘Everyone in Britain will pay with higher taxes, more spending, more debt and weaker defences in dangerous times. To keep the recovery on track and avoid this nightmare, vote Conservative.’ The Prime Minister's offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament . A Labour parliamentary candidate has rejected a £1,000 donation from Tony Blair towards her election campaign. Lesley Brennan, who is standing in Dundee East, said on Twitter her ‘instinct’ was to turn the offer down. The former Prime Minister has pledged £106,000 to help Labour campaigns in 106 marginal seats. But there has been unease about Mr Blair’s links to foreign corporations and dictatorships and candidates have been under pressure to hand back the so-called ‘blood money’. Mr Miliband is under huge pressure from his Scottish MPs to rule out a deal with the nationalists. Yesterday his deputy Harriet Harman dodged the issue eight times on the Murnaghan show on Sky. Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint refused four times to rule out a deal with the nationalists on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1. She said: ‘We are focused on winning a Labour majority government. Let me say this. We do not want, we do not need and we do not plan to have any coalition with the SNP.’ Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan dodged the question four times on Pienaar’s Politics on Radio 5 Live and shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran did so nine times on the BBC’s Sunday Politics. On Friday, Mr Salmond, the former SNP leader who is expected to lead the party in Westminster after the election, said Scotland could ‘call the tune’ in the Commons. ‘It is now clear that neither Tory nor Labour will win an overall majority,’ he said. ‘Neither are fit to govern. ‘It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament.’ At the same time, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon removed the biggest obstacle to a Labour-SNP deal by ditching her red line on Trident. She said her party could back a minority Labour government in key votes even if it had not secured an agreement to scrap the nuclear deterrent. Labour MPs say the party has ‘decided internally’ not to rule out an SNP pact before the election. This will be particularly concerning to English voters who fear the price of concessions the SNP will seek to extract from Labour in return for handing Mr Miliband the keys to No 10. Peeping from the breast pocket of a giant Alex Salmond, Ed Miliband is portrayed as a mere plaything of the SNP in the Tories’ latest poster. Lips pursed, he appears pensive and childlike as the larger-than-life Scottish nationalist looks down on him with a patronising smirk. The poster’s clear aim is to suggest Mr Salmond will have free rein to boss Mr Miliband around if their parties form a coalition in May. Last night the pair were immediately dubbed ‘Big Eck and Little Ed’. The Tory campaign drew comparisons to ITV’s Spitting Image, which mercilessly lampooned politicians in the 1980s and 1990s. Its targets included David Owen and David Steel, joint leaders of the SDP/Liberal Alliance. Mr Steel was lampooned as Mr Owen’s adoring sidekick and sometimes appeared in his pocket, left.

"Jay Z hosted the music industry's biggest stars at a glittering business meeting  to lament 'crass commercialization' and plot their own rival to Spotify, it is claimed. Madonna, Kanye West, Nicki Minaj, Daft Punk, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Jack White, Rihanna, an unnamed prominent country singer, and Jay Z's wife Beyoncé all gathered in February to share their thoughts, Showbiz 411 reported. And today the rapper, whose real name is Shawn Carter, confirmed his $54 million purchase of Swedish streaming network Aspiro, parent company of music platform WiMP. The program, which he plans to rename TidalHifi, will uniquely allow artists to profit from their material and directly upload quality tracks. Daft Punk's two members were key figures in deciding on a strategy during the meeting days before the Grammy Awards at The Fig House event space in a remote part of Pasadena, Los Angeles, a source told Showbiz 411. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Glittering business: Jay Z hosted some of the music industry's biggest names, including his wife Beyoncé (pictured together in 2014) at a secret meeting last month to discuss the commercialization of the industry . Putting their heads together: Nicki Minaj and Madonna joined the group in a remote event space in Pasadena, Los Angeles, days before the Grammy Awards in February to share their ideas (both pictured last month) Kanye West, pictured at Paris Fashion Week, was full of ideas that he kept blurting out, Showbiz 411 reported . They apparently suggested artists should be involved in curating and editing that material on the network. Meanwhile Kanye West was 'out of control'. A source told the site: 'He blurts things out. Jay Z kept him by his side and joked that he was his ""interpreter"".' On Friday, a spokesman for Project Panther Bidco, a company controlled by the 45-year-old rapper, said all the conditions for completing the acquisition of Aspiro had now been fulfilled. Owners representing more than 90 percent of shares in the Swedish-listed firm accepted the $54 million offer on Wednesday, the spokesman said. Panther Bidco will now initiate the compulsory purchase of the remaining Aspiro shares, as well as delisting the company from Nasdaq Stockholm. Rihanna arrived late to the meeting but contributed thoughts alongside Coldplay's Chris Martin, reports say . Daft Punk are said to have made persuasive contributions, saying artists should curate the stream . Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter (left) and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (right) were among the selected few . Completing the line-up, as well as an unnamed country music singer, was singer Jack White .

In January, shares in Aspiro, which runs music streaming service WiMP, leaped 59 per cent in early trading to the bid level of 1.05 crowns per share. 'I think they will be a better owner to lift Aspiro and its advanced music streaming service to a new level,' said Trond Berger, the financial director of Norwegian media group Shibsted, currently Aspiro's majority owner. At the end of the third quarter of 2014, Wimp said it had 512,000 paying users in Germany, Poland and the Nordic countries. That is a far cry from its Nordic rival Spotify, a pioneer in the streaming music business. The unlisted company boasted 15 million paying subscribers in mid-January and is available in 58 countries. Norwegian business daily Dagens Naeringsliv reported in January that Jay Z's company was particularly interested in Wimp's high-fidelity Tidal streaming service which is being launched on the US market. 'The Wimp/Tidal service has the potential for greatness, given that it has high-end audio capabilities,' music specialist Simon Dyson at corporate analytics firm Ovum told AFP in an email, adding that the $56-million price tag was 'not excessive'. It would need substantial investments to challenge Spotify or US tech giant Apple's widely expected entry into the market later this year after acquiring Beats Music from another rap star, Dr Dre, in 2014.

"Jordan's Queen Rania is spearheading a push to encourage more people to travel to the Middle Eastern kingdom despite terrorist threats or political turmoil in neighbouring countries. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline Travel, she said she is surprised that more Britons don't visit Jordan and assurred holidaymakers that it is safe and filled with unique experiences. 'Britons prefer an unconventional experience and we have so much to offer,' she said. Scroll down for video . Queen Rania, pictured, says tourists to Jordan should expect a 'warm' reception from locals . Her comments came during a tourism event in Amman in which the 44-year-old royal also said the country was stuck 'between a rock and a hard place' - a reference to the conflicts that have blighted the Middle East since 2011. Despite Jordan's 'bad neighbours', she continued, Britons and others should consider the country 'safe' to visit. Since the murder of pilot Muath al-Kasasbi, 26, at the hands of ISIS in February, tourism to the country has plummeted by 17.8 per cent - continuing a trend that begun two years ago. Tourism to Jordan has plummeted by 17.8 per cent - continuing a trend that begun two years ago . Just a five-hour flight from the UK, Jordan is around 15 degrees warmer and abundant with fascinating history and culture. The striking reds and soft undulations of the desert, the implausibly beautiful valley of Wadi Rum rum, cut into the sandstone and granite and the bouyant Dead sea waters should be enough to stir your wanderlust. In the Unesco World Heritage Site of Petra, famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system visit the treasury and the ancient Nabatean aqueducts. Or explore the Greco-Roman city of Jerash, taking in the monuments including the Temple of Artemis and Temple of Zeus. Climb the 800 steps of the Ad-Deir Monastery or go camel trekking through the desert at sunrise. As a result, the country is desperately trying to drum up interest abroad, with tourism chiefs pointing the continued calm in capital Amman and in major tourist sites such as Petra. However, Jordan has borders with both Iraq and Syria, and is part of the coalition currently conducting air strikes targeting the terrorists of ISIS.

'People will invite you to share a cup of tea or a meal. You will always get a warm welcome.' The royal also spoke of the country's history, which includes more than 500,000 sites of archaeological interest, among them 12 crusader-built desert castles and the mighty Petra, and of its striking Dead Sea coastline.

"They show the wonders of the world around us in incredible detail, providing views that could never be seen without the latest in imaging technology. These striking pictures have been selected as the best scientific images of the year in the Wellcome Image Awards 2015. Among the winners are the bulging eye of a greenfly magnified through an electron microscope and the papillae that create the rough surface of a cat's tongue. This image of a greenfly's eye (left) shows the thousands of lenses pointing in all directions on its surface while the aurora-like image of a cross-section of a mouse brain reveals the complex network of neurons at different depths, with red being the nearest and green the furthest away . Others show the strange beauty of a goat's stomach and the neuron connections inside a mouse brain lit up like a multi-coloured aurora. Another gruesome, but also strangely touching image, shows the dissected uterus of a New Forest pony preserved in perspex at the Royal Veterinary College, with the fetus still inside the placenta. Dr Adam Rutherford, the geneticist and broadcaster who was a member of the judging panel, said: 'The breath-taking riches of the imagery that science generates are so important in telling stories about research and helping us to understand often abstract concepts. 'It's not just about imaging the very small either, it's about understanding life, death, sex and disease: the cornerstones of drama and art. 'Once again, the Wellcome Image Awards celebrate all of this and more with this year’s incredible range of winning images.'

In total there are 20 images that have been selected as winners in the awards by a panel of nine judges. The overall winner of the competition is due to be announced at a ceremony in London next week. The images are to go on show in exhibitions around the world including Bristol, Glasgow, Dundee, Cornwall, Galveston, Texas, Belfast and Boston, Massachusetts. In one picture - which looks more like a Jackson Pollock painting - the colour coded map of a fruit fly's nervous system is revealed. The image on the left shows an interactive multi-sensory unit that vibrates, bubbles and lights up to distract and comfort anxious children receiving treatment in hospital while the image on the right reveals bundles of nerve fibres inside a healthy adult living human brain are revealed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to virtually slice the brain from front to back, with the front of the head on the left side of the image . The image on the left shows a map of a mouse kidney as it breaks down food to make energy while the tiny bumps on the image on the right are the papillae - tiny bumps - that make a cats tongue feel rough seen using a light microscope in a slide made by Victorian scientists . The yellow neuron is able to sense vibrations while messages entering and leaving neurons at synapses are shown as blue and red circles. The orange circles are mitochondria.

The close up view of the greenfly eye shows in detail the thousands of tiny lenses facing in different on its surface that enable the insect to see very fast movements. The insects are unable to see fine details or distant objects however. A scanning electron microscope also helped researchers capture the image of the head of a boll weevil found on the front porch of a suburban house in the USA.

"A star that is travelling fast enough to escape the gravitational clutches of our galaxy has been discovered by a team of astronomers. The amazing stellar object attained its rapid speed when a nearby star exploded as a supernova, sending it out of the Milky Way. At its current speed it would make the journey from Earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the Apollo spacecraft three days. Scroll down for a video showing an artist's impression of the event . Astronomers in Hawaii have found the fastest 'unbound' star in the galaxy. Called US 708 it is moving at 745 miles (1,200km) per second. It will leave the galaxy in about 25 million years. This artist's concept shows a star (left) being ejected from the galaxy, although in reality the supernova would have been faded long ago . The star, known as US 708, was first discovered in 1982 by Dr Peter Usher of Pennsylvania State University but had since then remained ignored. However, a team of astronomers led by the University of Hawaii at Manoa has now re-examined the star, and found that it breaks the galactic speed record for an 'unbound' star. US 708 is almost 62,000 light-years from Earth, and is on a path that will take it out of the Milky Way in about 25 million years. Type 1a: A white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes. Non-standard type 1a: Two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion. Type II: A star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out, causing it to explode. Type 1b and 1c: A star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds. Hypernova: Extreme type of supernova, 50 times as energetic as other supernovas, resulting in a black hole. The exact cause of them is unknown. Using the 10-metre Keck II and Pan-Starrs1 telescopes in Hawaii, the astronomers calculated that the star is moving at about 745 miles (1,200km) per second. This makes it the fastest ‘rogue’ star in the galaxy - one that is no longer orbiting the centre. ‘At that speed, you could travel from Earth to the moon in five minutes,’ said Dr Eugene Magnier of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. ‘By observing the sky repeatedly over several years, the Pan-Starrs1 survey, let us make a movie of the motions of the stars in the sky. ‘That enables us to study the behavioirs of extremely rare and weird stars like US 708.’ While a handful of other stars escaping the galaxy are known, this is the first to have been found that was ejected by a thermonuclear supernova explosion. US 708, which is a helium-rich white dwarf, was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up. At the speed US 708 is travelling it would make the journey from Earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the Apollo astronauts three days. Pictured is the view of Earth seen by the Apollo 8 crew as they circled the moon in December 1968 . This particular class of supernova is known as type 1a, where material is transferred between one star and another until one reaches a critical mass, and explodes. Often, the secondary star is obliterated in the resulting explosion, or pushed away at a more sedate speed. It is 'pushed' away because the loss of its companion means it no longer has a star to orbit, but retains its forwards momentum, so it is flung into space. The specific characteristics of this binary system, its distance and the mass of its companion, allowed US 708 to remain intact while still achieving record speeds for an unbound star. Stars like the sun are bound to our galaxy by its gravity, and orbit its centre at relatively moderate velocities, typically tens to a few hundreds of kilometres per second. Only so-called hyperveolocity stars are known to travel so fast that they are unbound to the galaxy. US 708, which is a helium-rich white dwarf, was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up (illustration shown). It is the first star found to be leaving the galaxy caused by such an event, and could provide an insight into these types of supernova . In addition, to escape from the Milky Way an object needs to exceed the ‘escape velocity’ - the strength of its gravitational pull. The escape velocity of our galaxy is about 375 miles (600km) per second, which US 708 easily exceeds. Astronomers hope that studying the star could help reveal how such helium-rich stars and thermonuclear supernovae are linked.","Astronomers in Hawaii have found the fastest 'unbound' star in the galaxy .

"Albert Bevins died last year after being diagnosed with dementia and suffering hallucinations . The family of a great-grandfather with dementia fear he may have hanged himself while acting out a 'vivid dream' that was triggered by a TV documentary about Harold Shipman. Albert Bevins died in Eachstep nursing home in Blackley, Manchester, the day after  a programme was shown about Harold Shipman, a GP who killed 215 elderly patients with lethal injections. The 85-year-old was prone to vivid hallucinations, the result of untreated dementia, at the time of his death, an inquest heard. Family members fear he may have died during one such dream, with the widower having previously been found sleepwalking and acting out his hallucinations. At an inquest into his death, his daughter, Joanne Jones, said he had become plagued with paranoia since being diagnosed with dementia. 'The only conclusion I can come to regarding his death is he had very vivid dreams,' she said. 'He always thought the family was in danger, especially his grandsons and great-grandsons. 'He thought something had happened to them in the night like a car crash and he wouldn't be consoled until he spoke to us. 'He used to live out his dreams but we just don’t know what dream he had that night.' She added she feared a documentary on television the previous night about Shipman, who killed hundreds of elderly patients, may have sparked caused her father to hallucinate. 'I thought ""could he have been watching that and that has triggered something?"" He would see things on the TV and related it to himself.' The 85-year-old was being cared for at Eachstep home in Blackley, Manchester, at the time of his death . Mr Bevins was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2012 and moved into Eachstep care home the following year. Despite revisiting doctors in 2014, nothing was prescribed to treat his worsening condition which had started to cause him to hallucinate. Experts told the inquest that 'important elements' of assessment were missed out during the latter visit to doctors. The former office clerk died in April last year at around 7am, with staff at the specialist house having checked on him in his room just two hours earlier. An investigation into Mr Bevins's diagnosis was launched by the NHS trust after his death. At its conclusion, psychiatrist Dr Sean Lennon from the Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust said Mr Bevins's condition,  dementia with Lewy Bodies, was not treated soon enough. 'The referral wasn't responded to urgently...there were a number of delays in providing him with the care he required,' he told the Manchester inquest. 'He should have been offered treatment which may have improved the psychotic symptoms but it may well have been he could be managed by further assessment.' Recording a narrative conclusion that Mr Bevins took his own life coroner Jean Harkin said: 'His time in the care home was, by all accounts, good. 'He was very well looked after and the family here have reported staff made him feel wanted. 'It is clear from the staff that he was a very well-liked gentleman and this has been a very traumatic experience not only for the family but also for the staff who looked after him.' The widower's family fear he may have been having a dream sparked by a television documentary about killer Harold Shipman (pictured above) Harold Shipman, a GP who murdered patients by administering killer injections, is described as one of the most prolific serial killers in Britain's history. For years the doctor went unnoticed as he prescribed patients with death sentences, killing them off for no other reason than for his own entertainment. Born in Leeds, the former doctor was his considered his mother's favourite child. After she was diagnosed with lung cancer, he oversaw her decline and carefully observed the effects of morphine as a means of pain relief. Following her death he vowed to attend medical school and later qualified to become a doctor, registering with a practice in Yorkshire in the early 1970s. He later moved to Hyde with his family where his sadistic tendencies were revealed. It was a local undertaker who first raised concerns after an unusually high number of Shipman's patients died in similar circumstances. Largely they were recorded as having been found propped up on a sofa, fully clothed, at the time of their deaths. An inquiry was launched after one of Shipman's colleagues expressed similar concerns but he was cleared. But after a more thorough investigation police discovered he had altered medical records to evade suspicion. In 1998, Shipman was arrested for the murder of several patients. He consistently denied the allegations and was, according to investigators, arrogant throughout police interviews. A trial found him guilty of the murders of 15 patients though experts believe he is responsible for hundreds of other deaths. Pathology reports found morphine toxicity was the cause of death among most of his victims. In 2004, four years after being jailed for his crimes, Shipman's body was found hanging in the cell of the Wakefield Prison where he was being held.

"Judith Brown-Mitchell married Roy Mitchell eight days before he died and then stole £15,000 of his granddaughter's inheritance . A 'black widow' who married a man on his death bed just eight days before he died has been jailed for stealing his granddaughter's inheritance. Judith Brown, 55, wed Roy Mitchell, 66, just over a week before he died after a long illness in 2011, but he changed his will so she would be the main beneficiary and trustee. Of Mr Mitchell's £180,000 estate, £60,000 was supposed to be divided between his four grandchildren to be spent on their education - but the widow stole £15,000. Brown-Mitchell, as she became known after she married, was Mr Mitchell's carer as he battled bowel cancer in 2011. He changed his will at the end of August that year and the pair, who met in 2006, married days later - but the then terminally ill man's family were not invited and were only told of the marriage by text message. Mr Mitchell's family also had no idea his will had been changed in Mitchell-Brown's favour until he died. After his death on September 10, 2011, Brown-Mitchell, of Haverthwaite,  Cumbria, should have handed over £60,000 for the children's education but refused to do so, Preston Crown Court heard. Eventually £45,000 of this was seized after a previous court hearing, but the rest of the inheritance - meant for the eldest granddaughter - was 'squandered', as well as a further £100,000 spent on 'shopping and entertaining herself'. Judge Howard Bentham criticised Brown-Mitchell for stealing £15,000 from a minor as he jailed her for two years. He said the defence of her actions was 'incredible' and said she had 'wilfully and deliberately' failed in her actions as a trustee. Jeremy Grout-Smith, prosecuting, told the court how Brown-Mitchell, who fostered young offenders before being struck down with multiple sclerosis, had pleaded guilty to the theft of £15,000 between September 2011 and October 2014. He said she had struck up a friendship with Mr Mitchell in 2006 and when he had fallen ill had become his carer. 'Black widow': Brown-Mitchell married Mr Mitchell on his deathbed, with his family only finding out about the wedding by text message . Mr Mitchell, 66, pictured with his daughter Nina, died in 2011 after losing his battle with bowel cancer . Mr Grout-Smith said: 'He didn't want to die in hospital so he moved into her home and at weekends they would go to his caravan on the Holker Estate. He had bought a caravan there because of his love of the Lake District. 'He changed his will on August 31, 2011 and married the defendant in a deathbed marriage on September 2. He died eight days later. Brown-Mitchell was jailed for two years for stealing from a minor . 'She was the executor and trustee of the will and was to give a legacy of £15,000 to each of the four grandchildren, which they would get once they reached the age of 18. 'He had left his estate, valued at £180,000, to the defendant.' Mr Grout-Smith added that the cash was never handed over and a long legal battle ensued. In the meantime Brown-Mitchell had been convicted of benefit fraud after failing to declare the inheritance. Donna Mitchell, the deceased's daughter, said in her impact statement: '[Brown-Mitchell] isolated him from us and his friends. She married him when he was dying and he changed his will. We never got to see him again as by the time we did he was in and out of consciousness. 'She has shown no remorse and doesn't seem to care.' But Laura Heywood, defending the 'black widow', said that Mr Mitchell's relationship with his daughters had deteriorated. She said: 'It wasn't all happy families at all. Brown-Mitchell had put £45,000 in a 10-year plan to safeguard it and was keeping the other £15,000 as the eldest grandchild would be 18 before that plan matured. 'She has ended up depressed by the way she has been pursued by the family. She thinks she also had a breakdown as one day she bought 36 cans of cat food and she doesn't even own a cat. 'Her strongest mitigation is that she pleaded guilty. She is remorseful for what happened. She never intended to spend this money but she has used it on the cost of general living.' Nina Taylor (left), Mr Mitchell's (right) daughter, said the family referred to Mitchell-Brown as a 'black widow' as they cannot bear to say her name . After Mr Mitchell's (centre right) death in September 2011, Brown-Mitchell should have handed over £60,000 for the children's education but refused to do so . Judge Bentham said: 'I am sentencing you for stealing £15,000 from a minor when you were trustee of the estate. 'You have squandered £100,000 from the estate and you have wilfully and deliberately failed in your actions as a trustee. 'Your defence was incredible. You will go to prison for two years.' Brown-Mitchell remained emotionless as she was led away to the cells. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Mitchell's 17-year-old granddaughter Charlotte - who was due the stolen money - sobbed as she described how she missed her granddad and the trauma the case had caused. She said: 'I'm so glad it's all over. I'm happy she has gone to prison after what she did. 'She has caused so much pain and heartache for our family.' Mr Mitchell's daughter Nina Taylor, 42, said: 'This has been a very long and traumatic time for me and my family causing a great loss of money to us along with the children. 'I have been off work due to anxiety and panic attacks on medication for stress. 'For the past three-and-a-half years my sister and myself have spent time going to civil court due to inheritance my father left for his four grandchildren. 'Mrs Brown-Mitchell was a friend of my father's for a number of years though I believe that she knew my father had a long-term illness. She tried to cut off my father's family and friends. 'Due to a court order we did manage to take over a policy in Mrs Brown Mitchell's name of £45,000 without her consent but still there was £15,000 missing and also costs of £10,000 approximately which have not been paid. 'This has been a very traumatic time for myself, my sister our families and the grandchildren.' Daughters Mrs Taylor (left) and Donna Mitchell (right) said the last three-and-a-half years had been 'traumatic' Mrs Taylor, a teaching assistant from Warrington, added: 'I believe that she played on my father and whilst he was very ill turned him against us. 'This is a heartbreaking situation that Mrs Brown-Mitchell has caused. We call her the black widow as we can't stand to say her name. 'I have trouble sleeping at night as this situation is constantly playing on my mind and have also been prescribed sleeping tablets. 'I cannot think about anything else, I am unable to trust people and my children cannot understand how an adult can do such a disgusting thing and possibly get away with it. 'My daughter Charlotte is due to go to university and my father's wishes were that the grandchildren use their inheritance for property or education. As Charlotte's is the missing money she will be unable to use this.' She added: 'We can now get on with our lives. I have no sympathy for her. She's a black widow and deserves all she gets. 'I would say that I hope she rots in hell but we got justice and that's all that matters. She took our dad away from us.'","Judith Brown married Roy Mitchell just eight days before he died of cancer .

"A Nashville bar owner was convicted of second-degree murder on Friday for the fatal shooting of a country singer-songwriter. Chris Ferrell, 46, had told jurors that he shot Wayne Mills in November 2013 in self defense. But Nashville jurors sided with prosecutors who argued that Ferrell intended to kill Mills when he shot him after a heated argument at his now-defunct bar. Ferrell testified that the two got into an argument at his Pit and Barrel bar in the city's downtown area and that Mills threatened to kill him. Scroll down for video . Nashville bar owner Chris Ferrell (pictured on Thursday) was found guilty of second-degree murder on Friday for shooting country singer Wayne Mills in the head during a heated argument at his now-defunct bar . Ferrell and singer Mills (pictured) were friends before the fatal shooting, according to family members in 2013 . 'I reached to the top of the cooler and retrieved my .22-caliber,' Ferrell said, according to The Tennessean. 'And I fired it. I fired in fear.' Ferrell said he grabbed bar towels to try and stop the bleeding, but then began to panic and put an unloaded gun next to Mills. 'Why would that cause you to panic?' David Raybin, Ferrell's attorney, asked him. 'Because I thought I'd, because I thought I'd done something wrong at that point,' Ferrell said about the shooting, which happened at about 5am. Ferrell (left) claimed he was only protecting himself when he shot Wayne Mills (right) in the head at his bar in November 2013 . Mills toured primarily college campuses for more than 15 years as the lead singer of the Wayne Mills Band. Country music singers Jamey Johnson and Blake Shelton opened for the band before becoming stars . An autopsy found that Mills was shot in the back of the head. He also had two broken ribs, bruises and scrapes, according to WKRN. The jury reached their decision on the fifth day of trial that Ferrell was guilty. His attorneys said that they would appeal, according to The Tennessean. Mills toured for more than 15 years as the lead singer of the Wayne Mills Band. Country music stars Jamey Johnson and Blake Shelton, as well as American Idol winner Taylor Hicks, all opened for the band in their early careers. The Pit and Barrel bar, where Mills was killed, was supposed to be featured on an episode of the SPIKE TV reality show Bar Rescue the day after the shooting . Mills graduated from the University of Alabama with an education degree, and also played football for the school. He moved to Nashville in 2003. The two men were previously friends, according to family members in 2013. Following the night of the incident, SPIKE TV was set to feature the bar on its show Bar Rescue, which brings in a professional restaurant consultant to give struggling pubs a make-over. The network canceled the new episode and aired a re-run instead. Ferrell faces 15 to 25 years in prison and will be sentenced on April 10. Ferrell testified in 2013 (pictured above) that he had received a dozen death threats since the killing - but insisted he acted in self defense .","Chris Ferrell, 46, claimed country singer Wayne Mills threatened to kill him .

"'Absolutely no peas!' booms Luis as he dispatches me to the market. I'm in Valencia, Spain's third largest city. Not for the Las Fallas festival (a huge affair every March when giant papier-mache figures of politicians are burned amid lively street celebrations), but for its other claim to fame - it is the home of paella. Luis is a top chef who leads paella-making classes. But first I have to get the ingredients. Dinner is served: Paella originated in Valencia, using ingredients which could be sourced cheaply and locally . The central market is in a glorious art nouveau building in the old quarter, with more than 500 stalls selling every Spanish food imaginable. I buy an 'arrangement' of rabbit and chicken portions from a butcher. Then I choose three different types of beans. Paella Valenciana was created from what was easily available to local farmers. This meant rice from the local paddy fields, and beans, rabbit and chicken from their land. It's wrong to add peas, as we Brits do, apparently. Under Luis's watchful eye, I learn how to chop the meat and cook it and the beans in different parts of the pan. I sieve fresh tomato and dabble in smoked pimento for flavour. The secret is about how to put the rice into the water. Luis tells me to add it in two straight lines in the form of a cross (seemingly, for perfect absorption). I add fresh rosemary, remembering to remove it after ten minutes. It seems to work and in around 20 minutes my glossy, golden rice dish is complete. Delicious, though I say so myself. Luis awards me my diploma: I am now a 'paella ambassador'. If you want to know more about this famous dish and its variations, contact Patrick Waller. Originally from Bromley, he moved to Valencia 23 years ago when he fell in love with a local, Julia Espin. A real mixed bag: True paella can contain seafood and rabbit - but should never feature peas . They run the Paella Project, taking in all aspects of buying fresh produce at the market, cooking classes, wine tastings and a visit to Xativa in the hills with lessons and meal preparation outdoors. You can also explore the famous rice fields of the Albufera National Park, just 15 minutes outside Valencia. They blew me away. You can take a boat trip on the vast lagoon or enjoy the pine-fringed, wild beaches and restaurants of nearby El Saler village. Valencia has fantastic white beaches, too, just five minutes from the city centre. There are endless orange tree patios (proper orange juice everywhere); walks along the former Turia riverbed; the Unesco listed Lonja (silk hall), which dates to1548; and superb shopping, including five El Corte Ingles department stores. Balconies of intricate metal designs and specialist cafes called horchaterias, with marble-topped tables serving a traditional Valencian drink made from tiger nuts and sugar, remind me this is the real Spain. Kirker Holidays (020 7593 1899, www.kirkerholidays.com) has three nights at Melia Plaza Hotel from £559 per person, based on two sharing, including flights from Gatwick, private transfers and B&B. Paella classes cost from £50 (www.escueladearrocesypaellas.com); four-day Paella Project from £475, including accommodation (www.thespanishthymetraveller.com).","Valencia, in the south-east of Spain, is the traditional home of paella .

"A girl, eight, escaped the horror that came down on her family as a man living with them is accused of killing her father and sister, and critically injuring three other relatives. The young girl ran to safety hiding behind a trailer  during the shooting that took place on Friday at her family home in Mississippi, according to WJTV. The father, Jermaine Sims Sr., 31, and daughter Jamiyah Sims, nine, died on Friday morning while in hospital. The mother, Victoria, 29, their six-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter survived but were in critical condition, said Capt. Clint Earls. Police did not release the children's names. Jimmy Lyons, 32, lived in the Sims' home and is accused of shooting the family, and faces two counts of murder and three of aggravated assault. He is being held in the Lincoln County jail. The bloody survivors crossed a usually busy two-lane highway to ask for help, said neighbors who called 911 after waking early Friday to find the mother and two children at their door. 'It was like out of a horror movie,' said Donna Davis, 39. 'I still see that little girl's face in my mind.' Scroll down for video . Jermaine Sims (left), 31, died along with his nine-year-old daughter Jamiyah (right) while in hospital following the shooting at their family home in Mississippi . Jimmy Lyons (above), 32, lived in the Sims' home and is accused of shooting the family . The bloody survivors crossed a usually busy two-lane highway to ask for help, said neighbors who called 911 after waking early Friday to find the mother and two children at their door (above scenes from the shooting at the family home) A woman who said she is the grandmother, Ethel Brown, told WJTV that Jamiyah was shot five times in the head. The mother, who was reportedly shot in the back several times, was taken to Southwest Mississippi Medical Center for treatment. The two other children who were injured during the shooting are at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, all with gunshot wounds, according to the Clarion-Ledger. The father's cousin, Ray Sims, said his relatives were helping Lyons by allowing him to live with them in their home. He said: 'It's hard, we don't have the answers. Right now we're trying to maintain and remain strong. The bloody survivors, including mother Victoria Sims (right), 14-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son and crossed a usually busy two-lane highway to ask for help, said neighbors who called 911 after waking early Friday to find the mother and two children at their door (left the four Sims children pictured) The father's cousin, Ray Sims (above), said his relatives were helping Lyons by allowing him to live with them in their home . 'You never think this can happen to your family and when it does it just takes you by surprise.' Brookhaven Police Chief Bobby Bell, who said  this is the worst shooting he has seen in his 35-year career, also said Lyons has already admitted to the shootings. He said: 'We have evidence that we have collected from the crime scene to send to the crime lab, and we're going to have to interview the survivors of this situation once they're able to talk to us.' The shooting reportedly followed an argument between Jermaine Sims and Lyons, but he did not know what the argument was about, according to Capt. Earls. Earls said there do not appear to have been any other witnesses. 'The only thing we are waiting on is getting some of the victims in well-enough health to where they can shed some light on what caused the incident to erupt,' Earls said. Police said a call about 12.20a.m. brought police to the neighbors' home, where they found Victoria Sims and two children outside, wounded. Inside the Sims' home they found Lyons, who was not injured, and Jermaine Sims and Jamiyah. Linda Davis, 65, John Davis, 41, and Donna Davis said they did not understand what had happened or who did what at the Sims' house because so many people were talking at once before an ambulance arrived. The shootings took place in an area about a mile south of downtown Brookhaven: inside city limits but rural in nature, its large yards studded with pine trees. At one point, Linda Davis (above) said, the six-year-old boy reached up to his face and said, 'Oh, half my ear is gone' Brookhaven Police Chief Bobby Bell (above), who said this is the worst shooting he has seen in 35 years, also said Lyons has already admitted to the shootings . The younger Davises and their 10-year-old daughter, Heaven, live in a white-and-beige trailer home next to Linda Davis' small cream-colored house. Both are located across the highway, about 100 yards away from the Sims' brown, wood-frame house. The Davises said they often saw the children getting on and off the school bus or riding bicycles in the yard, but did not know their neighbors. Donna Davis said that when she answered her door, someone kept saying, 'We've been hit.' There was so much blood, she said, that she thought they had been hit by a car. 'The little boy, he was half under the porch like he was trying to hide from someone. He was screaming for help,' she said, pointing to the rickety-looking wooden steps leading to the trailer door. At one point, Linda Davis said, he reached up to his face and said, 'Oh, half my ear is gone.' John Davis said the boy's wounds included cuts on his face, as if he'd been attacked with a knife. Donna Davis said that, while they waited for an ambulance, she hugged the girl to keep her warm. 'She kept saying, 'I want my mama,'' Donna Davis said.","Jimmy Lyons, 32, is accused of shooting the residents of a home in which he was living; faces murder and aggravated assault charges .

"Assault: The flight was diverted after the passenger attacked the stewardess (stock image) An easyJet flight made an emergency landing in Rome  when an angry passenger punched a stewardess because he was 'waiting too long for a sandwich'. The furious traveller shouted: 'I've been waiting for hours, I'm hungry', before assaulting the young cabin crew member, eyewitnesses said. The drama erupted aboard the British budget airline's flight from Geneva to Pristina in Kosovo this morning. A witness who was sitting near the man said: 'He shouted at the stewardess, then he stood up and punched her, and when she fell to the floor, he carried on hitting her.' Fellow passengers then stepped in to restrain the man, while the pilot diverted the plane to Fumincino airport in the Italian capital for 'security reasons'. EasyJet confirmed the attack and said its cabin crew member had been injured and her glasses had been broken (stock image) The stewardess later told Swiss newspaper 20 Minutes: 'I was totally shocked. I can't understand how anyone could react so violently over a sandwich.' Italian police arrested a man while the stewardess received medical attention at the scene, an eyewitness said. EasyJet confirmed the attack and said its cabin crew member had been injured and her glasses had been broken. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet can confirm that flight EZS1483 from Geneva to Pristina on 31 March diverted to Rome as a result of a passenger onboard behaving in a disruptive manner. 'The aircraft was met by the police on arrival in Rome and the passenger was arrested. 'The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always easyJet's priority. 'Whilst such incidents are rare we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour onboard and always push for prosecution.' The 180 passengers were taken on to Pristina on a separate flight later in the afternoon.

"America has long been known for its cultural diversity but the rise of the Hispanic population is unlike any other minority group in the country's history. By mid-century, up to one in four Americans will be of Hispanic descent and the white majority will give way to a so-called 'minority majority.' The US Census Bureau defines Hispanic or Latino to refer to 'a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American (except for Brazil), or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.' The Economist reports that more lenient immigration laws in the 1960s took the Hispanic population from just 7m in 1970 to 57m today, a number which is predicted to double by 2050. Rise of Hispanic America: Hispanics are becoming the nation's largest minority but inequalities between whites and Hispanics still exist . The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 abolished the quota system based on national origin. National quotas limited the number of people who were allowed immigrate from other countries. Thanks to the Civil Rights Movement, the immigration policy shifted and became focused on reuniting immigrant families and attracting new labor to the United States. For nearly two centuries and up until the time Ronald Reagan was president, white European immigrants made up to 80 per cent of the US population. Now less than two thirds of the population are white and whites will be a minority by 2044, says Census Bureau. Since 2000, the population of the United States has grown by slightly over 40 million people. Thirty five million , or 90 percent, of that growth is from minorities - Hispanics, Asian Americans and African Americans, says a report published byBusiness Wire. The U.S. Hispanic population jumped to 58.2 million in 2015, an increase of 2 million during the past year, says the same report. The growth of the Hispanic population is due to both convenient geography and rising birth rates, says The Economist. The United States is close in proximity to Hispanics' several countries of origin which makes immigration and communicating with families back home much easier. Increase in numbers: More lenient immigration laws in the 1960s took the Hispanic population from just 7m in 1970 to 57m today, a number which is predicted to double by 2050 . Rapid growth: Close geography of Latin countries to the United States and growing birth rates among Hispanics in America is causing rapid population growth compared to other minorities . Currently, 85percent of Hispanics are legal residents and Latino growth is not so much from immigration anymore as it is from births in the United States. According to a study published by Pew Research on March 9, births within the Hispanic community drives 78 per cent of population growth in the United States. Despite Hispanic growth, many inequalities still exist between whites and minority groups. Currently American Hispanics earn less money, on average, than white Americans. The median income of Hispanic homes at $36,949 and the medium income of white households at a much larger $75,448. With almost 1million US-born Latinos reaching voting age annually, and Latinos making up a significant portion of America's labor force,  income is expected to rise along with nationwide education reform. US companies have also been advised to shift their focus to Hispanic consumers who will be making up a majority of the US population and will account for much of the nation's future spending habits. The future: It is predicted that by 2050 there will be double the amount of Hispanics than there are today . Shift from immigration to native births: Currently, five-sixths of Hispanics are legal residents and Latino growth is not so much from immigration anymore as it is from births in the United States .","More lenient immigration laws in the 1960s took the Hispanic population from just 7m in 1970 to 57m today .
The number of Hispanics today is predicted to double by 2050 .
European whites once made up 80 per cent of the American population but will be a minority by 2044 .
Geographic closeness of Hispanic countries to the U.S. along with rising birth rates among Hispanics within the country account for the growth ."
"The search for the remaining bodies from tragic AirAsia flight QZ8501 has officially ended. Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's rescue agency, confirmed that the ships involved in the search were pulled out on Wednesday. AirAsia lost contact with flight QZ 8501 on December 28 as it was flying from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore with 162 people on board. The search effort has recovered 106 bodies, with 56 still missing. Indonesian rescue personnel carry a coffin bearing the recovered body of an AirAsia flight QZ8501 victim onto a plane in Pangkalan Bun airport on Tuesday . AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes said that 'contingencies' would be put in place should not all the bodies be located . Rescuers wave at an Indonesian Air Force helicopter while standing around the rescued tail section of flight QZ8051 . The families of those missing will now have to try and go on with their lives, but the chance of them finding closure looks gone forever. Frangky Chandra, the older brother of Gani Chandra, an Indonesian man who was on board the plane, and whose body has not been found, told the BBC it was difficult for his family to move on. ‘We will never stop waiting,’ Mr Chandra said. He said 'the most important thing' was that DV1, the official search team, has said it will help with the identification process if any more bodies are found. Tony Fernandes, the CEO of AirAsia, told reporters last week that to 'get more than 50 per cent (of the bodies) is considered a huge success’. He said the airline was giving it 'one last shot' at recovering those still missing. But he added that the search could not ‘go on indefinitely’.

A total of 56 bodies still remain missing since the plane crashed into the Java Sea en route from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, on December 28, killing all 162 people on board. 'It is our responsibly to look after those families as best as we can,' Mr Fernandes said last week. He said he was in 'constant dialogue' with the families of those still missing, and that 'contingencies' would be put in place should not all the bodies be located. 'QZ8051 was probably the worst moment of my life and it continues to be something that will haunt me forever,' he said. Mr Fernandes would not be drawn on why the preliminary official report into the crash was not being made public. Indonesian investigators earlier this year submitted the report into the plane crash to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, keeping its contents secret. An Indonesian search and rescue helicopter prepares for landing on the Indonesian navy vessel KRI Timur Yunusov Aceh during operations in the Java Sea in January . Mr Fernandes said it was 'not right for him to say whether they should have or whether they shouldn't have' publicised the report, adding there must have been a 'valid reason' for the decision. He also defended AirAsia's safety record. 'All I can say is that we're regulated by lots and lots of authorities and no one has banned us from coming to their country,' he said. Mr Fernandes supports the move for better aircraft tracking technology . Mr Fernandes also said he supported better aircraft tracking technology amid the ongoing mystery about the whereabouts of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.

"Harrison Ford may have been survived Thursday's plane crash without life-threatening injury, but the actor's distraught wife is now urging him to take the hint and stay grounded permanently after his lucky escape. Ford has a passion for flying, but wife of five years, Calista Flockhart, 50, is strongly urging her 72-year-old husband that now is the time to call it quits because he might not be so fortunate next time. Ford suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured pelvis and broken ankle, when he crash landed his 1940s aircraft onto a Californian golf course, but he is expected to make a full recovery. Calista Flochart, 50, was pictured on Sunday on her way to UCLA hospital looking relieved and almost smiling as it emerged that Ford could be out as early as next week . The Ally McBeal star is strongly urging her 72-year-old husband Harrison Ford that now is the time to call it quits as a pilot after his lucky escape from a plane crash last Thursday . The Star Wars-star has a passion for flying his prized collection of planes . 'Calista is devastated. Thank goodness Harrison is OK but it could have been much, much worse,' a friend of the actress told The Mirror. 'It is a worry for her and his children that he has this dangerous hobby. 'Whether or not he will pilot a plane again remains to be seen but everyone around him certainly hopes he will take a break – or give it up for ever. It is ­obviously a huge worry.' The Ally McBeal star was pictured on Sunday on her way to UCLA hospital looking relieved and almost smiling as it emerged that Ford could be out as early as next week. Flockhart isn't the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend, Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher has also urged him to 'take a break' following his plane crash and take it easy. Bloodied: Harrison Ford is carried away from the scene of his plane crash on Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles on Thursday . Wreckage: Harrison Ford is believed to have suffered a pelvic fracture, ankle injuries, and multiple bruises and cuts after crashing his vintage single-engine plane . Addressing Harrison, she told PEOPLE magazine: 'I know you have incredible bounce back, please take a bounce break for awhile. Can I drive next time?' Fisher, who plays Princess Leia in the films, told The Mail on Sunday that she had a car smash in Los Angeles last Sunday – and now fears that one of her other co-stars will also suffer an accident. 'Things happen in threes,' she said. 'I'm about to call Mark Hamill [who plays Luke Skywalker] to make sure he's OK. I have a horrid feeling there's a curse going on here.' Ford, 72, remained in hospital last night after crashing his vintage single-engine plane on Thursday. It is believed he suffered a pelvic fracture, ankle injuries, and multiple bruises and cuts. The superstar was hailed as a hero for avoiding a densely populated area of Los Angeles after the engine failed. He brought the plane down on a golf course. Fisher, 58, met Ford when they starred in the original Star Wars film in 1977, in which he played daredevil Han Solo. Young guns: Harrison Ford (left), Carrie Fisher (Centre) and Mark Hamill (right) in 1977's Star Wars . Fisher (pictured), who plays Princess Leia in the films, has revealed that she was in a car smash in Los Angeles last Sunday . They have remained close friends and appear in the next instalment of the franchise. It was filmed in the UK last summer and is due for release in December. Fisher, who is known for her eccentric views on life, said: 'What is funny is that last Sunday it was raining hard in LA. I was driving to the art store and I got into an accident. 'It wasn't that serious and I wasn't hurt but it's the first car accident I've ever had. I drove home and that's when the wheel came off my BMW. My assistant told me I could have died if the wheel had come off when I was on the freeway.' Laughing, she added: 'Then I was watching the news and saw Harrison had his crash. 'I'm a bit worried it's the curse of Star Wars. 'The thing about Harrison is that he's always the coolest dude in the room. He just oozes manly manliness. I'm not surprised he landed the plane in one piece and survived.' Fisher has not spoken to Ford since the crash, but has sent him some beer. She explained that on one occasion they were planning to fly together. 'I was messing around and he said, 'Look, do you want to fly or can we have a beer?' 'He wouldn't have a drink if we were going to fly. It became something of a joke between us that I chose to have a beer that time rather than fly. I sent him some beers to the hospital with the message, 'You should have had a beer this time.' She added: 'He's primal. As a woman you feel safe with him. I fully expect he will be back up there soon – even if he's told he's not allowed to. Harrison isn't someone who follows the normal rules.' According to the Los Angeles Times, Ford is 'uninsurable'. In 1999 the father of five crashed his helicopter in the desert north of Los Angeles after the motor failed. A year later he was forced to crash-land a plane in Nebraska. Fisher said Ford's accident last summer on the set of Star Wars VII – when the door of the Millennium Falcon dropped on to his leg, shattering it – was 'more serious than was let on'. She added: 'It could have been billions of times worse.'","Calista Flockhart, 50, is strongly urging her husband that now is the time to call it quits as a pilot after his plane crash last Thursday .

"A schoolboy had to be rescued by firemen after ignoring his teacher's orders and climbing 40ft up the front of a museum - only to break down in tears when he became frozen with fear. The naughty 10-year-old stunned teachers when he decided to clamber up the plush stone front of the museum on the school trip with his class. But when he reached the top of a 40ft stone column his 'Spiderboy' adventure came to an end when he burst into tears and was unable to bring himself down. Scroll down for video .

'I'm sure he's a pain in the neck for his teachers but you had to feel sorry for the lad - he had his hands over his face and was crying his eyes out.' The schoolboy got stuck yesterday on a class trip to the museum which houses dinosaur fossils, a national history gallery and an extensive collection of world renowned artworks. A spokesman for South Wales Fire and Rescue said that they had been called to the museum at 1.20pm with reports that a boy was stuck in a 'precarious position'. He said they used an extension ladder to help rescue the boy safely and had worked with South Wales Police throughout. A National Museum Wales spokesperson said: 'We can confirm that a school pupil had attempted to climb up part of the building at the front of National Museum. 'We are very grateful to the emergency services for their work in bringing him down safely. We are pleased the situation has been resolved and no harm caused.'","Naughty schoolboy decided to climb Cardiff museum's 40ft stone column .

"A couple travelling in their car were killed after multiple hay bales slid off a semi-truck along a country road in Minnesota crashing into their vehicle. It's not clear how the bales came loose but the accident occurred as the truck went around a bend just after 9 a.m. on Saturday morning. Teresa Erickson, 52, and her husband Dale, 59, were driving their pickup in the opposite direction when they were unable to avoid the hay. Mr Erickson's car was forced into a ditch and burst into flames. Killed: Dale Erickson, 59, and Teresa Erickson, 52, died within days of each other after their vehicle crashed into a ditch on County Road 9 and caught fire on Saturday morning after they were hit by a bale of hay . Scene of the crash: The couple passed the truck carrying the hay along a curve on Houston County Road 9 northeast of Houston, Minnesota just after 9 a.m. on Saturday . The couple were airlifted to hospital in Wisconsin however Mrs Erickson died soon after the accident and her husband passed away earlier this week. The semi that caused the crash was driven by Randall Hongerholt, 49, of Houston, according to the state patrol. He was not injured but according to the Minnesota State Patrol, charges are pending following the outcome of an investigation into the crash. 'Commercial vehicles, and all vehicles, are required to secure their load in a manner that prevents any of it's load from dropping, shifting, leaking, blowing or otherwise escaping from the vehicle,' said Patrol Lt. Tiffani Nielson. 'This fatal crash, unfortunately, is exactly why we have these laws in place — to prevent injuries or death. 'This was a very tragic crash, and a family is grieving a terrible loss that could have been prevented.' Hay bales vary greatly in weight, depending not only on dimensions but density. A federal study analyzed seven deaths in Minnesota in the mid-1990s associated with large hay bales and found that the bales ranged from 750 to 1,500 pounds. In Minnesota, truckers can be fined $385 if they are found to have an improperly secured or shifting load.","As truck went around a curve on a road in Minnesota it lost its load of hay A pickup headed in the opposite direction was hit by one of the bales .

After making the threat, he handed the phone to his wife Kathy, Fitz said in a written statement. She wrote: 'Seconds later, I heard Kathy say, 'He shot himself!'"" Fitz added: 'He spoke solely about his outrage concerning the rumors that were being spread about his religion and how he should respond to those rumors. 'I told him I thought it was best to let others stand up for him.' Schweich was Christian and attended church, but had some Jewish ancestry. The auditor's chief of staff, Trish Vincent, also talked with Schweich before his death. She said he told her he hadn't slept because he had been physically ill for most of the night before his suicide. In a written statement, she said Schweich 'was distraught, as he had been the last few days, regarding untruths about his religion'. On Tuesday during Schweich's funeral, Danforth eulogized his friend. Danforth, a political mentor and longtime ally to Schweich, is an ordained Episcopal minister. He suggested political bullying and an anti-Semitic whisper campaign led his friend to kill himself. Danforth expressed 'overwhelming anger that politics has gone so hideously wrong' as he spoke at the Church of St. Michael and St. George, the Episcopal church Schweich had attended in Clayton. He said: 'Words do hurt. Words can kill. 'That has been proven right here in this state.' He then urged the audience to disown 'winning at any cost' campaigns run by 'bullies' and to pledge 'that we will not put up with any whisper of anti-Semitism', the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

Family members of Schweich embrace outside the Church of St. Michael and St. George at his funeral . Former US Sen. John Danforth's (left) assistant Martha Fitz (right) was talking to Schweich before his suicide . Schweich, a Republican, launched an anti-corruption campaign for governor last month and was thought to have a good chance of winning. Last month, Schweich told an Associated Press reporter the believed the new chairman of the Missouri Republican Party - John Hancock - told people he was Jewish last year. Schweich said he considered the comments anti-Semitic and was extremely upset by them. Hancock has denied making anti-Semitic remarks. He has acknowledged he may have told some people Schweich was Jewish because he mistakenly believed that was true. Danforth responded to Hancock's denial without mentioning him by name. He said: 'Tom called this anti-Semitism, and of course it was. 'The only reason for going around saying that someone is Jewish is to make political profit from religious bigotry.' Schweich was first elected in 2010 and easily won election to a second term in November. He previously served as Danforth's chief of staff for a 1999 federal investigation into the deadly government siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, and followed Danforth to the United Nations, where he was chief of staff for the US. delegation. President George W. Bush appointed Schweich to the State Department in 2005 as an international law enforcement official and picked Schweich two years later to coordinate the anti-drug and justice reform efforts in Afghanistan.

"An idyllic abbey which was once the home of a number of scandalous orgies involving politicians and aristocrats has been put up for sale for £10million. Medmenham Abbey, in Buckinghamshire, is a beautiful riverside mansion with stunning gardens and luxury accommodation, which was once the meeting place for a secret society. In the early 18th Century Francis Dashwood, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, founded the ‘Brotherhood of the Knights of St Francis of Wycombe’ club. Also known as The Hellfire Club, it was a secret society of 24 members - known as the monks of Medmenham - who dressed in gowns and turbans before engaging in acts of debauchery.

The abbey, which comes complete with a spa including a Jacuzzi and steam room (pictured), is on the market for a whopping £10million . Legend has it that the members would dress prostitutes and open-minded ladies of societies as nuns and demand they pleasure the 'monks'. Members of the society included the likes of the Marquis of Granby, the Earl of Bute, John Wilkes, Thomas Potter, who was the Archbishop of Canterbury's son, and the Earl of Sandwich. The sordid days of Medmenham Abbey are now long gone and the property has been transformed into a 'historic and fantastic family home'. With 42 acres of land and gardens which have been beautifully cared for, the abbey is nestled in the heart of the English countryside and looks out onto the River Thames. The property was originally built on the site of a 13th century Cistercian abbey but was redeveloped by Italian designers in the 18th century at the request of Mr Dashwood.

'I would say it was one of the finest most important homes in the area. It is a one-off and I expect there will be a lot of interest.' Sir Francis Dashwood depicted in a portrait by William Hogarth in the late 1750s . Sir Francis Dashwood was a British politician who served as the Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1762 until 1763. He was born in Great Marlborough Street, in London, in 1708 to Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet, and his second wife Mary, the eldest daughter of Vere Fane, 4th Earl of Westmorland. He attended the prestigious Eton College and when his father died in 1724, Sir Dashwood inherited the family estate and Baronetcy of Dashwood of West Wycombe title. He was just 15-years-old. As he grew up, he reportedly became friends with John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich. In the mid-1700s, Sir Dashwood founded The Hellfire Club and the first meeting of the group – which was also known as the Brotherhood of the Knights of St Francis of Wycombe - was held at his family home in West Wycombe. The initial meeting was deemed something of a failure and the club subsequently moved their meetings to Medmenham Abbey, where they called themselves the 'Monks of Medmenham'. The 24 members of the secret society retreated to the idyllic abbey every summer and carried out acts of debauchery including scandalous orgies with female prostitutes dressed as nuns. Following his time with The Hellfire Club, Sir Dashwood was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in June 1762. Just a year earlier, he had found a new seat in Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis. He resigned from his position as Chancellor after just a year, following a disappointing Budget speech which was said to be ‘confused and incapable’. He later retreated from the limelight and passed away at his West Wycombe residency after a long illness in December 1781. He was buried, alongside his wife who died in 1769, at a mausoleum which he had built on the estate.","Idyllic Medmenham Abbey in Buckinghamshire was once the home of orgies involving politicians and aristocrats .

"The White House challenged Iranian negotiators on Sunday to 'live up to their rhetoric' and strike a nuclear deal with world powers before the March 31 deadline expires. Iran and six world powers have reached tentative agreement on key parts of a deal sharply curtailing Tehran's nuclear ambitions, Western diplomats said in Lausanne, where negotiators are racing to nail down an accord by midnight Tuesday. If negotiations are not met by the end of March, the House plans to hit Iran with fresh nuclear sanctions. Doubt: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that Iran needs to 'send a clear signal' as to whether or not 'they are willing to make the serious commitments required' to finalize nuclear negotiations (file photo) 'We've been negotiating for more than a year and ultimately it's time for the Iranians to send a clear signal to the international community about whether or not they are willing to make the serious commitments required,' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told ABC's This Week. The Iranians must 'basically live up to their rhetoric, that they are not trying to acquire a nuclear weapon. So if they can make those commitments, they should be able to do that by the end of March,' he said. Separately, House Speaker John Boehner promised to move 'very quickly' to hit Iran with new sanctions if a nuclear deal collapses. 'Very quickly. Listen, the sanctions were working,' Boehner said on CNN's State of the Union. House Speaker John Boehner said that he plans to quickly hit Iran with fresh sanctions if the nuclear deal does not pull through by the end of March (file photo) He added: 'They would have never come to the table and, frankly, we should have kept the sanctions in place so that we could have gotten to a real agreement. 'And the sanctions are going to come and they're going to come quick.' Boehner added that he had 'serious doubts' about the ongoing talks in Switzerland. 'I've had serious doubts whether there could be an agreement and I still have serious doubts,' he said.","Iran and six world powers have reached a tentative agreement within Iran's nuclear ambitions .

"Despite the likes of auto giants Ford, BMW and Tesla releasing electric cars, the technology has yet to become mainstream. And a major sticking point is the number of charging stations available. Now Goodyear has created a concept tyre that could spell the end of these stations, and ultimately petrol cars, by charging the car as it drives. Scroll down for video . Goodyear’s concept BH03 tyre (illustrated) was unveiled at the Geneva International Motor Show. It is fitted with thermo-piezoelectric materials that convert heat into energy to charge an electric car without the need for a charging station. This conversion happens when the car is both stationary and moving . Called BH023, the tyre concept is fitted with thermo-piezoelectric materials. When parked, sunlight heats the tyre and this heat is transformed into electricity using the thermo-electric material. The tyre has also been designed to be ‘ultra-black’ to absorb as much heat as possible. When being driven, the friction between the tyre and the road as well as the ‘squeezing’ and movement of the piezoelectric material as it rolls generates a small electric voltage. Piezoelectricity is the charge that builds up in materials such as those made of crystalline and ceramic structures. Exposing them to mechanical force causes a separation of electrical charge, which sets up a voltage that can be used to charge products. When a piezoelectric material is squeezed rapidly, it produces a small electrical voltage for a moment. If a voltage is put across the material it makes a tiny change in shape. In 2001, Trevor Baylis, the British inventor best known for his wind-up radios, famously walked 100 miles across the Namib desert in his ’Electric Shoes’, which charged a small battery that allowed him to use his mobile phone. This electricity is captured and directed to the car’s battery to charge it as it moves. ‘This tyre generates electricity through the action of materials in the tyre that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions,’ explained Goodyear. ‘The materials used would optimise the tyre's electricity generation capabilities as well as its rolling resistance. ‘As demand for electric cars grows, this technology has the potential to significantly contribute to the solution of future mobility challenges. ‘This visionary tyre technology could eliminate the vehicle-range anxiety motorists may have with electric cars.’ Goodyear also unveiled a second concept called ‘Triple Tube’. This tyre features three internal tubes located beneath the tread near the inboard and outboard shoulders of the tyre, as well as the centre. It relies on an internal pump that moves air from the main air chamber to the three individual air chambers, or tubes. When parked, sunlight heats the tyre and this heat is transformed into electricity using the thermo-electric material. The tyre has also been designed to be ‘ultra-black’ to absorb as much heat as possible . The tyre automatically adjusts - on its own - to three different positions based on road conditions and modes include the Eco/Safety, Sporty and Wet Traction. Eco/Safety offers maximum inflation in all three tubes and reduces rolling resistance. The Sporty position, with reduced inflation in the inboard shoulder tube, gives drivers more control of the car. When being driven, the friction between the tyre and the road as well as the ‘squeezing’ and movement of the piezoelectric material as it rolls generates a small electric voltage. Goodyear said the materials used would optimise the tyre's electricity generation capabilities as well as its rolling resistance . This electricity is captured and directed to the car’s battery (illustrated) to charge it as it moves. There are no immediate plans to release the concept but the tyre-maker said it predicts future cars will use the technology . While the Wet Traction position, with maximimum inflation in the centre tube, stops the car from aquaplaning thanks to a raised tread in the centre of the tyre. There are no immediate plans to release these concepts but the tyre-maker said it predicts future cars will use the technology. ‘These concept tyres reimagine the role that tyres may play in the future,’ said Joe Zekoski, Goodyear's senior vice president and chief technical officer. ‘We envision a future in which our products become more integrated with the vehicle and the consumer, more environmentally friendly and more versatile.’","Concept BH03 tyre was unveiled at the Geneva International Motor Show .

"The jihadi twin caught trying to enter Syria had already had a seven-month stay there with her toddler son, it emerged yesterday. Jamila Henry, 21, lived with two-year-old Mustafa in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa until just before Christmas. She came back to Britain to leave him with family before trying to return to Syria. On Monday Turkish police picked her up in the capital Ankara. Henry managed to flee the UK for a second time despite being on the radar of MI5, whose agents tried to recruit her. Wedding day: Jamila Henry with her estranged husband, whose identity is being protected . They interviewed her, gave her a smartphone and repeatedly contacted her. But, under their noses, she was able to steal her glamorous identical twin’s passport and head back to the conflict zone. The astonishing lapse comes weeks after it emerged that Mohammed Emwazi – the Islamic State butcher called Jihadi John – was known to the security services for five years and they had tried to recruit him too. Despite being classed as a priority target, Emwazi managed to travel to the Middle East and start his reign of terror in Syria. Michael Adebolajo, one of the killers of Lee Rigby in Woolwich, was also courted by MI5. Last night, a friend of the Henry family lashed out at ‘bumbling’ MI5 officers, accusing them of trying to cover up their mistakes. ‘They are a joke,’ said the source. ‘They keep calling everyone to find out what happened and telling them what they should and shouldn’t say to people. Travel: Ms Henry tried to use a passport, left, which belonged to her 'party girl' twin sister Jalila, right . ‘They were all over the family for months after Jamila came back but were left whistling in the wind when she disappeared again.’ Under surveillance: Jamila Henry was questioned by MI5 before she fled to try and travel to Syria . Henry returned in December under pressure from relatives including her estranged husband. A source close to the family said: ‘Her husband had no idea she was going to take Mustafa to Syria. He was extremely glad when they both returned safely. ‘He and his parents were distraught and traumatised in the months the baby was missing. ‘He in particular struggled not knowing where his son was or whether or not he was safe. It was a testing time. ‘He suffered many sleepless nights fearing he would never see his child again. He had no contact with Jamila. All he could do was send messages via her family pleading for her to return his son and just prayed that his pleas would reach her.’ Henry was stopped and questioned for up to nine hours by MI5 officers and detectives from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command when she returned home with Mustafa in December. They released her without her being arrested or charged in the belief that she would co-operate with them as they investigated her movements and contacts in Syria. Henry converted to Islam in her teens and moved to east London where she had an arranged marriage with her husband, a Muslim Turkish Cypriot. The couple soon had their child but their relationship collapsed when Henry began spouting radical beliefs. Her latest journey to Turkey was on the passport of her ‘south London party girl’ twin sister Jalila. Yesterday Henry remained under arrest at a high-security central London police station after being flown back from Turkey to Luton airport on Thursday. She is being held on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism, an offence which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. She is the latest woman to flee the UK to join the barbaric terrorist group as a jihadi bride and support its frontline fighters. Last month three ‘straight A’ east London schoolgirls, aged 15 and 16, abandoned their families to travel to Syria via Turkey. They were following in the footsteps of a friend who joined Islamic State in December. All four went to the same Bethnal Green school.

"Swedish furniture giant Ikea will produce 10,000 flat-pack shelters for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) as temporary homes for refugees across the world. The 'Better Shelter' units are to be rolled out on a mass scale following a successful trial in Ethiopia and the borders of Syria, in 2013. It is hoped the flat-pack homes, which can built in four hours without the need for tools, will make desperate conditions more bearable for displaced families. Scroll down for video . Family shelter: The shelters here, pictured here at the Syrian refuge in Kawergosk, Northern Iraq, are soon to be delivered on a wider scale . Home comforts: : IKEA has developed its own version of refugee shelters, featuring solar panels for electricity and proper standing room inside . The first mass delivery will head to camps across Iraq where 2.5 million people have been displaced by conflict. In typical Ikea fashion, the walls, roof, floors, door and windows all come flat packed in cardboard boxes, making them easy to transport. Dwellers will be pleased the 17.5sqm shelters are twice as large as the current crop of refugee tents used by the UN and can accommodate five or six people. Shaun Scales, chief of shelter and settlement at the UN's refugee agency UNHCR, said they would improve the lives of tens of thousands of people. 'The refugee housing unit is an exciting new development in humanitarian shelter and represents a much needed addition to the palette of sheltering options mobilized to assist those in need,' he said. Successful pilot: The flat-pack shelters, pictured here in Ethiopia as part of a pilot, take four-hours to erect and do not need tools . Refuge: A displaced family stand by a shelter at the Kawergosk refugee camp in northern Iraq . 'Its deployment will ensure dramatic improvement to the lives of many people affected by crises.' Refugee camps are typically overcrowded with temperatures in tents fluctuating between sweltering hot in the day time and freezing at night. The walls and roof are made from the lightweight polymer, Rhulite, laminated with thermal insulation, which clips straight onto the shelter's steel pole frame. They are strong enough to withstand the harsh climates seen in refugee camps. The material was specially developed to allow daylight to penetrate the shelter during the day but also to trap light sources emitting from inside the tent. It also stops people from being able to see shadows inside the tent, addressing privacy issues. It should assist inhabitants to read, learn and engage at night time under artificial light. A  lightweight insulated technical metallic textile is made with interlaced aluminium and polyolefin strips, designed to reflect heat from the sun during the day and stop the heat escaping from inside the tent at night. There is a solar panel on top, laminated on a thin plastic film, designed to generate electricity for a light and USB port inside the unit. But it is hoped the specially-designed shelters will bring an end to the grim conditions, with flexible solar panels on the roofs for power, and specially-made walls that can deflect heat during the day and retain it at night. At 1.75 metres high, they are tall enough for people to stand, and even have lockable doors, ventilation, solar panels, mosquito nets and lights. Mr Scales said: 'The units comprise the best elements of a tent in that it's pre-packed, of minimal weight and produced to core standards, but it also has a rigid, self-supporting frame and it provides more physical security and dignity for its occupants'. The shelters originally cost about £5,000, three times more than a standard UNHCR tent, but are designed to last for at least three years in harsh climates, compared to a tent's average lifespan of six months. The firm hopes they could be made for around £655 each once in mass production. Ikea's philanthropist foundation helped to fund the original project while a Sweden-based group called the Refugee Housing Unit has been working with the UN agency on the design. Jonathan Spampinato, head of strategic planning and Communications, at the IKEA Foundation said they were proud to help the relief effort. Easy to assemble: The shelters take about four hours to build and do not require tools . Home: One gentleman shows his spacious temporary home, both inside and out, at a refugee camp in northern Iraq. The shelters are set to help thousands when they go into mass production . He said: 'Putting refugee families and their needs at the heart of this project is a great example of how democratic design can be used for humanitarian value. 'We are incredibly proud that the Better Shelter is now available, so refugee families and children can have a safer place to call home.' Elsewhere, the Norwegian Refugee Council is piloting a similar type of structure in a refugee camp in Jordan where there are also a number of Syrian families living in container homes provided by Gulf donors.","Shelters big enough to house families-of-six in refugee camps .

The man, who is believed to have been involved in the collective, and may have travelled from the US to participate, was travelling along Silverton Road toward the Mundi Mundi lookout, both of which feature heavily in the film, when the incident occurred. Owner of the Silverton Hotel, Peter Price, said that the Mad Max community was devastated by the news. 'There has been an outpouring of grief from everybody that's been involved and we've had numerous phone calls this morning from avid fans that have been this way and it's been ... not nice,' Mr Price said. 'For the Mad Max family, it is a group of people worldwide and they'll be devastated by this, but I think the support that's there is so strong in the culture and I think there'll be plenty of support for everybody,' he said.

"Craig MacLean, 22 (pictured), was on a flight from Scotland to Abu Dhabi when stewards appealed for a doctor after a passenger suffered a cardiac arrest . A medical student has been hailed a hero after saving the life of a fellow passenger on an airliner at 36,000ft. Craig MacLean, 22, was on a KLM flight to Abu Dhabi when stewards appealed for a doctor after a man suffered a cardiac arrest. Although he told staff he was not yet fully qualified to treat patients, Mr MacLean was ushered towards the unconscious passenger. Despite his inexperience, the Dundee University student started trying to revive the man, then called for the defibrillator kit carried on board to restart the man’s heart. The flight was diverted to Ankara, in Turkey, where it was struck by lightning as it made an emergency landing. However, the man was safely handed to medical crews. Mr MacLean, who jetted back to Scotland yesterday from Abu Dhabi, then used the plane’s public address system to let passengers know what had happened. He said that after answering the appeal for help he told a steward: ‘I’m just a student. Before I could finish, she said, “Come with me”. ‘There was a man in his 50s with vomit coming from his nose and mouth who was unconscious. ‘He was completely unresponsive, so I called for help and we got him on to the floor in the aisle – he was a big man. ‘I assessed him and discovered he was not breathing and had no pulse. A major alarm bell goes off – this is a cardiac arrest. I need to act now, and quickly, or this man will die. I started CPR, called for the defibrillator and asked for an immediate emergency landing. ‘I continued CPR and they brought me medical equipment, at which time a Dutch nurse came to take over CPR. 'I was then able to apply the pads and shock the man. I got his heart beating properly again and he started breathing.’ Mr MacLean, who is from Glasgow and was attending a conference on the health problems caused by tobacco, said that, following the handover of his patient, ‘the last update I got was on landing, at which I was relieved to hear he was alive’. The Dundee University student started trying to revive the man, then called for the defibrillator kit carried on board to restart the man’s heart. Mr MacLean later took to Twitter to tell his followers about the heroic act . Mr MacLean, who is from Glasgow (pictured with First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon), told crew he told staff he was just a medical student and not yet fully qualified to treat patients but was still asked to help out . The incident unfolded on a KLM flight from Scotland to Abu Dhabi, which had to divert to Turkey (file picture) Mr MacLean later tweeted: ‘Not every day you have to ask for an emergency landing and get ROSC [return of spontaneous circulation] at 36,000ft.’ SNP Glasgow Cathcart MSP James Dornan, who knows Mr MacLean, lodged a motion at Holyrood marking his intervention, saying he is a ‘credit to his family, to his tutors who have clearly taught him very well and to Scotland'. He added: ‘Craig may say that he was just being professional – but it is clear he is a hero.’","Craig MacLean, 22, was on flight to Abu Dhabi when staff called for doctor .

"Barack Obama has hailed US gang drama The Wire as 'one of the greatest pieces of art in the last couple of decades' during an interview with its creator. The President told David Simon he was a huge fan of the hit HBO series about life in drug-plagued Baltimore, during a chat about criminal justice reform. A video of the 12-minute conversation, about the need to reduce the incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders, was shown at the Bipartisan Criminal Justice Summit in Washington. Meeting: President Barack Obama talks to The Wire creator David Simon about the war on drugs . The president said people looking for solutions to the drug war need to 'humanize what so often, on the local news, is just a bunch of shadowy characters and tell their stories.' 'That's where the work you've done has been so important,' he told Mr Simon. 'There is an increasing realization on the left, but also on the right, politically, that what we're doing is counterproductive,' he said. Fan: President Obama hailed The Wire, starring Dominic West, Larry Gilliard Jr. and Wendell Pierce (pictured) as a great 'piece of art' High praise: President Obama said he was 'huge fan' of The Wire, starring  officer James 'Jimmy' McNulty (Dominic West) and Detective William 'Bunk' Moreland (Wendell Pierce) pictured . 'Either from a libertarian perspective, the way we treat non-violent drug crimes is problematic, and from a fiscal perspective, it's breaking the bank, that you end up spending so much more on prison than you would with these kids being in school or even going to college, that it's counterproductive'. He spoke of people being turned into 'hardened criminals' while in prison, which created a cycle of them returning to jail. Disaffected: Obama said solutions to the drug war needed to 'humanize what so often, on the local news, is just a bunch of shadowy characters and tell their stories' which The Wire had helped with . Discussions: Barack Obama meets The Wire creator David Simon at the White House to discuss incarceration of drug offenders . 'When you break down why people aren't getting back into the labor force, even as jobs are being created, a big chunk of that is the young male population with felony histories. The Wire, which looked at the dark underbelly of the city of Baltimore, ran for five seasons on HBO. Each season focused on a different facet of the drugs trade in the Maryland city: the drug trade on the streets, the seaport system, corruption within the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media. The series, which ran from 2002 to 2008 and became a huge cult hit, being hailed by many critics as the best television programme of the last decade or even of all time. 'So now where we have the opportunity to give them a pathway toward a responsible life, they're foreclosed. And that's counterproductive.' The Wire chronicled the effects of the drug war as it was waged in Maryland's largest city in the early 2000s, showing how both drug use and the heavy-handed response of the law enforcement devastated communities. Mr Simon, an outspoken critic of the federal government's drug policies, did not hold back as he spoke with the President. 'What the drugs don't destroy, the war against them tears apart,' he said. Obama once again mentioned his favorite 'Wire' character Omar Little, a stick-up man who would make a living by targeting drug dealers. The President had previously revealed the character, played by Michael K. Williams, was his best-liked star of the show.","President talked about criminal justice reform with David Simon .

"A holiday resort in Thailand has come under fire after it posted a picture online of drunken guests riding a baby elephant around its swimming pool. The picture, which drew widespread criticism immediately after it was posted, was accompanied by a caption that stated it was ‘amazing Sunday brunch’. Nikki Beach Resort in Phuket was flooded with complaints over the photo, reports The Daily Telegraph. A holiday resort in Thailand has come under fire after it posted a picture online of drunken guests riding an elephant around its swimming pool . Nikki Beach Resort in Phuket published the picture along with a caption that stated it was ‘amazing Sunday brunch’ People were enraged such a young elephant had been brought onto the property so that guests could ride it for fun, and that guests were more than willing to take part. The resort quickly deleted the photo, and released a statement to address the controversy. 'We would like to make it clear that we do not, have not and will never own an elephant,' the statement read. 'The elephant in the photo is from a reputable elephant caretaker who has no affiliation with Nikki Beach. The resort is located about 30 minutes away from the tourist hot-spot of Patong . 'Elephants are a highly respected and regarded symbol of Thailand. As a global company, Nikki Beach respects every country’s culture and traditions and as such, we fall into the normal behaviors in usage of elephants to represent their culture. 'We never intended to be disrespectful.' The statement did little to calm the stampeding herd of online protesters, and the anger spilled onto the resort's TripAdvisor page. However, TripAdvisor deleted negative reviews based on the elephant incident.

"Years into the future, if historians look back at our convenience-obsessed era and pick one single product to sum up all of its follies, they will surely choose the disposable wet wipe. These moistened towelettes promise so much. They save us the apparent drudgery of having to dampen traditional cloths (that need washing when we’ve finished with them) or having to remove make-up with face wash and a flannel. For parents, they also offer an easy solution to the mess babies make of themselves. But it now seems that our lazy ways have come at great environmental cost. Yesterday, a report by the Marine Conservation Society revealed that wet wipes have become the fastest growing cause of pollution on our beaches. Its volunteers are picking them up from our coastline at a rate of 35 filthy wipes per kilometre. Wet wipes have grown in popularity - from kitchen and toilet wipes to moistened towelettes for keyboards . Meanwhile they are clogging up our sewers, creating floods of noxious waste, and also triggering outbreaks of serious allergies. Over the past few years, our love affair with wet wipes has grown. If there’s a part of our body or house that might harbour dirt, we’ll happily buy a wipe marketed specifically to sweep it away at the flick of a wrist. Kitchen wipes, toilet wipes, face wipes, hand wipes, keyboard wipes, antibacterial wipes, baby wipes . . . With babycare, the cocktail of chemicals scarcely have a chance to dry on our little ones’ skin before we slather them with another one. In the UK, we use on average between 1,500 and 2,250 baby wipes per child, from the day they are born until they reach three, according to the market analysts Euromonitor. That’s far more than any other country in Europe. Our obsession doesn’t stop with keeping our babies clean. We spend more than £500 million a year on wipes of all kinds, be they budget kitchen-cleaning ones that crowd pound-store shelves, or deluxe products such as l’Occitane en Provence’s citrus-scented ‘refreshing towelettes’ costing £7 a pack — that’s 50p a wipe. Our spending on these products is forecast to continue leaping by £10 million every year. Once used, they are all too often casually tossed down the loo — with disastrous consequences. Huggies pure wipes may contain the chemical Methylparaben, which according to some researchers may cause skin toxicity . Last year, a sewer pipe under Shepherd’s Bush, West London, became jammed by a blockage of fat and rubbish, known as a ‘fatberg’, that was the length of a Boeing 747. Thames Water said wet wipes were a major cause — because of the way they clog together with fat, grease and oil . The blockage caused raw sewage to flood into nearby homes, up through the toilets and sinks. It took Thames Water workers four very unpleasant days to clear. Three years ago, a similar blockage caused a tsunami of sewage to pour into the Menai Strait near Anglesey and this year Southern Water said more than 2,000 tons of wet wipes were playing havoc with sewers in Kent. The problem is that the wipes are not simply a dampened form of paper towel. They are usually made from a combination of plastics, wood pulp and cotton. The material is hard to break down and can float about our sewers and seas for years. Buying supposedly ‘flushable’ wet wipes make no difference, says Thames Water. Marine Conservation Society volunteers are picking wet wipes up from our coastline at a rate of 35 filthy wipes per kilometre . The sensible answer may seem simply to throw used ones into the bin. But even in landfill they create problems, due to the combination of alcohol, preservatives, fragrances, cleaning and moisturising agents with which they are impregnated. The antibacterial alcohol also kills the bacteria and enzymes which we rely on to break down solid waste in landfill sites — and in septic tanks, too. Don’t think that composting them is a good idea, either. The synthetic fibres won’t break down, while the chemicals and preservatives will pollute your plants and kill off the soil’s ecology. But it is the effects on humans that should worry us most. A number of scientific papers have linked chemicals in wet wipes with serious outbreaks of skin allergy problems, most notably dermatitis and eczema. Numerous cases of skin rashes have been reported, most often on babies’ skin and also on their parents’ hands. One of the key culprits is a preservative chemical — the substance methylisothiazolinone (or MI, for short). A sewer pipe under Shepherd’s Bush, West London, became jammed by a blockage of fat and rubbish, known as a ‘fatberg’ (pictured), last year . Researchers at the Leeds Centre for Dermatology and the St John’s Institute of Dermatology at St Thomas’ Hospital in London say this chemical is to blame for an increasing number of allergic reactions. Indeed, two years ago, the American Contact Dermatitis Society identified the chemical as the ‘Allergen of the Year’. The British Association of Dermatologists dedicated its annual conference to discussing MI in 2013, and persuaded the industry body, Cosmetics Europe, to tell its members to remove MI from any of their products that are left on the skin. This ban would include wet wipes, the British Association of Dermatologists assumed. But when, last July, the European Commission issued its own directive banning MI from products that stay on the skin, it appears to have omitted wet wipes. What is certain is that wet wipes containing the chemical are still readily available. Tesco and Sainsbury’s own-brand antibacterial wipes both feature MI, according to their websites. As for other brands, it is hard to tell, as research by Belgian experts showed that MI is not necessarily included on wet wipes’ labels. And once anyone becomes sensitised to MI, by skin contact with wet wipes, they can suffer allergic reactions — such as widespread skin rashes or outbreaks of eczema — simply by sniffing the chemical from numerous sources such as the fumes from paint, according to a report by Danish investigators. Researchers have linked chemicals in wet wipes with serious outbreaks of skin allergy problems, most notably dermatitis and eczema (a little girl's eczema on her legs) Meanwhile, a host of other chemicals found in popular brands of wet wipes, such as polyhexamethylene biguanide, are also suspected as the cause of serious allergies. In addition, there is growing research that links over-use of antibacterial wet wipes with allergic conditions such as asthma. This could be linked to the ‘hygiene hypothesis’ — the theory that over-clean modern homes deny youngsters the mild exposure to bugs that their immune systems need for them to develop healthy responses to bacteria, rather then overreacting to harmless things such as household dust. In the meantime, Thames Water offers an alternative — Freshu, a foaming gel designed to be applied to standard loo paper, as a DIY sewer-friendly wet wipe. But perhaps the best answer is to jettison our convenience-driven neuroses about everyday dirt and germs. As study after study has shown, the safest and most effective answer to dangerous dirt is simple soap and water.","Love affair with wipes has grown recently - from kitchen to keyboard wipes .

"A 'gay-bashing' murderer and a paedophile serving life sentences have tied the knot in Britain's first homosexual wedding in prison but will not be allowed to share a cell, jail bosses have said. Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov, 40, who was jailed in 1997 for what a judge labelled a ‘callous, chilling killing’, married fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin, 31, yesterday, it has been reported. Goodwin was the leader of a gang that roamed the streets of Blackpool looking for homosexuals to attack. He was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years in 2007 after being found guilty of murdering Malcolm Benfold, 57, who was beaten to death. His trial heard that he and two friends had agreed to go ‘gay bashing’. Wed: Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov (right), 40, who was jailed in 1997 for what a judge labelled a ‘callous, chilling killing’, married fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin (left), 31, yesterday . According to reports, the 15-minute ceremony, during which the prisoners wore suits, was attended by four family members. Mr Benfold's sister, Wendy Bridge, from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside has previously spoken out against the wedding. 'I don’t object to a prisoner having a wedding, but when its two murderers getting married to each other, that’s wrong,' she told the Liverpool Echo. 'Marriage should be something to aim for when they get out, to build a home and a new life with someone,' she added. It came at no cost to the public purse, a Prison Service spokesman said. 'We are very clear that if prisoners do get married, the taxpayer does not foot the bill for the ceremony and they are certainly not allowed to share a cell,' he added. It is believed that the couple had considered a civil partnership until a change in the law in March last year made homosexual marriage legal in Britain. Goodwin and Gallatinov – who strangled 28-year-old gay man Adrian Kaminsky – met while behind bars, according to the Daily Mirror. Gallatinov, of Manchester, who previously served a prison sentence for sexually abusing children, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of Mr Kaminsky – meaning he could be eligible for parole in two years. The convicted murderers wed at HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire (pictured) and was the first gay wedding in a British prison . There was a 15-minute chapel ceremony at HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire, which was attended by four of their relatives, according to The Sun . He spoke to his victim on a gay chat line before luring him to his home. At the time of his sentencing, Judge Rhys Davies QC said the murder was ‘a cold-blooded, well planned, callous, chilling and apparently motiveless killing’. The case was particularly shocking because Gallatinov was under police surveillance at the time and had actually told an undercover detective that he intended to commit murder. Officers were positioned outside his house at the time of the killing and he photographed his victim with a camera that he had been lent by detectives. Mr Kaminsky’s body was later found nearly naked in the boot of Gallatinov’s car after he was stopped on a motorway. Goodwin, originally of Airdrie, near Glasgow, is expected to serve at least another ten years behind bars.","Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov, 40, married fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin, 31 .

"Organic kitty litter was partially to blame for a multimillion-dollar radiation leak at an underground . nuclear waste dump in New Mexico, scientists revealed this week.

Health scare: The accident at WIPP exposed 22 workers to radiation in amounts not expected to threaten their health . The radiation leak that began in the WIPP disposal chamber . half a mile below ground February 14, 2014, 'did not result from . a detonation,' the 277-page report released Thursday concluded.

The accident indefinitely suspended key operations at the . site, the Energy Department's only permanent underground . repository for certain types of radiological waste tied to US nuclear labs and weapons sites. In September, Energy Department officials estimated the cost . of the initial recovery of the dump at $240million and said it . might be two years or more before it is fully operational again. 'I cannot say how high a priority it is to get WIPP reopened and operating. In general terms, it is critical for everything we do in geologic disposal of nuclear materials,' Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said at a Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee hearing earlier this week. The report confirms the agency's preliminary theories about the cause of the costly mishap and also clarified that just one barrel of waste containing 'chemically incompatible' materials - including Swheat Scoop brand litter, nitrate salts and a neutralizing agent - from Los Alamos was to blame.

'But we’re doing everything we can, throwing everything at it, with Alessia being 3½, we’re trying to stay as positive as we can.' Stuart Diver, 45, met his future wife, Rosanna Cossettini, two years after the Thredbo tragedy, which claimed his first wife’s life.

He has been a much-sought after public speaker since the tragedy and continued to work on the ski fields . In his memoir Stuart wrote that: ‘I’d see Rosanna Cossettini now and then at the pub or walking around the village. We would chat but I never thought it would really amount to anything.' 'I figured she was way too good to go out with a rogue like me.’ His connection with Rosanna, he remembered, was truly special and she played a huge role in helping him heal from the trauma of his wife Sally’s death. ‘I had always believed that if it was right in your heart, then it was right,' he wrote of finding love after Sally's tragic passing. 'With Rosanna, I found myself loving again.' At the time they ran the Snow Cloud Ski Lodge in the Woodridge section of Thredbo village together. In 2007, they set about building their dream home at Tura Beach on the South Coast. Stuart Diver with his first wife, Sally (pictured). He wrote in his memoir that his connection with Rosanna was truly special and she played a huge role in helping him heal from the trauma of her death . Stuart Diver at the then launch of his remarkable tale ""Survival: The inspirational story of the Thredbo disaster's sole survivor"" Stuart wrote in his 2012 autobiography: ‘I knew in my heart that Sal would have wanted me to get on with my life.’ Three weeks after they married came the shattering diagnosis: Rosanna had advanced breast cancer. However she recovered and, despite being told Rosanna could never carry a child, they welcomed their 'miracle baby’ daughter Alessia on September 3, 2011. Rosanna was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in June 2013 which was reportedly followed by brain cancer. At the time they ran the Snow Cloud Ski Lodge in the Woodridge section of Thredbo village together. The final sentences of Diver’s 2012 memoir is an ode to his wife: ‘Just look at what I now have … Alessia … Rosanna… my family… my career. 'Life’s good.

"Two cousins have died and another man is in hospital after they apparently took a batch of legal highs at a house party. Dean Boswell and Stephen John were found dead in their beds the morning after they both attended a party in Pembroke Dock, West Wales. Another friend was hospitalised after falling ill from taking the same substance, believed to be a synthetic psychoactive drug. Police are now investigating the sudden death of Mr Boswell, 36, who was a builder, and his second cousin Mr John, 40, and are awaiting the results of toxicology tests. Death: Dean Boswell, left, and Stephen John, right, died after taking a legal high at a house party . Health officials have warned that legal highs are becoming stronger, leading to a rise in the number of people being hospitalised after taking them. A friend said that the three men were at a party together 10 days ago where several people took legal highs, before they returned to their separate homes. She said: 'There were a group having a good time together on Friday night and it appears Dean and Stephen took some kind of legal high which has ended up killing them. 'It is so tragic as both of them were so full of life and had everything to live for.' Mr Boswell's mother Wynfrai said that she found her son dead in his bedroom on the morning of her 59th birthday, and vowed to use his funeral this week to alert others to the dangers of drugs. 'Dean wasn't a heavy drug user - he maybe had the odd smoke,' she said. 'I suspect they thought they were invincible. Deadly: Legal highs such as mephedrone, pictured, have grown in popularity in recent years . 'It is too early to speak about all this for both families but the vicar will be saying something about drugs at the funeral. 'Something has to be done about the people who sell drugs and the deaths that are happening in the town. The family was previously struck by tragedy when Mr Boswell's sister died on Valentine's Day a few years ago. In recent years, there has been a huge surge in the number of deaths linked to legal highs. 97 people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years. In around two-thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death. Ministers have already introduced bans on some former legal highs, including mephedrone - known as meow meow - NBOMe and Benzofury. A ban on synthetic stimulant mephedrone came into force across the UK in 2010. The drug is now a Class B substance, along with its associated compounds. The two cousins were said to be very close to one another, and as they were both avid fans of Liverpool FC they will have the club's crest on their coffins at their funerals . A spokesman for Dyfed Powys Police said: 'An investigation is ongoing into the cause of their deaths. Police are awaiting results of a toxicology test in order to establish the cause of death.' The police added: 'Police in Pembrokeshire are committed to the ongoing fight against substance misuse across the county. Enforcement activities take place regularly, but we also educate people on the risks of substance misuse. 'We want young people in particular to be informed and aware of the serious dangers of substance misuse, and encourage family and friends to look out for them by familiarising themselves with the tell-tale signs of misuse of drugs.' Anti-drug groups say that legal highs - officially known as New Psychoactive Substances - are getting stronger and more readily available. Josie Smith, from the Welsh drug testing agency Wedinos, said: 'What we have found in the past year is an increase in the strength of NPS drugs. 'They have addiction potential far higher than some of the controlled substances.' Doctors are also concerned by the effects of the drugs bought online and in so-called 'head shops'. Julia Lewis, of the Aneurin Bevan Health Board in South Wales, said: 'We are seeing increasing numbers of people going into mental health units with acute psychotic episodes after having taken some of these legal substances. 'We are hearing of quite young people having heart attacks - I treated one 17-year-old boy who'd had a small heart attack on one of these substances.' Danger: Owain Vaughan, 14, pictured with mother Jenny, was hospitalised thanks to a legal high . Three schoolboys from Glynneath in South Wales have been hospitalised after they took a legal high which they had bought over the counter. Owain Vaughan, 14, took the drug with friends and was rushed to hospital after suffering severe fits, low blood pressure, burst blood vessels in his face and violent nausea. When he came round, he insisted he had never taken drugs before but said he assumed the substance would be safe because it was legal. His mother Jennie said: 'I'm so embarrassed but people need to be aware. My boy was given a legal high and ended up in A&E. 'I had no sleep for over 24 hours and thought my baby was going to die. I don't want any other child or parent to go through this.' After his ordeal, Owain posted a message on Facebook warning his friends not to dabble with drugs which could turn out to be unsafe or even deadly.","Dean Boswell, 36, and Stephen John, 40, took drugs at a house party .

"New surveillance footage of a Boston bomber laying an explosive then fleeing the scene has been shown in court. Footage shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walking through the city before pausing near the finish line, where he dropped an explosive charge that killed an eight-year-old boy. He is seen standing in the crowd for several minutes, before calling his brother, Tamerlan. Shortly after the call, the first bomb explodes - at which point he pushes his way through the stunned crowd. Tsarnaev managed to clear the blast zone in the 12 seconds between the first bomb exploding and his going off - but is still in the shot from a surveillance camera at the scene. Shock: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, cirlced top left, is pictured above in FBI surveillance video standing in a crowd the moment the first bomb goes off at the Boston marathon. While most of the crowd looks towards the blast, he heads off in the other direction . Explosion: Pictured above is the moment Tsarnaev's pressure cooker bomb exploded. It killed two people and wounded dozens more . Killer: The blast ended the life of 8-year-old Martin Richard, and also robbed his sister of one of her legs . Some 12 seconds later, a second explosion takes place precisely where he was standing. He is later shown running from the scene without the backpack he was carrying earlier. It is unclear exactly how the bomb was detonated - though early claims that it primitive kitchen-timer device seem to be endorsed by the fact that Tsarnaev was still fleeing when the bomb went off. The blast killed eight-year-old Martin Richard, as well as Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old student. Martin's younger sister, Jane, lost a leg in the blast and hundreds were injured. The footage was shown to jurors weighing up whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death for the bombing - which his lawyers do not deny he did. The video - nine and a half minutes in total - was compiled by FBI investigators from surveillance footage around the city. Plotting: Dzhokhar, circled in white, is pictured here before the blasts. His brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a gun battle days later, is circled in black . It shows both brothers walking the streets before splitting up to set down the pressure cooker bombs near the finish line on April 15, 2013. He is the only surviving bomber, as Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gun battle days after the attacks. Defense attorneys have argued that Tamerlan persuaded his brother to carry out the attacks, and as such he is not as culpable. Seconds later, the second bomb explodes, and Tsarnaev, who prosecutors say detonated the second bomb, is seen running with a crowd of people who also are running, pushing some out of his way to flee the scene. People are also shown jumping over metal barriers as smoke wafts over the scene. In wait: Tsarnaev is pictured above just down the street from the site of the bomb blast . Approaching: Tsarnaev, circled in white, is seen here walking up to the spot where he dropped the explosive . Less than 30 minutes later, Tsarnaev calmly walked into a Whole Foods store in Cambridge and bought a half-gallon of milk. Jurors were shown surveillance video of him making the purchase and then returning to the passenger side of a car parked in the lot. He then strangely runs back into the store to exchange the gallon of milk for another and then returns to the car. Tsarnaev's defense attorneys cross-examined a witness who said the time stamps on the Whole Foods CCTV was approximate, but prosecutors countered that with a receipt of Tsarnaev's purchase confirming the time for that day was correct. Prosecutors also showed jurors tweets from what they identified as two accounts of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. 'If you have the knowledge and the inspiration all that's left is to take action,' he tweeted April 7, a little over a week before the bombings. 'I want the highest levels of Jannah,' he tweeted March 10, referring to the Islamic concept of paradise. 'I want to be able to see allah every single day for that is the best of pleasures.' After the blasts: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen entering a Whole Foods in Cambridge, Massachusetts just 30 minutes after the explosions . Errand: Surveillance footage from the Whole Foods shows the younger Tsarneav buying a carton of milk and then checking out . Not the driver: After leaving the store, Dzhokhar is seen walking in the parking lot and entering a waiting car through the passenger-side door . Wrong milk: Dzhokhar was seen re-entering the store to exchange the bottle of milk he purchased for another . Timing: Tsarnaev's lawyers cross-examined a witness who said the time stamps on the surveillance video were approximate, but Whole Foods provided a receipt for Tsarnaev that proves they were correct on that day . An exterior view of the Whole Foods in Cambridge, Massachusetts where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev bought a bottle of milk after the Boston Bombings . In January, three months before the bombings, he tweeted: 'I don't argue with folks who say islam is terrorism it's not worth a thing, let an idiot remain an idiot.' Jurors also heard from victims of the bombing. Jessica Kensky told how she and her husband, Patrick Downes, each lost a left leg in the 2013 attack. After more than 18 months of surgeries and consultations with doctors around the country, she came to the painful conclusion that her right leg would have to be amputated, too, she said. 'I did not want to become a bilateral amputee,' Kensky said. 'I wanted to paint my toenails, I wanted to put my feet in the sand, and I wanted to do all these things. To lose the second leg was a gut-wrenching, devastating decision.' On the run: This FBI video shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev fleeing the scene of the Boston bombing after setting his explosive. He was pictured carrying the backpack earlier in the day . Fleeing: Tsarnaev is pictured again, highlighted above, fleeing from the carnage he helped create . Facing death: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, is picturted above with a defense attorney in a court sketch from Monday 9 March. Federal prosecutors hope to secure the death penalty against him for his role in the bombings . Chilling: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev tweeted this message around two hours after he detonated the bomb . Also testifying Monday was a woman whose close friend, 23-year-old Lingzi Lu, died in the second bomb blast. Danling Zhou said Lu grabbed her arm after the first bomb exploded, looking panicked, and said 'What happened?' and 'What should we do?' Before Zhou could answer her, the second bomb exploded. Zhou said she looked in front of her and saw a man whose legs had been blown off. When she looked at Lu, she thought she would be OK because she seemed to still have her arms and legs, Zhou said. Trial: Tsarnaev's case is being heard at The John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston . She found out later in the hospital that Lu had died. Both women grew up in China and were graduate students at Boston University. Prosecutors say the Tsarnaevs carried out the bombing to retaliate against the U.S. for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During opening statements, a prosecutor cited a hand-scrawled note Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left on the walls of the boat he was captured hiding in and said he believed 'he was a solider in a holy war against Americans' and had 'taken a step toward reaching paradise.' Three people died and more than 260 were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs filled with shrapnel exploded near the finish line.","Footage compiled by FBI shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on day of bombing .

"A mother-of-three says she was shocked to open a bag of her favourite crisps and discovered the world's smallest Wotsits inside. Ayesha Bhatti, 29, from Derby, found several mini-Wotsits measuring just 1cm long in her 99p multi-pack of the cheesy snacks. The crisps were dwarved by the regular versions, which measure around 3.5cm, much to the amusement of her family. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-three Ayesha Bhatti, 29, says she was shocked to open a bag of her favourite crisps and discovered the world's smallest Wotsits inside . 'I have never seen Wotsits as small as that,' said the full-time mother, who bought the packets in the Derby branch of discount store Home Bargains on Wednesday last week. 'It's so funny. My family eats quite a lot of them and I like them because they're not oily like other crisps. 'I think these ones could possibly be the smallest in the world. What are the chances of finding so many at once? It's very unusual. 'They certainly wouldn't fill you up but I suppose they're good if you're on a diet.' The crisps were dwarved by the regular versions, which measure around 3.5cm, much to the amusement of Ms Bhatti and her family . Ms Bhatti said she has not contacted manufacturers Walkers over the minature crisps, but said she would do if she found more. 'I don't feel ripped off,' she said. 'At the end of the day they're Wotsits. I haven't spoken to Walkers about it and I didn't take them back to the shop. 'I don't feel hard done by, it's quite funny really, my kids think they're hilarious. 'But if it happened again, I would probably have a word with Walkers. Ms Bhatti found several mini-Wotsits measuring just 1cm long in her 99p multi-pack of the cheesy snacks which she bought at a discount retailer in Derby . 'I'd already seen a post on Facebook where somebody was saying they had small Wotsits so I'm not the only one.' Ms Bhatti says she and her family have decided against eating the crisps, but do not know what they are going to do with them. 'At first the kids were really excited and wanted to eat them but when we found more they said they wanted to keep them,' she said. 'I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the Wotsits now. The kids will probably go in the cupboard and eat them when my back is turned.'","Ayesha Bhatti, 29, found a number of the crisps measuring just 1cm long .

"A young woman, who had no luck when she posted an ad on Gumtree to find the father of her unborn son, is determined to keep searching after her baby almost died at birth. Bianca Fazey had a one-night stand with a man in Perth, Western Australia on April 23 last year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. The 25-year-old frantically searched for the father for five months but had no success as she only knew his name was Jeremy who was from the Perth suburb of Morley. As a last-ditch attempt she decided to post the ad which only created unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers. Two months ago, Logan Fazey was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him but now the little fella is fighting fit and healthy. Now that life has returned to normal after the trauma, the graphic design student has continued to look for Logan's father, a fly-in, fly-out worker in his 20s, who she met at the Harlem Wednesdays night at Amplifier Capitol. Scroll down for video . Bianca Fazey continues to  search for Logan's father who she had a one-night stand with in April last year . Two months ago, Logan was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him - pictured is the first time Bianca got to touch her son . Now the little fella is fighting fit and Bianca described Logan as 'strong, smart, happy and very, very loved' Her latest appeal has seen social media users label Bianca as an unfit mother and accuse her of telling her story just for the money. 'I'm so appalled at comments that I am a bad mother and 'god help my child'. It makes me sick that people can judge so quickly off something that is 500 words long,' she said on her Facebook page. 'Yeah I am still looking, I will probably always be looking I am very curious as to who this person is and one day Logan probably will be too. 'I don't ever expect him to come forward but if he did contact me, it would only be between us two and not the world. ' Bianca then responded to the accusations that she was paid to do the media interviews. 'For the incredibly judgemental people thinking it is all about money, I have never accepted anything for the stories, I also have my own money, I work and I study full time, I am not this drop kick you assume me to be!' she said. 'I love this beautiful boy with all my heart and I am a fantastic mother, he is strong, smart, happy and very, very loved!' She then went onto express her gratitude for the ongoing support of her family and friends in the town of Jurien Bay - 260km north of Perth. 'Not only do I have the support of my family but also this beautiful town I live in and my amazing friends, I am so appreciative of everyone who has been kind to me even if you are holding your tongue!' she said. 'I don't know if this will be the end of this story, I will continue living my life and raising Logan just as I have been, in no way is getting 15 minutes of fame a priority on my list. 'Logan, my family, our health and happiness is all that matters to me.' Bianca Fazey posted a Gumtree ad last year in an attempt to find her unborn son's father . Bianca's ad (pictured) received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers . When Bianca fell pregnant all she could think about was letting the pending father know the news. 'I was at my wits end,' she told Daily Mail Australia in December. 'I tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant I don't give up despite exhausting all avenues.' This when Bianca, who was so stressed that she was losing sleep, decided to post an ad on Gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down. 'I stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen, maybe I will get lucky,' she said. 'Unfortunately all I got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be Jeremy.' The most offensive messages were from people saying that Bianca should have opted for a termination. 'When it was shared on the LAD bible page a lot of people made single-minded comments aimed at me, no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant,' she said. 'Sometimes I want to be like one of those people on Maury Povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they're booing about!' Bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby . Bianca (pictured before being pregnant) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome . Bianca wasn't exactly shocked to be called names like a 'sl**' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying 'kill it'. 'It was sad to see people saying I should get an abortion, those were the only comments that hurt.' 'Society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship,' she said. 'I was more mad at the amount of women (mums included) saying I shouldn't go through with it.' But Bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months. 'All I can say is I chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because I didn't think I could have children,' she said. 'Even though I knew this guy had disappeared I didn't want to give up my chance and I'm so grateful I didn't.' Bianca has hit out at people saying she is a 'sl**', a bad mother and has only told her story for money . Despite the fall-out from the ad - Bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends. 'It has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person,' she said. 'I couldn't be happier, I am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment.' She is also looking forward to getting back into shape . 'Excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape!' she said. 'I hate that I'm so limited physically.' Bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son's life. 'I do hope that I can find him and let him know, he can make his own choice,' she said. 'But more for the sake of the kid, when he asks questions or wants to find him I want to be prepared.' She still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of Logan's life .","Bianca Fazey had a one-night stand with a man in Perth on April 23, 2014 .

"Down a dirty track, huddled on a pile of filthy second-hand duvets and surrounded by huge mounds of rubbish, a family pull their ripped clothes around them for warmth. Yang Shongshi looks for his crutch as he clutches his leg in pain. The 50-year-old broke it last year and cannot afford to pay a doctor. His four children – aged between 11 and two – surround him after spending all day scavenging. They are unable to go to school because they were not registered at birth, People's Daily Online reported. Chinese father Yang Shongshi (centre) has been forced to live on a rubbish dump with his family for 20 years because he couldn't find a job. The government has no official identification records for them . In fact the whole family is 'invisible'. Mr Shongshi has been living on a dump in Xinzhou, China, for 20 years and the government has no official records he - or his wife and children - ever existed. A series of shocking photos has now revealed what life is really like for the family. Mr Shongshi, who cannot read and write, moved 330 miles away from his home in the Shandong province in 1995 in the hope he would find work. But he found no one to employ him and had to move on to a 600 square metre patch of land covered in junk. He  even married his 45-year-old wife Li Runling, who has learning disabilities, on the dump. Their only form of shelter is a shack. Eldest daughter Yuanyuan, 11, helps with chores while her father scavenges. She went to school for two years but was removed after they discovered she had no records. A series of shocking photos has now revealed what life is really like for the family, who have hardly any shelter and sleep on second-hand duvets .

When she has nothing to do she looks at the books her father found in the rubbish - but does not understand any of the words. 'I actually really want to go to school,' she said. Mr Shongshi said life is very difficult. He said: 'My wife isn't able to help as she has problems and so I am the only one who can feed our children. A tiny shack made out of bricks roughly pushed together is the only shelter the family have. A washing line hangs between a wooden pole and their door to keep their clothes off the ground .

'But because we don't have an official address, I can't register the kids as residents and therefore they can't go to school. 'I can't read or write so I can't help them and nor can my wife. My dream is to make a better life for our children. Anything has to be better than this.' The photos have been sent to officials who are investigating.

"A fed up father left his entire £2million estate to his two daughters – because his two sons refused to stop smoking. Businessman Dawid van Vuuren, 87, who had suffered from cancer, warned his sons Daniel, 60, and Marius, 55, that unless they quit the habit they would not get a penny from him. Marius said: 'My brother had told me what our father said but we thought it was a joke. We didn't take it seriously.' Two sons have been disinherited for not giving up smoking when their father told them to do so in his will . The two contested the will, saying that their father, from Pretoria, South Africa, had only written it as a warning, but had then died suddenly, leaving it the only signed will in his possession. The children only discovered the will, which was handwritten on a piece of paper, after their father's death last year. At the High Court in Pretoria, Daniel said he and his brother spoke about this prior to their father's death, but they laughed about it as they thought it was funny . He said: 'The truth is my father did admonish me on many occasions during his life that he would disinherit me if I did not stop smoking. 'I never took his threat seriously and I was shocked when it appeared that he actually carried out his threat.' The brothers claimed it was then implemented by lawyers against their father's wishes. However, it was ruled by Judge Cynthia Pretorius to be Mr van Vuuren's true will. Judge Pretorius said it was clear no other testament could be found, except for this paper. Dawid's secretary signed it as a witness, as required by law. She had worked for him for 18 years and confirmed his signature was genuine.","Former cancer sufferer Dawid van Vuuren, 87, made threat to cut out sons .

"Jewish schools and synagogues will get £10million a year for guards to protect against anti-Semitic attacks, David Cameron announced last night. In a hard-hitting speech to Jewish leaders last night, he promised not turn ‘a blind eye’ both to physical attacks and to ‘non-violent extremism’. The Prime Minister said new money had been found in the Budget to protect the community following the terrorist attacks in Paris and at a synagogue in Denmark. Hard-hitting copy: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured yesterday) said new money had been found in the Budget to protect the community following the terrorist attacks in Paris and at a synagogue in Denmark . He said he had been ‘sickened beyond belief’ by the attacks in Paris in which journalists were killed at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, and more people died at a kosher grocery store. ‘At a time when once again the Jewish communities of Europe feel vulnerable, and when anti-Semitism is at record levels here in Britain, I will not stand by, I will not turn a blind eye’, Mr Cameron said. And he hit out at the ‘poisonous ideology’ of Islamic extremism, which he said involved not just terrorist attacks but ‘incitement’ on the internet and by radical preachers. He said this involved the peddling of ‘the idea that Muslims all over the world are being persecuted as a deliberate act of Western policy… that 9/11 was a Jewish plot or that the 7/7 London attacks were staged.’ Terrorism: Mr Cameron said he had been ‘sickened beyond belief’ by the attacks in Paris in which journalists were killed at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo (above), and more people died at a kosher store . He told the Community Security Trust, a Jewish charity which protects the community against anti-Semitism, that their 3,000 volunteers represent the ‘best of Britain’. Currently around £2billion a year is provided in security to Jewish state schools. But the Prime Minister said he had been asked what would happen if there was a terrorist attack at a private school. ‘How would we feel if we know we could have done more?’, he said. ‘That’s not a thought I am prepared to entertain’. He announced £7million a year of new money to fund guards for all Jewish private schools and colleges across the country. Terror attacks: Mr Cameron said 'incitement' on the internet and by radical preachers involved the peddling of the idea 'that 9/11 (left) was a Jewish plot or that the 7/7 London attacks (right) were staged' He added that MPs from all parties had highlighted the threat to synagogues and community buildings, which would get £3million. ‘That’s over £10million of new money for security – this year and every year – for as long as necessary’, Mr Cameron said. There will also be a one-off £1.5million payment to the Trust to fund state of the art CCTV cameras. Mr Cameron said the Jewish community feels ‘safe to live and flourish’ in Britain, at a time when thousands of Jews are fleeing France every year to live in Israel. He added: ‘For as long as I am Prime Minister, you will never be alone. When people talk of trying to boycott Israel, you will never be alone. With me you will always have a British Prime Minister whose belief in Israel is unbreakable.’","PM says new money found in Budget will protect Jewish community .

"Jerry Springer had nothing but kind words to say about his former producer Jill Blackstone, who could be rearrested for the murder of her sister. The Hollywood producer was arrested for murder on Wednesday in Los Angeles but later released without charge over the death of her sister, Wendy, 49, who was found dead in the garage of the home they shared on Saturday, alongside their three dogs. 'She hasn’t worked on the show for twenty years but I remember her,' Springer told Daily Mail Online exclusively. 'She was just a very nice person. She was one of our producers and a very good one. 'But I can’t comment on anything else about what’s currently happening with her, he said' Meanwhile LAPD officer Drake Madison tell Daily Mail Online that this is 'an ongoing murder investigation.' 'Jill Blackstone was arrested on Saturday but the District Attorney dropped the charges and she is no longer in custody. The investigation is still active and the police are looking for a murderer,' he said. Asked if the police could re-arrest Jill, officer Madison said he had no further information at this time. Arrested: Jill Blackstone, a former producer on Jerry Springer, was taken into custody by the LAPD in connection with the death of her sister, Wendy Blackstone. Neighbors say it was a suicide pact gone wrong . Scene: Police were called to the Studio City home of Jill Blackstone on Monday, after she reported finding her sister and three dogs dead in the garage . Stephanie’s husband, Dennis, 68, added: ‘Around 4pm they brought Jill out and she was conscious and she was sitting up, but they didn’t bring anyone else out. 'Then they brought out one of the dogs, wrapped in a sheet.’ The Cohens explained how the sisters were under a great deal of pressure, especially Jill, 52, as Wendy was deaf. To make matters worse the sisters were facing being forced out of their home in the San Fernando Valley area  by developers. Neighbors exclusively told Daily Mail Online said they heard through the police that Wendy had died by asphyxiation and were led to believe the incident had been an attempted double suicide, possibly by trying to poison themselves with fumes from their car. Stephanie Cohen, 60, who lives across the street from the sisters said: ‘The police were here for 12 to 14 hours on Saturday. We were told they were investigating a double suicide, an attempt, and one of the people died.’ On Wednesday numerous signs were posted on the property saying it had been marked for demolition. Stephanie added: ‘They were having a hard time finding a new home because the sister that died was very ill - she couldn’t see, she couldn’t hear, she was housebound, she was very ill. So she needed to find a house that could accommodate her sister with the illness and the dogs. Evidently the pressure was intense on them, but nobody expected this to happen.’ According to TMZ, Jill was the one to call police, who subsequently arrested her after they concluded a suicide note reportedly left by her sister had actually been written by her. Jill was initially held on $1 million bail before being released later on Wednesday, and the case was sent to the Los Angeles Police Department for further investigation, according to the website. Animal lover: Blackstone was arrested on suspicion of murder, but later released without charge . Hollywood producer: Blackstone has worked on shows including Jerry Springer, Sally Jessy Raphael, Rosie, Dr. Drew, The Real, and Sharon Osbourne . Another neighbor, Ron Ross, an 81-year-old actor, said he had been told by a close friend of the Blackstone sisters they had attempted to kill themselves in a suicide pact. He added: ‘They kept themselves to themselves, they seemed very nice, I know they had a dog rescue operation.

"A Virginia chiropractor has been indicted on suspicion of intentionally shooting dead a family's beloved German Shepherd with a bow and arrow. Court documents read in Fauquier County on Monday claim 47-year-old Howard Van Nostrand killed five-year-old Morgan on October 3 during deer hunting season because he was scared of being cornered by dogs. However, the same court documents also state that Van Nostrand was 15-feet above the ground in a tree stand when he pulled the trigger. Killed: Morgan was shot dead by two arrows fired by Virginia chiropractor Howard Van Nostrand on October 3 . Devastated: Craig and Karen LeValley have said they are distraught at losing their beloved family pet . According to owner's, Craig and Karen LeValley, they first realized something was wrong when their other German Shepherd, Zeus, returned from a run around outside their property without Morgan. They received a phone call from Fauguier County Sheriff's around one hour later following a failed attempt to find their dog and discovered Morgan dead from two arrows according to Fox News. Nostrand had told police his childhood fears of being cornered by dogs had caused him to shoot Morgan, however, the LeValley's refute this. They say texts sent between Van Nostrand and another hunter who was there in the tree stands prove his intent. Memories: The LeValley's have set up a Facebook page called Paws for Morgan on which they have posted pictures of their dog as a puppy (right) The text were read out in court and allegedly reveal one hunter ask Van Nostrand what to do about the two dogs who were out on a run around the LeValley's property. He allegedly replied he would take care of it and shot Morgan twice. Van Nostrand has never denied shooting Morgan, but claims it was out of fear because he had been 'cornered by dogs when he was younger and didn’t want to take that chance again.' The chiropractors legal counsel asked for a plea bargain but the request was denied according to Fox News. Van Nostrand will appear in front of a grand jury on March 23 and is charged with cruelty to animals and destruction of personal property greater than $1,000. The case now moves to a jury trial.","Howard Van Nostrand, 47, was indicted in Virginia court on Monday .

"Airline staff are trained to try to solve customers' travelling problems, but one selfless employee has gone above and beyond the call of duty. The Alaska Airlines employee, Judy Reid, paid out of her own pocket to fly a stranded customer home in a heartwarming act of kindness. Vancouver resident Miriam Thomas was left stranded and confused as she was trying to return from a business trip to California, when her ticket to Seattle with Delta Air Lines, an Alaska Airlines partner, was cancelled.

"Facebook has created a new rule book that tells users the sort of content they can and can't post on the site, including a ban on images of 'fully exposed' buttocks. The social network has been criticised in the past for inconsistency when it comes to user-published content. While images of breastfeeding have been tightly clamped down on, videos of beheadings have made it onto newsfeeds on more than one occasion. Scroll down for video . Facebook has published a new Community Standards page, clarifying what it will allow to be posted on its site. This includes clarification that some nudity is allowed for artistic purposes, but images of genitals or buttocks will be taken down. This includes clarification that some nudity is allowed for artistic purposes, but images of genitals or buttocks will be taken down. Another key area to be addressed is self-harm, with the promotion of self-harm or suicide not allowed. Facebook states it will remove content that 'promotes or encourages suicide or any other type of self-harm, including self-mutilation and eating disorders'. The site adds that it will not allow any content that identifies victims or survivors of self-harm or suicide and targets them. Now, the social media hub has clarified its policies with a new Community Standards section of the website. This includes clarification that some nudity is allowed for artistic purposes, but images of genitals or buttocks will be taken down. Facebook's had of global policy management, Monika Bickert, said in a blog post announcing the new page: 'Billions of pieces of content are shared on Facebook every day. 'We hope these updates help provide more clarity about the standards we have, whether they are our own Community Standards or those imposed by different laws around the world.' On the subject of direct physical threats,  Facebook said it reviews all reports of threats to identify those which are credible to public and personal safety. 'We remove credible threats of physical harm to individuals. We also remove specific threats of theft, vandalism or other financial harm.' The site said it also factors in location when evaluating threats, including the status of the part of the world a threat has come from.

Facebook states it will remove content that 'promotes or encourages suicide or any other type of self-harm, including self-mutilation and eating disorders'. The site adds that it will not allow any content that identifies victims or survivors of self-harm or suicide and targets them. While confirming it doesn't consider body modification to be self-harm, it added it does allow the sharing of information about the topic of self-harm and suicide when it 'does not promote these things'. The new guidelines also say that Facebook does not allow any organisations to have a presence on the site that engage in terrorist activity, organised crime, or promoting hate against others. The site says it will also remove content expressing support for any groups involved in such behaviour. This comes in the wake of increased social media activity from organisations such as ISIS. On nudity, the social giant said its policies can 'sometimes be more blunt than we would like', highlighting that while some nudity may be for a campaign or artistic purpose, some Facebook users in different parts of the world may be be sensitive to this type of content. As a result, Facebook said: 'We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures. 'Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for educational, humorous or satirical purposes. 'Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited. 'Some verbal descriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed.' There is also a section on hate speech, with  Facebook confirming it relies on users to report cases of hate speech.

However, the new Community Standards page identifies prohibited content as anything that directly attacks people based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender, disability or disease. The site added that it encourages people to 'challenge ideas, institutions and practices because such challenges can promote debate and greater understanding'. Facebook also said that it allows 'humour, satire or social commentary related to these topics' if the user is posting under their real identity. The new guidelines also cover the area of violence and graphic content. Here, Facebook will continue to be a place where users can share experiences and raise awareness, says the site. 'Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and graphic images of public interest or concern, such as human rights abuses or acts of terrorism.

"The parents of a nine-month-old northwest Missouri boy who died after being accidentally shot in the head by his five-year-old brother will not be charged. Alexis Wiederholt, 24,  made a frantic call to police in the small town of Elmo after her five-year-old son told her 'I'm sorry, Mom. I shot Corbin'. The infant was flown 120 miles away to a hospital in Kansas City, where he was pronounced dead. Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice announced Friday that Mrs Wiederholt and her father Bill Porter would not be charged with criminal negligence for the 'tragic accident' at the grandfather's home. Scroll down for video . Nine-month-old Corbin Wiederholt (above in mother Alexis's arms with father Brad and  brothers) was killed when his five-year-old brother shot him with a revolver. No negligence charges are being filed in the case . Mr Porter owned multiple guns, including the .22-caliber magnum revolver used to shoot his grandson, according to the St. Joseph News-Press. Both he and his daughter, who lives in North Dakota with her husband but was visiting her father before a National Guard stint, believed that the weapons were empty and stored in a gun safe. The revolver was kept in a shelf built into Mr Porter's headboard in the same room where Corbin was in a playpen. Mr Rice said that the weapon was not in plain sight. Mrs Widerholt originally thought that her five-year-old had shot her baby with a paintball gun before finding out that he had been shot in the head with a handgun. 'I walked in and there was my baby, lying there, bleeding,' the young mother told NBC News. 'I had just hugged him in my arms five minutes before that.' Corbin (above) was shot in a playpen at his grandfather Bill Porter's house, which was in the same room where a revolver was stored in a headboard . Mrs Widerholt was home alone with her children and doing laundry at the time of the tragic shooting . She was home alone with her children doing laundry at the time of the tragic shooting, according to the Maryville Daily Forum. Mrs Wiederholt revealed that she had no idea her father even kept a loaded gun in the home. 'I didn't know it was there until I turned around and saw it laying on the bed,' she said. Porter said of the tragedy; 'I told the boys they weren't supposed to be in my bedroom where I keep the gun cabinet and they knew it — but like I said, boys will be boys.' Neighbor Jessica Hutchison, said: 'I think that gun safety could have come into play and would have maybe prevented the situation. It's just really sad altogether.' The Wiederholt children are five, three, and one-and-a-half years old. A Child Fatality Review Board recommended that Mrs Wiederholt and her father not be charged shortly after the incident. Criminal negligence occurs when someone 'fails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a result will follow, and such failure constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise in the situation' according to Missouri law. An average of 62 children are shot unintentionally each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control.","Corbin Wiederholt, 9 months, was shot while in his Elmo, Missouri, playpen .

"This is the moment a hapless motorist was found desperately clinging to his car aerial after he careered through a fence and plunged into a 12ft deep garden pond. The non swimmer was at the centre of a rescue operation after he was spotted waist deep in the murky water with his hands wrapped around the mast. The Vauxhall Corsa ended up nearly fully submerged in the pond after the driver slewed off the road, when he collided with a parked car to avoid a deer. This is the moment the hapless motorist was found clinging to his car aerial after plunging into a garden pond . Police, fire fighters and paramedics were dispatched to bizarre scene in Rumburgh, Suffolk, after the alarm was raised at around 3am. Fire crews used an extendable ladder to rescue the man from the roof of his car before the damaged Corsa was hauled out of the water. 'I didn't hear much as I was fast asleep, but then there were three fire engines, the ambulance and the police outside my house,' said Roger Davis, 59, whose pond was at the centre of the rescue. 'The chap was clinging to the roof of the car, they got him off and pulled the car out. He couldn't swim - and the pond is about 12 foot deep at the moment. 'I think the chap went to hospital with hypothermia, he was clinging to the roof and holding on to the car's aerial. It was interesting to say the least. 'I think he'd swerved to avoid a deer, that's what the police said.' Fire crews used an extending ladder to assist the unnamed motorist getting back to dry land . The blue coloured Vauxhall Corsa was left almost fully submerged after the early morning accident . After the driver was rescued the mangled wreckage of the car was hauled from the water by a tow truck . The man was breathalyzed by police at the scene, but he gave a negative test for alcohol. Stuart Hostler, watch commander at Halesworth fire station, said: 'He was a very lucky chap. 'When we got there he had already got out of the car and was holding on to the aerial for dear life. 'He was showing signs that he was very cold and he was up to his waist in the water.'

"Their crimes were committed decades ago but these Edwardian crooks are as menacing as ever as they gaze out of their police mugshots taken way back at the turn of the 20th century. The motley crew,  including many women and children, were arrested on charges ranging from petty theft to murder and photographed before being hauled before the North Shields Police Court between 1902 and 1916. The fascinating images  were given to Tyne & Wear Archives back in November 2010 and over the last few weeks historians have been adding to the set which now holds over 1000 mugshots. Killer: Corsican Jerome Guerrini was jailed for 15 years in 1904 for murdering labourer Patrick Gilligan. The Judge  said of Corsicans: 'If there was anything that distinguished a Corsican from the native of any other country, it was the hotness of his blood and the constant use of the knife' Smutty: Both Thomas Wallace, left and James Dawson, right, were  arrested on charges of indecent exposure in June 1902 and February 1905 respectively . Susan Joice, left,  was arrested for larceny in August 1903 while Susannah Adamson, right, was arrested for the same crime  in 1904. Larceny was  a form of theft which involved 'taking and carrying away' property from someone else, but without committing or threatening violence . Alan Hayward, an archivist at Tyne and Wear Archives said: 'As the photos piled up we thought this would be a good opportunity to find out more about the stories behind them. 'The mugshots include quite a few of children. 'These can really tug at the heartstrings.' Among the crooks on display are youngsters David Lloyd, 15, and George Burn, 14, who were arrested on 10 November 1902 for larceny, a form of theft. Historians from the archive have been trying to find out more about the pictures and found a report in the Shields Daily News which said that the boys were charged with 'stealing on the 8th inst. from a wash-house in Prudhoe Street brushes and a box worth 3s, the property of Peter Johnson'. The Shields Daily News for 17 November 1902 then revealed that the boys pleaded guilty to the offences and their parents were bound over in the sum of £5 for their good behaviour during the following 6 months. Young offenders: David Lloyd, 15, left, and his accomplice George Burn, 14, right, were both convicted in November 1902 for stealing 'brushes and a box worth 3s' from a wash house, alongside his accomplice George Burn, 14. The Shields Daily News reported that the boys pleaded guilty to the offences and their parents were bound over in the sum of £5 for their good behaviour during the following 6 months . Charlotte Branney and William Wilson were both arrested for larceny in  January 1904 and February 1905 respectively. The offence was abolished in 1968, and replaced with the broader crime of theft . Rogues: John Currey, left, was arrested in July 1905 while Simon Sheffield, right, was arrested in June 1906 the offences are unknown . But by the far the most terrifying Edwardian criminal featured is Corsican Jerome Guerrini, who was jailed for 15 years in 1904 for killing labourer Patrick Gilligan. Mr Hayward added: 'While the images of child prisoners really caught my attention, there was another case featured in the album, which had the same effect for completely different reasons. 'Rather than generating sympathy for the prisoner, this mugshot sent a shiver down my spine. 'There was something menacing about the prisoner's appearance and the word 'Murder' on the board he was holding didn't help matters either. 'The case would have been featured in countless newspapers around the country but I was able to find a particularly good account by searching the British Newspapers collection on the findmypast website. 'The account appeared in the Morpeth Herald for 26 November 1904 and it revealed that the prisoner Jerome Guerrini (who also went under the alias of Joseph Brunetti) was a 27-year old Corsican who had spent the previous four years at sea as a fireman.' The Morpeth Herald reported that the man was accused of murdering labourer Patrick Gilligan who lived on Clive Street, North Shields (with two brothers named Davis), almost directly opposite the lodgings occupied by the accused. Annie Anderson was arrested for larceny in August 1903, left, while Mary A Butts,right, was arrested for the same crime in December 1904 . Ellen Healey, left and Maud M Garmey, right, were both arrested for unknown offences  in 1905 and 1908 respectively. Little more is known about the two women . Alfred Thompson, left, was arrested for larceny in August 1902 while Mary Brewis, right, was arrested for an unknown offence in February 1908 . Mr Hayward added: 'The Judge's summing up is interesting in the rather casual way that it stereotypes Corsicans. 'Did Gillighan single out Guerrini because he was a foreigner?' The report states that Judge Darling, in his summing up, said that 'if there was anything that distinguished a Corsican from the native of any other country, it was the hotness of his blood and the constant use of the knife.' The jury found Guerrini guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude. Mr Hayward said: 'By bringing together information from different sources, in this case a photograph album and local newspapers, it's possible to bring some fascinating, if tragic, stories to life. 'To my mind the mugshot album is particularly interesting because it relates to a port town. 'It gives us an insight into the lives of both locals and transient visitors such as Jerome Guerrini.' At the turn of the century North Shields, which is eight miles east of Newcastle, was an important fishing town and shipyard. It was also crucial to the industry of the North-East, leading to widespread urban poverty which might explain some of the crime documented in these photographs.","Police mugshots dating from the turn of the 20th century have been handed to the Tyne & Wear Archives .

"A blind man claimed health care workers carved the letters 'KKK' into his stomach during heart surgery in 2011, but a federal jury has found that a South Dakota hospital is not liable. Jurors ruled in favor of Rapid City Regional Hospital on Friday after five hours of deliberation. The hospital maintained that the marks on Vern Traversie's abdomen were the result of a skin reaction to medical tape. The Rapid City Journal reports that the 71-year-old sued the hospital for alleged violations of civil rights, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Scroll down for video . Injured: Vern Traversie (left) accused a  Rapid City Regional Hospital worker of  intentionally carving the letters ""KKK"" into his abdomen during heart surgery . Traversie is a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. State and federal authorities earlier concluded there was no criminal wrongdoing. A lawyer for a Native American man who claimed the letters 'KKK' were carved into his stomach during surgery filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the hospital where the operation took place in 2012. YouTube videos featuring 69-year-old Vern Traversie, a Lakota man who lives on the Cheyenne River Reservation, went viral in Native American communities in 2012. In them, Traversie talks about being mistreated at the South Dakota hospital and shows his abdomen. Though he himself is blind, Traversie says he was told by others that the scars left after his heart surgery form the letters. Video from YouTube . Vern Traversie is blind but after a nurse saw these scars in his abdomen and on his back after his 2011 heart surgery, she told him he should get someone to take a photo of his scars . A May rally in support of Traversie drew hundreds of people, many of whom said his story exemplifies the racism Native Americans experience in Rapid City. But others say they couldn'  make out the letters, including police who investigated his allegations and hospital officials. Chase Iron Eyes, a lawyer for Traversie, filed a lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in South Dakota against Rapid City Regional Hospital, its board of directors, physicians and TRS Surg Assist Inc. The lawsuit alleged a civil rights violation based on race and cites the scarring from Traversie's double-bypass surgery done in August 2011 as evidence. kk: The pattern of scars look as though they say KKK, which stands for the Klux Klux Klan . Defendants injured, carved, burned, and/or cared for Plaintiff's abdomen in such a manner that scars resembling three letters 'K' were permanently placed on Plaintiff's abdomen for no medically necessary purpose or reason, and in the process injured, carved, burned, and/or cared for other portions of Plaintiff's body to cause injury, specifically his abdomen and back,' the lawsuit stated. Tim Sughrue, chief executive of Rapid City Regional Hospital, said in a statement that the hospital will 'vigorously defend this claim'. 'We at Rapid City Regional Hospital are confident the care we provide meets or exceeds standards of care and is without bias or consideration of race, religion, color, age, sex, disability, national origin, or any other classification protected by law,' he said. 'I think the Native people have been fighting racial hatred for many years in South Dakota, but you know, it's not all the people that are hateful toward Native Americans,' said Traversie, who recently had another heart surgery in Bismarck, North Dakota. Post surgery: Vern Traversie shows his scars after getting heart surgery in 2011 and previously claimed the hospital carved KKK into his abdomen . 'We have a good segment of our society -- white society -- in South Dakota that are Christian people and they get along good with the Native Americans. In my instance, I believe I'm dealing with the Ku Klux Klan, and that's a small minority.' As well as the marks on his skin, he said the staff was also abusive towards him and when he told them how much pain he was in, no one did anything to help him. 'I had a confrontation with a male nurse while I was in intensive care,' he said. 'I was in so much pain, I begged him for pain medication. 'He told me to shut my f***ing mouth or he’d shut it for me. I didn’t provoke him. I didn’t disrespect him.' When he asked to be sent to a rehabilitation center because the pain was so bad, they said this was approved - but instead discharged him. On the day he was discharged, a nurse at the hospital told Mr Traversie that he should get someone to take a picture of the surgery scars on his stomach and his back. Hospital response: The hospital maintained that the marks on Vern Traversie's abdomen were the result of a skin reaction to medical tape . The nurse said she would not testify on his behalf but couldn't live with herself without at least alerting him to the scars. She said to him: 'My conscience won’t let me be. It’s bothered me for days. Something was done to you, and I believe it was wrong. 'I can’t sleep. I keep thinking about what they did to you.' He told the Indian Country Today Media Network after the operation: 'You can see the surgery sutures, and they’re clean. 'But those three letters, two good-sized Ks and one smaller one off to the side, had to be made with some sharp knife or heated instrument. It’s like they branded me.' Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and Cody Hall, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, which Traversie belongs to, organized the May rally in an effort to bring attention to what they say is continued mistreatment of Native American people. Iron Eyes declined to comment about the lawsuit. While Traversie's story spurred the protest, many Native Americans who attended referred to broken treaties, unsolved murders and incarceration rates among Native Americans as their reasons for showing up. They included Dennis Banks, who helped found the American Indian Movement in the late 1960s to protest the U.S. government's treatment of Indians and demand the government honor its treaties with Indian tribes. South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley said on Tuesday that his office would release information in the 'near future' about its investigation. A friend of the 69-year-old who made a YouTube video about the case, said they also cut down through an existing surgery scar and carved two vertical lines above the older scar. The hospital have attributed the extra wounds to surgical tape or to infections related to his diabetes.","Vern Traversie, now 71, accused a South Dakota Hospital of carving KKK into his stomach post surgery .

"Jane Whittington, 58, died after a freak wave hit while she was enjoying a dip on holiday in Goa . A British grandmother drowned after being swept away by a freak wave during an exotic luxury holiday in India. Jane Whittington, 58, was on a four-month break in the resort of Goa with her partner Steve Cooper when the tragedy hit. And sadly, the former carer never got to meet her newborn granddaughter, Betsy, who arrived while she was on her dream holiday. Ms Whittington, from Birley, Sheffield, and her partner, as well as her sister and brother-in-law, who were also on the trip, had been out a boat for a fishing trip before having a beach massage. She then decided to cool off with a dip in the sea with Mr Cooper, but got into difficulty and was carried out by a freak wave. Mr Cooper battled the rough conditions to rescue Ms Whittington,  and tried in vain to save her. The couple were due to return home this weekend, but instead she was cremated in Goa earlier this week. Paying tribute, her family said they were devastated at the loss of Ms Whittington, who 'lived life to the full'. Daughter Donna McGrail, 40, son Max Ellis, 37 and five grandchildren, are now planning to return later in the year to scatter her ashes. Mr Ellis's partner Kirstie Barber, said: 'All we know is she had a lovely day on a fishing trip, had a massage on a beach, went swimming and then a wave took her. 'Steve managed to get her out of the water but could not save her.' The former carer never got to meet her newborn granddaughter, who arrived while she was on her four-month dream holiday with her partner Steve Cooper, sister and brother-in-law . The couple were on holiday in the same resort they had visited for years, which Ms Whittington called her 'second home'. Ms Barber added: 'She loved it over there, she called it her second home and each time she went she stayed for longer and longer. 'Jane said that if she ever passed away over there it was a nice place to die and her wish was to stay there, which is why her ashes will be scattered there. 'Jane loved it there, she loved the easy, relaxed way of life. She felt part of the community and volunteered at a dog rescue place.' She added: 'She lived every day like it was going to be her last. Everyone is devastated, absolutely devastated.' The family are planning to celebrate her life at a gathering at The New Inn in Gleadless, on March 14. Ms Whittington visited the same resort in Goa (file photo above) many times and called it her 'second home'","Jane Whittington was on a four-month break with partner Steve Cooper .

"Their debut YouTube video of them miming to Queen's hit song 'Bohemian Rhapsody' attracted 18 million hits,  caught the attention of Brian May, and was credited by Billboard magazine with causing a staggering 261 per cent surge in the streaming of the iconic song. And now Sydney-based trio SketchSHE are back with a second hilarious car jam  titled 'Mime Through Time' featuring over 14 classic songs from the 40s through to now...and this time they appear naked. The stunning models turned comedy act, comprised of Shae-Lee Shackleford,28, Lana Kington, 25, Madison Lloyd,27, became an  overnight sensation when they released  'Bohemian Carsody' last month. Scroll down for video . Model mimers: Sydney comedy act SketchSHE rose to fame after release of YouTube parody 'Bohemian Carsody' Road trip reminisce: Sydney-based comedy trio SketchSHE have released second clip 'Mime Through Time' today . Mimicking Miley: Trio Shae-Lee (left), Madison (middle) and Lana (right) mime along to Miley Cyrus 'Wrecking Ball' One third of the trio, Shae-Lee Shackleford, says the response has been more than they ever imagined for the act that only started filming skits in December. 'We had no idea it would have such an incredible response. The fact that we've had people writing to us from around the world... I don't think there's been a country or continent that hasn't reached out and written to us to say they loved it.' Shackleford, 28, says the reason she thinks they've struck a chord with such a global fan base is that their song choice was so relatable, people love the song, it transcends the age and at some point in time everyone has had a 'rock out' to it. Another reason behind the Sydney trio's success is the natural sex appeal they inject into the humorous skit. As models who met  through the same agency, Shackleford admits while they are aware of their attractiveness they've chosen to incorporate it into the act in a way that defies the typical 'pretty girl' stereotype and still empowers women. 'Unlike what might be synonymous with an attractive girl, we want to be crazy, let our hair down, and break the rules a bit. But we still like to wear make-up and dress up - we just want be able to make fun of what we do while empowering women to be comfortable in their own skin.' Beatle mania: A dramatic rendition of 'Help' by the Beatles . Britney baby: 'Baby one more time'  with references to Spears's dark days . Elvis in the house: Elvis's 'Hound Dog' debuts in traditional full body suits . In their latest hit 'Mime Through Time', you can definitely expect even more sex appeal with the final scene including a rip-off of Miley Cyrus's 'Wrecking Ball' in which the girls go completely topless in their now famous Suzuki Swift. Shackleford admits the scene (which was filmed in the car of her dad's back drive way) was a definite risk and two alternative ends were filmed in case it came across as too risqué. 'When I first told mum she said ""oooh, I don't know"" but then when they saw it they cracked up and  think it's a great joke... My mum was more shocked by the fact I looked so much like my brother in the slim shady scene... which I'm not sure is a good thing.' The girls only use the bare essentials to produce the clip. 'The first time we had a bra in the car so we taped the iPhone to it and propped it up that way, but this time we upgraded to a block of wood, but it's still very dodgy,' says Shackleford. Getting thrifty: Fur coats and bling showcased in the mime of Macklemore's 'Thrift Shop' Painting the town: Face paint featured as  key costume in Gotye's 'Somebody that I used to know' Going ghetto: Gangster moves and flipped up hoods for Dr.Dre and Snoop Dogg's 'The Next Episode' As for the car setting itself, while the girls plan to continue jamming it out in the Suzuki, they admit there are restrictions. 'The very first take we did of the Elvis song, there's a bit where we do a canon with our face down and I completely head-butted the steering wheel. Lana just cracked up laughing and didn't ask if I'm okay, guess that sums up our friendship completely,' says Shackleford. When asked what the girls hope the audience will take away from their latest clip, Shackleford says as long as they laugh out loud at some point she'll be happy. But a good reminisce is also great too. Next up for the girls after the release of new clip 'Mime in Time' that's out today is a trip to Los Angeles for two weeks to line up a series of interviews in which they hope lands them a partner with a hope to start their own comedy show. We also hear new modes of transport will be included in part two of the SketchSHE skits and there may even be a blooper reel on it's way... Stay tuned.

"Police have been able to thwart a terrifying plot by a deranged St. Louis teenager to kidnap his friend's 10-year-old sister in the middle of the night, then allegedly smother her to death and rape her dead body, authorities say. John Thomas Classen, 17, is now in custody after breaking into his classmate's home in O'Fallon around 12.40am Thursday, using a window he deliberately left unlocked two days earlier, and hiding in the basement for over four hours. He then went up to the main level of the house, where the young girl - who he was reportedly in love with - was asleep on the couch, put his hand over her mouth and threatened to kill her if she screamed. Classen then allegedly dragged her to the basement, but the two slipped and fell down the stairs. Scroll down for video . Deranged: John Thomas Classen, 17, of O'Fallon, Missouri, was 'in love' with his friend’s 10-year-old sister and kidnapped the girl early Thursday, planning to smother and 'rape her dead body', then flee town, police said . Classen allegedly took his victim out the window he used to get into the house - located in the 100 block of McCluer Drive - and then to his car, which was parked in a nearby street. The girl continued resisting. He drove off, headed for a wooded area next to an apartment complex. 'He wanted to talk to her about the first time they met,' the victim's 18-year-old brother, who asked not to be named, told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 'My sister told him she was hurt and wanted to go back home.' Meanwhile, back at the house, the family's three dogs started barking at the sound of Classen and the victim tumbling down the stairs. The mother woke up, now about 5.25am, and started screaming after realizing her daughter was missing. She looked outside and allegedly saw Classen dragging her little girl down the street and quickly called 911. Scene: Classen allegedly broke into this O'Fallon home around 12.40am Thursday, using a window he left open while visiting the house two days earlier. He hid in the basement for four hours before kidnapping the victim . Police established road road blocks using a one-mile radius and we able to stop Classen at a checkpoint near the entrance to the Prairie Village subdivision, off the South Outer Road of Highway 364. The girl was rescued, shaken and with minor injuries. Police found a list on Classen's cellphone that detailed his plans. 'Take her to a secondary location, explain everything to her, smother her, rape her dead body, clean up and then pose the body … photograph her, dispose of her body, leave town,' police documents stated. 'We were very, very fortunate to get on it right away,' O'Fallon Police Chief Roy Joachimstaler said. The victim's brother goes to school with Classen at Fort Zumwalt West High School. They have known each other for about five years. The brother said he first realized something was amiss last summer, when Classen sent his sister a message on social media. It said he thought she was a cute and that he loved her. 'I took it in the best possible way and thought he was just being friendly,' he brother said. Safe: The 10-year-old victim is seen here being attended to by ambulance officers following Classen's arrest . Injured: The girl had a sore ankle from the fall down the stairs and scratches on her back, but was fine . Arrest: Quick-thinking police were able to intercept Classen within 35 minutes of him snatching the girl . The cellphone Classen wrote said that he was going to rehearse the abduction and wear latex gloves. After pulling off the alleged rape and murder, he planned to flee town and hide in a foreclosed home, and surviving by stealing cars and money. Part of the note read: 'She will die as she lived, my only friend. The darkness has engulfed everything … I’ll miss you.' Classen has been charged with child kidnapping, burglary and two counts of child abuse. 'This is one of those things that makes no sense; there’s no logical reason behind it,' the brother told STLtoday. 'I hope he gets punished and that he gets some mental help.' Classen's bail was set at $1.5 million.","John Thomas Classen, 17, broke into friend's home at 12.40am Thursday .

"Clare Balding has abandoned the Grand National to host the Boat Race . Clare Balding will abandon the Grand National next month to host the Boat Race because it is the first time coverage will also include the women’s race. The date of the Oxford-Cambridge rowing race clashes with the Aintree event, which she has covered for 21 years. The Bafta-winning presenter, 44, told the Racing Post: ‘I knew I couldn’t do the Grand National because of the Boat Race. 'I have not been quiet about my commitment to women’s sport and next year will be a really historic moment because the Women’s Boat Race will be on TV for the very first time. 'I would have liked to do both events, but whereas I’ve covered the last 21 Grand Nationals I’ve never covered the Women’s Boat Race. ‘I felt I couldn’t say all I say about women in sport and then not be there that first time the women are on the tideway.’ Yesterday one of her Twitter followers, Kev Doolan, wrote: ‘Still can’t believe you are doing the Boat Race over the Grand National #deserter.’ She responded: ‘For the record, the Grand National doesn’t need my help, women’s sport does.’ After Mr Doolan said he was upset she was leaving the Grand National after 21 years because she was such a good presenter, she added: ‘You’re very kind but it’s a very good team at C4 and I don’t think you’ll even notice I’m not there. And I believe that sometimes you’ve got to do something unexpected to make your point. My point being women’s sport matters.’ She added: ‘It’s a very good team and I don’t think you’ll even notice I’m not there. I believe sometimes you’ve got to do something unexpected to make your point. My point being women’s sport matters.’ Miss Balding has long been an advocate of women’s sport and believes that in recent years female athletes have been taken more seriously. She told The Independent last year: ‘I’ve felt that, especially since London 2012, the demand for a variety of women’s sport is there from the public. ‘They’re interested, they’re engaged and I have the feeling that in the next ten years we are going to see a massively changed cultural landscape.

"It's a feast of epic proportions. Hungry sharks, dolphins, gannets and even a whale take part in a feeding frenzy of a staggering nine million sardines. The huge cluster of sardines form a ball as a defence mechanism to try and look bigger but that doesn't stop the predators attacking them. Scroll down for video . Dolphins take the opportunity for all-you-can eat buffet of sardines in The Wild Coast, on the East coast of South Africa . This gannet gets perilously close to a marauding shark, and appears to realise the danger nearby . A whale decided to get involved in the action, but there was enough food to go around for sure . Dolphins lead the hunt and attack first, causing the school of fish to split up - after it is a free for all between the sharks, gannets and whale. The frenzy was 25 metres beneath the surface and lasted for over a staggering seven hours. Wildlife photographer Michael Aw was underwater and managed to capture the spectacular feeding frenzy which took place in The Wild Coast, on the East coast of South Africa. Michael, 59, who is from Sydney, Australia, said that seeing this mass feast, called the 'sardine run', was 'the greatest show on earth - the pinnacle of wildlife adventure.' The huge cluster of sardines form a ball as a defence mechanism to try and look bigger but that doesn't stop the predators attacking them . This shark must have thought all its dreams had come true as around nine million sardines swim past . Around 300 dusky sharks, bronze whale sharks and sand tiger sharks all got in on the action and were joined by 150 dolphins and 1000 gannets - as well as a Bryde's whale. Michael, who photographs the sardine run every year, said: 'This is the greatest show on earth - the pinnacle of wildlife adventure. 'A scientist confirmed that there were nine million sardines in the huge ball, it was happening 25 metres below the surface. 'The dolphins break out a size-able chunk of sardines from the main shoal and chase it to near the surface.

'The gannets, sharks and the whale are all opportunist feeders. 'The school of sardines were hurling away and forming a big ball to look bigger as a defence mechanism. 'I was there from 9am until 4pm and when I left, they were still feeding. 'Witnessing it was breathtaking - exhilarating - nothing can compare to it, it was the wildest of all wild moments.'

"Shocking CCTV footage has emerged of a British tourist shooting himself in the head in an apparent suicide at a shooting range in Thailand. The horrified reaction of a worker at the range who was supervising the man - identified as Liam Colven, originally from the Isle of Skye - can be seen as he wheels away in shock after trying to stop Mr Colven turning a handgun on himself. The footage was taken from a camera at the Thalang range on Phuket, Thailand, where the British man had arrived by taxi, reportedly following an argument with a male friend. When he hailed the taxi, he asked the driver to 'take me somewhere I can shoot', it was reported. A distressed staff member first tries to stop the man shooting himself, before wheeling away unable to believe what has just happened . Tragic: The man who shot himself has been identified as Liam Colven who was originally from the Isle of Skye . A Foreign Office spokesperson said it is 'urgently working with the authorities in Thailand to establish whether a British national has died in Phuket'. The 21-year-old used an 11mm pistol to shoot himself in the head. The incident happened at around 3pm local time when according to a staffer at the range, Mr Colven bought one package of six bullets and fired them all off at a target, reports the Phuket Gazette. He then asked for three more bullets before turning the gun on himself and firing at point blank range, staff and witnesses told police. Paying tribute to Mr Colven on Facebook last night, friend Alex Macleod said: 'There are no more words to sum up the events of today or to describe the loss and emotions of the people of Skye that has not all ready been said. 'However I consider myself lucky to be a part of a small community that I know will support the family in the days, weeks, & years to come. 'This wonderful community will also share in the loss and help each other to overcome it. RIP Liam Colven.' Jenny Mackenzie wrote: 'Love you Liam Colven sleep tight will cya one day mate x.' In the video of the incident, the staff member, wearing a light blue shirt, flings the sun hat he is wearing aside seconds after the shooting. Clearly in serious distress immediately following the man's actions, which apparently came without any sort of warning, he grips a table in shock before walking away with his hands on his head. Clearly in complete shock, the staff member who was supervising the man turns his face away in horror just seconds after he had tried to stop the British man from firing when he apparently turned the gun on himself . The man falls to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place . The member of staff then falls to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place. He looks back at where the tourist's body is lying slumped on the ground where he fell after discharging the weapon. Phuketwan reports that the British man called a taxi from a rank outside the Sun Wing Resort in Bang Tao to take him to the shooting range at around 2pm. The taxi driver who picked him up from a hotel at the beach resort, on Phuket's west coast, said the man was seen arguing with a friend before he picked him up. Prasert Pasaman, 41, said: 'I then asked him where he wanted to go, and he said ""take me somewhere I can shoot"" so I took him to the shooting range,' The Bangkok Post reported. But Mr Pasaman later told MailOnline that Mr Colven had not been involved in an argument, and had seemed 'happy' and 'normal' before the incident. Mr Pasaman said that he had seen Mr Colven speaking to another man outside the Sunkiss Hotel, but said they were not arguing. 'They talked for around half an hour. Not fighting just talking.' The taxi driver was sure the man had been Mr Colven's friend and not a hotel employee, and that Mr Colven was stopping by to see him. Despite not knowing for sure, he added: 'they looked like they knew each other' After that Mr Colven walked the short distance across the road and asked for a taxi. 'He said, ""I want to shoot"" so I took him there. The driver said there was 'some talk' during the drive but added that his 'English is not good' and the only thing he remembered was that he was 'from the UK'. Mr Colven was not staying in the premises himself, but it's believed he was visiting a friend before he went to the shooting range and shot himself dead. 'He was just sitting out the front for around a half an hour or an hour,' receptionist Jasmine Belarmino told MailOnline on Sunday. 'He look fine. He didn't seem sad or worried. He asked one of the employees about taxis. 'There are so many people through the hotel everyday and he didn't stand out to me. He was like anybody else.' A Thai policeman told MailOnline that Mr Colven had not been staying in the Ban Tao area prior to his death and that the young man's belongings had been collected by officers and taken to a the Thalang police station. He added that Mr Colven had been at the Sunkiss hotel to 'visit a friend'. A staffer at the Thalang shooting range said: 'He came by a taxi. He bought a ticket for shooting a .45 handgun and then then shot himself in the head.' The British tourist shot himself after emptying one magazine at a target, staff at the Thalang range said . MailOnline spoke to a young neighbour of the Thalang range deep in the Phuket countryside (pictured) Local officials have become increasingly concerned at the number of suicides among expats and tourists visiting Phuket. Pictured is Paradise Beach on the Thai island . A young man living near the shooting range, who did not want to give his name, told MailOnline: 'It is sad. I heard shots and someone scream. 'The police came and took his body away.' The range the 21-year-old visited is deep in the Phuket countryside, down a number of rocky byroads and around an hour from the bustling hub of Patong. The spot is peaceful  at night with plenty of trees around and a tied-up elephant grazing in front. Lt Kraisorn Boonprasop of the Thalang Police said: 'We have taken statements from some witnesses but we will question more people at the scene and we have yet to review the CCTV footage.'

Southeast Asia has an unfortunate reputation as somewhere where dangerous weapons can be fired for fun if you know the right people. There are also dozens of legitimate shooting ranges across the country offering tourists a wide array of guns to shoot. It may be  illegal for a foreigner to own or purchase firearms in Thailand, but you can fire handguns, rifles, shotguns and automatic weapons at these establishments. In Patong, around an hour from Thalang, the Shooting Café is located in the Jungceylon shopping mall and boasts on its website that it has an 'air-conditioned, full-service café wrapped around the shooting range. 'There’s a closed-circuit TV system inside too, so you can sit at the bar with a drink and watch shooters firing on all cylinders.' The Old City, known as Rattanakosin, is the epicentre of gun culture in the capital Bangkok. According to thailawforum: 'almost 80 gun and weapons shops line Wang Burapha Road. 'Shotguns and rifles stand upright in retail window displays next to arrays of handguns and ammo. 'For Thais looking to purchase guns, there’s no other place to go, though for foreign gun-enthusiasts, the most you can do is look.' If you're an expat resident or seasoned traveller in the region the chances are you know at least one person who has 'rented' weapons from enterprising military personnel.","Incident happened at Thalang range not far from the international airport .

"Surgeons have carried out the UK’s first transplant of a non-beating heart. Donor hearts are usually from people who are brain-stem dead, but whose hearts are still beating. In this case, the organ came from a donor after their heart and lungs had stopped functioning. Surgeons at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire restored function to the heart before placing it on an Organ Care System to maintain its quality before it was transplanted. It is the first time such a procedure has been performed in Europe. Surgeons at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire restored function to the heart before placing it on an Organ Care System to maintain its quality before it was transplanted to 60-year-old Huseyin Ulucan from London . Recipient Huseyin Ulucan, 60, from London, who underwent surgery earlier this month, had a heart attack in 2008. He said: ‘Before the surgery, I really had no quality of life. Now I’m feeling stronger every day.’ The hospital said Mr Ulucan was making ‘remarkable progress’ after spending only four days in its critical care unit before being allowed to go home. Currently not everyone who needs a heart transplant can have one due to there not being enough suitable ones available. However, it is hoped that by using non-beating hearts, the number of people able to have heart transplants could increase by  up to 25 per cent in the UK alone, saving hundreds of lives. Last year, surgeons in Australia performed the world’s first transplant using a non-beating heart. Consultant surgeon Stephen Large, who led the Papworth transplant team, said: ‘The use of this group of donor hearts could increase heart transplantation by up to 25 per cent in the UK alone.’ There have been 171 heart transplant in the past 12 months in the UK. But demand exceeds supply, and some patients have to wait up to three years for a suitable organ, with many dying on the waiting list. Non-beating-heart donors provide kidneys, livers and other organs, but until now it has not been possible to use the heart because of concerns it would suffer damage. Huseyin Ulucan, from London (pictured with wife Meryem), who became the first person in Europe to receive the surgery following a heart attack in 2008, said he is 'feeling stronger every day' following the operation . Mr Large added: ‘This is a very exciting development. By enabling the safe use of this kind of donor hearts, we could significantly increase the total number of heart transplants each year, saving hundreds of lives.’ The first successful transplant carried out using the Organ Care System – also known as ‘heart in a box’ – took place in St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney last year, involving a heart that had stopped beating for 20 minutes. The system allows the donor heart to be connected to a sterile circuit of blood which restores the heartbeat and keeps it warm, limiting the adverse effects associated with previous methods which saw hearts kept on ice. Using the preservative solution and the heart in a box, the organ is able to be reanimated, preserved and assessed until it is ready to go into a recipient. It is not clear how long after it stopped beating that the doctors at Papworth restarted the heart. They used ultrasound to assess the function of the restarted heart for 50 minutes before approving it for transplantation. They then removed it from the donor, placed it in the heart-in-a-box machine which perfused the organ with blood and nutrients, and kept it beating for three hours until the operation went ahead. The Organ Care System (OCS), developed by TransMedics, allows donor hearts to continue functioning in a near-perfect state outside the body during transport and until it is placed into the body of the recipient . ‘This is a phenomenal achievement,’ said Simon Messer, cardiothoracic transplant registrar at the hospital. ‘People who previously would not get a heart transplant will now be able to have them.’ More than 250 patients in Britain are on the waiting list for heart transplants, and around 900,000 people in the UK are living with heart failure, according to the British Heart Foundation. Mr Messer added: ‘Currently patients can wait over three years for a heart transplant. But less than half of the people on the waiting list will be transplanted. ‘About 13 per cent die while they are waiting, and around 30 per cent are removed from the list, because they become too unwell to have the operation.’","Surgeons successfully carried out UK's first non-beating heart transplant .

"A Sydney hospital employee who alleged a colleague sexually harassed her with repeated references to his 'anaconda' has had her claim dismissed. But the claim has shone a light on a culture of vexatious complaints and counter-complaints among health staff. Melanie Nacu, a sterilising technician at St Vincent's Private Hospital, told the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal that another technician approached her at work in February 2013 and told her: 'My anaconda, it's really big and alive'. A sterilising at St Vincent's Private Hospital claimed another technician approached her and repeatedly sexually harassed her . Ms Nacu told the tribunal she initially believed her colleague, Isagani Alano, was talking about a pet snake. She alleged that Mr Alano then pointed to his penis and said: 'This one'. On another occasion he discussed his penis with her and offered to show it to her. She also said Mr Alano frequently slapped her on the back despite her requests that he stop. In a decision handed down on Tuesday, the tribunal rejected Ms Nacu's version of events, noting that if the harassment had occurred it would likely have come to the attention of her supervisors. 'The charge of repeated sexual harassment in the workplace is a very serious allegation which must be decided in that light,' the tribunal stated. 'In the face of the respondent's denials and the absence of any evidence ... we are not satisfied that the applicant has proved her allegations on the balance of probabilities.' The man allegedly pointed to his penis and said: 'my anaconda, it's really big and alive' One witness - Vincent Cox, who was a nursing manager of Sterilising Services at the time of the alleged harassment - testified to a 'culture of vexatious complaints' within the department. '(Mr Cox) pointed out that they were not all made by the applicant,' the tribunal's judgment read. Other staff members made complaints which were dismissed. He could not recall whether he became concerned at the level of complaints. Under questioning, Ms Nacu agreed that other staff members had successfully made complaints about her, including about her swearing at colleagues, and that her counter-complaints had been dismissed on several occasions.","Melanie Nacu told the Court Isagani Alano harassed her in February 2013 .

"Once a wanton wiener dog, Dennis the miniature dachshund went on a diet and is now a happy shadow of his former self after losing more than 75 per cent of his body weight. Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at a whopping 56 pounds — about the size of four or five miniature dachshunds. A series of 'before' photos show Dennis resting on rolls of fat, his head seemingly too little for his blob of a body. He couldn't take more than a few steps without being out of breath. Scroll down for video . In this June 2013 photo, Dennis, a dachshund, rests on the ground in Columbus, Ohio. Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at 56 pounds and could walk only a few feet without stopping, out of breath. But then Burton rescued him from his previous owner and provided him with a proper diet, exercise and affection . pictured on February 25, Dennis now only weighs 12 pounds and can freely play in the snow. He has had three skin-removal surgeries to remove the folds of excess skin . Then Brooke Burton adopted him from a relative who had fed him White Castle burgers, pizza and other human food, and didn't pay much attention to the dog's burgeoning belly. Burton, a 26-year-old nursing student, recalls how emotional she became when she first saw Dennis in June 2013, and then persuaded her relative to give him up. 'Out comes Dennis, and I couldn't believe it,' Burton says. 'I wasn't even sure what breed of dog he was supposed to be because he was so large.' Burton put him on diet of dry dog food, plus lots of walks and affection. Now the 6-year-old wiener dog is a svelte 12 pounds and happily chasing squirrels in the backyard, playing fetch and bossing around the other three rescue dogs that live with him. 'In the beginning, you could tell he was very depressed, that he really didn't feel good at all,' Burton says. 'He didn't have much of a personality. After he lost weight, this bossy little demanding man popped out. He's into everything, he wants to play with everybody.' Dennis lost so much weight that he started tripping over the folds of excess skin that were left over and getting infections. He has had three surgeries at the Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center to get rid of it. The operations cost more than  $2,800 together and were covered by a GoFundMe page set up by Burton, donations from individuals and the OSU Veterinary Medical Center, according to  the Columbus Dispatch. Dr. Kathleen Ham, the veterinary surgeon who performed the operations, says Dennis' story is a good lesson for pet owners who might feed their animals too much. 'We have an expression: Food is not love,' Ham says. 'Most of what your pet wants from you is affection and attention.'","Dennis the miniature dachshund lost  75 percent of his body weight .

"A 12-year-old girl allegedly tried to kill her own mother by poisoning a smoothie with bleach after she had her iPhone taken away. The girl, who has not been named but lives in Boulder, Colorado, allegedly blended the smoothie earlier this month, spiked it with the caustic liquid, then fed it to her unwitting mother, who drank it. Her throat was burned by the bleach, and she had to be treated in hospital - but wrote the incident off as a mistake until her daughter tried again, according to police. Plot: The pre-teen allegedly blended up a smoothie (file photo right) spiked with bleach in the hope of killing her mother after she took away her iPhone (file photo left) The Boulder County sheriff's department said that on her second attempt the woman poured bleach into a water carafe by her mother's bed. When she smelled bleach again she reportedly confronted the girl - who admitted the attempts on her life were vengeance for having her smartphone taken away. She was later arrested. According to ABC News, she was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder on Friday. A police spokesman said: 'On March 6, 2015, deputies of the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched to Boulder Community Hospital to investigate an assault. 'Subsequent investigation has developed evidence that a 12-year-old Boulder County girl attempted to kill her mother on two separate occasions. 'On both attempts the girl used bleach. The first attempt on March 2, 2015 left her mother feeling ill after her daughter placed bleach into a breakfast smoothie she made. 'Mom noticed an odor of bleach in the drink and thought her daughter had cleaned the glass prior to making the beverage and did not rinse all the bleach out. 'Later in the week the girl poured bleach into a water carafe her mother kept in the bedroom. On the second occasion Mom noticed the odor of bleach in her water and confronted her daughter. 'This is when she learned her daughter had developed the plan to kill her for taking away her iPhone.

"Holiday death: Andrew Smyth, 32, from Surrey, is feared to have been a ‘honeytrap’ victim in Turkey . A British holidaymaker was killed and his bank account plundered after being lured by a woman he met on holiday in Turkey in a 'honeytrap', his parents insisted today. The body of Andrew Smyth, 32, was found dumped in undergrowth four miles away from a nightclub where he had been, and his bank account cleared out through a cash machine. But a coroner in Surrey recorded an open verdict - saying that he understood how the family concluded foul play, but could take the case no further after a four-year investigation. However, Mr Smyth’s family believe his drink was spiked at the nightclub, before he was followed, robbed and murdered. His fully-clothed body was found face down in woodland. He had traces of heroin in his body - possibly from the spiked drink, toxicology tests showed. An inquest at Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking was told that the athletic electrician had flown to Antalya a week earlier for a fortnight’s break at his father and stepmother’s holiday home. His friend flew home after a week but Mr Smyth stayed, going out drinking on a Friday night with a woman he had met at the resort. However, at 3am the following morning, CCTV footage showed him leaving the club - shortly before a series of withdrawals were made from a cash machine, emptying his bank account. Hours later his body was spotted in a forest with no cash in his pockets other than small change. A post-mortem examination found a heroin metabolite, 6-MAM, in Mr Smyth’s body - indicating that the Class A drug had been consumed before his death, in September 2010. Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl, who carried out an autopsy at the Royal Surrey Hospital in Guildford once Mr Smyth’s body had been repatriated, could find no evidence of a fight or any injuries. The original post-mortem examination was not carried out for five days. 'What we expected': Mr Smyth pictured with his mother, Celia Armstrong, who said she was 'disappointed' after a coroner returned an open verdict at an inquest into his death . He said the presence of 6-MAM showed that heroin specifically had been present, rather than any other opiates, and he had found water on the lungs - which was consistent with heroin toxicity. Toxicology tests showed he was below the drink-driving limit, with just 55mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, 35mg off the 80mg UK maximum. However the pathologist added that although the signs pointed towards opiate toxicity, given the state of decomposition, he felt unable to establish a cause of death. Dr Fegan-Earl added: ‘An unusual fact is the location of Andrew’s body, which seems to be at odds with what he was doing, enjoying himself in a club.’ Mr Smyth grew up in Surrey and trained to be an electrician, before relocating to Swindon in Wiltshire, where he took on a new job and dated a number of women. He had flown to Turkey in September 2010 for two weeks with a woman he had met on dating website Plenty of Fish. Amanda Miles told the hearing that the pair had only met a few months earlier, kissed once and decided afterwards that they were better off as friends. They pair stayed at an apartment in Side owned by his father and his partner, then Lynne Cannon. Electrician: Mr Smyth had flown out for a fortnight’s break at his father and stepmother’s holiday home . Mr Smyth’s father told the inquest that he had received regular phone calls and texts from his son while he was away, which was unusual - but he had been having trouble with Miss Miles. She conceded they had had a volatile friendship, and that they had argued over ‘silly’ things because Mr Smyth was often in a bad mood - which led to a row in the holiday resort one night. During the first week of the holiday, they decided Miss Miles would leave early and, after changing flights, she left Turkey on the Friday. That night Mr Smyth went out drinking at a bar called the Light House, but never came home. His decomposing body was later found dumped in a remote area of woodland by passer-by Adam Yesilova, who was collecting beer cans. Barman Soner Korkmaz told the hearing that Mr Smyth had gone to the club with a woman and the pair had dinner and drinks together. His companion, Emilya Agayeva, insisted he had vanished, forcing her to pawn her earrings for a taxi fare home after running out of money. Night out: Mr Smyth went out drinking at a bar called the Light House (file picture) in the city of Side in Antalya province, Turkey, but never returned home . However, the barman claimed Mr Smyth had come and gone to get more cash to buy drinks, during which time two men joined the woman. After Mr Smyth had left the club in the city of Side once more, the woman stayed drinking, dancing and kissing one of the men. His family believed she could have been acting as a honeytrap and pointed to CCTV footage showing him leaving the club at 3am. In the footage, as he exits, a man taps another male on the shoulder and motions for him to follow Mr Smyth, after which £150 was drained from his bank account in several withdrawals. Mr Smyth’s body was found the following morning dumped in woodland four miles away. An only child, he was born in Torbay, Devon, before his family moved to Camberley, Surrey. His parents separated when he was a teenager but he had a good relationship with both of them, living with both his mother and his father at different points in time. The hearing was told how before his death Mr Smyth had a new job which he loved - and had planned to emigrate to Australia where his company also had an office. His father Christopher Smyth said: ‘He was really happy. He loved the job, he liked going to work. The week before he went on holiday he moved to a new place which he loved.’ Aerial view: Mr Smyth and his friend stayed at an apartment in Side (pictured from above) owned by his father and his partner . At points during the previous years he had struggled with a cocaine habit, the court heard. Tests on Mr Smyth’s hair suggested ‘occasional use of cocaine’ in the months leading up to his death - but no other drug use other than ‘exposure’ to heroin, thought to be from when he lived with people who smoked the drug. His family have travelled to Turkey on dozens of occasions to try to uncover the truth about what happened to Mr Smyth and to bring anyone responsible for his death to justice. But his father, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after the death, is now too ill to fly there himself - confined to a wheelchair and having to carry oxygen with him. Recording an open verdict, coroner Richard Travers said Mr Smyth had travelled to Turkey for a holiday after a rough patch in his life, which included a financial crisis. He said: ‘By the summer of 2010 things were picking up for him and it was in these circumstances he decided to go on holiday to Turkey. He went to Turkey in the company of a woman called Amanda Miles and initially they had got on very well.’ After a breakdown in the friendship, Miss Miles left Mr Smyth at the resort  on September 10. Mr Travers continued: ‘She left and did not see or communicate with him again. The evidence of what happened next is somewhat sparse. The cause of death was unascertained. ‘I fully understand that Andrew’s parents believe that there has been foul play. It is not for me to speculate what may have happened to Andrew. ‘It is simply not possible to know what happened to Andrew in the hours before his death. I regret that I am unable to assist the family in any further ways. I record an open conclusion.’ Speaking after the inquest, Mr Smyth’s mother Celia Armstrong said: ‘It’s not the verdict we wanted, but it’s what we expected.’ Her ex-husband Christopher Smyth, of Mytchett, Surrey, remained convinced people in Turkey were withholding information. He said: ‘It’s undoubtedly a cover up. We had to work quite hard to get anything from the Turkish authorities. 'I understand the coroner’s point of view, but without a doubt my son was assaulted. I firmly believe my son was murdered. He was beaten to death. He had everything to look forward to in life. I won’t ever give up (seeking the truth).’","Body of Andrew Smyth, 32, was found dumped in woodland in Antalya .

"It is a problem familiar to anyone whose family day out at a safari park has ended in disaster. Just as you’re enjoying the view, a cheeky monkey yanks off your windscreen wipers or decides to have a swing on your aerial. Now, a British safari park has become the first to offer visitors protection for their cars – by covering them in bubble wrap. Scroll down for video . Frustration: Monkeys look but they can’t touch the tempting yellow vehicle – to the amusement of its passenger . The incredibly simple yet effective scheme is being pioneered from today at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire, where the unwanted attention of some of its more mischievous exhibits has been a headache for decades. For £10, drivers can have their cars completely covered in layers of bubble wrap before driving into the enclosures, leaving even the most inquisitive monkey unable to cause any damage. The wrapping also helps to prevent dents and scratches to the bodywork, although it is not yet guaranteed to be totally rhino-proof. Nevertheless, it is estimated that it will save visitors thousands in repairs each year. Longleat Safari Park  has become the first to offer visitors protection for their cars against animal damage . No monkey business: For £10, drivers can have their cars completely covered in layers of bubble wrap before driving into the enclosures . Trained staff will apply the plastic wrap to cars, vans and minibuses before they enter the monkey drive-through, then remove and recycle it when they leave. Longleat customer service assistant Paolo Flirs said: ‘Some drivers are put off by the prospect of having their car covered in highly curious and occasionally slightly destructive simians. ‘The bubble wrap will give them extra security and the confidence to brave the drive-through safe in the knowledge their prized vehicle will remain untouched.’ Safari parks across the world are said to be keeping a close eye on the project and could roll out similar schemes – as long as the bubble doesn’t burst.","Longleat Safari Park to offer bubble wrap covers for cars .

"David Cameron kicked off the Tory Election campaign yesterday with an intensely personal attack on Ed Miliband and his ‘hopeless, sneering socialists’. The Prime Minister made a direct assault on the Labour leader’s background, calling it the ‘same old condescending, bossy, interfering, we-know-best attitude of the Hampstead socialist down the ages’. Mr Cameron’s withering reference to the North London borough associated with ‘champagne socialists’ comes after Mr Miliband was ridiculed last year for claiming in his party conference speech to have met ordinary voters on Hampstead Heath, a short walk from his £2.6million home. Scroll down for video . Attack: Mr Cameron said it was ‘same old condescending, bossy, interfering, we-know-best attitude of the Hampstead socialist down the ages’ With just 40 days until the tightest Election for a generation, Mr Cameron used his first address of the campaign to unveil the party’s slogan – ‘We are with you’. He told supporters at his party’s spring forum in Manchester that the Conservatives were ‘the real party of aspiration, of working people – the party that is with you, not against you is not that bunch of hypocritical, holier-than-thou, hopeless, sneering socialists’. He defended his approach, declaring: ‘Some might say, “Don’t make this personal,” but when it comes to who’s Prime Minister, the personal is national.’ Withering: Prime Minister claimed 'I know what this role needs – and I don’t think Ed Miliband has it' He added: ‘I know what this role needs – and frankly, I don’t think Ed Miliband has it’, warning voters Mr Miliband would ‘be the one taking the make-or-break calls in the middle of the night’. Speaking at the ITV studios where Coronation Street was filmed, Mr Cameron also compared Mr Miliband unfavourably to his predecessors, saying Labour was ‘not the party of Clement Attlee, who built the NHS... not the party of Wilson and his ‘white heat of technology’... not even the party of John Smith, who believed so passionately in the dignity of work.’ Instead, he said, they ‘were the party whose new Jerusalem is a load of dead-end lives and poverty handed down through the generations’. Chancellor George Osborne also mocked Mr Miliband, who, when asked last week by Jeremy Paxman whether he was tough enough to be PM, replied, ‘Hell, yes.’ Osborne painted a picture of life under a Labour Government, describing it as: ‘Hell – yes, indeed.’ Mr Cameron also used the speech to promise that a future Tory Government would turn the NHS into a true seven-day service, with more hospitals providing top-level treatment at the weekend.","Mr Cameron began campaign with assault on Mr Miliband's background .

"A trusted church treasurer stole £90,000 to fund her online gambling habit, then pretended to be ill to escape justice. Nicola Holding was described as a 'pillar of the community' for her role at St Boniface's church and pre-school in Plymouth, Devon. But she was secretly siphoning off money from church funds and spending it on herself, Plymouth Crown Court heard. Holding, 50, pleaded guilty to fraud two years ago, but repeatedly failed to turn up to be sentenced, blaming a variety of serious illnesses. Jailed: Nicola Holding has been sentenced to prison for stealing from the church where she was treasurer . Yesterday she was finally sentenced to two and a half years in prison after arriving at court in a wheelchair wrapped in blankets. She whimpered during the hearing with her head slumped to the side, and at one point was given a sugary drink to help her diabetes. Kelly Scrivener, prosecuting, said that Holding had stolen £90,000 between 2008 and 2011, forging documents to cover up the fraud, and had repaid just £24,000. She said £7,700 was paid out to Gala Coral online gambling and £6,700 to Ikea, while Holding had also claimed expenses for her voluntary role helping out at the pre-school. In June 2011, Holding went to Reverend Alison Shaw 'in hysterics' saying she had 'got things in a muddle', the court heard. Judge Paul Darlow said:” 'You plundered their accounts for your own benefit including gambling on internet sites.”' Victims: The congregation at St Boniface's church in Plymouth were betrayed by the fraud, a court heard . He also said that Holding, a divorced mother of two, had falsely claimed to be housebound when she was caught on camera outside her home. Jo Martin, defending, said: “'Since the allegations her fall from grace has been huge and her life has even more spiralled out of control. Undoubtedly she has a number of medical issues.” ' She said Holding would find prison life '‘extraordinarily difficult'’ because of her ailments. Ms Shaw, who took in Holding when her marriage broke down, read a statement to the court about the impact of the defendant's crimes. 'It was a huge sense of betrayal which has had a massive impact on the church and the church community,' the vicar said. 'She was central to everything in the church. Young people put her on a pedestal and she preached to the adults. “'She was a very moral person who told them how to behave. Nicola was trusted implicitly.”' Holding was wheeled out of court to begin her sentence at a prison which can cater for her medical condition.","Nicola Holding was a 'pillar of the community' for role at Plymouth church .

"Illegal immigrants would be put on a plane before they get the chance to appeal under Conservative plans to rip up deportation laws. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to implement a new regime of 'deport first, appeal later'. The rules, to be brought in if the Tories are re-elected, would apply to anyone with an expired visa or those living in Britain without permission. The only exceptions would be asylum-seekers or migrants who could suffer 'irreversible' harm if sent back to a dangerous country. The move seeks to end the racket of thousands of illegal immigrants being able to prolong their stay in Britain for months or even years by lodging a string of appeals and judicial reviews. The only exemptions to the new rules would be asylum seekers or migrants who could suffer 'irreversible harm' if sent back to their home country. File image used . Officials also hope the crackdown – central to Tory manifesto plans to slash net migration – will save the taxpayer money. Migrants will still be able to appeal – but must do so from their country of origin. It is thought that fewer people will then attempt to play the system, sparing the UK taxpayer the cost of holding them in an immigration centre or paying for housing. The Conservative manifesto is yet to be completed and has undergone a series of re-writes in recent weeks. But senior Government sources say it will once again contain a target to slash net migration – with renewed focus on removing more people from the country as a way of achieving it. Mrs May is pressing for a firm restatement of the Prime Minister's 'tens of thousands' target – despite the fact it was missed spectacularly. David Cameron remains committed to slashing net migration – the number of people arriving in the country against those leaving – which currently stands at 298,000. By increasing the number of illegal immigrants who are removed from the country, it makes it easier to hit the target. Until now, the focus has been primarily on reducing the numbers coming in. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to implement a new regime of 'deport first, appeal later' should the Tories gain re-election . Mrs May, hinting at the plans earlier this month, said: 'I think we will keep the target. It is important because it is about not just dealing with those coming into the system, but also about making sure that those people who shouldn't live here actually leave.' Tory insiders are satisfied the so–called 'non-suspensive appeals' policy is legally water-tight and will not be derailed by Labour's Human Rights Act. On a smaller scale, Mrs May has for the past year been deporting foreign criminals under an identical 'deport first, appeal later' regime. So far the move has seen 600 offenders sent home before their appeals were exhausted. Deportees and their lawyers lodged a series of judicial reviews against the scheme in the hope it would be ruled unlawful. But in a string of test cases, judges found there was no barrier to making foreign offenders lodge their claims from their home countries. Those kicked out so far include a Nigerian woman who claimed to have a human right to a family life in the UK – despite being convicted of repeatedly beating her own child. Under the old system she could have delayed her case for years by lodging a string of appeals in the British courts. With an estimated one million illegal immigrants living in the UK, the Home Office has a large group to target. But campaign groups have raised concerns that the department lacks the resources to track them all down. MigrationWatch said the £1.8billion Britain spends securing borders and removing illegal immigrants and foreign criminals was 'clearly inadequate' – and six times less than the estimated £12billion overseas aid budget. While the number of migrants arriving in the UK has increased sharply in recent years, the number being removed has stayed flat at around 100,000 every year. The Mail understands Mr Cameron is considering including two different targets in the final manifesto. In addition to the 'tens of thousands' target, he could also opt for a specific pledge to slash net migration from outside the EU – which, unlike EU migration, ministers can fully control. Earlier this week, research based on an analysis of the British Social Attitudes Survey found voters in every different ethnic group in Britain want immigration reduced. Some 60 per cent of Asian respondents wish to see immigration reduced – 38 per cent by a lot.","Theresa May wants to implement new 'deport first, appeal later' regime .

"Dangerous man-eater on the loose in Downing Street! On closer inspection it turned out to be ITV presenter Susanna Reid interviewing (or rather devouring) the Prime Minister for breakfast. Flap flap. The Reid eyelashes beat like the wings of a butterfly trapped at a window pane. She pouted until her lips must have ached worse than Louis Armstrong’s after a night on the toots. Then she bit her pen – grrrrr! Shades of Liz Hurley in one of her leotarded jungle-vamp roles. My goodness political interviewing has come a distance since Sir Robin Day and his bowtie. Yesterday morning’s broadcast was, unintentionally, comedy of a high order. It confirms Miss Reid as heir to the late Kenny Everett. Scroll down for video . Man about the house: Mr Cameron rustles up a quick lunch of sardines and mayonnaise on toast in the modern kitchen of his Downing Street flat. The American-style steel fridge is covered with family photos and magnetic letters while the shelves house a mug collection and gleaming saucepans . He had a character called Cupid Stunt, a glammed-up TV dolly who would lift her whole derriere off the chair when she crossed her thighs. Cupid used to scream that it was all being done ‘in the best PAHSSIBLE taste’. Oh, Susanna, we’ll make a Windmill girl out of you yet. In that Scarlett and Rhett publicity still of you and the PM, you owned him, baby. And later your puppy eyes would not have disgraced an Andrex advert. Mr Cameron, we will deduce, is on a personal publicity push. So are the other party leaders. Only the quickest-fingered channel-surfers can these days avoid some fresh outrage against taste by senior politicians. Tidying up: The PM at his fridge with some wine on show. There's another bottle on the bench. The larder stores olive oils, condiments and - surprisingly - what seems to be salad . A PM's work is never done: Tackling his paperwork among the children's toothbrushes, a tube of toothpaste and a packet of Weetabix . The Milibands, Mrs and clunky Mr, popped up on the BBC bulletins the other night with their kiddywinks in a saccharine parkland scene. Nigel Farage was giving it full bluster on yesterday’s Daily Politics and had posed for another of his man-with-beer portraits in that pub-bore coat. Scots Nationalist Nicola Sturgeon was on breakfast telly on Monday, giving the nation a fright with its Frosties. Meanwhile, Cleggy and the castanet clacker (Senora Miriam) posed for cheesy shots at their spring conference the other day. Mr Cameron, in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry Susanna, yesterday had a soft double-page in London’s Evening Standard and an astonishing effort in The Sun. He had given personal access to that red-top for an entire day, starting with Jamie Oliver-style footage of him in his kitchen at dawn. What is it with politicians and their kitchens at present? Appearances: Mr Cameron, in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry Susanna Reid, yesterday had a soft double-page in London’s Evening Standard . Politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers . Mr Cameron’s in Downing Street, by the way, has a fridge as large as Imelda Marcos’s shoe closet. He also let The Sun attach a camera to his body so we could see what it looked like to walk into No 10 as PM. For Heaven’s sake, you lot, you’re contesting a general election, not some Butlin’s Bognor Regis beauty pageant. Thanks to The Sun’s intimate web-video we saw a shirtsleeved Prime Minister licking his Hellman’s mayonnaise spoon and concocting a lunch of sardines on toast for the paper’s political editor, who, when asked, declined to say they were delicious. When the Hellman’s went back in the enormous fridge we copped sight of a fair few bottles of vino. Hic! We heard our head of government go through his diary to convey what terribly busy days he has (is this news?) And we saw him giving Michael Gove a telling-off for being late to a pre-Cabinet meeting. One actually quite interesting disclosure was that the Prime Minister calls Cabinet to order by ting-a-linging a little bell, the sort of thing found on the reception desks of small seaside hotels. Puppy eyes: A flirtatious Susanna Reid interviews David Cameron in Number 10 for Daybreak yesterday . Yes Prime Minister! Susanna pulls a mischievous smile (left) and chews her pen (right) during the interview . He yacked away happily with Miss Reid about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see Shaun the Sheep The Movie with his little daughter Florence . Endless, soft-focus shots caught the PM bidding hello to office underlings and doorkeepers, quite the breezy brigadier telling the little chaps what a splendid job they were doing. The camera lingered lovingly on the Camerons’ cat and on photographs on the walls of No 10. This would have been for something like Through the Keyhole but it did not exactly elucidate the Conservative Party’s policies. How does such a soft-soap sell connect with the blue-collar vote the Tories must retrieve if we are to be spared a Miliband-Sturgeon government? The film ended with the PM retiring at bedtime. We did not – phew – see him leaping into his pyjamas. Boris Johnson will have to wait until 2016 for a Cabinet post if the Tories win the general election, David Cameron signalled yesterday. The London mayor, who is the Prime Minister’s chief leadership rival, is bidding to return to the Commons and has been tipped for various posts, including party chairman or head of a new infrastructure department. But Mr Cameron suggested that any appointment would have to wait until Mr Johnson steps down as mayor next year. ‘Boris can do anything, he defies all laws of political logic and gravity,’ he said. ‘But I think he needs to focus on being mayor, strongly. Being MP and the mayor is quite a lot.’ The PM also spoke of how he and George Osborne differed, describing himself as a more traditional Tory and the Chancellor as a ‘metropolitan, market Conservative’. He added: ‘We have both had our ups and downs. Whenever I am down he will offer the hand up and when he is down I will offer the hand.’ Asked who he would back to succeed him, Mr Cameron declined to name an individual – but identified five potential candidates: Mr Johnson and Mr Osborne as well as Theresa May, Michael Gove and Philip Hammond. He stopped the camera at the door to his family quarters, saying it could go no further. But it may have been a damn close call. Perhaps such things as economic-industrial strategies and education proposals and political philosophies are no longer considered important by the image-benders and political spin doctors. Perhaps this really is the way to win votes in 2015. But I have my doubts. Politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers. The only one to have kept below the radar is the Greens’ woman, Aussie Natalie, but that is probably only because her nerve is shot after her recent mid-interview ‘dry’ on radio. Back on ITV yesterday morning, Miss Reid was unstoppable. Shameless. Incorrigible! She kept touching her blushing cheeks, drew her mouth into sucky pools of winsome doubt, stroked one of her ears, tilted her black-maned head in a come-hither gesture. Even the thickest Royal Navy flag office would have been able to translate those signals. There were times, it must be admitted, when Mr Cameron gave her what we might call an old-fashioned glance, plainly wondering what on earth she had put in her tea. The thought ‘who IS this madwoman?’ flittered across his gaze. But hey, there is a General Election in the offing. Prime Ministerial dignity was hauled overboard. Soon he was yacking away happily with Miss Reid about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see Shaun the Sheep The Movie with his little daughter Florence. ‘We try to be a reasonable dad,’ he said. We? As in ‘we are a grandmother’ (copyright M. Thatcher 1989)? Susanna cooed. Her laughter tinkled like the Trevi fountain. One of her eyeballs swelled. Samantha Cameron, sweetheart, LOOK OUT!","David Cameron agreed to have a camera attached to his body for a video .

"Wearing a lime green cap and carrying a black backpack, a teenager has been caught attempting to flee Australia to join jihadi militants in the Middle East. A 17-year-old boy was taken off a plane at Sydney airport on March 12 and interviewed by counter-terrorism officers, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton revealed on Wednesday. It comes after two teenage brothers were also discovered doing the same thing earlier this month. A third teenager has been caught by authorities trying to join Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East . The incident happened on March 12 and charges have not been laid against the boy . The boy is the third teenager government officials have intercepted among about 200 people stopped from heading overseas to become foreign fighters with terrorist groups. He has since returned to his family, with the Australian Federal Police and ASIO investigating the matter. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said while it was hard to believe people who had grown up in Australia's free and open society could be susceptible to brain washing by extremist groups such as Islamic State, it was clearly happening. 'It is very dangerous for you. It is very dangerous for others,' he told reporters in Canberra. It follows two brothers who were detained for doing the same earlier this month (pictured above) The siblings aged 16 and 17 were questioned by counter-terrorism officers before they were sent home to their mother in Sydney's south-west . There are fears that more teenagers could end up like Abdullah Elmir (pictured) who has been dubbed the 'Ginger Jihadist' Elmir (front centre) has appeared in propaganda videos since he arrived in the Middle East (above) 'We will do everything we can to stop you if you do try.' The two brothers who were stopped earlier this month were aged 16 and 17. The siblings were south-west Sydney and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained. Authorities’ suspicions were aroused after the two had booked flights to an unidentified country in the Middle East and their luggage was searched. The latest teenager to be caught were trying to fly to the Middle East like notorious extremists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar . Mohamed Elomar (above) has caused a stir on social media after posting photos of him with weapons and severed heads . Meanwhile Khaled Sharrouf made international headlines after he posted photos of his children posing with guns . The above photograph is Sharrouf posing with his children in front of an Islamic State flag and rifles . The two boys were stopped on the night of March 6, Mr Dutton said at the time of the revelation. Their parents were unaware of their plans to travel to the Middle East. The brothers were later issued court attendance notices. Under the new Foreign Fighters Act, customs officers are allowed to detain people where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is intending to commit a Commonwealth offence or is a threat to national security or the security of a foreign country. Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State. Elmir, a former Condell Park High student, was filmed on the banks of the River Tigris in Iraq last October. While Elomar and Sharrouf have appeared regularly in Islamic State videos. One of which included a beheading of a prisoner.","Third teenager has been caught trying to flee Australia to join Islamic State .

"President Barack Obama said Monday that American politicians in an era of partisanship should try to carry themselves more like Edward M. Kennedy. As politicians from both political parties lauded the late Massachusetts senator's collegial spirit at the dedication of an institute that bears his name, Obama said it was appropriate for Kennedy to want 'a monument not to himself but to what we the people have the power to do together.' The $79 million institute, built next to the John F. Kennedy presidential library on Boston's Columbia Point, was envisioned by Kennedy before he was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2008. He died the following year. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, right, embraces Victoria Reggie Kennedy, widow of former U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy as she introduces Obama at the dedication ceremony for the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, in Boston, Massachusetts . 'What if we carried ourselves more like Ted Kennedy?' Obama asked during his speech. Obama praised Kennedy for looking for 'common ground' with his Republican colleagues . Obama shakes hands with former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, as Connecticut State Sen. Ted Kennedy Jr., watches during the opening of the $79 million institute that is located next door to the presidential library of Kennedy's brother, the late John F. Kennedy.

Biden also spoke at the event, remarking that Kennedy 'treated me like a little brother' The president said today that he he hoped the institute could help restore confidence in government at a time of great cynicism, giving a young student a chance to debate in its full-scale replica of the Senate chamber. 'What if we carried ourselves more like Ted Kennedy?' Obama asked. 'What if our politics, our democracy, were as elevated as he envisions it to be?' Obama said. Instead, the president said citizens are cynical about government and disgusted by politicians' trivial pursuits and grandstanding for 'cameras instead of colleagues.'

Former U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy, the son of Ted Kennedy, sits next to former presidential hopeful John McCain during the dedication ceremony . 'Fear so permeates our politics instead of hope. People fight to get in the Senate only to get afraid,' the president told some 1,800 Kennedy friends, family and politicians from both parties gathered for the dedication. He said Kennedy was never afraid to compromise with Republicans, even if it would anger his supporters. Speaker after speaker spoke of Kennedy's outsized influence on the Senate, where he served for 47 years, and held his consensus-building up in contrast to the gridlock that has become the hallmark of the modern Congress. 'No one made the Senate come alive like Ted Kennedy,' Obama said. 'It was one of the great pleasures of my life to hear Ted Kennedy deliver one of his stem winders on the Floor.' Then an Illinois senator, Obama served in the upper chamber with Kennedy for roughly three and a half years before vacating office in preparation for his move to the White House. Kennedy backed Obama for the Oval Office in 2008 over fellow senator Hillary Clinton of New York, comparing him in a speech to his brother John F. Kennedy, another young politician who ignored suggestions within the political class that he wait his turn in line and was successfully elected president. The influential senator died the following year in August of 2009 several months after Obama took office. Known as the 'Lion of the Senate,' Kennedy held his position as statesman in the U.S. Senate for nearly 50 years.

Patrick Kennedy, Amy Kennedy and her daughter Harper Petitgout are seen inside the debating hall at the new centre, which is a full-scale replica of the U.S. senate . Obama praised Kennedy on Monday for looking for 'common ground' with his Republican colleagues, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was on hand Monday for the event. It was 'common ground, not rooted in abstractions or stubborn, rigid ideologies, but shared experience, that led Ted and John McCain to work on a Patient’s Bill of Rights, and to work to forge a smarter, more just immigration system,' the president said. 'A common desire to fix what’s broken. A willingness to compromise in pursuit of a larger goal. A personal relationship that lets you fight like heck on one issue, and shake hands on the next -- not through just cajoling or horse-trading or serenades, but through Ted’s brand of friendship and kindness, and humor and grace.' McCain remembered Kennedy's 'zest for political argument' and said they would often laugh together after fighting on the Senate floor. He said the Senate hasn't been the same without him. ' That's mostly for reasons unrelated to losing Ted, but I have no doubt the place would be a little more productive and a lot more fun if he were there,' McCain added. Vice President Joe Biden said that Kennedy 'treated me like a little brother' when he arrived at the U.S. senate, and helped him into assignments usually not given to such junior politicians .

The afternoon included a performance by the Boston Pops Orchestra, as conductor Keith Lockhart (left) and Brian Stokes Mitchell (right) got into the swing of things . 'I miss fighting with him to be honest. It's gotten harder to find people who enjoy a good fight as much as Ted did,' he said to laughter. Vice President Joe Biden, who served with Kennedy in the Senate as well, said he 'treated me like a little brother.' When Biden first arrived in 1973, Kennedy helped him land choice committee assignments not generally available to freshmen senators. Biden said Kennedy introduced him around the Senate and was a master at generating trust and mutual respect. 'All politics is personal,' Biden said. 'No one in my life understood that better than Ted Kennedy.' Former Senate GOP Leader Trent Lott noted the irony of his inclusion on the institute's board of directors, along with former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. 'Yes, a Republican from Mississippi,' said Lott, to laughter and applause, 'is proud to be here today.' Lott said although the two disagreed and had 'some fiery discussions,' they came together sometimes in a bipartisan way. Lott recalled after he worked with Kennedy on an immigration bill that lost on a procedural vote in 2007, he told him, 'Ted, every time I work with you I get in trouble man.' Trent Lott (centre, flanked by Tom Daschle, left, and Ted Kennedy Jr, right) gave an amusing speech in which he joked: 'Yes, a Republican from Mississippi, is proud to be here today' Ted Kennedy Jr, sentaor for Connecticut, speaks about his father at the opening of the Ted Kennedy centre .

Kennedy's widow, Victoria Kennedy, said her late husband hoped the institute would honor the nearly 2,000 who have served there and inspire future senators. She said he wanted visitors to feel the awe of walking into the chamber. Guests, including student groups, will be able to role-play as senators and debate some of the major issues of the day. The facility also includes a re-creation of Kennedy's Senate office, virtually unchanged from how it appeared when he died. 'He believed in the majesty of the place and its ability to inspire,' she said. A full-scale replica of the U.S. Senate Chamber is displayed inside the Edward M.

The Kennedys came out in full force on Monday to celebrate the memory of their late family member. Among the event's attendees were Jean Kennedy, the sister of Ted Kennedy, and former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy, Ted's son.

"Indiana Governor Mike Pence pushed back today on claims that his state's new religious freedom law is a 'license to discriminate.' 'I abhor discrimination,' he said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. 'If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore.' The Republican politician said to be considering a presidential campaign stated that he'd veto any bill that 'legalized discrimination against any person or group' - but that's not what Indiana's law does. With the storm that has gathered over his state since he formally approved the law last Thursday showing no signs of dissipating, Pence called off public appearances on Monday. Meanwhile, sports officials planned an 'Indy Welcomes All' campaign ahead of this weekend's NCAA Final Four in Indianapolis as lawmakers scrambled to quiet the national firestorm over the new law that has much of the country portraying Indiana as a state of intolerance. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This is not a 'license to discriminate': Indiana governor Mike Pence, pictured here last Thursday - the day he signed the state's new religious freedom law, said today that he abhors discrimination and would veto a law making it legal . Controversial law: Indiana Senate President Pro Tem David Long, left, and House Speaker Brian Bosma, right, said Monday that they would be willing to clarify the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act to to make it clear that the measure does not allow discrimination against gays and lesbians . Republican legislative leaders said they are working on adding language to the religious-objections law to make it clear that the measure does not allow discrimination against gays and lesbians. The measure prohibits state laws that 'substantially burden' a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. The definition of 'person' includes religious institutions, businesses and associations. 'What we had hoped for with the bill was a message of inclusion, inclusion of all religious beliefs,' Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma said. 'What instead has come out is a message of exclusion, and that was not the intent.' The efforts fell flat with Democrats, who called for a repeal, and even some Republicans. 'They're scrambling to put a good face on a bad issue. What puzzles me is how this effort came to the top of the legislative agenda when clearly the business community doesn't support it,' said Bill Oesterle, an aide to Republican former Governor Mitch Daniels and CEO of consumer reporting agency Angie's List, which canceled expansion plans in Indianapolis because of the law. Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a Republican, said the law threatens to undermine the city's economic growth and reputation as a convention and tourism destination and called for lawmakers to add protections for sexual orientation and gender identity to Indiana civil-rights laws. 'I call upon Governor Pence and the Indiana Legislature to fix this law. Either repeal it or pass a law that protects all who live, work and visit Indiana. And do so immediately. Indianapolis will not be defined by this,' Ballard said. If Angie's List doesn't go through with the planned $40 million investment into new headquarters in Indianapolis, the city stands to lose out on a projected 1,000 new jobs in the next half decade. NOT GOOD ENOUGH: Indiana Senate Democratic Leader Tim Lanane, left,  and Indiana House Democratic Leader Scott Pelath, right, call for the repeal of the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act at a Monday press conference . After a two-hour private meeting of House Republicans, Bosma said Monday that repealing the law isn't a realistic goal at this point."" 'I'm looking for a surgical solution, and I think the least intrusive surgery is to clarify that (the law) cannot be used to support the denial of goods, facilities or services to any member of the public,' he said. Pence, who defended the law during a television appearance Sunday and in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, canceled scheduled appearances Monday night and Tuesday, in part because of planned protests. In the The Wall Street Journal essay, Pence argued that the religious freedom measure 'contains no reference to sexual orientation.' It simply 'mirrors' federal law, he stated. The federally mandated Affordable Care Act, he said, 'renewed concerns about government infringement on deeply held religious beliefs' compelling the Republican-controlled Indiana legislature to introduce enhanced protections for persons of faith. 'Faith and religion are important values to millions of Indiana residents,' he said. 'With the passage of this legislation, Indiana will continue to be a place that respects the beliefs of every person in our state.' Pence and Republican Senate President Pro Tem David Long have stressed that the new law is based on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which has been upheld by courts. But the Human Rights Campaign and other Democrat-aligned groups say it's disingenuous to compare the two laws. Demonstrators  gather outside the City County Building on Monday in Indianapolis, Indiana. A group of more than 2,000 protesters lined up outside the state Capitol on Saturday, as the tide of public opinion turned against the Hoosier State's new religious freedom bill . HRC's legal director, Sarah Warbelow, said the federal law was designed to ensure religious minorities were protected from laws passed by the federal government that might not have been intended to discriminate but had that effect. The Indiana law, she said, allows individuals to invoke government action even when the government is not a party to a lawsuit. It also allows all businesses to assert religious beliefs regardless of whether they are actually religious organizations. Warbelow said one of the best ways to fix the law would be to add language that explicitly says it cannot be used to undermine already existing civil rights protections. Democratic House Minority Leader Scott Pelath said Republican legislators should admit the law is a mistake. 'They're not facing up to reality — this is a national embarrassment,' Pelath said. 'The bush needs to be pulled up by its roots and thrown into the fire.' Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss said the backlash is being fueled by the legalization of gay marriage and last year's Supreme Court ruling in a case that found Hobby Lobby and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of providing the free contraceptive coverage required by the Affordable Care Act. Indiana's lack of a law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is also a contributor, she said. Demonstrators react to the City County Council passing a resolution calling on the state to repeal or revise it's controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . Long and Bosma did not appear eager to add such protection into the measure, noting that it is a big policy decision and that only four weeks remain in this year's legislative session. The fallout continued over the weekend and into Monday. The national public-employee union known as AFSCME announced Monday it was canceling a planned women's conference in Indianapolis this year because of the law. The band Wilco said it was no longer come to the city for a May performance. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe issued a letter to Indiana corporations saying Virginia is a business-friendly state that does 'not discriminate against our friends and neighbors,' while Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel sent letters to more than a dozen Indiana businesses, urging them to relocate to a 'welcoming place to people of all races, faiths and countries of origin.' Two states' Democratic governors , Connecticut's Dan Malloy, and Washington's Jay Inslee, said they were imposing an administration-wide ban on state-funded travel to Indiana. The city of Seattle, Washington, had already instituted such a travel ban as had San Francisco, California. As a similar bill advances in Arkansas, HRC's Warbelow said lawmakers need to take notice. 'We hope that the state legislature is paying attention ... and taking seriously that the whole world is looking at them,' she said.","New measure prohibits state laws that 'substantially burden' a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs .

"Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool in Oregon that suggests humans occupied the western US earlier than thought. The agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash dating back to the eruption of Mount St Helens 15,800 years ago. Scientists believe the primitive knife, discovered 12ft (3.6 metres) below ground, was used for cutting animal hides, butchering meat, and carving wood by pre-Clovis people. Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool in Oregon that suggests humans occupied the western US earlier than thought. The agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash dating back to the eruption of Mount St Helens 15,800 years ago . The find, at Rimrock Draw Rockshelter, was announced today by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. Archaeologist Scott Thomas said that if the age of the area holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest pre-Clovis find west of the Rockies. It would also be older than another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago. Professor Patrick O'Grady from Oregon University called the find 'tantalising.' The find, at Rimrock Draw Rockshelter, was announced today by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. Archaeologist Scott Thomas said that if the age of the area holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies . But he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area. Donald Grayson, professor of archaeology at the University of Washington, said the scientific community would be skeptical. Two pre-Clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists. One is Paisley Cave, located about 60 miles southwest of the Rimrock site. The other is Monte Verde in Chile. Both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest Clovis sites. If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area. Much of discoveries at these sites indicate the people were involved in hunting, gathering and fishing, for which they used bone tools. Some sites suggest that pre-Clovis people sometimes lived in hut clusters. Many were situated along the coastline, suggesting a marine lifestyle. Many archaeologists favour the theory that they came over the Bering Strait crossing from northeastern Asia. 'No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in  that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,' he said. 'Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.' Two pre-Clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists, Grayson said. One is Paisley Cave, located about 60 miles southwest of the Rimrock site. The other is Monte Verde in Chile. Both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest Clovis sites. If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area. The find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences. Thomas found the site several years ago, while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School nearby that O'Grady was overseeing. He said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow, with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it, indicating very deep sediment deposits. Rimrock Draw Rockshelter is located near Riley Oregon in Harney County in southeast Oregon. If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area . The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time. An ancient streambed ran by, which would have given people more reason to stay there. And on the surface, he found a stone point of the stemmed type, found at sites both older and younger than Clovis. Similar points have been found at Paisley Cave . Volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points, and the field school started excavations in 2011, O'Grady said. Uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels. Tests by Archaeological Investigations Northwest of Portland on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals, Thomas said. The most likely bovine animal living in Oregon at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo.","The agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash .

"It will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind for 16 years and won’t happen again for a decade. But those hoping to witness Friday’s solar eclipse could be disappointed – as clouds may block their view. The dramatic partial eclipse begins at 8.30am and will reach its maximum point around an hour later. Scroll down for video . Friday's solar eclipse will be the most spectacular celestial show of its kind 16 years, but the incredible sight could be blocked by clouds (file picture) It will see the country plunged into near-darkness during the morning rush hour and the temperature will drop noticeably. The phenomenon – in which the moon moves in front of the sun – will be most visible in more remote parts of the country, which are said to offer the perfect viewing environment. And the proportion of the sun covered will increase towards the north of the country, ranging from 84 per cent in London to 89 per cent in Manchester and 93 per cent in Edinburgh. Northern Scotland is expected to have the best view, with the Isle of Lewis seeing around 98 per cent of the sun hidden and Shetland around 97 per cent. However, forecasters warn early predictions show there may be cloudier skies in the north of the UK – which could ruin the view for astronomy enthusiasts. Glenn Spencer, forecaster at Meteogroup, said: ‘The South will get the best of the breaks between clouds and it will get cloudier the further north you go. It’s not the greatest situation. The South will see about 60 to 70 per cent cloud cover – which is enough to be able to see the sun. ‘In the north the sky will be almost completely covered by cloud. However, it is still early and the situation could quite easily change by Friday. It’s luck of the draw at the moment.’ Get out your glasses: Special shades like this are a good bet for watching Britain's first great eclipse this century, with the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not set to take place until 2026 . The timeline for the eclipse in Manchester. First sight will come at 8.20am and maximum eclipse at 9.32am . Cloudy skies also meant spectators struggled to see the UK’s last eclipse on August 11, 1999, but the effect was still dramatic as the country was pitched into darkness. The next eclipse of similar magnitude will take place on August 12, 2026, with 95 per cent of the sun obscured. Britain will not see a total solar eclipse until September 23, 2090. Anticipating Friday’s event, Robin Scagell from the Society for Popular Astronomy said: ‘We won’t experience totality [of darkness] in the UK but it will still be memorable. ‘Depending on where you are, up to 90 per cent of the sun will be covered over. ‘You’d think everything would go virtually black, but it doesn’t, it’s about equal to a fair bit of high cloud in front of the sun. But it has this eerie quality, especially on a clear day. You think, hang on, it’s getting darker, but there are no clouds.’ Experts have issued a reminder that people must be aware of possible damage to their vision if they fail to take the necessary precautions while watching the phenomenon. As with normal daylight, people should avoid looking directly at the sun – even if it is partly hidden or they are wearing sunglasses.","Friday's solar eclipse - the first in 16 years - could be ruined by clouds .

Emma Pardo Vidal, her 12-year-old daughter Emma Solera Pardo, and her mother Emma Vidal Bardan were among 50 Spanish passengers on board flight 9525 to Dusseldorf. They were due to take a connecting flight from the German city to Manchester where another family member was studying English. Tragic: Emma Pardo Vidal (pictured), her 12-year-old daughter Emma Solera Pardo, and her mother Emma Vidal Bardan were among 50 Spanish passengers on board flight 9525 to Dusseldorf . A child, her mother and grandmother were killed in the Germanwings crash. Pictured are flowers laid in memory of the many victims of the disaster at Le Vernet, France . Prosecutors say co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit and aimed the aircraft down in an eight-minute descent until it hit the ground . But all of those on board the flight to Germany were killed after prosecutors say co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit and aimed the aircraft down in an eight-minute descent until it hit the ground. Juan Pardo Yanez - the child's grandfather and former husband of the eldest Emma - was virtually speechless after returning from a trip for relatives of the 150 crash victims to the crash zone in Seyne-Les-Alpes, France. Investigators were still working in a ravine collecting small pieces of the plane and body parts ahead of a painstaking identification effort. French investigators are continuing to work amongst the debris of the Airbus A320 at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes . 'There is nothing that can be done or could be said to me to change the loss of these three so dearly loved ones,' Pardo Yanez told journalists outside a Barcelona crisis center set up for victims' relatives. About 400 friends and relatives of the daughter, mother and grandmother gathered for a private Mass at a monastery in Sant Cugat del Valles, choking up as they went inside to commemorate those lost from the family that moved to the community of about 85,000 about a decade ago. The youngest Emma's father, Juan Ignacio Solera, is the founder and chief executive of iVOOX, a company that makes a popular software application for podcast downloads. Emma went to a Catholic school just a five-minute walk away from the family's apartment in a cluster of buildings ringed by high brick walls. Her death hit classmates incredibly hard, said principal Maria Reina Montoro, who could only come up with one word to describe how they felt: 'Destroyed.' While  quiet and timid, the youngest Emma was a dedicated tennis player who regularly practiced at a club, said Manu Navas, director of the club's tennis academy. 'She wasn't a player who stood out, but what I would highlight about her was her attitude. She never took no for an answer,' Navas said of the girl. Pardo Yanez did not say how he would try to help rebuild his life and family now that his ex-wife is gone along with one of his daughters and a granddaughter. But he was sure of one thing: 'I will return with all my children to the site where all of them have died.'","Emma Pardo Vidal was among 50 Spanish passengers killed on the flight .

"An ointment that painlessly melts away fat has been hailed as ‘an eye-lift in a bottle’ by experts. The treatment – known only by its experimental name of XAF5 – has been shown to significantly reduce bags under the eyes. Its makers say it could also be used to dissolve double chins and even be employed on the body, particularly on stomach fat. The praise follows yesterday’s annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology, where US bio-tech company Topokine Therapeutics presented details of a trial of 90 patients, aged between 40 and 70, who applied the cream once a day to their under-eye area for ten weeks. Scroll down for video . The treatment, known only by its experimental name of XAF5, has been shown to significantly reduce bags under the eyes. Stock photo . The trial was double-blind and placebo-controlled, meaning that neither the participants nor the researchers knew which patients belonged to the control group or the test group. Bags were graded on a four-point scale, and in ratings given by independent doctors, just under half of those using XAF5 were found to have improved by one full grade in both eyes, with some seeing a two-grade improvement. Dr Michael Singer, Topokine’s chief scientific officer, said: ‘A one-grade improvement may sound small, but it is a meaningful change. Participants said they felt they looked more youthful, more attractive and more well rested after treatment.’ Eye bags, or steatoblepharon, are fat pads under the eye socket that bulge forwards. Although numerous factors, including lack of sleep and allergies, can lead to fluid accumulation in these tissues, they are typically a permanent part of the facial structure. Their appearance worsens with age as the ligaments holding the pads in place soften. When applied, XAF5 is absorbed through the skin and into fat tissue. It binds to receptors on the surface of fat cells, causing them to expel their oil contents, reducing their size. It also prevents new fat cells from forming. The makers of the cream say it could also be used to dissolve double chins and even be employed on the body, particularly on stomach fat. File photo . The ointment’s active ingredient – a compound known as a prostaglandin – was initially developed as a treatment for glaucoma, or high pressure in the eyeball, given as eye drops. However, while testing the drug, doctors noticed that fat around they eyes began to disappear within weeks – called prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy, or PAP. However, as well as losing their eye bags, some patients also developed deeper or ‘sunken’ eyes. Previously, PAP has been seen as an unwanted side effect of a different prostaglandin used in another prescription-only cosmetic cream Latisse, which causes the eyelashes to grow. In rare cases, the drug also causes irreversible brown pigment to appear in the eye. But Dr Singer said that XAF5 was a different type of prostaglandin, and trials had seen ‘no effects on the eye, including iris hyperpigmentation’. US professor of ophthalmology, Dr Stanley Berke, who has written papers on PAP, said this type of fat loss could make people with loose, puffy, baggy lids and loose skin look better. ‘For some patients who might be candidates for plastic surgery, this could be thought of as a “blepharoplasty [eye lift] in a bottle”,’ he added. However, London-based dermatologist Dr Stefanie Williams said: ‘Surgery is currently the only option to treat eye bags due to fat accumulation.’ Yet while this is effective and permanent, surgeons may inadvertently remove too much fat, which can leave people looking hollow-eyed and permanently surprised. In contrast, when XAF5 is discontinued, the results reverse. XAF5, which would be a prescription-only cream to be applied at home once a day, is now undergoing further testing.","Treatment – known only by its experimental name of XAF5 – has been shown to significantly reduce bags under the eyes .

"A 'nearly pristine' 600 million-year-old sponge has been uncovered in southern China. Scientists believe the sponge – which represents the most primitive animal on Earth - is the oldest ever found. Its discovery pushes back the start of the evolution of multicellular animals to before the Cambrian explosion 541 million years ago. A 'nearly pristine' 600 million-year-old sponge has been uncovered in southern China.Scientists believe the sponge – which represents the most primitive creature on Earth - is the oldest ever found . The Cambrian Explosion, around 541 million years ago, was a wide variety of animals burst onto the evolutionary scene. Before about 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organised into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated  and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago. The latest discovery pushes back the date of multicellular animal evolution to 60 million years before the Cambrian explosion started. Sponges, also known as Porifera, are multicellular organisms that have bodies covered with pores and channels that allow water to circulate through them. Scientists have still to confirm when they first appeared on Earth. Estimates range from 700 million years ago to a time known as the Cambrian period, which took place 541 million to 485 million years ago. The latest finding would place the sponge around 60 million years before the Cambrian started. Researchers want to pin down the date because they believe it is key to understanding early animal evolution. The split between sponges and most other animals was a major event in the early history of life on our planet. The sponge, found in the Doushantuo Formation, is just over one millimetre in height and width, according to researchers from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. To get a good look, scientists used scanning electron microscopy and X-ray technology. The team has named it Eocyathispongia qiania and say that it is made up of hundreds of thousands of cells. Its structure is formed in three tube-like chambers that are fixed to a common base, with cell structures that resemble those in modern sponges. Scientists also found surface cells that indicate pores, like modern sponges, which control water flowing into the organism. The sponge, found in the Doushantuo Formation in southern China (left), suggests the date of multicellular animal evolution was 60 million years before the Cambrian explosion started. Scientists found surface cells that indicate pores, like modern sponges (right), which control water flowing into the organism . There was an area inside one of the tubes with pits surrounded by raised collars - a possible precursor to choanocyte cells which modern sponges use to move water through their bodies. As well as being one of the oldest of the really old sponge fossils found, the find also represents one of the most pristine. The researchers say they have more material from the site where the sponge was found, and will be sifting through it looking for more tiny sponges and perhaps other organisms. Lead author Maoyan Zhu told IBTimes UK that the find suggests that animals on Earth began diversifying 600 million years ago. 'Discovery of additional specimens would confirm that the fossil represents a Precambrian sponge,' he said. 'But features of the fossil are consistent with sponge anatomy… fossils of similarly advanced eumetazoans [all major animal groups except sponges] may yet lie in the fossil record.' The researchers say they have more material from the site where the sponge was found, and will be sifting through it looking for more tiny sponges and perhaps other organisms .","The sponge was found in the Doushantuo Formation in southern China .

"Russians are being warned of the dangers of the spring thaw after a young university graduate was killed by an icicle that fell 14 storeys onto her head. Tatyana Igonina, 20, died just a few steps outside the front door to her home after she had left to take her dog for a walk. Her mother and doctors who had arrived at the scene in Novosibirsk, Siberia, narrowly missed being hit by further blocks of ice as they tended to her body. Scroll down for video . Tatyana Igonina, 20, was killed just a few steps from her front door after a falling icicle hit her in the head . The incident is the latest involving falling icicles to take place across Russia as the rising temperatures begin a thaw, according to The Siberian Times. Public authorities have been tasked with clearing roofs of any overhanging ice, but in some cities they are coming under scrutiny following a spate of injuries and near-misses. Tributes were paid to Ms Igonina, an only child, on Russian social media sites. She had spent the New Year on a sunshine break to Thailand and was said to be 'very happy' with her life. In a post on Vkontakte social media her cousin, Vladimir Makhonin, wrote: 'I will never forget her laughter, her eyes and smile. Farewell beloved sister. I would give everything to hear her voice again.' According to one of Ms Igonina's friends, investigators refused to approach her body until all remaining icicles were removed from the block of flats . In another tribute, a friend also wrote: 'How to live forever now. Our beauty.' Ms Igonina had recently graduated from university and was looking for a job. According to one of her friends investigators refused to approach her body until all remaining icicles were removed from the block of flats. Following a decree from the mayor of Novosibirsk, public service officials had cleared the roof a week before the tragedy but did not notice blocks office that had formed on a canopy belonging to one of the residents. It had been assumed the owner would clear the canopy himself, but he did not. Residents in Russia are used to seeing icicles and snow falling from roofs during winter and particularly in spring when the thaw begins. Icicles (pictured overhanging a balcony in Siberia) have caused dozens of deaths over the past few years after they thaw and then fall onto people passing below . In 2010, five people died and 150 were injured by icicles in St Petersburg amid the coldest winter for three decades. Nine years earlier 74 people in Moscow were the victims of falling ice, including an 18-year-old killed by a falling shard at his military base. The last death in Siberia occurred in January 2008 when an 83-year-old was killed, but there have been a number of serious injuries and near misses involving ice this month. In Novokuznetsk on March 15, a day after Tanya's death, a snow boulder fell on a 17-year-old girl, leaving her with a head wound. The same day, in Ulan-Ude, an icicle hit a 10-year-old boy who was walking with his friend. A day later, Irkutsk an ice block fell on a 40-year-old woman, as she walked into a shoe shop with her 18-month-old and three-year-old granddaughters. She did not lose consciousness but was taken to hospital with a suspected concussion. Friends paying tribute to her today said she was 'very happy' with her life and was looking for a job having just graduated from university .","Tatyana Igonina, 20, died just a few steps outside front door of her home .

"Surgeon Marco Moraci, pictured with his wife, who has been suspended by the General Medical Council . A foreign plastic surgeon who left a pensioner scarred for life has been suspended after it emerged there have been 60 complaints about his work. The General Medical Council has barred Marco Moraci, who is one of a number of 'fly in fly out' surgeons who jet into the UK from Europe to operate in private hospitals and then return home. Moraci, who lives in Naples with his TV star wife, is understood to have quit working in the UK last year after he failed to compensate Pearl Richman for a bungled facelift in 2010. Mrs Richman, 67, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, has been left with scars after suffering from necrosis, a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of skin cells - and was left with open flesh wounds. She was awarded £43,000 in compensation by a court in Birmingham but is unlikely to receive the cash as the surgeon's insurance company say he did not report the bungle to them. The Harley Medical Group, which organised the £8,000 surgery, went into administration but is not legally responsible for the surgeons it uses. Last month, the GMC stepped in after it became clear that there may be other victims of Moraci, after as many as 60 patients are understood to be complaining about their care. He has also been stopped from working as a doctor for 12 months while it is decided if he will face a disciplinary hearing. Moraci has also worked for the Hospital Group, who say that his rights to treat patients at their hospitals had been withdrawn. Now Mrs Richman is calling for the government to take action over 'fly in fly out' foreign doctors who fly into the UK and undertake procedures before returning home. She said: 'He never talked about necrosis at all. It wasn't mentioned. He talked about the normal risks but at no point at all did he mention necrosis. I just remember him saying that he would make me happy. 'When they took the drains out of my face it hurt so much, I screamed and it started to go purple. It went from a large purple bruise to a huge black scab that had the feel and look of leather.

Mrs Richman was awarded £43,000 in compensation after the botched facelift but has yet to receive any of the money . 'Surgeons should not be limited to their country but the government should make sure there is a level of accountability through qualifications and insurances. 'Clinics should also be responsible for the actions of the surgeons they use.' Clinical negligence lawyer Jeanette Whyman, of law firm Wright Hassall, is now pursuing the case. Mrs Richman, pictured with her lawyer Jeanette Whyman, is now calling for 'fly in fly out' surgeons to be regulated . She told the Sunday People: 'Clinics normally ask the surgeon themselves to be insured. If something goes wrong a patient cannot sue the clinic, they have to pursue the surgeon, which is extremely difficult if they are based abroad. 'It is really easy money for surgeons as the procedures are more expensive here and they don’t have to pay for the clinics. 'But if things go wrong very often it falls back on the NHS to put things right, which begs the question why there is not more regulation.' Dr Moraci refused to comment on the allegations against him when contacted at his Naples home.","Plastic surgeon Marco Moraci has been suspended after 60 complaints .

"Emma Easterby, 34, says she no longer takes daughter Alexis to Sure Start centre, Darlington, after she was told to take her buggy outside . Council bosses have come under fire after barring parents from bringing their prams into a mother and baby centre for 'health and safety reasons', telling them to use an outside buggy park instead. The angry parents say staff at the Sure Start centre in Darlington are forcing them to leave expensive prams chained up in freezing weather, and fear they could become a target for thieves. It is thought the buggy park has been in place for around three weeks, despite previous government advice saying there is no need for a 'blanket ban' on prams inside children's centres. Mother Emma Easterby, 34, says the ban means she no longer fells comfortable taking her four-month-old daughter Alexis to the centre. She said: 'It's health and safety gone mad. My baby has underdeveloped eyesight and doctors told me to use the sensory room there but I can't now as I can't take her pram in. 'There is no way I'm going to leave the pram chained up outside, I couldn't afford to replace it if it was stolen and I don't want to put my baby into a freezing cold buggy when we come back out. 'If word gets out that we are leaving our prams outside then we could be targeted. 'The staff have been abrupt and say it's health and safety but that never stopped us before - I've been going there for three months, the prams weren't causing problems or blocking corridors. 'I was there one Friday with no problem at all and by the same Monday we were turned away at the door. There was no warning given at all.' After refusing to leave her pram unattended, Natalie Henderson, 28, claims she was told to take her baby to another centre to be weighed. She said: 'I went to the centre twice a week until they told me to leave my pram outside. 'I'm not putting my baby into a freezing cold pram - it needs sorting, I can't get my baby weighed. 'They say it's health and safety but that's rubbish, it's supposed to be a centre for babies and children and they could get sick as a result of this nonsense.' Darlington Council said the ban on taking prams inside the centre (pictured) was made after staff carried out a risk assessment and found they were blocking walkways and fire exits . Jade Davidson, who is mum to four-month-old Charlie, added: 'It was about three weeks ago when I first encountered the ban. I couldn't believe what I was hearing I thought it was a joke. 'Charlie has not been very well since birth so when I was asked to leave his pram outside in the sleet and rain I was really upset. 'I needed to take him in to be weighed so I agreed but when I came back out and put him in the buggy he was freezing and developed a cold as a result. 'I understand that the ban won't be such a big deal in summer and I went back last week and explained that I couldn't leave my buggy inside again. 'They let me bring the pram inside that day because it was a quiet time but it's not really good enough.' A spokesman for Darlington Borough Council said that the ban was put in place after staff carried out a risk assessment and found the prams were blocking walkways and fire exits. She added that the centre has recently become busier as a result of new courses being put on, and was struggling to fit the extra pushchairs inside. The Government's Health and Safety Executive responded to similar cases by saying: 'There is no health and safety reason for a blanket ban on buggies and prams in a children's centre. Ms Easterby, who takes her daughter to use the sensory room at the centre after she was born with underdeveloped eyesight, says she fears the pram park could become a target for thieves . 'Seeking a solution that works for everyone would be infinitely preferable to hiding behind quoting ""health and safety"" as a blanket excuse.' Darlington's MP Jenny Chapman said: 'Only a crazy person would insist parents wake their sleeping children before they're ready. 'I'm sure there were sound practical reasons for suggesting the rule but we need to make sure nothing puts parents off accessing services.' Jenni Cooke, a councillor responsbile for children, families and learning, added: 'We haven't banned people from bringing prams and buggies into the centre but it is a question of safety for everyone who uses it. 'We've asked people to use their judgement, particularly at busy times, and park their prams and buggies in the covered, on-site buggy park. 'We will provide locks and help people get in and out of the centre if they need help.' Councillor Cyndi Hughes added: 'Our priority is on speaking with these families to find workable solutions to the problems they have raised. 'We know the success of our Children’s Centres depends on our ability to make it as user friendly as possible.'","Parents at Sure Start, Darlington, told to leave prams chained up outside .

"She might have blue blood, a nanny and a husband on hand to help out but when it comes to new motherhood Zara Phillips is just like the rest of us. More than a year after giving birth to her daughter Mia in January 2014 the Queen's granddaughter, who is currently 15th in line to the throne, says she is still battling to regain her pre-baby fitness levels. In an interview with FT Weekend Magazine the 33-year-old, who is married to former England rugby player Mike Tindall and is one of Britain's leading equestrian riders, revealed: 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back.' Zara Phillips says she is battling to get her fitness levels back more than a year after daughter Mia was born . Crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2006 Zara won team silver at the 2012 Olympics in London on her horse High Kingdom. She also has a host of other awards under her belt including individual and team gold at the European Eventing Championships in 2005 and individual gold and team silver at the World Equestrian Games in 2006. But, despite an active pregnancy in which she eschewed NHS guidelines and rode with her baby bump, she was forced to take a break from competitive riding and she says she's found it a battle to return to the same level of fitness since becoming a mum. Zara, who got back on the saddle just 12 weeks after giving birth to Mia, says she now spends her afternoons swimming and cycling to get back in shape. A pregnant Zara in August 2013, left, and at Goodwood six months after giving birth to Mia in July 2014, right . Zara, pictured at the Cheltenham Festival this month, says getting back in shape after having a baby is 'tough' She said: 'I also try to work out on an exercise bike first thing in the morning.' But while many new mums take their time to get their pre-pregnancy figures back, time is of the essence for Zara who is hoping to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Zara's stables are next to the cottage she shares with Mike and Mia at Gatcombe Park, the Gloucestershire estate that belongs to her mother, Princess Anne, and with 17 months to go until the Olympics she is training hard. And the royal  said the family-friendly nature of the eventing circuit means she can bring Mia with her to competitions 'so I don't have to go the entire day missing her'. Zara has put plans for baby number two on hold while she trains for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio . Zara, pictured with Mia, is often seen at equestrian events with her one-year-old daughter in tow . With the Games looming any plans the couple have to add to their family have been put on the back burner until after next year's event. Zara says: 'That also means I won't be able to have any more children between now and then too.' But training doesn't mean Zara has to miss out on family life – she has a live-in horse lorry where baby Mia can sleep at eventing competitions, which she says are great for families.","The Queen's granddaughter lost all her fitness after baby Mia was born .

"A political operative has sued presidential campaign adviser David Axelrod over Axelrod's claim that he came up with the attack strategy that saved an embattled Philadelphia mayor in 2003. Philadelphia campaign consultant Frank Keel said it was his idea to blame Republicans for an FBI listening device found in Democratic Mayor John Street's office. Keel considers the decision to attack then-President George W. Bush's Republican administration 'a defining moment' of his career, according to his lawsuit. 'His brazen and successful handling of the crisis launched Keel to the forefront of his profession,' said the legal filing, filed earlier this week and first reported on by The Philadelphia Inquirer. In his book 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics,' Axelrod takes credit for the plan to accuse President George W. Bush's Justice Department of trying to sink Street's re-election bid. David Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign strategist in 2012, is under fire on at least two fronts for claims he made in his new political memoir . WHOSE IDEA WAS IT? Philadelphia Mayor John Street (right) swept to a re-election victory in 2003 after his campaign aides hatched a plot to blame Republicans for alistening device the FBI planted in his office . The FBI bugged Street's office as part of a 'pay-to-play' probe that led to the indictments of a city treasurer, a top Street fundraiser and 10 others. The mayor himself was never charged and denied wrongdoing. Street had initially been quiet about the bug found in his City Hall office but went on the attack as the campaign claimed that Republicans did it. Weeks later, he won re-election in a landslide. Axelrod, in a statement, said his book does not rule out the possibility that other advisers 'arrived at the same conclusion or proceeded on parallel tracks.' But the lawsuit claims Axelrod was unreachable on the day Keel came up with the strategy – and later opposed it. Shawn Fordham, Mayor Street's 2003 campaign manager, submitted a statement with the suit saying that Axelrod eventually 'got on board' and called Keel a 'hero.' Keel also sued Penguin Random House, Axelrod's publisher. It dismissed Keel's claims as 'utterly absurd.' Axelrod served as President Barack Obama's chief campaign strategist in 2008 and 2012. Now the founding director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, Axelrod cut his political teeth at age 27 as a city hall correspondent and columnist at the Chicago Tribune. Three years later he jumped to politics with a communications director job for sitting U.S. Senator Paul Simon. Mitt Romney's personal assistant Garrett Jackson (right) saw and heard everything the GOP candidate said and did during the last presidential race, and he said Axelrod lied about the 2012 Election Night concession call to make the Republican look like a race-obsessed sore loser . In addition to the Street campaign, Axelrod later managed the re-election campaign of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, He later worked for then-Senator John Edwards' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to Obama's 2008 effort. Ultimately he became one of the president's most senior advisers before departing the White House in 2011. His career has also included political consulting for liberal candidates in Canada and Italy. 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics' came out in mid-February and has already brought complaints from two people who say Axelrod lied in the memoir . This year he's consulting with Britain's Labour Party in advance of May 7 elections. Labour has said Axelrod is being paid a 'six-figure salary' for his advice, and that he is working with Douglas Alexander, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary – largely via telephone conference calls. The Street case is the second claim that he lied in his memoir. The personal aide of one-time Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney blasted him last month for writing that Romney had claimed President Barack Obama's 2012 election victory was the product of an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation tageting blacks. Garrett Jackson told CBS News that Axelrod told a 'ridiculous ... lie' about a phone call between Obama and Romney on Election Night. The Republican nominee, according to Axelrod's account, angered Obama when he called to concede the race – saying, 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.' That's how Obama remembers it, Axelrod wrote. 'In other words, black people,' his book records the president as saying, 'That's what he (Romney) thinks this was all about.' Garrett claimed he was in the room listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and it never happened. Separately, Axelrod made news in February with a speech at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics by claiming that the Obama presidency has seen 'six years in which there hasn’t been a major scandal.' That claim drew a mix of applause and laughter from his audience.","Axelrod took credit in his memoir for a plan blaming GOP dirty-tricksters for a listening device the FBI planted in a Philadelphia mayor's office as part of a criminal probe .
But another Democratic operative claims it was all his idea – and Axelrod thought it was a bad one .
It's the second time the Obama confidant's book has been branded dishonest .
A Mitt Romney aide said last month that Axelrod lied when he wrote that the Republican candidate suggested on Election Night 2012 that Obama only won because his outreach targeted black voters .
Axelrod has a long career in Democratic politics and landed a six-figure consulting contract with Britain's Labour Party during this year's elections ."
"A Penn State professor who was arrested on an American Airlines flight after lighting a cigarette and ranting about Obama said she was expressing an act of 'civil disobedience'. Dr Karen Halnon, 52, became an internet sensation after she was caught on camera lighting up shortly after a flight from Nicaragua landed at Miami International Airport on Saturday. Halnon said she used the moment to protest 'U.S. military global domination,' claiming the country has 'declared war on Venezuela' and was responsible for giving her hero Hugo Chavez cancer. Dr Karen Halnon, left in her police mugshot and right in a faculty photo, said she was expressing an act of 'civil disobedience' when she was filmed smoking and ranting about the US after her plane landed in Miami . The sociology professor also said the US was after Venezuela's water and oil. 'I had to speak out now,' she told Philadelphia Magazine. 'The situation is dire and urgent.' 'Any sacrifice I make for my own self, if it saves lives — there have been far too many lives lost due to U.S. global military domination.' Halnon claims she was 'tortured' by the FBI and TSA after she was arrested in Miami for disorderly conduct. 'I was put in a room with two fans in the ceiling, it was freezing cold for hours and hours and hours,' she said. Halnon alleged she was not allowed to go to the bathroom and had to wet her pants. She said she also defecated on the floor and was forced to pick it up while being 'laughed at'. A number of passengers around Halnon became angered after she lit up on the plane. The professor said the act was a 'symbol'. 'Every revolutionary I know smokes,' she said. 'It was identifying with the revolutionary cause. 'Beyond that, it is a symbol that the United States is a smoking gun.' Halnon also questioned how she got through security with the lighter, which she said was right on top of her book bag. Halnon is seen smoking onboard the flight, in a video uploaded to YouTube and posted on Reddit . When fellow passengers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior, Halnon blamed someone else for smoking and went on a  rant, saying the US had 'declared war on Venezuela' 'The action was necessary,' she said. 'They are going to kill many more people.' During her political rant aboard the flight Halnon, who said she teaches about US imperialism in Latin America, equated the country's tough economic sanctions against Venezuela with a declaration of war. According to an eyewitness, she also allegedly said that Obama 'kills people on Tuesdays'. Halnon shouted: 'The United States has declared war on Venezuela. Venezuela has been declared a national security threat.' 'You're a national security threat,' a passenger remarked off camera. 'She's gangster' another passenger said, laughing. Flight attendants warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. But she yelled louder, ranting that Venezuela 'previously owned the oil in Venezuela.' 'My great hero Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people would own the oil...not Exon Mobil.' After she was warned again by a flight attendant that she was going to be arrested, Halnon remarked 'I know already.' 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. A statement from Penn State on Tuesday confirmed that Halnon is a member of staff. A flight attendant, right, warned Halnon that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she didn't calm down. Halnon said she knew she was going to be arrested and wanted to speak her piece . It said: 'Penn State Abington is aware of Dr. Karen Halnon’s behavior this past weekend on a flight from Nicaragua and is looking into the matter.' Halnon teaches sociology at the school's Abington campus near Philadelphia, and has the rank of associate professor. According to her faculty page, she is an expert on capitalism, Latin America and 'mad women'. Dr Halnon was award her PhD from Boston College in 1995 with a thesis about treatments for women and hysteria. She has two published books, and more than 25 journal articles to her name. The video of Halnon was captured  by a passenger who then posted the video  to YouTube and Reddit. The redditor, with the user name 'upside down dog', alleged that he was on the same flight as Halnon when he recorded her. 'They already say they are arresting me so I'm going to tell you more,' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up. He  wrote: 'While the plane was waiting on the tarmac for the police to arrive, she leans over to me and asks for a cigarette. 'She pulls one out of her bag and lights up. This is the point where I pull eject and run to the back of the cabin. The police arrive after 20 minutes and escort her off the plane. 'She only had a single drink on the plane (however, others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers)'. Halnon confirmed she only had one small bottle of wine on the plane that she said she mixed over the course of three drinks. 'I wasn't drunk,' she said. 'I don't need alcohol to protest. This is my life.'","Dr Karen Halnon, 52, became an internet sensation after she was caught on camera lighting a cigarette and ranting on an American Airlines flight .

"For a city with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, the sudden opening of a gun store on New York's Lower East Side raised eyebrows. The GWH Gun Shop was open for only two days last week and had a very specific purpose - to put people off buying guns. Potential shoppers were lured in by a large sign in the window that stated: 'First-time gun buyer? We are here to help you.' In the apparently well-stocked store, in a space usually used as an art gallery, each gun is labelled with information about how that make and model was used in a particular tragedy. The 'sales pitches' from the actor posing as the store clerk are brutal and hidden cameras captured the startled reactions of customers. Scroll down for video . The store opened overnight in a space usually used as an art gallery in New York's Lower East Side . The authentic looking store was filled with guns, clothing and accessories, but no live ammo was on site . Many of the shoppers that entered the store were potential first-time gun owners looking to buy a weapon for primarily for protection . 'Collectors love this one. Adam Lanza's mom had this in her collection, too, until he took this and several other guns and killed her and then went down to Sandy Hook and killed six teachers and 20 innocent children. Twenty little kids…Gone like that.' For a customer interested in ease of use he said: 'This revolver, it's the easiest gun we have to use. It's our most popular one. It's a .22-caliber, six-inch revolver. It's also a gun that a five-year-old found in his parents' bedroom, went down and shot his nine-month-old baby brother with it.' In another part of the video he showed a 9mm semi-automatic weapon to a customer: 'A very handy gun. Easy to use. It's a great gun to carry in your purse, like that gal from the Walmart, her two-year-old son reaches into her pocketbook, pulls it out, shoots her.' The store - and its accompanying website, Guns With History - were part of a campaign put together by States United to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun control non-profit organization and New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, one of their affiliates. The 'sales pitches' from the actor posing as the store clerk are brutal descriptions of tragedies committed with the make and model of the weapon . All the weapons, which were unloaded movie props, also have a tag with information about the tragedy to which the clerk refers - the descriptions are also on the related website . Hidden cameras captured the reactions of potential first-time gun owners to the 'sales pitches' Customers were visibly shocked or upset by the descriptions of gun accidents and mass shootings . Working with Grey, a New York-base agency, and production company Rival School Pictures, the goal was to ensure that people are aware of how many accidents and tragedies occur as a result of having a gun in a home. The groups were also particularly keen to reach out to parents. The pro-gun lobby was quick to label the stunt as misleading. 'This is a tasteless PR stunt designed to further an anti-gun agenda, and it's out of touch with reality,' National Rifle Association spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told FoxNews.com. 'As gun ownership has risen to an all-time high, violent crime has fallen to a 43-year low, and the firearm accident death rate has fallen to the lowest that it has been in over a hundred years.' 'A clear majority of the American people support the use of firearms for protection and put more faith in gun ownership rights than in gun control.' Julia Wyman, executive director of SUPGV said: 'Our aim is to ensure those looking to purchase a firearm are aware of the potential risks [and to promote responsible gun ownership].' 'Often gun purchasers wrongly believe guns will keep them safe when, in fact, a gun in the home greatly increases the risk of homicide and suicide.' 'This sets the record straight so consumers can make an informed choice to buy a firearm or not.' The store has an accompanying website which carries the same information . Potential shoppers found the information sobering .","The fake store opened for two days on the Lower East Side with the express purpose of putting people off buying guns .

"Camila Batmanghelidjh, 52, started Kids Company, a charity that provides support to vulnerable young people, as a drop-in centre in Camberwell, south London in 1996. In the 19 years since, it has grown to support 36,000 children across the country, in walk-in centres, therapy groups and more than 40 schools. She invited the Daily Mail into her office and shared the story behind some of her most sentimental possessions. Camila Batmanghelidjh, 52, in her Kids Company office in south London . KEEP SMILING . I established Kids Company in 1996, but we moved into this office five years ago. Our doors are open to any neglected child who feels they need us, and we now reach 36,000 across London, Bristol and Liverpool. This is my office and it's full of the children's artwork – I can't bear to let it go and they love the fact I have it around me. Like this Laughing Man picture – I just love the imagination. A lot of the art is made for the major donors whose cash keeps us going, but I thought, ""No donor's getting this!"" SUPER ANNIE . One of our children, Annie, has special needs but she's extraordinary. Her mother died, her sister was shot dead, then her grandmother, who became her carer, died. She was abused and ended up on the streets as a teenager being trafficked by drug dealers. She came here and started doing incredible art like this table. Now she goes into neglected children's houses and cleans up and then paints and decorates. This table was for a donor too but it's going nowhere, it's absolutely exquisite. This duck with a plastic crown is supposed to be Camila . QUACKERS! A little girl called Ariana created the duck pond under the main table. The kids bring me plastic ducks and I use it for family therapy sessions when children want to show me what's going on in their families, or in care. We also use it with the younger children because the table's a bit big for them. They like to be on their stomachs, so they talk from under the table and move the ducks around. The house on the left is meant to be a castle. And the duck with the crown is supposed to be me! A boy made this truck for Camila . FREE WISHES . This Wishing Tree was part of an exhibition we did, Angels And Demons, because we wanted to explore the way children are demonised. It's adults' choices that make these disturbed children. The idea was that children could hang their wishes on the tree, and I kept it because I feel I'm propelled into action every day by them. What they want sometimes is so poignant, like 'A pair of shoes'. A third of our kids don't have a bed to sleep on, and one in four doesn't have any furniture. THE LOVE TRUCK . This very special boy who was in foster care decided he wanted to make me a truck. It has me driving and in the back are all the glittery things I bring for the kids. But when you open the bonnet you get a surprise – he's put a heart in it. He wanted to show that the engine of my truck is love. He was just ten and I was so touched by his profound understanding of what we're about – transporting love from those who can give it to those who need it. The Love Truck and the Wishing Tree really move me. A teenager that Camila helped bought her this pink elephant . TO THE RESCUE . I found a teenager in a pitch-dark flat. He had no light, no fridge, no bath, no bed, just his clothes in a bin liner. He'd had 64 care placements before the age of 16, and social services never visited again. I burst into tears and said, ""No son of mine is going to live like this!"" We decorated his room and got him furniture. We took him shopping and he saw this elephant and said, ""It looks like Camila! It's got to be in her office."" He must have thought, ""It's colourful, it's big – and it's got a big butt!""

"A one-year-old boy has died after a pick-up truck thought to belong to one of his relatives reversed into a garden wall which then collapsed on top of him. The baby, believed to be from an Asian family, suffered a serious head injury and died outside a semi-detached home in Yardley, Birmingham. Several neighbours have said they thought the owner of the truck may be the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash. An air ambulance landed in a public park opposite the house and paramedics made desperate efforts to save the baby after the 'tragic' crash earlier today. Floral tributes have been left at the scene of the incident in Birmingham where a one-year-old boy died after a pick-up truck -thought to belong to his father - reversed into a garden wall which then collapsed on him . The boy suffered a serious head injury and died outside a semi-detached home in Yardley, Birmingham . Police were alerted  at around 5pm and officers said the road was likely to be closed for some time for an investigation to take place. The family's next door neighbour Mary Mason, 67, said: 'The pick up truck is there quite often so I think it belongs to the home owner. 'I saw it reversing out my window and then it lurched forward and I heard a massive crash. I looked out and their garden wall had collapsed. 'Next thing I know I can just hear screaming and shouting, I don't know what was going on. There was chaos. I could just hear yelling and panicked screams. 'There was blue flashing lights everywhere but I had no idea what had happened, I thought the wall had just collapsed but the shouting and the noise made me think it could have been something worse.' One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I don't know how he managed to do it or whether the lad was in a pushchair or cot,' she said. A white forensic tent was erected outside the £120,000 semi-detached property where the crash took place . Several neighbours said they thought the owner of the truck may be the boy's father, a taxi driver, who was seen 'crying his eyes out' after the crash. Dozens of flowers were left at the scene outside the home today . One young girl and her mother leave a bunch of flowers at the scene, where the crumbled wall remains today . 'But I'm certain he must have been on the footpath the other side of their garden wall. I looked out my window and could see the man crying his eyes out - he was a mess, he was really in a bad way.' A white forensic tent was erected outside the £120,000 semi-detached property where the crash took place and a large number of people could be inside one of the nearby homes. Neighbour Barbara Porter, 76, said: 'I heard the helicopter land in Old Yardley Park over the road and there was police and ambulances everywhere. 'Its a really busy road and we've had loads of accidents down here. To know it is a little child is just heartbreaking. 'There's a lot of pedestrians as we are by a school and the cars are always bombing down the road. It's such a shame. 'It doesn't get more tragic than this. It's upsetting to think about what his family must be going through right now.' Another neighbour Glenys Cooper, 68, said: 'I went out after hearing a lot of commotion. There were sirens blaring. 'I spoke to one woman who was in a right state, she was really upset and she said it was her cousin who had been involved. 'But she couldn't get to anywhere near the scene really, the police soon had it all taped off. It's such a tragedy. Paramedics and an emergency doctor made desperate efforts to save the baby and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance attended the scene . Officers were called to the Stechford area of the city at around 5pm today following a report that a recovery truck had hit a wall, pictured is the road where the incident took place . 'I'm a grandmother and when you think it could have been one of your grandkids, you just can't imagine what the parents must be feeling.' Inspector Paul Bennett said: 'This is a very tragic set of circumstances – words cannot describe what his family are going through and our thoughts are with them at this time. 'Specialist officers will be supporting the boy's family and – as with all serious and fatal collisions - an investigation has been launched to establish the cause.' Dozens of people  have already taken to social media to send messages of support to the baby's family, who are believed to be from the area. Louise Pernell said: 'How terribly sad...thoughts go out to the family and those that attended the accident ...RIP little one.' Brad Wilkinson said: 'Tragic, thoughts are with the family.' Ben Weatherstone said: 'Just down the road from me... Horrible news.' A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'A rapid response vehicle was on scene within four minutes of the call and was backed up by an ambulance, a paramedic officer, a BASICS Emergency Doctor and the Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance. 'The boy suffered a serious head injury. 'Ambulance staff carried out advanced life support but sadly nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed dead at the scene by the doctor.' Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash to come forward, .

"A section of scaffolding collapsed at a high-rise construction project in downtown Raleigh, killing three people and sending another to a hospital, officials said Monday. Jeffrey Hammerstein, a district chief at Wake County EMS, said three people were confirmed dead in the accident at the glass and steel building called Charter Square, where scaffolding had peeled away from the exterior and fallen into a parking lot below. Authorities said they were working to identify those who died. The fourth worker was reported to have suffered serious injuries. Prayers: Construction workers gather outside the scene where a section of scaffolding collapsed at a high-rise construction project, killing three people and sending another to a hospital on Monday . All were involved in the construction project, Hammerstein said. Peter Thurston was working inside the building installing a security card reader system when the accident happened. He said he ran outside to try to help and saw three men in safety harnesses, leading him to believe that they had been attached to the scaffolding. 'It was just a loud crash and a huge cloud of smoke,' said Thurston, 32, of Garner. 'I noticed three of the guys and it looked like they were dead. ... That could have been anybody. That could have been me.' He said a fourth man wearing a safety harness was found inside a nearby portable toilet. He was still breathing and had a pulse, but was barely responsive, Thurston said. It was not immediately clear if the injured man had fallen into the toilet or had been sitting inside when the collapse occurred. Towering: A section of scaffolding framework hangs from the side of the Charter Square building after Monday's accident which left three dead . The scaffolding that fell was attached to the side of the new building that allowed it to travel up and down. One of the tracks had snapped off several stories up and fallen into a twisted heap on the ground below. State Department of Labor spokesman Neal O'Briant said Monday that his agency is investigating the cause. Officials had closed off a wide area around the scene. A group of men in hard hats and yellow vests, some of which said Associated Scaffolding on them, were talking to an official near the edge of the police line. A woman who answered the phone at the company's Durham headquarters declined to give her name and said the company had no comment. According to the state Department of Labor, the construction industry accounts for nearly half of all workplace fatalities in the state, with 19 deaths at construction sites reported in 2014.

"A father charged with causing his 15-month-old son's death by leaving the boy in a hot car has entered a plea. Kyle Seitz of Ridgefield, Connecticut, entered a so-called Alford plea in which he didn't admit guilt but agreed the prosecution has enough evidence to convict him at trial. A guilty finding was entered on the record. Authorities say the 37-year-old Seitz forgot to take his son, Benjamin, to day care on July 7 and unintentionally left him in the car for more than seven hours while he went to work. Temperatures that day hit the upper 80s. Kyle Seitz (pictured in court in November) told police he accidentally left his 15-month-old son on the backseat of the car for the entire day on July 7. Sentencing is scheduled for April 9 with the crime carrying a maximum one-year sentence . 15-month-old Benjamin Seitz (left and right) died as a result of hyperthermia after being left in a hot car by his father in Connecticut last summer . Seitz drove his car three times with his toddler dead in the back seat after forgetting him when he went into work, prosecutors said at a hearing in November. He went to lunch and back, then drove to his son's daycare  after work before finally realizing the 15-month-old was dead in his Jeep Cherokee. The software programmer told the authorities that he 'felt shock and terror' when he discovered that his son was in the back seat 'motionless'. After discovering Benjamin lying unresponsive on the car's back seat, he rushed the toddler to Danbury Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Benjamin died as a result of hyperthermia due to environmental exposure. Seitz was charged with criminally negligent homicide. Seitz, who has two daughters, aged eight and six, has been free on bail. Sentencing is scheduled for April 9. The crime carries a maximum one-year sentence. Just weeks after Benjamin's death, the child's mother, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz, said she forgave her husband of 12 years, describing the Owl Computing Technologies employee as an 'amazing father'. 'I love my husband,' she told the Associated Press at the time. 'Of course I forgive him. But it doesn't mean that our lives aren't different now. 'So we have to move forward with a new different reality for us, and it's always going to be that way.'

"A pensioner was left covered in blood after a thug knocked him to the ground during a violent neighbourhood parking dispute. Lee Cairns, 43, of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, took a 'running leap' at Stan Roberts, 79, and punched him in the face during the row in North Shields. Mr Roberts suffered cuts and bruises to his nose and cheek, as well as damaged teeth, and said he had 'never been punched so hard in my life'. Pensioner Stan Roberts, 79, was left covered in blood (pictured) after being punched to the ground during a neighbourhood dispute in North Shields . Mr Roberts suffered cuts and bruises to his nose and cheek, as well as damaged teeth, and said he had 'never been punched so hard in my life' The attack took place while Mr Roberts was visiting his ex-wife Yejide Roberts, 38, at her home. The court heard how Cairns' daughter Kelly Lamb, a mother of one, had knocked on Mrs Roberts's door, asking her to move her vehicle from outside Ms Lamb's home. But, despite Mr Roberts moving the car, a heated row broke out in the street between Mrs Roberts and Ms Lamb. The court heard how, minutes later, Cairns stormed down the path and began hurling abuse at Mr and Mrs Roberts. He then attacked the pensioner, punching him once to the face with such force that he collapsed. Before fleeing the scene, Cairns and Lamb then kicked the door of Mrs Roberts's car, leaving a visible dent. Lee Cairns, 43, of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, took a 'running leap' at Stan Roberts during the violent row, which took place after his daughter Kelly Lamb (left) asked Mrs Roberts to move her car . Then, when police arrived to arrest Cairns at his home, he snatched a baton from one officer and threatened to 'take his head off'. Maimuna Bappa, prosecuting at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court, said: 'There was an argument about where Yejinde had parked and it escalated outside the house with Mr Cairns appearing on the scene. 'At this time the victim remained in the house - he is 79 and suffers from heart problems - but he observed that the dispute was getting out of hand. 'When he stepped out the door, he saw the defendant running down the path to him, draw back his right fist and then punch him in the face. 'He was bleeding heavily from the nose and collapsed back in the house by the living room floor.' The court heard how, after attacking Mr Roberts, Cairns and Lamb both kicked his ex-wife's car before fleeing from the scene. Mr Roberts had gone to visit his former partner when the incident took place . Ms Bappa said Cairns then became aggressive while being put under arrest. The court heard how, while one hand was cuffed, he used the other hand to pull the baton from the officer's belt. He said: 'He raised it above his head and threatened to hit the officer. He said he would ""take the officer's head off"" with the baton.' Cairns, who admitted assault, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer, has now been jailed for 22 weeks. He was also ordered to pay £750 compensation to Mr Roberts and must abide by a two-year restraining order. Speaking after the court case, Mr Roberts said that his ex-wife had been left 'a bag of nerves' following the ordeal. Speaking after the court case, Mr Roberts (left) said that his ex-wife Yejide (right), a trainee nurse, had been left 'a bag of nerves' following the ordeal . He said: 'I am glad he has gone away for what he has done to me and to my ex-wife. 'I am 80 this year and I am starting to feel my age and this certainly hasn't helped.

"It is possible that Hillary Clinton distributed sensitive information through her personal email, the State Department now admits, and only a review of her messages will determine if she broke the rules. A State Department official who spoke to The Washington Post acknowledged that some of the correspondence Clinton sent through her private email may constitute a breach of security guidelines. The official asserted that Clinton didn't directly defy State's policies by using her personal email for government communications, but a manual obtained by news outlets shows that since 2005 State has directed its employees to use its email system because it has the 'proper level of security control.' The former secretary of state's team has responded to a storm of criticism surrounding Clinton's email practices by hunkering down and waiting for it to pass. The former secretary of state's team has responded to a storm of criticism surrounding Clinton's email practices by hunkering down and waiting for it to pass. But top communications gurus are recommending the campaign immediately act to deflate 'email-gate' State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf insists that Mrs. Clinton didn't send any classified material through her private 'clintonemails.com' account while she led the agency . But top communications gurus are recommending the campaign immediately act to deflate email-gate. Democrats in early states worry the scandal is an early warning sign that Clinton's presumed presidential campaign is on the path to destruction and could 'implode.' From the outset, the State Department has cautiously avoided declaring Clinton innocent of any wrongdoing while encouraging reporters to give her the benefit of the doubt. 'She and her team has said that it was not used for anything but unclassified work,' Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman for State told reporters on Wednesday, adding moments later, 'I don’t think there was any indication she was doing anything but [that] here, so I don’t think it’s really a pertinent question.' Further pressed to 'definitively' claim Clinton wasn't sending classified information through her personal email – which is against the law – Harf argued that 'you can’t claim that about anyone’s unclassified email.' She also noted in the exchange that the department doesn't monitor its other employees' private communications to make sure that classified information isn't being shared. 'I’m not sure why this would be anything different,' Harf contended. 'I don’t know why this would be held to a different standard.' When Clinton did need to discuss classified information she communicated through her her staff, the State Department spokeswoman claimed. Later asked if Clinton's exclusive use of personal email was 'problematic,' Harf stated that that 'there was no prohibition on this practice.' 'So I’m not going to make a judgment about appropriateness or not,' she said. 'I’m telling you what the regulations say and don’t say. She operated under them, and that’s as much as I can say.' Guidelines published by Politico and other publications on Thursday evening suggest otherwise, however. 'It is the Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized [Automated Information System], which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information,' the State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual says. An official who spoke to Politico said that it is true that 'sensitive but unclassified information should be handled on a system with certain security requirements' with the caveat 'except in certain circumstances.' The State Department insider said it's not true that 'by using personal email she is automatically out of step' with the guidelines outlined in the manual. Likewise, the Post's source at State said, 'We are not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton’s 55,000 pages of e-mails.' National Democrats aligned with Clinton are blowing off the email squabble as background noise that won't affect voters' perceptions of their party's most formidable presidential candidate. 'Voters do not give a s*** about what email Hillary used. They don't even give a fart,' Paul Begala,  confidante of and adviser to Bill Clinton,' said Thursday on CNN. Media Matters founder David Brock said in an op-ed on CNN that the media 'hype' around Clinton's emails is the 'perfect example of ""gotcha"" journalism, where reporters will take any bait the Republicans give them without proper vetting.' Brock, whose group American Bridge runs a pro-Clinton fact-checking service called Correct the Record, also argued that the Clintons 'are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny.' 'Their perfectly usual, above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable -- while Republicans are left relatively unscathed,' he charged. Regardless, top level communicators on the left and the right say that Clinton currently risks mishandling the crisis. Former Barack Obama senior adviser David Axelrod has said that the longer Clinton and her team wait to respond to the flurry of questions about her use of not only a non-official email for her work at the State Department but also a personal domain name and a private server, the likelier the situation is to get out of hand. 'It’s a ball of wool that won’t go away until the questions are answered,' he told the New York Times on Thursday. DUELING TWEETS, PART I: Likely Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush goaded Clinton to be more transparent . DUELING TWEETS, PART II: Clinton responded by saying 'I want the public to see my email' and asking her old agency to hurry up the process . Ari Fleisher, a former spokesman for George W. Bush, told Bloomberg, Clinton's team is 'making a big mistake' by not letting her address the issue publicly. 'This is immediately understood and problematic in the eyes of the average voter. Everyone can relate to it and understand it … it cuts through the clutter in a way that hurts her,' he said. 'This is one of those issues that’s not going away anytime soon.' Clinton fired off a tweet on Wednesday night saying she wanted the public to read her emails and had given the State Department permission to publish them once they it finishes its review. And a spokesman for her confirmed to the press at the beginning of the week that all of her emails that pertain to the State Department have been remanded to the federal government. Questions continue to linger, however, and neither Clinton nor her team have given a reasonable explanation for the former Obama administration official's actions. Larry Hogden, chairman of Iowa’s Cedar County Democrats, told Politico the email controversy 'adds more reason' for other politicians in the party to explore presidential campaigns. 'Because, who knows? She could implode totally,' he said.","'Day-to-day operations [must] be conducted on an authorized [system] which has the proper level of security control,' State Dept. policy reads .

"Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas, it emerged last night. Four women and five men entered the country last week, keeping their plans secret from relatives until shortly before they crossed the border. Turkish politician Mehmet Al Ediboglu told The Observer: ‘We all assume they are in Tel Abyad now, which is under Isis control. Scroll down for video . Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. From left to right: Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir and Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah . The four women and five men apparently kept their plans secret from their families. Left to right: Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Sami Ahmed Kadir and Ismail Hamadoun . They are believed to now be in Tel Abyad, according to a Turkish politician. From left to right: Nada Sami Kader, Mohamed Osama Badri Mohammed and Tasneem Suleyman . 'The conflict out there is fierce, so medical help must be needed.’ He added: 'Let's not forget about the fact that they are doctors; they went there to help, not to fight. So this case is a little bit different.' Mr Ediboglu, who has met the students’ families, said they felt the young Britons had been ‘cheated [and] brainwashed’. Volunteer: Lena Abdulqadir has gone to Syria to work in ISIS controlled hospitals . The group, in their late teens and early 20s, are all Britons of Sudanese descent studying at the University of Medical Sciences and Technology in Khartoum, where it is feared they were radicalised. They have been named as Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Sami Ahmed Kadir, Ismail Hamadoun, Nada Sami Kader, Mohamed Osama Badri Mohammed and Tasneem Suleyman. They have been joined by two other medics from the United States and Canada, also of Sudanese origin. Mr Ediboglu wrote on his Facebook page: 'Eleven doctors - nine British and two Sudanese - came to Turkey a week ago to join ISIS. 'The families of the young people have been in Turkey to search for them and bring them back. 'Our greatest hope is to save the doctors from ISIS and reunite them with their families.' Mr Ediboglu added: ‘These kids were born and raised in England, but they were sent to Sudan to study at medical school.’ The nine flew to Istanbul on March 12, he said, and took a bus to the Syrian border the next day. The families were alerted only when one of the students, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir, 19, who was born in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, sent a Whatsapp message to her sister saying she wanted to ‘volunteer to help wounded Syrian people’. Accompanied with a grinning selfie, the youngster is reported as having written to her sister: 'Don’t worry about us, we’ve reached Turkey and are on our way to volunteer helping wounded Syrian people.' Her father is thought to have rushed to Turkey immediately after learning of her plans. Speaking to Turkey's Birgun newspaper, he said: 'She was living in [Africa] a land which needs a lot of doctors everywhere. 'Why would she go all the way to Syria for volunteering?' A friend of Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin in Khartoum told the BBC the young woman and her friends had 'radically changed' a few years ago and started wearing the full veil, which 'shocked a lot of their friends' in the British Sudanese community. Turkish politician Mehmet Al Ediboglu said he and the families of the medics assume they are in Tel Abyad (pictured), which is under ISIS control . A fluttering Islamic State flag is flown over a hill in the town of Tel Abyad on the Syrian-Turkish border . Ahmed Babikir, students' dean at Khartoum's private University of Medical Sciences told AFP five students university were missing after travelling to Turkey. In February, three east London schoolgirls fled from their homes, reportedly to become jihadi brides in Syria. Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15 were spotted on CCTV in Turkey, where they are thought to have been ushered over the border by a 'fixer' who provided them with false documents. They are believed to have followed in the footsteps of their friend Sharmeena Begum, who went to the same school as the girls in Bethnal Green, and fled to the region before them. Last week, jihadi twin Jamila Henry, 21, was caught allegedly trying to enter Syria, having reportedly already lived in Raqqa, the group's de facto capital, with her seven-month-old son. She was arrested at Luton Airport when she landed back into the UK. Earlier, three teenage boys had also been stopped in Turkey, apparently trying to enter Syria to join ISIS. It came as five teenage girls and a 16-year-old boy were banned from travelling abroad after showing an interest in joining the terror group. 'They all have British passports and are of Sudanese origin,' he said. 'Their families have travelled after them to stop them from joining IS. We are not able to confirm they have crossed into Syria.' The Home Office is reported to have said the group would not automatically face prosecution if they returned to the UK, as long as they could prove they had not been fighting for IS. The Foreign Office said: ‘We are providing consular assistance to the families and have informed the Turkish police, to try to ascertain their whereabouts.’ A Home Office spokesman said: 'The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. 'Anyone who does travel to these areas, even for humanitarian reasons, is putting themselves in considerable danger. 'The best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support UK-registered charities with ongoing relief operations.' It comes after five teenage girls who took an interest in Syria were banned from travelling abroad amid fears more British youngsters are planning to join the terror organisation. The girls, two of whom are 15 and three 16, had their passports removed by a High Court judge after concerns over their alleged plans were raised by a local authority. The adults responsible for them were also stripped of their passports. Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, both 15, fled their north London homes in February and were seen on CCTV in Turkey shortly afterwards . The previous day a 16-year-old boy from Brighton was also banned from travelling abroad following the deaths of his older brothers, both killed in Syria. Earlier three teenage boys were thrown out of the country after being picked up in Istanbul as they tried to cross the border. Their British parents phoned police after the boys, aged 17 and 19, went missing. Their arrival back in the UK came as footage of three north London schoolgirls who had earlier left the country to join frontline militants emerged. In February Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria. The girls were captured on CCTV in the UK and in Turkey where they are thought to have been ushered over the border by an ISIS 'fixer' who provided them with false documents. Sharmeena Begum, who went to the same school as the girls in Bethnal Green, travelled to the region before them.","Families alerted when one sent a Whatsapp message to sister near border .

"Eric Joyce has racked up a £13,000 expenses bill on train tickets and hotel costs for staff – some of which was run up on a special Parliamentary credit card . Parliament’s expenses watchdog has been forced to dock an MP's wages until the election in a bid to recoup £13,000 in debts he owes the taxpayer, MailOnline can reveal. Eric Joyce, who was convicted of assault in 2012 after head-butting a fellow MP in a bar, racked up the bill on train tickets and other expenses – some of which was put on a special Parliamentary credit card. Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around £1,000 a month from Mr Joyce’s wages after he objected to handing back the cash. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority [IPSA], which overseas MPs’ expenses, began deducting cash from his salary in February, but he only has another two months’ pay before the election. Mr Joyce, who was kicked out of the Labour Party following the 2012 Commons brawl, is not standing for election in May and will therefore still owe thousands of pounds after leaving Parliament. IPSA has revealed that Mr Joyce now owes just over £10,000 - down from £12,919.61 at the end of January. If he refuses to repay the money after leaving Parliament he will be pursued through the civil courts, an IPSA source told MailOnline. The expenses body has never deducted cash directly from an MP’s salary before – and Mr Joyce is understood to be furious about the move. A source said: ‘We are doing it and he knows we are doing it. We have these powers to be able to do it. I wouldn’t say he was happy about it.’ IPSA informed the MP last month that they would not pay a host of travel and other expenses. A spokesman for the expenses watchdog said: ‘It is unusual for us to be in this situation, but we are clear that the MP has a duty to repay the sums due and it is our job to make sure that the taxpayer doesn’t lose out. ‘We are taking payments direct from the MP’s salary to recover the money due. If the MP leaves Parliament at the election and there are still amounts owing, we will continue to seek repayment.’ Mr Joyce, a former army officer, was thrown out of the Labour party after being arrested for head-butting Tory MP Stuart Andrew (right) in a House of Commons bar . Mr Joyce confirmed to MailOnline he owed around £10,000 in claims for ‘travel and accommodation for staff’. He revealed he was being docked ‘around a grand a month’ from his wages. Mr Joyce said he was told out of the blue by IPSA that he owed them the money and insisted that they had previously signed off his expenses claims – a claim which IPSA denies. The MP said he had made a complaint to the expenses watchdog’s compliance officer who was investigating whether it was a ‘fair demand’. He said: ‘It won’t be finished when I finish next month. I will have to pay them it anyway. ‘If I owe them it then I will pay them it, but I just dispute that I owe them it.’ In a blog post posted on his website last month he attacked IPSA for making it look like he ‘had knowingly left a debt unpaid for over a year’. Sir Ian Kennedy has led the clampdown on MPs' expenses as chair of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority . He said: ‘IPSA accepts that the claims were agreed in advance, then confirmed as OK, then checked and paid by IPSA.’ But he said: ‘They say that the original reading of the rules by IPSA staff was wrong and so was all of the advice they gave. ‘My staff member or me, as it’s my responsibility should therefore repay all of the cash paid out by IPSA last year.’ He added: ‘I have at no point in my parliamentary career failed to promptly pay anything to IPSA which may have been owed by my office, nor have I made any public complaint about IPSA. ‘I will not repay IPSA in cash unless the situation is resolved in IPSA’s favour.’ The revelation that Mr Joyce owes more than £10,000 to the Commons authorities comes after his expenses claims sparked controversy last year when it emerged he had bought expensive computers and charged them to the taxpayer. In total Mr Joyce claimed £185,635 in expenses last year. Among the items he charged to the taxpayer was £1,777 of 'replacement laptops' and £125 on accessories from the Apple shop. Mr Joyce will be able to keep the technology despite agreeing to refrain from seeking re-election in 2015. The MP was thrown out of the Labour party after being arrested for head-butting Tory MP Stuart Andrew in a House of Commons bar. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined £1,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.","EXCLUSIVE: Eric Joyce racked up the bill on train tickets hotels for staff .

"David Cameron is seen as 'arrogant' while Ed Miliband is 'weak' according to exclusive new polling for MailOnline which asks voters to sum up political leaders in a single word. For the first time voters have been captured on video making clear what they really think of the people bidding to run the country. Using webcam technology and surveying more than 2,000 people, the poll also reveals that Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is seen as 'weak' while Ukip's Nigel Farage is branded 'racist'. Scroll down for video . Exclusive video polling for MailOnline reveals what voters think of the party leaders in their own words . The political blink test is designed to test the instant reaction voters have to seeing the party leaders jostling for their support on May 7. More than 2,000 people were surveyed by Populus for MailOnline, and each were given the option to record their responses on camera. It gives a Gogglebox-style insight into the personal reactions of members of the public to senior politicians. The most frequent response to Mr Cameron was 'arrogant', followed by 'smug', 'leader', 'liar' and 'Prime Minister'. Three people branded the Prime Minister a 'plonker', two called him 'evil' and one replied 'Blair'. Nine called him a w*nker,  11 said 'knob' and 8 used the words 'arsehole'. Six mentioned Eton and four called the Prime Minister a 'c***'. Prime Minister David Cameron was branded 'arrogant', followed by 'smug', 'leader', 'liar' and 'Prime Minister'. When a photograph of Mr Miliband was displayed, the most popular response was 'weak' followed by 'idiot', 'Labour', 'useless' and 'untrustworthy'. Other frequent responses were 'weird', 'incompetent', 'boring' and 'honest'. The top 10 is completed by 'Wallace', the plasticine character the Labour leader is often likened to. One person called him 'Gromit'. Five people thought of 'bacon sandwiches' as the first reaction to Mr Miliband, after his disastrous attempt to be photographed eating breakfast a year ago. Five also called him a 'clever', four mentioned 'hope' and one said Mr Miliband was 'cute'. One said 'anus', two said 'crap' and five called him a 'moron'. When a photograph of Labour leader Ed Miliband was displayed, the most popular response was 'weak' followed by 'idiot', 'Labour', 'useless' and 'untrustworthy' Like Mr Miliband, the overwhelming response to Mr Clegg was 'weak'. The Lib Dem leader has seen his party's popularity collapse since entering coalition five years ago, in large part as a result of the broken promise to abolish tuition fees. Popular responses to the Deputy PM also include 'liar', 'don't know', 'untrustworthy' and 'useless'. In a sign that not everyone knows who he is, or is unsure what to feel about him, the top 10 is completed by 'idiot', 'nothing', 'who?', 'OK' and 'unsure'. Two people described the Deputy PM as a 'poodle', four said he was a 'sell-out' and one branded him a 'tosser'. One called him a 'slag', another said 'numbskull' and two said 'pillock' Popular responses to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg included 'liar', 'don't know', 'untrustworthy' and 'useless' The overwhelming reaction to Mr Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Ukip has been dogged by revelations about its candidates and members, with Mr Farage insisting he will take action against those who embarrass the party. But he has also courted controversy by defending a candidate taped mocking 'poofters', referring to a Chinese woman as a 'Chinky bird' and threatening to 'shoot peasants'. The next most frequent reactions to Mr Farage included 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot'. The top 10 responses also included 'untrustworthy', 'honest' and 'joke'. Five people said 'frog', five said 'yuk!' and another five replied 'w*nker'. The overwhelming reaction to Ukip leader Nigel Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Others called him an 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot' Daisy Powell-Chandler, a consultant at Populus, said: 'It is a fact ignored by most politicians that the public aren't paying attention most of the time. 'Voters have families, jobs and bills that are much more interesting to them than today's policy launch or staged visit.' As the election approaches on May 7, more information will start trickle through. 'But many of the electorate will be choosing who to vote for (or whether to vote at all) based on how each party leader scores on the 'blink test' – the immediate reaction when they see or hear party leaders in the media. This poll shows precisely that. 'It is clear from the results that all political leaders are polarising figures with strong downsides. People think Cameron is arrogant, Miliband is weak, Clegg cannot be trusted, and Farage is a racist. 'But the flipside of these criticisms are things we like about them: Cameron may come across as smug but he is smooth and competent – an assertive leader. 'Ed is weird but caring and intelligent. Clegg is the likeable liberal and Farage a charismatic, funny man. 'Over the course of the campaign, the electorate need to decide which of these attributes are most important and the emotional connections that the public make with these leaders are likely to be an important factor in deciding who the next Prime Minister is.'","Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and Farage subjected to 'blink test' polling .

"The Cancer Drugs Fund for England has cut 19 life-extending treatments it claims are too expensive after a review in January . Thousands of cancer sufferers will lose out on ‘last chance’ drugs after the NHS withdrew approval for their use. The Cancer Drugs Fund for England has cut 19 life-extending treatments it claims are too expensive after a review in January. They include Jevtana, used in prostate cancer, along with Zaltrap, Avastin and Erbitux for bowel cancer. New patients needing these drugs will no longer be able to get them on the NHS without a consultant’s special request. But experts say this is doomed to fail and they will effectively only be available privately often costing thousands of pounds. Following appeals, four drugs will be reconsidered and remain available in the meantime. Dr Alison Birtle, consultant clinical oncologist at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said the decision to axe Jevtana was a travesty. She said ‘As a doctor who treats men with advanced prostate cancer, I am deeply saddened and my patients will be devastated. ‘In my every day experience, Jevtana has given some men with advanced prostate cancer extra time – some of the men that I started to treat with Jevtana three to four years ago are still alive today. ‘Most importantly this time has been of good quality, allowing them to carry on doing the things they enjoy despite their cancer.’ The £280million-a-year Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) which began in April 2011 has led to around 55,000 patients in England getting drugs banned on the NHS by Nice, the rationing body, or awaiting approval. The Government's aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit. Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said ‘We need to hold the Government and the Prime Minister to account for what has happened. ‘He needs to justify why he no longer believes doctors should be able to prescribe the drugs they think will benefit their patients. ‘If this is not what he believes, then he needs to reverse these cuts until a new system is in place.’ He said tens of thousands of patients had petitioned David Cameron, urging him to keep his promise made before the last election and to postpone the cuts until a better, fairer system was in place. He said ‘Cancer treatment shouldn’t be about luck. There should be no difference in the access to treatment between a patient diagnosed a couple of weeks ago and one diagnosed tomorrow. ‘But there will be and we believe this is just the thin end of the wedge with further cost cutting to come. ‘From yesterday, any patients who faces an unfortunate diagnosis of advanced cancer will no longer be able to benefit from the treatments that have been removed from the CDF. ‘The argument shouldn’t be about politics and economics, but so far this has been an exercise in managing budgets and maximising profits. ‘It should have been an exercise in what is important to patients and how to improve outcomes for cancer patients.’ New patients needing these drugs will need a consultant’s special request to access the drugs on the NHS . Dr Rob Glynne-Jones, chief medical advisor of Bowel Cancer UK, said Zaltrap was an effective anticancer drug, which can improve the chances of long-term survival. He said ‘This de-listing decision will significantly restrict patient choice – thus inevitably widening the gap in survival for English patients with colorectal cancer compared with the rest of the world.’ Hugh Gunn, spokesperson for prostate cancer patients’ charity TACKLE, said the removal of Jevtana, also known as cabazitaxel was a terrible blow. He said ‘I am shocked that men in England cannot get the same drugs as men in other European countries, especially when we have a Cancer Drugs Fund to supposedly pay for them. ‘For many men – myself included – cabazitaxel was going to be the next treatment option. In fact, the last treatment option we had left. ‘At the moment I’m well, but in a few months’ time I might not be; for the first time in my entire cancer journey I’m frightened.’ Tarja Stenvall, General Manager for Sanofi in the UK, said the company was continuing a ‘dialogue’ with NHS England to explore immediate ways of maintaining access to patients for Jevtana. A spokesman for NHS England said ‘NHS cancer doctors on the CDF panel have taken a careful look at how we ensure he drugs available offer the best clinical benefit, getting the most for patients from every pound.'","The Cancer Drugs Fund for England has cut 19 life-extending treatments .

"Photographs capturing soldiers posing with the dogs that helped carry messages, detect enemy troops and simply provide comfort in the trenches  while they were fighting during World War One have been found. Libby Hall, of Hackney in east London, has spent four decades collecting dog photos and stumbled on the collection of wartime snaps at a market stall. The pictures show soldiers, dressed in full uniform, posing fondly with the animals as well as whole companies with the animals that were likely to have been trained to act as messengers, scouts and seekers to find and help the wounded on the battlefield. Scroll down for video . Photographs depicting soldiers in World War One posing with the dogs they kept as pets and messengers have been uncovered, including this one of a Staff Sergeant (Horse Farrier) of the Army Service Corps (ASC) with the Corps pet dogs, Hissy and Jack, in France in 1916 . Around 20,000 dogs are believed to have been involved in the World War One - a testament to Britain's affection for dogs. The series of intimate pictures betrays the high regard placed on the animals - which were vital as the war moved to the trenches, either in providing comfort to soldiers or helping with tactics to foil the enemy. Dogs were used for a variety of purposes during World War One and later became known as the 'unsung heroes' of the war. The animals were used a lot by German troops and increasingly by the British and French - with troops training intelligent agile dogs such as Doberman Pinschers to carry messages and even seek out the wounded. In fact they became so important that in the early months of 1917, to hone the animals’ skills, the War Office formed the War Dog School of Instruction in Hampshire. Some were used as sentinel dogs, kept on a short leash to accompany guards on the top of the trench. They were trained to give a warning signal if an unknown person entered a secure area, so subtle the enemy would not have realised they had been detected. Dogs performed a number of vital roles for soldiers, acting as scouts and seeking out the wounded. The animals were highly regarded by their owners, such as Officers, Warrant Officers, Staff Sergeants, of the Army Service Corps (ASC) who pose with their company dog in 1917 . Dogs were quicker, more agile and smaller making them efficient messengers during World War One, like this dog pictured in France in 1918 . Others were used to act as scouts. Able to detect enemy scent up to 1000 yards away, these dogs were trained to run ahead searching for alien scents and give subtle signals to troops, such as straightening their tails or raising their backs, when an enemy was approaching. Companies also trained dogs to find the wounded on the battlefield and even carry messages. The animals were seen as more efficient than human messengers, able to cover greater distances and any terrain. They also presented less of a target to enemies and were able to carry messages from the first line of fighting troops to commanding officers in the rear. British forces also developed a technique used by the Germans in the 1800s to use dogs to help the wounded. Animals were typically equipped with simple medical supplies so soldiers found by them could make an attempt to treat their own wounds. German officers used many dogs during the war, often as messengers and to seek out the wounded, and are seen posing behind the lines at Le Cateau, France during Christmas 1916 (left), while two German Other Ranks officers were pictured posing with four puppies (right) Dogs brought soldiers and civilians together during the war, with civilians posing proudly with the animals in August 1915 alongside four soldiers - most of whom were from the Wiltshire Regiment (left), while a Corporal of the Worcestershire Regiment is with his dog (right) in 1917 . As life in the trenches became bleaker, some dogs were simply used as pets or mascots. The animals were seen as a psychological comfort to soldiers which could temporarily take away the torment of life in the trenches. They were also useful at removing rats and other pests, making life slightly more comfortable. A number of stray dogs were given to the army by organisations such as Battersea Dogs Home, after their usefulness to troops was recognised. The tradition of the military using dogs has continued, with the US military currently having a force of around 2,500 animals - some of which have been used in Afghanistan and Iraq. Ms Hall, 73, has been collecting photos of dogs since 1966 and She stumbled across the collection of dog photos, featuring soldiers during World War One, at a local market. Dogs are seen as man's best friend and were treated with respect during the war, seated for tea with two German officers in 1917 . The 209th (Norfolk) Field Company, Royal Engineers, of the 34th Division, pose with their dog - a vital member of the team during the war . She found out the photographs were destined for the skip and decided to buy the entire set to save it. Her latest collection is now the largest of dog photos, taken during World War One, and is being exhibited in London. She said: 'My collecting began by chance. 'I was a press photographer and discovered that a local junk shop in Dalston doing house clearances was simply throwing away old photographs. A member of the Swedish Navy poses with his dog in around 1915 - an example of how dogs were often kept as pets as a form of comfort . Dogs had a variety of uses during the war, from being companions to messengers and collecting much needed funds like this Airedale . Dogs were often used as mascots during wartime, and Bruce - a Rough Collie - was used by Moseley Road fire station in Birmingham in 1914 . 'I persuaded them to let me have them, really just to save them from the dustbin. 'I have lived with dogs all my life and began to be intrigued by the photographs that had dogs in them.' Libby started collecting pictures of dogs in 1966 and chose a selection of them appearing in the 1914-18 war to display in the exhibition. The exhibition is being held at Bishopsgate Institute, in Spitalfields, as a show entitled Dogs of the First World War. Entry is free and it runs until June 26. In ancient times the Greeks and Romans regularly used dogs as sentries during times of war, and sometimes the animals were taken into battle. Attila the Hun used powerful Molosser dogs in his campaigns, while the Spanish Conquistadors were said to have used armoured dogs that had been trained to kill. The soldiers set the dogs on natives as they travelled the globe conquering territories. In the U.S. the American pit bull terrier was used in the Civil War both as a means of protection for soldiers and to send messages. The dogs also appeared on propaganda and recruiting posters in the U.S. during World War I. In recent years in the U.S., some troops in Afghanistan and Iraq have been accompanied by military working dogs. The animals are paired with a handler after being trained for detection work, such as helping to search for survivors after an explosion.","Previously unseen photographs of soldiers posing with their dogs during World War One have been uncovered .

"A British solicitor has claimed that ‘Jihadi John’ gatecrashed her daughter’s wedding. According to court documents, Mohammed Emwazi used 22-year-old Gina Morgan’s wedding in 2011 as cover for a secret meeting with members of his terror network. But Ms Morgan’s mother, Jacqueline Nuth, 53, suggested Emwazi wasn’t invited. She said: ‘I’ve no connection to him and my daughter has no connection to him. The veiled woman at Ms Nuth's home (left) declined to speak to reporters over claims Mohammed Emwazi (right) attended the solicitor's daughter's wedding as a cover for a terror meeting in 2011 . 'It’s absolute rubbish. None of my family have anything to do with him.’ According to the court papers, her daughter’s wedding to an Egyptian Muslim was held at the home of the wife of a terror suspect referred to as ‘CE’, who once spent time at an Al Qaeda training camp. Emwazi turned up with another man, Mohammed Mekki, and is then thought to have discussed ‘extremist activity’ with CE. The papers state that Ms Nuth ‘describes as “absurd” the suggestion that extremist activity was discussed’. However they note that ‘Ms Nuth left shortly after the arrival of Mekki and Emwazi at about 10pm and so cannot speak of what occurred after her departure’. Later that year all three men were described in court as supplying funds and equipment to Somalian terrorists. Ms Nuth told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I don’t want to get drawn into all this. What was said in court was confidential. As a solicitor I do not want to compromise my position.’ It is believed her daughter, now 26, is living at Ms Nuth’s West London home, having spent time in Egypt. Yesterday a woman in a niqab arrived at the flat but declined to speak to a reporter. It also emerged last night that Emwazi may have collected money for jihad from friends and neighbours in London, under the pretence of fundraising for Syria. The 26-year-old entered Syria some time after the wedding where he has taken on the role as the masked executioner of its propaganda videos . The jihadi was raised in North West London (above) with by his Kuwaiti father and alongside siblings .","Mohammed Emwazi attended wedding of 22-year-old Gina Morgan in 2011 .

"The region of Molina de Aragon, in Spain, is as barren as it is beautiful. Since the 1950s and continuing through to today, the process of de-industrialisation and de-population has left behind a vast region of Central Eastern Spain that is infamous for its staggeringly low number of inhabitants. In fact, there are so few people who live in these particular municipalities that the area now competes with Siberia and the Arctic provinces of Lapland as the least populated zone in Europe. Spanish photographer, David Ramos, captured images of the de-industrialisation and de-population occurring in Central Eastern Spain . Despite the barren landscape, agriculture and ranching remain the main economic sources all around the vast region. The square footage of the underpopulated Central region is as large as Austria, and just two hours drive from Madrid. Quickly becoming known as Europe's largest desert - at least in terms of population - the area is made up of the provinces of Soria, Guadalajara, Teruel and Cuenca. And the population that remains is aging. Currently, 41 percent of the whole population is over 65 years of age, while a shocking eight per cent is under the age of 15. Three crosses are seen outside the village of Luzon near Molina de Aragon, Spain, which is the least populated zone in Europe . Here, a mastiff sits among sheep as they graze near the village of Codes, which is also near Molina de Aragon, Spain . An abandoned house is spotted in the village of Iruecha, where agriculture and ranching are the main economic sectors in the region . Felix Martinez, aged 75, poses for a portrait as he lops apple trees near the village of Rillo de Gallo, near Molina de Aragon, in Spain . Mari Angeles Moreno and her son Juan Romero wait for the school bus outside the village of Selas so that Juan can travel 68 km to class . Juan Romero, for example, is the only boy in the village of Selas, a municipality located in the province of Guadalajara. The school is Selas was shut down in 1974 and moved to Molina de Aragon, which is the largest village in the region, with a population of 3,706. Every weekday, Juan has to travel 68 km to get to school. According to official figures, the area has 1.63 inhabitants for every square kilometre, compared to the 1.8 of Laponia and 3 inhabitants for every square kilometre in Siberia. However, Javier Munoz, the former mayor of Selas, points out that these figures could be even lower than suggested because the official census does not represent the actual population of the villages. The vast, barren landscape is hauntingly beautiful outside the village of Luzon in Central Eastern Spain . A mare looks on in the village of Selas, Spain, which, as of 2012, had a population of just 63 inhabitants .

He's also been awarded with top international prizes for his work, such as the World Press Photo and Feature of the Year by Getty Images.","Near Molina de Aragon in Central Eastern Spain, there are only 1.63 inhabitants for every square kilometre .

"Collapsed roofs, mangled cages and sunken floors - these are the eerie pictures taken inside an abandoned psychiatric hospital where patients were once locked up and given lobotomies. The abandoned site in north Wales, known as Denbigh Asylum, has been partially devastated by fire while there are still cages intact that were used to prevent patients escaping from their designated areas. More than 20 patients were selected for prefrontal lobotomy treatments between 1942 and 1944 at the hospital, with one patient dying from the controversial procedure. Lobotomies, which consisted of the removal of parts of the brain, began to be routinely carried out in the 1930s as a supposed treatment for those considered insane - but the barbaric practice was stopped two decades later with the introduction of antipsychotic medicines. The once eloquent and imposing building was built in 1848 and designed by architect Thomas Full James. It was designated for closure by MP Enoch Powell in 1960 and was finally shut for good in 1995. Photographer Mathew Growcoot described the scene: 'It was by far the creepiest place I have ever been into. There were so many strange noises emanating from the buildings that I really didn't want to wander too far from my companion. 'At one point we both heard what sounded like a groan and just stopped and stared at each other. I don't believe in ghosts but I didn't want to hang around.' The site has been subject to a compulsory purchase order by Denbighshire council. But that is being appealed by the site's current owners. The front facade is Grade II listed and a proposal to build homes around the entrance has been put forward. However, the restoration cost is set to be close to a million pounds. Mr Growcoot added: 'It was in a really poor state. It looked as thought a bomb had tore through the site, everything was damaged. There was nothing to stop you entering the site and as a result the vandalism and fire damage was plain to see. 'I wonder how far a million pounds would go to restoring the hospital. Seems as though it would make more sense to flatten the site and start over.' Scroll down for video .

"It started as an easy way to pay to park a car when you ran out of coins, or a strategy to avoid long queues as bus drivers desperately searched for change. . But now the system of paying to park using your mobile phone, follow the trend of using passes instead of cash on buses, could be the latest sign that Britain is moving towards a cashless system. Brighton and Hove Council has announced it will scrap half of its coin operated parking meters in favour of people using their phones to pay for and top up their car parking. Scroll down for video . Britain appears to be moving towards a cashless society with payments by card and mobile phone predicted to outstrip those made using coins and notes for the first time this year, as Brighton becomes the latest authority to use the method as it announced it would be scrapping coin-operated parking meters . The council, which estimates it will save £250,000 from the move according to the Observer, is the latest to implement the cashless way to pay. This is already used on buses across the country where cash is no longer accepted, and particularly in London, as well as in a number of work canteens that operate card-only systems of payment. The popularity of non-cash payments has also been seen on the streets with an unemployed man travelling to Mayfair armed with a card machine so people can give him money using their cards. Britain is on track to make more non-cash payments - defined as paying by card, cheque, direct debit, standing order and mobile phone - than cash for the first time in 2015, according to predictions by the Payments Council. This year non-cash transactions are expected to reach 19.9billion, outstripping the predicted 19billion cash exchanges.  This is forecast to happen at some point in 2015because while cash payments are remaining fairly constant, the number of non-cash payments has been steadily increasing. The growth in online shopping and the rise of new, innovative ways to pay have led to consumers turning to a growing range of payment options in recent years. Some have predicted the end of coin-operated marking meters (right) could spell the end of cash . About three-quarters of Britons now shop online, compared with just over half in 2008, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures released last year. In Brighton councillors have decided to remove half of its coin-operated parking meters because of the popularity of doing this through mobile phones and the ease of its use. The move by Brighton and Hove Council follows similar methods such as only accepting payments by card and oyster card on buses in London (left) as well as the launch of the Barclays pingit app (right) Ian Davey, a transport councillor in Brighton, said: 'It's actually a lot easier than messing about getting the right change. You can also top up your parking time remotely if you need to stay longer, which is a lot easier than walking back to the car.' And  Damien Preston-Booth travels 200 miles every day to Mayfair in London to sit outside an London restaurant and beg, using his wireless card machine. The 37-year-old travels by bus, train or rental car from Preston in Lancashire to Mayfair and spends Thursdays to Sundays taking cash from passers-by and card payments from 'regulars'. Damien Preston-Booth, 37, commutes from Preston to London to beg in Mayfair armed with his own chip and machine, and is pictured here taking money from Simon Cowell and offering him a sweet in return . Contactless payments have also had a significant boost in the last year, with £2.32 billion spent using the method in 2014. This was more than three times the total value of contactless spending the previous year. Contactless payments can be used on transactions worth up to £20, and the limit is due to be increased to £30. And in another move towards getting rid of cash, Barclaycard has launched a 'ping-it' app where people can make payments in a similar way to sending a text message. The bank also revealed it is developing pairs of contactless 'tap and pay'  gloves, which people can use by swiping the back of their hand on the reader at the till, in a similar way to making contactless card payments. Damien Preston-Booth, 37, is believed to be on Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for his depression, which could earn him up to £108 a week. The Government allows ESA to be paid to people of working age who are too ill to work because of a health condition or disability. You must be under state pension age, not getting statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay and not receiving any jobseeker's allowance. In order to qualify you will have be assessed and after that can earn another £104 a week on top of your benefits for certain types of work. But Mr Preston-Booth's  begging - which is illegal in Britain and punishable by a £1,000 fine - could be considered benefit fraud. The Department for Work and Pensions told MailOnline it never comments on individual cases. However a spokesman said: 'Benefit fraud is a crime and our fraud investigaters will look into all suspected cases. 'If you suspect someone of claiming benefits fraudulently you can report it to the Benefit Fraud Hotline on National Benefit Fraud Hotline 0800 854 440'. Richard Koch, head of policy at the UK Cards Association, said: 'Instead of having pockets full of coins or carrying wads of notes, people are increasingly choosing their cards instead. 'Three in every four pounds spent in British shops is now paid with cards and we're all using them for smaller purchases too. 'It's the rise in convenient contactless payments for lower sums and smaller transactions online which in particular are changing the way we choose to pay.' And the amount we spend with cash is dwindling too, with the British Retail Consortium estimating we now spend an average of £9.47 in coins and notes. However the Payments Council said the popularity of cashless payments do not spell the end of Britain's monetary system in its entirety. While card and other non cash payments will continue to become popular, the council predicts that by 2023 we will still be making 12.9 transactions using coins and notes. This will be significantly lower than the 27.5 billion transactions without cash that are expected. Mark Bowerman, a spokesman for the Payments Council, said cash is still a vital payment method for many consumers, with students, people who need to tightly control their budgets, older people and people with a disability being particularly high users of cash. He said: 'We are not forecasting that cash will disappear. 'Cash is widely used for day-to-day purchases by virtually everyone and for some people (around 3.5 million) cash is the only method that is used.'","Brighton and Hove Council is scrapping half of its coin-fed parking meters .

"Kathryn Beale, 41, who makes smoothies from raw placenta is being investigated by public health officials . A mother-of-two who makes smoothies from raw human placenta is being investigated by public health officials. Kathryn Beale produces the drinks for new mothers from their own afterbirths for around £25 each. The 41-year-old insists the smoothies, produced as soon after the delivery as possible, are perfectly safe and that they have many  benefits. But health officials, worried about potential 'serious health risks', attempted to gain an emergency court order banning them. They were unsuccessful, but Ms Beale has offered to stop making the drinks pending a visit from officials to inspect her hygiene standards. 'Most species of mammal eat their own placenta straight after birth, raw - it is normal in the animal kingdom,' said Ms Beale from Swindon, Wiltshire. 'We are unusual in that we don't routinely do it. It is full of iron, stem cells and hormones and is reputed to help with milk production and post-natal depression.' For the placenta smoothies Ms Beale visits the new mother in their own home or private hospital room as soon after the birth as possible. She puts a couple of pound-coin sized pieces of the placenta into the blender and mixes it with fruit, including berries and bananas. What is left can then be dehydrated, ground into powder and put into capsules for the new mother to take. She can also create the pills, which cost around £150, using the Chinese method. This involves the placenta being steamed with lemon, ginger and chilli and it is believed to have enhanced healing properties. The capsules are Ms Beale's most popular product. Ms Bearle got involved in consumption of placentas - known as placentophagy - two years ago after meeting the founder of the Independent Placenta Encapsulation Network. She only makes placenta products for mothers who provide their own organ for processing. She explained: 'Women who want to use their placentas are tested during pregnancy, and if we know the placenta carries any blood-born pathogens we will not use it.' Ms Beale, pictured left, and a placenta smoothie, pictured right, made with banana, blueberries, strawberries and apple juice . Last week Swindon Council went to court seeking a hygiene emergency prohibition order against her but it was not granted as she had no future clients booked. Instead, public protection officials will visit her home next week to check on what she is doing. 'I have voluntarily stopped taking bookings until they approve everything.' she the mother-of-two, who is still breast feeding her second daughter born in 2010. Raw placenta sliced and ready to be dehydrated, pictured left, and placenta wrapped in its own amniotic sac, pictured right, ready to be steamed over green chili, lemon and ginger, in line with the traditional Chinese medicine . 'I am assuming I will get a food hygiene rating, provided they do not decide to close me down. 'I do not believe I am doing anything that puts myself or the public in any danger. There are more than 50 people around the UK doing the same thing. 'When I do this it is a more time-consuming process because I have to follow the right procedures and constantly wash my hands. 'Mums will often take theirs' home and cook it or bury it in the garden. 'If I am doing it at least it is safer, because it needs to be thoroughly dehydrated to kill all the germs.' Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow have used placentas for their supposed health benefits. One Direction star Harry Styles also dabbled in the fad when he had a luxury sheep placenta facial. Ms Beale also makes umbilical cord keepsakes which are made by shaping the umbilical cord into either a spiral or a heart-shape and dehydrating it until it becomes translucent shades of gold and red. Swindon Borough Council said: 'We can confirm Public Protection officers attended court on Tuesday, March 10 seeking a hygiene emergency prohibition order in respect of raw human placenta practices. The order was not granted on this occasion. 'Our investigations continue and we are therefore unable to comment further at this stage. 'While the health benefits of this activity are not clear, the processes involved in the production of human placenta for human consumption present a number of potentially serious health risks, which explains this action.'

"An Australian woman who contracted a life-threatening infection after a breast implant procedure at a Thai hospital, later requiring a partial double mastectomy, said she was 'butchered' by cosmetic surgeons. Ms O'Keefe chose a $7,500 cosmetic surgery tourism package  as a reward to herself after losing 35kg and her breasts appearing 'like pancakes'. She said she was told she was going to have 'the best time of her life'. But Ms O'Keefe said she was shocked at the result of the operation. 'I've been absolutely butchered,' she said.

With implants: Courtney O'Keefe is pictured here, with her implants, after spending more than six months in hospital for a deadly infection. Ms O'Keefe has since had the implants removed and a double mastectomy, but still has a long path of reconstructive surgery ahead . After they were taken out: This picture shows Ms O'Keefe's breasts after her implants were extracted from her body. She will receive re-constructive surgery from the Cosmetic Institute in Sydney, who have stumped up to assist her . Ms O'Keefe is pictured here following her double mastectomy, holding both of her implants in each hand. The implants were removed on December 17. Ms O'Keefe has not worked since she was struck down by the infection . Ms O'Keefe said she was in 'agony' upon returning to Australia and her mother whisked her to hospital shortly after she arrived back home in Perth. 'We went straight to Armidale Emergency,' she said. 'I was there for 5 minutes and she admitted me up to a room. 'I was in an isolation room becaues they didnt have any clue what I had... They swabbed, and it took four days to figure out what it was.' It was the beginning of a six month ordeal, with Ms O'Keefe spending time at both Armidale and Fremantle hospitals. She was diagnosed with the rare bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, which the Centre for Disease Control said is often contracted by patients in hospital, particularly those with wounds from surgery or hooked up to medical devices. Ms O'Keefe is pictured here after her stay in hospital, when she still had implants . Her condition worsened. 'It was also turning septic and was starting to shut down my liver, my kidneys, my heart, my brain,' she said. 'Mum and Dad had to come and say goodbye to me twice,' said Ms O'Keefe. Doctors called in respected specialists to treat the condition, and they concocted a special substance to fight it. A PIC (peripherally inserted central catheter) was installed inside her so she could receive a constant stream of antibiotics. On December 17, 2014, nearly a year after her ordeal, surgeons removed her implants because the infection had returned. Because the infection had spread to her surrounding tissue, both her breasts were also removed. 'I will never be able to life a normal life': Ms O'Keefe is pictured following the surgery to remove both of her breasts . But her ordeal is not completely over. Ms O'Keefe has suffered kidney and liver problems because of the medication required to treat her infection. She told Daily Mail Australia she had coughed up blood and that doctors said she may require surgery if she does not improve. She lost her job and has not worked since the ordeal began. She had to move back in with her mother. And she's devastated. 'I'm never going to live a normal life,' she said. Ms O'Keefe urged Australians examining plastic surgery overseas to reconsider. 'Someone said it to me a couple of weeks ago. If you wouldn't drink the water there why the hell would you have surgery there. That's so true. So true.'

The man behind a new book promises to show you how to take back a little bit of peace, space and all-important calm in just a few simple steps. The book, which is rather fittingly called Calm, contains the simple tools, tricks and habits that he believes will change the rest your life. A new book promises to show you how to take back a little bit of peace, space and all-important calm in just a few simple steps . Anxiety affects one in six people in the UK with am estimated 70 per cent of GP visits being due to stress-related issues. According to author Michael Acton Smith, we can do little things every single day to combat this. His book combines extracts from neurological research with wisdom from history's great thinkers and the real-life experiences of individuals across the globe. From how you decorate your house to changing your computer password, FEMAIL has selected the best bits from Calm to help you live a more successful life. 1. Change your password, change your life How many times a day do you re-enter your computer password? Having to change our passwords constantly is one of the exasperating necessities of office life. But what if you were to reappropriate your password, using it instead as a modern-day mantra to help you ensure you remain mindful of whatever it is you most want to achieve? This could be BU!LDNEWFRI3NDSHIPS or SAVE4SKIING. The joy of it is that you can alter it every month if you like. It's an opportunity to repeatedly hit your subconscious with a mindful reminder. 2. Nature meditation Sit in a quiet space. Imagine you are sat beneath a tree in the middle of a field or forest beneath a large, leafy tree with strong branches. Smell the rich soil and clean air. Listen to the wind rustling through the leaves and notice if you hear any birds or animals stirring within. Visualise the tree's leaves, branches and trunk, then picture yourself reaching out to touch it. Feel the texture of the bark. Imagine the tree drinking up the water through its complex root system. Visualise the lengthening, spreading branches, and the leaves opening towards the sun. 3. Create a sleep-friendly bedroom Keep your bedroom decor simple and calm. Avoid clutter, which can trigger your stress response, and make sure work papers are out of sight. Changing your password to something useful or calming is an opportunity to repeatedly hit your subconscious with a mindful reminder . 4. Invest in blue furnishings Opt for blue walls, or flashes of blue in soft furnishings: looking at this colour can lead to a drop in heart rate and blood pressure, and gentle blue hues are widely believed to have a sleep-inducing effect. 5. Keep a notepad or journal by your bed Then, instead of lying awake, worried you will forget something in the morning, you can write it down and allow the thought to pass. Opt for blue walls, or flashes of blue in soft furnishings: looking at this colour can lead to a drop in heart rate and blood pressure . 6. Imagine a nature scene If your'e struggling to get to sleep, try imagining a tranquil natural scene, whether it's a bucolic rural landscape or the gently lapping waves of the shore of a beautiful lake. Researchers from the University of Oxford found that when volunteers imagined such scenes, they fell asleep an average of twenty minutes earlier than those who didn't use the technique. 7. Design your dream island If you were to design a whole island for yourself, a place that had the specific purpose of helping you to feel as calm as possible, what would you put on it? Write about it and draw it. Revisit this place whenever you get stressed, embellishing the details and adding new, calming features over time. 8. Make a list of the ten people who make you happiest This list could be anyone from friends to inspiring writers or thinkers. Look at it regularly (why not take a snap on your phone to keep it to hand), and whenever you feel stress kick in, pick up your phone and call one, or open a book to absorb their wisdom. 9. Let out a sigh An emphatic 'aaah' or 'ommmm' will combat the restricted feeling that sometimes settles in your chest at the end of a stressful day, and the vibration and deep breath will energise you. 10. Three things that make you happy Every night before you go to bed, write a list of three things that made you happy that day. If you have a child, ask them to do it. It's a great way to reinforce a healthy self-image and a positive mindset, and ensure they go to sleep with happy thoughts in their heads. It has the added benefit that you get to hear a bit about their day and the things that genuinely bring them joy. 11. Eat a single square of chocolate mindfully Eat a square of chocolate so mindfully that you pay attention to everything, from the sounds of the wrapper to the smell of it and the feeling against your tongue. Focussing on taste in this way forces your sense to wake up. 12. Wear a blue ribbon A blue ribbon is a simple symbol of calm that can bring you back to what you've learned when you find yourself slipping (the book even comes with one you can cut out). Speaking about his book and accompanying app, Michael Acton Smith OBE, who is CEO and founder of kids entertainment company Mind Candy, the creators of global kids phenomenon Moshi Monsters, said: 'Regular meditation is medically proven to be good for you - it increases focus and creativity, productivity and job satisfaction, mental and even physical health. The book, right, and app, which was penned by Michael Acton Smith OBE, who is CEO and founder of kids entertainment company Mind Candy, the creators of global kids phenomenon Moshi Monsters, suggests simple tips like eating chocolate mindfully, left . 'But in reality most of us don't have time to sit on a cushion with our eyes closed for half an hour every day. And many people associate meditation with hard work and huge lifestyle shifts: you might be imagining Buddhist monks locked in a mountain retreat and living off gruel... 'This is where Calm comes in. Calm is about simple, achievable habits that work with the demands of your busy life instead of pretending those demands don't exist. Calm does not require specialist training: it uses abilities that every single one of us is born with, like creativity, spontaneity and simply noticing the world around you. 'Calm is not a set of rules that you need to worry about following or breaking. It is inspirational, practical and non-prescriptive. Onerous, time-consuming meditation might seem out of reach but everyone can achieve calm - including you.'","Calm book written by Michael Acton Smith OBE .

"The Greek government has proposed hiring tourists to help uncover tax dodging businesses in holiday resorts as part of its efforts to rescue the country’s shattered finances. Holidaymakers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so-called ‘onlookers’ carrying hidden cameras and recorders to catch tax dodgers. The plan, which met with immediate mockery from critics, emerged in a leaked letter sent by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis to the President of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem, which outlines a range of reforms for the Greek economy. Revelation: The unusual plan emerged in a leaked letter sent by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (above) to the President of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem . In the letter Essex-University educated Varoufakis said: ‘The culture of tax avoidance runs deep within Greek society.’ Arguing that tax authorities were overstretched, he suggests hiring ‘large numbers of non-professional inspectors’ to spread fear among tax-avoiders. The plan would involve basic training for the amateur tax sleuths who would be ‘wired for sound and video.’ The inspectors, who would operate across the country with tourists most suitable for spying on resort areas, would not be able to confront tax dodgers or have any authority to carry out checks but the evidence they collected could be used in prosecutions. The inspectors would be hired for a maximum of two months and would not be re-hired. Varoufakis, finance minister of the new left-wing Syriza government in Greece, claims the move would create a new climate in the country. Secret filming: Holiday makers could be recruited alongside students and housewives to form an army of so-called ‘onlookers’ carrying hidden cameras . ‘The very news that thousands of casual ‘onlookers’ are everywhere, bearing audio and video recording equipment on behalf of the tax authorities, has the capacity to shift attitudes very quickly spreading a sense of justice across society and engendering a new tax compliance culture,’ Varoufakis writes in his letter. The idea however has met with derision from some quarters with one unnamed European official quoted as saying the plan was ‘hilarious’. The letter is the Greek Government’s detailed response to a request from its European partners to provide a list of reforms for its economy, a promise agreed by Varoufakis last month in return for an extension of its current bail-out pending further talks. The tax spy proposal is one of seven reforms proposed by Varoufakis, which will be considered by Eurozone finance ministers on Monday. Other measures include taxing gambling, improving existing budget and tax collecting systems and creating a Fiscal Council which would act as an independent overseer of state spending. Laws to create the Fiscal Council were passed by the previous Greek Government but have yet to be put into practice.","Holiday makers could be recruited alongside students and housewives .

"The Melbourne Islamic State jihadi who had his bloodied dead body posted on social media had reportedly committed a string of criminal offences before he fled to the Middle East. New details have emerged that Suhan Rahman, who was killed while fighting in Syria last week, was sentenced to 80 hours of community service for attempting to pervert the course of justice and witness intimidation in 2013, according to The Australian. The 23-year-old, who was previously pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar, also faced a number of charges including assault and unlicensed driving, where he was hit with a $1000 fine. Melbourne Suhan Rahman was reportedly a convicted criminal before he fled the country for the Middle East . The revelation comes just less than a week after a woman claiming to be the wife posted her deceased husband Rahman on Twitter, announcing that he had been killed fighting for the IS. His twisted wife said: ‘May Allah accept my husband, Abu Jihad al Australi.’ ‘Promised Allah and fought in the front lines until he obtained shahadah,’ she added. Rahman, who had been fighting under the name Abu Jihad al Australi, previously threatened a terrorist attack on Australia claiming he would 'bring the war home' to the west in January. ‘Spill blood young Aussies,’ he wrote on Twitter. His last known location was Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in Syria. The woman, named Zumarul Jannah, who claimed to be his wife said: ‘Alhamdulillahi rabbil alimeen, I'm the most content I have ever been in my life ♡.’ A researcher at the London based terrorist research centre ICSR posted this photo of Rahman on Twitter . A woman claiming to be Suhan Rahman's wife posted a bloodied photo of her dead husband on Twitter. A rifle was placed on his body . The woman who claimed to be Rahman's wife said: 'I'm the most content I have ever been in my life.' ‘And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead,’ she added. She also posted a photo of a man that looks like Rahman praying. The 23-year-old was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar earlier this year and was also friends with playboy Melbourne jihadi Mahmoud Abdullatif. Rahman and Abdullatif regularly conversed via Twitter before Abdullatif was reported dead in January. In November Rahman confessed to Abdullatif it was his ‘first time using twitter its tripping out bruv [sic]’. Abdullatif replied: ‘Lol I know I still don’t how to use it.’ The woman asked for Allah to 'accept' her husband, who she called Abu Jihad al Australi . The 23-year-old (left) was pictured with Sydney terrorist Mohamed Elomar (right) earlier this year . ‘Ye how do I retweet to others and what duz dat mean.’ Rahman asked. ‘I’ll explain when I come home insha Allah,’ Abdullatif responded. Along with his recent postings on Twitter, Rahman also uploaded one photograph of himself wielding a high-powered silver rifle AK47. Referencing the terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hedbo in January, where two Islamist gunmen killed editor Stéphane Charbonnier and 11 other people, Rahman wrote: 'May allah accept the french brothers who terrorised france. Allahu akbar. Day by day we will bring the war home to you.’ His previous posts painted a keen young reveller at Melbourne nightclubs who enjoyed partying with his mates, rap music and fast cars but in recent months, he has taken an eerie turn. Rahman's family made a desperate plea for him to return home in January after his father Lutfur Rahman alerted authorities that he was fighting with IS, The Daily Telegraph reports. A woman claiming to be Rahman's wife posted this photo of a man that looks like him praying . Abdullatif and Rahman chatted about how they didn't know how to use Twitter back in November 2014 . Mr Rahman was told by the Australian Federal Police Counter-Terrorism Squad that they were monitoring his son's every movement overseas. His father has been left distraught after learning his son's decision when he slipped out of the country with three other men to go to Syria. 'We hoped that he would never get into this type of thing,' his father has told the Daily Telegraph. 'Everything was OK then suddenly he just left the country.'","Suhan Rahman has been revealed as a convicted criminal, report says .

"A Philadelphia police officer was fatally shot Thursday during an attempted robbery at a GameStop on the city's north side. Officer Robert Wilson III, 30, was shopping for a present for his son and in full uniform inside a North Philadelphia GameStop when two armed men entered the store and announced a robbery, ThePhiladelphia Inquirer reports. Wilson immediately confronted the suspects, and the three exchanged gunfire, with the assailants firing rounds at close range on either side of the officer, Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey said in a news conference Thursday. Officer: Philadelphia Police Officer Robert Wilson III, 30 (photographed), died Thursday after being shot in the head during an attempted robbery at a video-game store on the city's north side . Wilson was struck multiple times but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head, Ramsey said. Wilson's partner was outside of the store and exchanged fire with one of the assailants. The second assailant fled and attempted to blend in with the crowd but was caught at the scene. One was shot in the leg, Ramsey said, but it is unclear if the assailant was shot by Wilson or his partner. They were identified as Ramone Williams, 26, and Carlton Hipps, 30. Wilson was rushed to Temple University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6.25pm, NBC reports. Wilson was an eight-year veteran of the department, a husband, and a father of two. GameStop: Wilson was in full uniform inside a North Philadelphia GameStop (photographed) as part of his patrol duties when two armed men entered the store and announced a robbery . Struck: Wilson was struck multiple times but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head (here, Wilson's body is transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office) Procession: A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office . Never Forgotten: Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten' 'Take a moment and say a prayer for this family,' Ramsey said. 'And this 9-year-old boy who will now grow up without a father. A 1-year-old is going to grow up without a dad because of what happened today.' Authorities later found the suspect's weapons in the store: a .40-caliber and a 9mm. Police say the brothers were repeat offenders and one was on parole at the time of the shooting. The suspect who was shot was taken to a local hospital but his condition has not been released, NBC reports. Wilson was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting, Ramsey said. However, a surveillance camera in the store captured the incident. The video has been reviewed by homicide investigators. A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office. At the news conference, Ramsey said he knew the officer and described Wilson as a 'very, very brave, heroic individual.' 'People tend to lose sight of the dangers inherent in being a police officer,' Ramsey said. 'Sometimes they're seriously injured or even murdered as a result of trying to protect every single person in this city...He put his life on the line to make Philadelphia a better city and a safer city.' Volunteer: Wilson (left) was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting .

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement offering his condolences to Wilson's family and his colleagues. 'This senseless act is devastating and a stark reminder of the danger faced everyday by our brave men and women in uniform,' Wolf said. 'Across Pennsylvania, members of law enforcement and our first responders put their lives on the line to protect our families and our communities. We can never forget their selfless service and sacrifice.' Wilson is the fifth Philadelphia Police officer to die due to a gun shot wound since 2007, according to the Fraternal Order of Police.","Officer Robert Wilson III died Thursday after being shot in the head during an attempted robbery in North Philadelphia .

"IKEA has banned people from playing hide and seek in its stores after several Facebook-organised games amassed tens of thousands of participants. More than 19,000 people have signed up to participate in a game at an Amsterdam IKEA store and another 32,000 at a shop in Eindhoven, forcing management to ban the event citing safety concerns. The bizarrely popular events were inspired by the success of a game held in a Belgium store last year in which 500 adults participated and were discovered hiding in fridges, cupboards and underneath piles of soft toys. More than 32,000 people were planning to play a game of hide and seek at an IKEA store in Eindhoven next month, forcing management to ban the game. File image used . In banning the game, Ikea spokesperson Martina Smedberg told Bloomberg it was simply too difficult to control. She said: 'We need to make sure people are safe in our stores and that's hard to do if we don't even know where they are.' The carefully orchestrated games had begun spiralling out of control - its burgeoning popularity has already spread to the Czech Republic and Australia where more games are being organised. The cancellation of the games, which were to be held in April and May, has now left participants scrambling to find alternative shopping mall and retail locations. The idea of using an Ikea store for an adult game of hide and seek has been mooted for years, given the furniture stores' abundance of adult-sized hiding places. An organiser of last year's Belgium game, Elise De Rijck, told Bloomberg this was because the stores were like an 'extremely large living room'.","IKEA has banned adults from playing  hide and seek in its furniture stores .

"The cover for Harper Lee's new novel will surely remind you of the cover for her old one. On Wednesday, HarperCollins unveiled the jacket art for Lee's Go Set a Watchman, the unexpected follow-up to her classic To Kill a Mockingbird. The new cover, like the one for 1960's To Kill a Mockingbird, is a moody illustration featuring an oak tree in front. The art for Go Set a Watchman also shows train tracks and a train in the distance. In a statement released by HarperCollins, company President Michael Morrison noted that Go Set a Watchman begins with Mockingbird protagonist Scout Finch returning by train 20 years later, in the 1950s, to her native Alabama. Revealed: Publisher Harper Collins have released the official cover for Go Set a Watchman, set to be released July 14 (US jacket pictured left). It is the first novel from Pulitzer Prize-winner author Harper Lee since To Kill A Mockingbird in 1960 . HarperCollins has announced a first printing of two million copies and a July 14 publication date. However the release of the book has been mired with controversy since the publisher confirmed it in February. The announcement came just three months after the death of Lee's older sister, lawyer and gatekeeper, Alice Lee. Harper and Alice Lee lived together at a nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama. Alice was 103 when she died on November 17. Lee once described her sister Alice as 'Atticus in a skirt', referring to her beloved Mockingbird character Atticus Finch, which is believed to have originally been inspired by the women's father. Lee retreated into an intensely private life following the fame that To Kill A Mockingbird garnered her and repeatedly refused to publish another novel, maintaining her stance for over 50 years. Some in Monroeville subsequently question whether the 88-year-old was capable of now consenting to the second novel's publication. A longtime friend came forward claiming Lee is mostly deaf, blind and in poor health. Others questioned whether her mental health was sound enough to make such a decision. However, after launching an investigation, Alabama Securities Commission Director Joseph Borg said earlier this month his agency reviewed the matter at the Department of Human Resources' request, and that Lee answered questions to an investigator's satisfaction. They have since closed the case. Sameness: The cover for Lee's second book is much like her first, 1960's Pulitzer prize-winning piece To Kill A Mockingbird. Pictured right is the UK jacket of the upcoming book . A high-ranking state official said DHR opened its investigation after the second novel's announcement. The status of the DHR investigation was unclear. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The New York Times reported that investigators interviewed staff at The Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides, as well as friends and acquaintances. A doctor who asked to remain anonymous said he had filed a complaint after knowing Lee for two years and believing her infirm. Investigation: Earlier this month, staff at The Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides in Monroeville, Alabama, were interviewed to see if see was compos mentis . He said he had been told she was mostly incapable of communication. Such investigations can involve law enforcement if financial exploitation can be shown. One person speaking to The Times anonymously said Lee seemed to understand the investigators and give clear responses. People have argued for several different pictures of Lee: funny, depressed, witty, confused, or even varying from day to day. She reportedly had a stroke in 2007, resulting in health and vision problems. 'It's a call only God or a doctor can make,' attorney Philip Sanchez, who was a pallbearer for older sister Alice's funeral, told the Times. 'I am more concerned that Nelle is content than the discussion of her cognizance.' Accounts of Lee's mental and physical state have been contradictory over the last few years, but intensified recently after HarperCollins announced her second book, Go Set a Watchman . A friend of Lee, Wayne Flynt, said he visited her recently and found her mentally cogent. But he agreed she had some health issues, telling him 'I'm not so sure anymore', in response to a congratulations on the new book. Lee has only given statements about the novel through her attorney, Tonja B. Carter. Carter handled the book deal and declined to respond to interview requests. Lee wrote the book, Go Set A Watchman, in the 1950s. It was first submitted to publishers before To Kill A Mockingbird and is considered her earliest work. The manuscript was presumed lost, according to reports, but was found last year. It centers around Mockingbird's protagonist, Scout, returning to Maycomb after 20 years.","Go Set a Watchman will be released July 14 .

"Patients at a hospital A&E department are being forced to parade details of their conditions on laminated signs. They are assessed by staff when they arrive, then given a red card if their illness is serious or a green one for less urgent issues, with a two or three-word summary of their ailment. These are designed to speed up staff assessments as patients wait for treatment, but the trial scheme has been described as ‘insensitive’ and like ‘a police line-up’. Elizabeth Reid, 49, has criticised a hospital after she was forced to wear a sign detailing her condition while waiting for treatment . It means those with alcohol, mental health and gynaecological problems, and others who might prefer to keep their conditions private, could be at risk of losing patient confidentiality. Elizabeth Reid, 49, said she was appalled when she went to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, and was given a green card detailing her ankle injury after she was assessed by a nurse. ‘I didn’t mind much for me as I had hurt my ankle,’ she added. ‘But I thought it was disgusting that patients with alcohol problems or mental health issues had to carry cards that showed everyone what was wrong with them.’ The mother of five from Chelmsford has complained to hospital bosses about the scheme. She said for those ‘carrying signs saying they had alcohol problems, it just smacked of them being marked out – it was like a police line-up’. Mrs Reid added: ‘The poor man in front of me was looking after his teenage daughter, who had alcohol poisoning, and everyone could see what was wrong with her. ‘I could see why every single person in the queue was there – and we had to wait in a line that went past lots of people sitting down waiting, so they could all see what was wrong with us too. It’s really poor for patient confidentiality.’ Hospital bosses at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, said it was designed to speed up staff assessments . She suggested it would be possible to obscure the details written on the cards, leaving the colour visible for staff, but said patients coming into A&E might be too distressed or distracted to think of doing this. ‘The people who come in are panicking or in pain,’ she added. ‘They could see anyone they know as it’s a local hospital, and they have to carry these cards showing what’s wrong with them.’ Another woman who visited the hospital said: ‘I had a laminated card and actually laughed at the insensitivity. I had a very negative experience, having just moved here from another county, and as a nurse myself was quite disheartened with the overall care I received at a sensitive time to myself and my family.’ The trust responsible for the hospital has defended the scheme, saying it will lead to quicker assessment times. The trial scheme has been described as ‘insensitive’ and like ‘a police line-up’ (picture posed by models) Dr Donald McGeachy, medical director of the Mid-Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ‘We’d ask people to bear in mind that the new reception arrangements at Broomfield Hospital are part of a pilot scheme that is being developed and constantly refined. ‘We want to provide patients arriving at A&E with a rapid assessment so they can be seen by the right clinical service at the right time. At the moment, people arriving at Broomfield will be assessed by a nurse and either referred on for emergency medical help or redirected to see their own GP. ‘The new area that has been set up within the hospital entrance mirrors the main reception and pays the same regard to patient confidentiality. ‘The information patients are being asked to provide on arrival is the same as when they book into the A&E reception, with the difference that they are rapidly assessed and directed to the right service for them. ‘We are not aware of any complaints about the pilot scheme.’","Patients at Broomfield Hospital  are given a card with summary of ailment .

"An ornate scabbard chape belonging to Admiral Lord Nelson - discovered on the bed of the River Thames by a police diver in the 1970s - has surfaced at auction for £70,000. It is believed the 6in long enamel and diamond decoration that fixed onto the bottom end of the naval hero's sword case was tossed into the water by thieves decades before. It was discovered in 1973 purely by chance by a police diver searching for a weapon used in a crime. Admiral Lord Nelson's sword scabbard (pictured) is set to sell at auction for up to £70,000 . The chape was from a scimitar sword presented to Nelson by the Sultan Selim III of the Turkish Empire to commemorate the British victory over the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. It is decorated in diamonds with the star and crescent which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent granted to Nelson in 1799. The locket no longer exists as it was melted down years ago but the chape is now coming up for auction in London with a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 to £70,000. The one-armed naval hero (illustrated) was famed for his victories at sea, mostly notably the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar . Michael Moorcroft, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The chape would have been a super-expensive item of the day. 'We can associate it with Nelson through the star and crescent at the centre of the decoration which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent conferred on Nelson in 1799 and as seen in a portrait of him in 1801. 'The sheer quality of workmanship that has gone into it is quite stunning. 'It is an object that is pretty fabulous.' Five years before its discovery, an ornate locket with an identical decoration that was used on the top part of Nelson's scabbard was found during dredging work of the River Wey in Surrey. The location wasn't far from the Thames at Windsor where the chape was found, nor from Nelson's palatial home at Merton. Both discoveries were featured on BBC's Blue Peter. Mr Moorcroft added: 'Both the locket and the chape were found at the bottom of rivers just five years and a few miles apart. The locket was found about 20 miles from Nelson's estate at Merton. The chape is being sold by Bonhams on April 1.","An ornate scabbard gifted to Admiral Lord Nelson is set to sell for £70,000 .

"A CEO who reportedly died of a heart attack in Venezuela two years ago has been arrested on fraud charges after being captured by the FBI at his remote North Carolina hideout. Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested on Saturday wearing a brown toupee and a dyed beard. Each count carries a possible 30-year sentence. Just a few years ago, Lantigua's family appeared to be living the American Dream. The Cuban immigrant claimed he had a heroic military career and earned numerous degrees before running a successful furniture business. He owned a Florida beachfront condo and a new home atop a verdant North Carolina mountain. But in 2012, as his Circle K Furniture company slid deeper into debt, those who knew Lantigua said he'd made some odd decisions: he ordered tons of new furniture on the company dime for his family's many homes. Scroll down for video . Jose Lantigua and wife Daphne Wilson celebrating New Year's Eve 2013. Three months later, his family said he died of a heart attack in Venezuela, his body cremated there instead of returned home. He was arrested this weekend on fraud charges in North Carolina . Jose Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, have been jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . FBI agents execute a search warrant at the Sapphire, North Carolina, home of Jose Lantigua on Monday. Lantigua, a Jacksonville businessman reported dead two years ago in Venezuela, was arrested in North Carolina on Saturday on alleged fraud charges after his life insurance companies filed a lawsuit alleging he was alive and they shouldn't be making payments . He replaced the bookkeeper he'd used for years with a relative. He built a panic room with steel doors inside his North Carolina hideaway. And, prosecutors say, he and his wife began planning his fake death to scam almost $8 million from insurance companies. No matter how the criminal case turns out, his arrest gives a resolute end to a long-running court battle between Lantigua's family and insurance companies that refused to pay off on his life policies because, for many reasons proven right, they didn't think he was dead. 'I've never seen anything quite like (this case),' said Joe Licandro, a Jacksonville prosecutor working the case. 'There was always a suspicion, but they were able to evade authorities as long as he did, and she didn't have any missteps either - until recently.' Lantigua, who had emigrated to the U.S. as a youth, purchased Circle K Furniture in 2008 after claiming to have served more than 20 years as a senior officer in the U.S. Army, where he claimed to have earned the Silver Star, the nation's third-highest military honor for bravery. Jose Antigua with his heavily-pregnant daughter Christina on New Year's Eve 2013 before he allegedly faked his own death. Friends had left messages of condolence to her following her father's reported passing in 2013 . Months after her father's alleged passing, Christina Lantigua posted this picture of them together and friends posted their condolences below. Neither the businessman's daughter or son, Joseph, have been charged with a crime . The Army has not responded to requests for confirmation. He also graduated from Florida International University in 1989 with a degree in computer science, the school said, and claimed degrees in management, mathematics and physics and aerospace engineering from Pepperdine University, Northwestern University and the University of Florida, respectively. UF said he attended the school but did not earn a degree and Northwestern had no record of him. Pepperdine did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. By the time Lantigua bought Circle K Furniture, it had grown from a few items sold from the corner of an old feed store to two large Jacksonville showrooms offering everything from contemporary to country-style pieces made from logs. Problems surfaced in 2012, when Lantigua told friends and colleagues he'd fallen ill and needed to go to Venezuela to get an experimental treatment not available in the United States. Simpson stood by his side with an expression of worry, people who know the couple said. Records showed they sold their Jacksonville-area condo for $600,000. About this time, Circle K was also developing financial problems. No one suspected anything suspicious at first, said Kathleen Leis, who was Circle K's bookkeeper. But as the company's debt grew into hundreds of thousands of dollars, she said Lantigua kept buying furniture for his family with company funds. Still, she trusted the man, whose kindness she said she leaned on previously when she had problems. Then Lantigua replaced her as bookkeeper with his sister-in-law. 'I wasn't given a reason except I was needed more on the floor and his sister-in-law couldn't sell furniture,' she said. Before long, Lantigua headed to Venezuela to deal with his alleged illness. Lantigua ran the once successful Circle K furniture company (pictured) but the business began to slide into debt in 2010 . Lantigua, 62, and his 57-year-old wife, Daphne Simpson, are jailed on seven Florida insurance fraud charges each after he was arrested by federal agents on Saturday in North Carolina . It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home. Circle K's stores closed a month later and the company soon filed for bankruptcy. Lantigua's family began filing life insurance claims for the nearly $8 million in policies he'd obtained. At his June 2013 memorial service at High Point Community Church in suburban Jacksonville, Lantigua's daughter, Christina, sang 'Amazing Grace' and the pastor read words of hope as his widow looked on. Meanwhile, American General Life Companies had suspicions about the $2 million claim Lantigua's son, Joseph, had filed, particularly the Venezuelan death and cremation certificates accompanying it. First, the physician who signed Lantigua's death certificate never received or examined the body. The investigators also said there had been no autopsy. Finally, the crematorium that had supposedly been used was 250 miles from where Lantigua supposedly died. Investigators found that suspicious. 'The insured's body was purportedly not prepared in any way prior to the cremation and likely would have rapidly decomposed during the lengthy travel in high temperatures,' American General said in court documents. The crematorium representative who signed the certificate was paid to generate false documents, the company said. Last November, American General denied the claim and lawsuits were filed. Joseph Lantigua has not responded to several phone messages  seeking comment. No contact information for Christina Lantigua could be found. Neither has been charged with a crime. American General's findings piqued the interest of local and federal prosecutors, who opened an investigation that included surveillance. At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville. 'It's possible that he's been hiding out there these past couple of years,' said Licandro, the Jacksonville prosecutor. Residents of the nearby village of Sapphire said the area is perfect for hiding out: only a couple hundred people live there and they keep to themselves. But Lantigua apparently thought trouble was coming. He built a bunker in his basement complete with 20-inch thick steel doors, said a contractor who worked on the house. 'It made me wonder why would you need a panic (room) here? There's not that many people around here you got to worry about,' said Forrest Boutte, 28. Boutte said Lantigua was a nice, straightforward man. On Saturday, U.S. State Department security agents arrested Lantigua near the Hogback Mountain home. The passport he had used to get back into the U.S. had proved his downfall. The man whose name Lantigua was trying to steal was black — the photo Lantigua submitted showed he is white. The Social Security number he used was from a woman born in 1917. Suspicious, State Department agents used facial recognition software to discover his true identity. Finding him wasn't hard — while the other information on his passport application was allegedly forged, he listed his supposed widow as his emergency contact and gave the correct North Carolina address. For those who knew him, the news that he was still alive was startling. 'I'm just shocked. He didn't seem that type at all. He seemed to me an upstanding, Christian family man. He was nice to everybody and wanted help people,' Leis said. It was there, in April 2013, that his family said he died of a heart attack, his body cremated there instead of returned home (pictured) At the time of his supposed death, Lantigua and his wife had been building a home at the top of a steep, narrow road on Hogback Mountain in North Carolina, a remote vacation destination near Asheville .","Jose Lantigua, 62, and wife, Daphne Simpson, 57, jailed on insurance fraud charges after he was arrested by FBI on Saturday in North Carolina .

"An Alabama woman charged in her granddaughter's running death testified Wednesday that she would 'rather die' than hurt the little girl, and denied making her run as punishment. Joyce Hardin Garrard took the witness stand to say she never intended any harm to 9-year-old Savannah Hardin. When defense attorney Richard Rhea asked if she would have done anything to hurt Savannah or any other grandchildren, Garrard replied, 'I'd rather die first.' The 49-year-old Garrard said she and Savannah had been in the yard picking up sticks and talking, taking frequent breaks to get a drink of water and to play. She said she was telling Savannah the importance of not lying. Took the stand: Joyce Garrard, 49, took the stand in her own defense Wednesday in her trial for allegedly killing her 10-year-old granddaughter Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy . 'I was picking up sticks with her because I felt just as responsible for her lying as she was,' Garrard testified. Prosecutors say Garrard killed the girl three years ago by making her run as punishment for a lie about candy. 'It was 'more like a jog and not a run,' Garrard maintained. Garrard said Savannah was such an active child, the only way to hold her attention was to keep her moving. 'We was hooting and hollering, fussing back and forth,' Garrard said. Garrard said they picked up sticks for about 40 minutes, but spent much of the day in the yard. She said Savannah told her she had to go to the bathroom and they were racing into the house when the girl fell backward. Garrard said that's when she told Savannah's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, to call 911. 'Did you have some intent to hurt Savannah?' Rhea asked. 'Not that day or any other day,' Garrard replied. Victim: Garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter, Savannah Hardin (pictured left and right), 9, to run to her death at her home in Etowah County in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates . Arrests: Garrard (pictured, left, in her police mugshot) was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin (right) One word on a 911 recording could help decide Garrard's fate. With 9-year-old Savannah lying unconscious following an afternoon of running and a 911 operator listening over the phone, Joyce Hardin Garrard asked for something — either a cigarette or a blanket. The request, depending on exactly what she said, could be considered callousness or compassion. On the Feb. 17, 2012, recording, played in court Tuesday, Garrard is heard in the background as the girl's stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, talked for more than 11 minutes with Lori Beth Beggs, a 911 operator in Etowah County. 'My daughter had a seizure,' Hardin says at the beginning. Speaking in a loud voice as Hardin talks to Beggs, Garrard is heard repeatedly saying the child's name and asking her to wake up. 'Savannah. Savannah,' Garrard says in a steady voice. 'Savannah, open your eyes.' Then, nearly three minutes into the recording, with Savannah still unresponsive, Garrard makes a request. 'Give me a smoke,' Beggs testified the woman said. The defense maintains she said: 'Give me a throw,' referring to a small blanket. While jurors have listened to the recording, Circuit Judge Billy Ogletree refused to let them see a transcript of the audio prepared for the defense. What the jurors believe she said could be vital. If Garrard asked for a cigarette while the girl lay before her dying, jurors could agree with prosecutors that the woman was angry and meant to kill the child by running her for hours. If they believe the woman said 'throw,' jurors could see that as sign Garrard was worried and trying to help the girl. Other testimony showed that the girl was wrapped in a small blanket when firefighters and paramedics arrived. Scene: Gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home (pictured). But defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader's death wasn't Gerrard's fault . Prosecutors were preparing to cross-examine Garrard later Wednesday after she was questioned by her attorney. Garrard faces a death sentence or life without parole if convicted of capital murder. The girl's stepmother is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death. Authorities said she sat by without intervening while the older woman forced the girl to run until she dropped. A defense expert said in dramatic testimony Tuesday that he wouldn't classify the death of a young girl as a homicide even though her grandmother is accused of running her to death, yet he agreed the child wouldn't have died without exhausting physical exertion. Questioned by an attorney for Garrard at her capital murder trial, forensic pathologist Dr. James Lauridson indicated he couldn't say someone else caused the death of Savannah Hardin, 9. 'Knowing what I know I would not have called this a homicide, I would have called it indeterminate,' said Lauridson, retired chief medical examiner for Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences. Lauridson also disagreed with autopsy findings that concluded the girl suffered from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Lauridson — using water, dye and a plastic skull to demonstrate sodium deficiency — said the girl was actually over-hydrated and had no signs of heat illness. Mother and daughter: Savannah (pictured with her mother in a Facebook photo) eventually collapsed and started seizing. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium . Jurors paid close attention to Lauridson, standing and craning their necks to follow his testimony. Garrard began crying after he said her granddaughter's death wasn't a homicide. But under cross-examination by prosecutor Marcus Reid, Lauridson admitted he didn't have all the witness statements and police files that were available to Dr. Emily Ward, the state pathologist who ruled that the girl's death was a homicide. Her decision was crucial to the decision to charge Garrard. Neighbors have testified they saw the 49-year-old Boaz woman forcing the girl to keep running even after she was vomiting and begging to stop, and Reid drove home the point to jurors. 'It was running that killed her. Isn't that right?' Reid asked Lauridson. 'Yes,' Lauridson replied. Lauridson's testimony built upon that of former forensic investigator Chris Crow, who helped Ward with the post-mortem investigation of Savannah's death. Crow testified that a report indicated Ward didn't have the girl's medical records before conducting the autopsy. The final autopsy report wasn't completed until weeks after Garrard already had been indicted, he said. Crow said the autopsy took Ward only an hour, which he described as 'pretty quick' for such an examination. But Crow testified under cross-examination that Ward was more experienced than other pathologists in her office, possibly accounting for her speed, and Ward was in a meeting where authorities detailed their evidence. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Garrard, who is accused of making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on Feb. 17, 2012. Garrard, of Boaz, says she is innocent. Run to death: Savannah (pictured) suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent doctors visits, court documents state. Defense attorneys have said it was her medical condition that caused her death .","Joyce Garrard, 49, is charged with killing 10-year-old Savannah Hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy .

"A Corporal's wife who was 'starved of affection' was spared jail yesterday after having sex with the 14-year-old son of a soldier. Caroline Salisbury, 27, lured the boy into her bed after meeting him on a school bus. The mother-of-two, who had been 'looking for love', pleaded guilty to four charges of sexual activity with a child – after earlier telling a neighbour she had been raped by him. Speaking at a court in Colchester yesterday, Judge Advocate Emma Peters gave her a two-year suspended sentence and warned her to 'stay away from young boys'. Salisbury, who was 25 at the time, began having sex sessions in her living room with the boy a week after his 14th birthday in 2013, the Service Civilian Court was told. Spared: Caroline Salisbury (pictured) - who lured the boy into her bed after meeting him on a school bus - was given a two year suspended sentence . They met when she became a bus monitor escorting children of soldiers based in a British garrison in Germany to school. Colonel Nigel Jones, prosecuting, told the court: 'She invited him to her house and the relationship developed from just being friends into what became a sexual relationship.' She would send him Facebook messages when her husband, David, a corporal in the Royal Engineers, was out, so he could visit her married quarters for drink and sex. In one message she told the boy: 'Come at four. He won't be in. I cannot wait for you to f*** me again.' Col Jones said: 'She had two accounts on Facebook to communicate with him. It was not just about meeting up. Declarations of love were made on both sides.' He added: 'Because he was spending so much time with her his mother became suspicious. A friend of his mother visited her and showed her messages from Salisbury which suggested a sexual relationship between her and the boy.' His parents alerted the Royal Military Police and when they knocked on her door, the boy fled over the garden fence. Despite twice being warned by the police not to meet him, Salisbury continued the affair. Then, when his parents were having a barbecue, the boy did not attend and was not answering his mobile phone. His brothers went to Salisbury's home and began banging on the door because they knew he was inside. Neighbours called the police and the boy fled once more. Col Jones said: 'The boy later confessed to his father he had been in a sexual relationship with her and she was arrested.' Sneaky: Salisbury would send the boy Facebook messages when her husband, David, a corporal in the Royal Engineers, was out (file photo of British soldiers abroad) Salisbury told a neighbour she had been raped by him. But in an interview with the Military Police she admitted twice having sex with him saying he had forced himself on her, but did not say rape. Col Jones added: 'He was very upset at the end of it. He was totally besotted with her.' Defence barrister Peter Glenser told the court that Salisbury was 'starved of affection' by her husband who has since left the Army and is working in Saudi Arabia. 'It was for this reason she sought the company of people younger than herself,' he said. 'In the last week he has indicated that he is sorry for the way he has treated her and that he should have been more supportive of her.' Mrs Salisbury, from Suffolk, wiped tears away as Mr Glenser told the court: 'This is a shaming occasion for her. She desperately regrets what has happened.' Judge Peters told his wife: 'This was a boy who was a child of just 14 and to suggest he pressed himself upon you is revolting. 'That is utterly criminal. The police warned you off and you carried on. Young boys have to be kept safe and not be groomed and taken back to your house when your husband was away. 'You were looking for love. You are a damaged woman. I am going to take an exceptional course – you have come within a hair's breadth of going to prison for a long time. 'I pass this suspended sentence with a heavy heart. You need to stay away from young boys.' Salisbury was placed on the sex offenders' register for ten years and banned from having any boy aged under 16 in her home without parental consent.","27-year-old Caroline Salisbury was given a two year suspended sentence .

"Students at a high school in southern California returned to class on Monday to discover that their chemistry teacher had switched gender, adopted a different first name and was dressing as a woman. Amanda Swager, born Michael, grew up as a boy, but learned as an adult that she was actually genetically female and began transitioning. Swager, 32, who teaches chemistry at Chino Valley Unified School District, had first notified district leaders about her situation two years ago. Scroll down for video . Amanda Swager, born Michael, grew up as a boy, but learned as an adult that she was actually genetically female and began transitioning . She had originally planned to start teaching as a woman after the summer holidays, but that timetable had to be brought forward after being outed over the weekend while on date. 'I was in a movie theater with my boyfriend, and some students walk in and start shooting pictures of me in a movie theater,' she told KCAL9. After discussing the situation with the school district, it was decided that Swager should adopt her new identity immediately. Swager considered her gender very much a personal matter and so the decision was taken to notify only students in her class and their parents, rather than making a blanket announcement to everyone. 'We decided as a district, as a faculty, that it would do more harm than good to do a mass notification,' Swager told NBC4. 'Instead do individual notifications in classrooms where they knew what to expect.' The district's handling of the matter and Swager sudden change have come in for criticism from some parents who say they support the teacher but feel they should have been notified so they could speak to their kids about it. The Chino Valley Unified School District have updated information of their website about Swager after the decision was taken that she would transition to a woman sooner than originally planned . 'On a Friday he was a man, on Monday he was woman,' said one parent. 'This probably brought or is going to bring disruption in the classroom because all these questions need to be answered,' said another, who identified himself as Rusty. 'They're going to want to know why did the teacher did what he did.' Students interviewed seem less concerned. 'If it's what she wants to do, I mean, I'm not going to judge. It's what she wants to make her happy,' said a pupil called Madison. A spokesperson for the Chino Valley Unified School District said they can't comment because it's a personal and private matter for the teacher. Swager has asked parents to not be angry with the school district. 'I've got nothing but overwhelming support from the school district,' she said. The teacher also told NBC4 that she has no regrets and now wants to focus on doing her best job in the classroom. 'It's just relaxing to be able to wake up in the morning and just be me,' she said. Swager, pictured above, had originally planned on returning to school as a woman after the summer holidays, but that timetable had to be brought forward after she was outed by pupils over the weekend while on a date .","Students at Chino Valley Unified School District in California returned to class to discover chemistry teacher Michael Swager, 32, was now Amanda .

"Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against the crazed activist they say slashed the U.S ambassador to South Korea while screaming demands for Korean reunification. The attack Thursday on Mark Lippert, which prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' left deep gashes and damaged tendons and nerves. It also raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang. While an extreme example, the attack is the latest act of political violence in a deeply divided country where some protesters portray their causes as matters of life and death. Scroll down for video . On the mend: U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage  after a man attacked him with a knife during a lecture in Seoul . Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against anti-U.S. activist Kim Ki-jong (above) who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification . Lippert, 42, was recovering well but still complaining of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in televised briefing. Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by Tuesday or Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect, Kim Ki-jong for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved . Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood . In custody: The 55-year-old Kim reportedly yelled 'North Korea and South Korea should be unified' before he attacked Ambassador Lippert at the breakfast meeting. Seen above being taken into custody on Thursday . Journalists question Kim, who was brought out in a wheelchair, as he left the police station for a court in Seoul earlier today . They want to charge Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction, and have requested a formal detention warrant. A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathising with the North Korean government, was being considered. But the 55-year-old has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. Protest: South Korean officials responded swiftly in response to the attacks, beefing up security outside the U.S. Embassy and promising justice. Above, a group of South Korean protesters burn North Korean flags in Seoul during a rally denouncing the attack on Thursday . Pro-American: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country that are against the strong U.S. military presence. Above, more U.S.-South Korea alliance supporters pictured above on Thursday .

Kim, who has a long history of anti-U.S. protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police it was meant as a protest of annual U.S.-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials. While most South Koreans look at the U.S. presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history. Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops here, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea. 'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said. Right before: Lippert pictured above, seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by Kim Thursday morning . Stained: Police say the ambassador was at his table and about to make a speech when Kim pushed him from behind and then started slashing him with a knife. Above, investigators survey the blood-spattered table on Thursday . Taken by surprise: Injured Ambassador Lippert is seen leaving the performing arts center where he was slashed by Kim Thursday morning . Stitched up: South Korean police stand guard outside Gangbuk Samsung hospital where Ambassador Lippert was taken after the attack on Thursday. Doctors say he needed 80 stitches for the wound on his face . South Korean protection: South Korean police patrol outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on March 5. The protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country . Kim is well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes. Police didn't consider the possibility that Kim, who has ties to the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which hosted the breakfast meeting where Lippert was attacked, would show up for the event, according to a Seoul police official who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. U.S. ambassadors have security details, but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post. Seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the North Korean border. It's not clear how many guards Lippert had, but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the Mideast. Outspoken: Kim Ki-jong reportedly has a history of public outbursts. Pictured above in an undated file photo from a prior protest . Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern South Korea had been injured in a violent attack. However, the Japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when Kim threw a piece of concrete at him, according to police. Kim, who was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea, hit the ambassador's secretary instead, media reports said, and was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term over the attack. The website of the Woorimadang activist group that Kim heads describes the group's long history of anti-U.S. protests. Photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul to protest the U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are to run until the end of April. North Korea's state-controlled media crowed Thursday that Kim's 'knife slashes of justice' were 'a deserved punishment on war maniac U.S.' and reflected the South Korean people's protests against the U.S. for driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia for meetings with regional leaders, said the U.S. 'will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.' Activists in Seoul, meanwhile, expressed worries that the attack on Lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters, or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities. Small to medium-sized demonstrations regularly occur across Seoul, and most are peaceful. But scuffles with police do break out occasionally, and the burning of effigies of North Korean and Japanese leaders is also common. Some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers, thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self-immolate. Lippert became ambassador last October and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in Seoul. He's regularly seen walking his Basset Hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened. His wife gave birth here and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name. While South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest Asian allies, America has been partially blamed for the severing of Korea into two countries. In 1910, the Japanese Empire took control of unified Korea which they ruled as a colony through the end of World War II. When the Empire fell IN 1945, it was decided in a United Nations agreement that Korea be split in half at the 38th parallel. The U.S. established a trusteeship in the south while the Soviets took over in the north, leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries. Above, American troops board a boat bound for South Korean at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 . However, both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified Korea. Cold War tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union only fueled these ambitions, and in 1950 the North Korean army invaded the south backed by Chinese and Soviet soldiers. While the South Koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle, the U.S. helped booster their forces and retake their land. The fighting was disasterous for both countries, which eventually agreed to an armistance in July 1953. Since the Korean War is technically ongoing, the U.S. keeps troops in South Korea at the ready. However, the strong U.S. military presence in South Korean has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the West. Still, South Korea remains one of the most pro-American populations in the world. According to a 2013 poll, 77 per cent of South Koreans surveyed said they approved of President Obama's leadership - compared to just 45 per cent of Americans at the same time.","The U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert was injured in a surprise knife attack at a breakfast meeting on Thursday .

"Residents living in a picturesque rural village with a population of just 613 have slammed plans to build a Muslim cemetery on greenbelt land - for over 3,000 people. The proposed site in leafy Catherine-de-Barnes, near Solihull, West Midlands, will include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of Islam. This is despite Muslims accounting for fewer than 3 per cent of the population of Solihull and its surrounding areas. Residents living in a picturesque rural village have hit out at controversial plans to build a Muslim cemetery on rural land . The proposed site of 3,000 graves (edged in blue) and the previous applications (green and red) that have been made for the sites near Solihull, West Midlands . Previous applications to build what would have been Britain's largest Muslim-only cemetery put before Solihull Metropolitan Borough have been unsuccessful. But Cemetery Development Services Ltd have now submitted scaled down plans with fewer graves, which could be approved next month. It would mean the cemetery could eventually hold over FIVE times as many people as Catherine-de-Barnes itself. The graveyard would be able to comply fully with Sharia law which states Muslims are traditionally buried in their own section of land, next to others of the same faith. Islamic law also stipulates a method of bathing and shrouding the bodies before being buried with their heads facing towards Mecca. Yesterday villagers criticised the revised plans for the major development - which will also include 95 spaces for visitors - and said it would blight green belt land. Locals are also objecting the plans for the cemetery based on concerns surrounding the impact it will have on traffic. Grandfather-of-four Gerry Chauke, 55, said: 'There is ample room for graves to accommodate the local population here. 'I'm a believer that these sort of developments should serve the local community, but we don't have a massively large multicultural population here. 'So plans to have a graveyard exclusively for Muslims just seems a bit absurd to me.' Leader of Solihull Council, Conservative councillor Bob Sleigh, who represents the Bickenhill ward, said he also agreed the needs of local people could already be met by current plots. The proposal  in Catherine-de-Barnes, near Solihull, West Midlands, would include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of Islam . He said: 'This is simply not an appropriate place to site a cemetery. 'Planning permission was refused on substantial grounds last time and I will continue to oppose the scheme on the same grounds again. 'There were a lot of environmental concerns with siting a cemetery on this land. This is just not the right position for this type of scheme. 'There is no need for this extra site in Solihull. We have identified our population need and made provision for that. 'Obviously people are concerned about the scale of the development and its threat to greenbelt land around Catherine-de-Barnes. 'I don't believe the case has been made to overcome the very special measures which apply to greenbelt land.' Trevor Eames, secretary of Solihull Ratepayers Association, said the application was 'disappointing'. He added: 'At this stage we see no obvious difference in this application to the earlier plans or for planning to draw a different conclusion. Residents in the surrounding are say it will have a great impact on traffic if given the green light . 'The parking for 90 cars and access is much the same as is the impact on the openness of the green belt plus there was concern over pollution of watercourses.' Conservative councillor Alison Rolf, who also represents Bickenhill, added: 'My main concern is that they are building on the greenbelt land. 'In Solihull we don't have a huge Muslim population . 'When the first application was taken down local people were delighted that it had gone away, but it's come back with very little adjustment. 'I understand people's frustrations.' The cemetery has received backing from the Muslim community in Solihull, who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces. The first application for planning permission for the cemetery was made in July 2014 and was for 4,000 burial plots, which was refused. This was increased to 7,000 on an adjacent site a month later, but this application was withdrawn. The latest application is for a total of 3,333 plots. According to a report by Cemetery Development Services, the site will be operated by a charity called Thaqwa Cemetery, which provides 'a low cost dignified burial at a freehold plot according to Islamic beliefs and culture'. The report adds: 'After the departure of the soul, human being has been buried since beginning. 'Other methods of disposing of human remain are relatively new. Being the oldest Monotheists, Muslims have always maintained the ancient burial system. 'To preserve this centuries old tradition in this part of the world we acquired a plot of land in the Catherine-De-Barnes area of Solihull after consulting and obtaining positive response from Solihull Metropolitan Borough. The cemetery has received backing from the Muslim community in Solihull, who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces . 'It is also an established fact that there is a shortage of burial places across the country. 'Birmingham and Solihull regions are not an exception. Thaqwa Cemetery is a positive endeavour in meeting the community burial need.' Funeral director Mohammed Khalil, of Birmingham-based ZUQ Funeral Services, said even 3,000 burial plots would barely provide enough space for the next 50 years. He said: 'The local Muslim population is growing rapidly. 'Don't forget, the people who came here in the 1950s and 1960s are now old and dying fast. 'Before, they used to send people back home to their families in Pakistan and Bangladesh. 'But apparently now all their families are here and they have no-one back home. 'They are saying 'this is our country now. We are living here and dying here so we should be buried here.'","Application for a controversial Muslim cemetery submitted for third time .

"The remains of a woman who has been missing for more than thirty years have been discovered on the side of a Utah hill. Theresa Greaves, 23 at the time, went missing from her home in Woods Cross, Utah on August 5, 1983, after going for a job interview in nearby Salt Lake City. In February of this year, a man discovered a human skull on the side of a highway access road in Fruit Heights, about ten miles north of her home in the opposite direction from the state capital. Scroll down for video . Warning: Graphic images below . Police found clothing and bones on a hillside in Fruit Heights, Utah, after a passerby found the skull of Theresa Greaves . Ms Greaves, who was 23 at the time of her disappearance in 1983, had gone for a job interview in Salt Lake City but never returned to her home north of the state capital . Police later found clothing and other bones at the site, which have now been identified as Ms Greaves. Her case has remained unresolved for 31 and a half years, and police think that her body may have been washed down the hill after originally being placed higher. Doug Lovell, who is currently starting a new trial for the 1985 murder of a 39-year-old woman he once pleaded guilty to killing, was previously questioned in the case, according to the Deseret News. The inmate, who was previously on death row, has denied knowing Ms Greaves or having any involvement with her or another woman who went missing in the 1980s. Ms Greaves called a friend after she arrived by bus in Salt Lake City for her interview, but never returned to her mobile home north of the city, where she lived with a roommate. Ms Greaves (pictured) made contact with a friend to confirm she had arrived in Salt Lake before her disapperance.  Her parents have died and police are unable to contact any living relatives. Police believe that Ms Greaves's body may have originally been placed higher up the hillside it was found on before it washed down towards the road . Police are treating Ms Greaves's case as a homicide, but are not released details of a medical examiner's report. Authorities have been unable to contact any relatives and the parents of the New Jersey native have died. She moved to Utah when she was 18. Woods Cross Police Department has spoken with the officer who originally conducted the investigation. The victim would have turned 56 this October.

"A 54-year-old man was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico after he reportedly fell off a cruise ship on a five-day tour of the area. The man, who has not been named, was on the last leg of a five-day cruise around the Gulf of Mexico. The ship, the Carnival Triumph, is due back in Galveston, Texas, today. A surveillance camera spotted the man fall from the rail into the sea and an immediate search was launched. Scroll down for video . Tragic: A 54-year-old passenger, who has not been named, fell from the Carnival Triumph, pictured, on Tuesday night into the Gulf of Mexico . Troubled history: In February 2013, the Carnival Triumph was struck by an engine fire while on a cruise leaving it stranded . Passengers were warned that one of their shipmates had gone overboard on Tuesday evening. The ship was off the coast of Mexico at the time of the incident and Mexican authorities recovered a body shortly afterwards. The 54-year-old man's remains will be repatriated to the United States following formal identification. The company said that the ship was due back in Galveston later today, having been delayed by the incident. A spokesman confirmed that grief counsellors have been made available for the man's family and any passenger who may be distressed because of the incident. 'Our foremost care and concern is with the loved ones of our guest at this very difficult time,' he said. In February 2013, the Carnival Triumph suffered an engine fire while it was sailing 150 miles off the coast of Mexico, leaving it without propulsion. The ship, which was carrying 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew, had to be towed to safety. Nobody was injured in the incident. Attorney Jim Walker is is representing families of people who have fallen overboard on other cruises. He said that the industry must do more to ensure passenger safety. A 'ship overboard system' could be installed, he said. This would alert the bridge immediately when there is a man overboard, greatly increasing chances of rescue. He told KHOU.com: 'This type of technology assists the cruise line in realising that a guest has gone overboard such that they can conduct a search and rescue assistance.' Mr Walker said that 90 per cent of cruise companies do not use this safety equipment.","The 54-year-old man fell from the Carnival Triumph late on Tuesday night .

"A school teacher who allegedly showed teenaged pupils a documentary about Islamic State featuring decapitated soldiers has been suspended. Mansoor Mahmood was said to have accidentally shown a clip featuring images of soldiers' heads on spikes to fourth-year pupils at Gryffe High School in Houston, Renfrewshire. The popular teacher was reported to council bosses after a parent complained to the police. It is understood the woman's daughter was one of a group of pupils who were shown the 42-minute BBC documentary which portrayed dead Iraqi soldiers. Mansoor Mahmood was said to have accidentally shown a clip featuring images of soldiers' heads on spikes to fourth-year pupils at Gryffe High School in Houston, Renfrewshire . The students were reportedly left sickened by the footage, which also included images of soldiers' heads on spikes. But one mother, who did not wish to be named, has described Mr Mahmood as 'an absolute gem' and said he was singled out for being a Muslim. Her daughter is a fifth year pupil at Gryffe High School in Houston, Renfrewshire, and has said she is 'outraged' over the investigation into a 'really good teacher'. Pupils from the school have launched two petitions to support Mr Mahmood, who started working at the school in August last year. The mother said: 'He doesn't deserve this. He shared a news clip which, unbeknown to him, contained the footage and now he is facing disciplinary action. 'Some of the young people at Gryffe have set up petitions and Facebook pages to support Mr Mahmood. 'My daughter is absolutely outraged as she says he is actually a really good teacher. 'The footage has been shown on national TV, it has been on the Internet, on newspaper sites and to be honest, it is the horrific reality of the world. 'If it had been a history class and they had shown the depiction of William Wallace's head on the railings and his body decapitated, would it be any different? 'Yes, he made a mistake, but that footage is out there for the world to see and perhaps people should remember that.' She said: 'There is a huge undercurrent that it is Mr Mahmood's religion that has caused the real offence to the parents concerned. 'I support Mr Mahmood, we are short of great male teachers in the system and this could be an end to his career. 'You have to also ask yourself if this content was so graphic, why did the council's Internet protocols not block it? 'Just shows that it was on what was deemed to be a safe and appropriate site and that a young teacher is being blamed for trusting the system. The popular teacher was reported to Renfrewshire council bosses after a parent complained to the police. It is understood the woman's daughter was one of a group of pupils who were shown the 42-minute BBC documentary which portrayed dead Iraqi soldiers. 'The kids are supporting the teacher 100 per cent.' An online campaign named 'Keep Mr Mahmood in Gryffe' has been launched and has collected almost 100 signatures. One pupil said: 'Mr Mahmood should not be identified as 'the terrible teacher showing inappropriate videos', he's only showing the reality of the world. 'This is being blown out of proportion for just a good teacher doing his job. 'He should not be kicked out of Gryffe just because he's teaching the reality of things.' Renfrewshire Council confirmed that Mr Mahmood had been reported to the General Teaching Council for Scotland. A spokesman for the authority said the video was used as part of a lesson about ongoing issues in the Middle East. He said: 'During a religious, moral and philosophical studies lesson, one fourth year class was shown a BBC narrated video about Islamic State. 'The clip was intended to provide pupils with an insight into the political and religious context in the Middle East as a basis for discussion. 'However following a complaint from a pupil, the material was reviewed and immediately withdrawn from use. 'No parents have complained to the school, however we value the opinion of our pupils and have acted accordingly.' Even police were called to speak to staff at the school, but left after finding no criminal element to the single complaint. Inspector Stevie Espie, of Johnstone Community Police, added: 'We were made award of this incident last Wednesday, on March 4, after being contacted by a parent whose daughter attends Gryffe High School. 'Police attended and spoke to the school staff. We also watched the video but found nothing criminal in relation to this. 'The school are now progressing with the enquiry but we will not be investigating the incident any further as there was nothing untoward found.'","Mansoor Mahmood was said to have shown the BBC clip to 14-year-olds .

"A rare poster for the 1931 horror Frankenstein is set to fetch $225,000 at auction . One of the world's rarest movie posters for the classic horror Frankenstein has emerged for sale - for a staggering $225,000. The 84-year-old poster for the cult 1931 film, which starred Boris Karlov as Dr Frankenstein's monster, is the only one of its kind in existence. It was discovered languishing in an old projection booth in a disused theatre in Long Island, New York during the 1970s before being restored to its former glory. The 6ft 6ins by 3ft 5ins poster, known as a 'three sheet' because it is made up of three panels, has been in a private collection ever since. Frankenstein was one of the first horror films ever made, and the poster is one of only a handful of originals known to have survived. Collectors are expected to pay as much as $225,000 to get their hands on the coveted poster when it goes under the hammer at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas. A spokesman for Heritage Auctions said: 'Only a small handful of one sheets including one teaser, one six sheet, one insert, and a restored half sheet are all that have appeared of the posters, not including lobby cards,' the spokesman said. 'Offered in this lot is the only known copy of either of the two styles of three sheets created for the debut of the film. 'This is the Style C and is arguably the best graphic of the two styles. 'It had apparently been used as a display for a number of reissues of the film with its counterpart Dracula, as was so often the case throughout the 1930s and 1940s. 'It underwent professional restoration and the poster now displays beautifully.' The spokesman said posters for the film had always been 'infamously difficult to find'. 'To say that the 1931 horror classic Frankenstein was monumental is an understatement of the impact it made on the audiences of the day,' the spokesman said. 'It remains the link that gets us where we are today in the evolution of the essentials of the horror film. 'Every cliché of cinema horror was created with this film - the mad scientist, the misunderstood monster, the angry villagers carrying torches, the dark laboratory filled with science fictional devices and the creepy assistant. Frankenstein was one of the first horror films ever made, and the poster is one of only a handful of originals known to have survived . The 84-year-old poster for the cult 1931 movie, which starred Boris Karlov as Dr Frankenstein's monster, is the only one of its kind in existence. Pictured is a scene from the movie . 'From the Creature of the Black Lagoon, to Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw, to Jason of Friday the 13th, and to all of the undead Zombies that followed, the hulking horror created by Boris Karloff, James Whale, and Jack Pierce influenced them all.' The auction will be held on March 28. Last year, a poster for the 1927 classic London After Midnight went under the hammer for $478,000 breaking the record for the most valuable poster ever sold at public auction. Heritage Auctions said the previous record was set 17 years earlier following the $453,500 sale of a poster for The Mummy.","Poster discovered in 1970s in a disused theatre in Long Island, New York .

"A black female police officer who previously acted as a bodyguard for the Duchess of Cambridge is suing a police force because she claims she was sacked after accusing another officer of racism. Ricky Haruna claims she was sacked for gross misconduct after she claimed a police sergeant at the Metropolitan Police had racially harassed her. Ms Haruna claims that after she made the allegation Sergeant Laurence Boyle convinced an elderly woman with dementia to make false claims of fraud against her. This led to Miss Haruna being hauled before a misconduct panel and dismissed, only to be reinstated after a successful internal appeal. Ricky Haruna joined the Met Police in 2002 and one of her jobs was escorting Kate Middleton before she married . The 39-year-old is now suing the Met Police for race discrimination and wrongful dismissal for the way it handled her case, with her previous claims of racism not forming part of her own misconduct hearing, the Central London Employment Tribunal was told. She claims that although the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) was aware of the race allegations she had made, these were not put before the police misconduct board. Ms Haruna joined the Met Police in 2002 and one of her duties was escorting Kate Middleton before she married Prince William and became the Duchess of Cambridge. During her career she saved two people's lives and received two commendations. Ms Haruna claims she experienced racism from her police colleagues in 2010, and also reported that Sergeant Boyle racially harassed her. Following her allegation an elderly woman came forward and accused Miss Haruna of fraud. This led to what Ms Haruna refers to as her 'malicious arrest' in April 2013. Ms Haruna appeared before a misconduct panel and - despite the Crown Prosecution Service saying the fraud allegation was untenable and they would not be bringing charges in September 2013 - she was disciplined and sacked last June. But in February she was reinstated with full pay after a successful internal appeal against her dismissal. Lawrence Davies, representing Ms Haruna, said in his skeleton argument: 'Prior to her dismissal, the claimant had complained of racism on several occasions. She also claimed that she was being harassed and victimised...The DPS were aware of that allegation. 'However, the DPS failed to put this relevant evidence before the Police Misconduct Board.' He added that Ms Haruna did not raise these claims herself because of 'bad advice' from the Police Federation, the DPS had a 'clear duty' to do so. He said that in light of panel not having any knowledge of the evidence of discrimination, it made the 'wrongful decision' to dismiss her. Mr Davies said: 'We do say PS Boyle is racist and that this sorry saga began when he pressurised a very elderly lady with dementia to make a formal complaint of fraud against the claimant.' He added that PS Boyle's questioning of the woman, who also imagined that Ms Haruna had had an abortion and that Lord Russell had bought her a house, caused her to become 'very upset'. Ms Haruna was reinstated in February this year . It is not argued that the misconduct panel was prejudicial, but that the wrong decision it made was rendered discriminatory by the racist motivation of the DPS and/or PS Boyle. Mr Davies also drew attention to the employment tribunal of black police officer Pc Carol Howard in which the Met admitted it had a written policy to ensure that no discrimination complaint was successful. Ms Howard won £37,000 in her race and sex discrimination claim. However Louise Chudleigh, representing the Metropolitan Police, said once the the CPS had decided to not take any action against Ms Haruna for the fraud allegations, the matter was dealt with as a disciplinary issue, leading to her dismissal. She said Ms Haruna could not have a wrongful dismissal case because she had been reinstated. She further argued that the Pc could not bring race claims because the panel that dismissed her was protected from discrimination claims by judicial immunity proceedings. But Mr Davies said it would be 'absurd' if the officer could not bring her discrimination claim because he said 'even the MPS has accepted that the decision was wrong and given the importance of tackling discrimination in society and in particular the police.' Employment Judge Harjit Grewal reserved her judgment on whether Ms Haruna can bring a case of wrongful dismissal and race discrimination against the Met. Another preliminary hearing has been scheduled for April 30.","Ricky Haruna was sacked from the Met Police last year for misconduct .

"Alex Baah was jailed for 18 years today for a horrific series of rapes on a 13-year-old girl . A sex attacker who repeatedly raped a 13-year-old was jailed for 18 years today. Ghanaian Alex Baah, of south-east London, paid the girl £2 after each assault, the Old Bailey heard. The 42-year-old raped the girl at an address near Croydon and sent her perverted text messages, the court was told. The victim finally complained to police in August 2013 when she was aged 15. Jobless Baah denied touching the girl and claimed she had planted evidence and stole his mobile to send the messages. But the jury convicted him of five counts of rape committed between 2010 and 2013. The jury failed to reach verdicts on a further two counts of raping the girl when she was eleven and those charges were dropped. Judge Simon Farrell told the father-of-three his behaviour was ‘wicked'. He said: ‘This was a terrible case. The damaged caused to this girl is incalculable.' The judge added: ‘Rape of a child is a particularly serious offence and calls for severe punishment.’ The girl, who cannot be identified, told how Baah would give her money after he raped her. After an attack in early August 2013, she turned up unexpectedly at her aunt’s house in floods of tears. Her aunt said: ‘As soon as she arrived at my house she walked through the door and said: “He’s been touching me”. ‘I called her mother and she managed to get hold of her first but she was hysterical and wasn’t talking clearly. Then she showed me the text messages.' Baah’s name had been was saved in the girl’s phone under ‘P****’, the court heard. Traces of Baah’s DNA were found on the girl’s clothes during a medical examination after she alerted police. Giving evidence Baah claimed: ‘I don’t know how it got there, but the only way I can think is she go to the bathroom and use it against me.’ He also tried to argue that text messages sent from his phone may have been an attempt to set him up. Baah, of Plumstead, denied two counts of raping a child under the age of 13 and five counts of rape of the same victim between 2008 and 2013. In addition to his jail term, the judge passed a sexual offences prevention order which bans Baah from wilfully being in the presence of a girl under the age of 16. He waved at relatives in the public gallery as he was led to the cells. A judge at the Old Bailey told Baah: ‘This was a terrible case.

"That's one way to cap off a successful first date. Tristan Gareau’s new relationship got off to a fiery start last week when he rescued a man from a burning car on his way back from a romantic rendezvous with his new flame. The 21-year-old resident of Winnipeg, Canada, was driving in the area of Grant Avenue and Kenaston Boulevard just before midnight last Tuesday when he spotted a car that had smashed into a condominium. Gareau, who was driving a young woman home after their first date, pulled over and rushed to the smoldering car to see if he could be of assistance. Scroll down for video . Real-life hero: Tristan Gareau, 21 (left and right), has been hailed as a hero for rescuing a 65-year-old man from a burning car on his way home after a first date . Inferno: Gareau was dropping off his date in Winnipeg, Canada, when he came upon a car that had slammed into the side of a condominium . In the nick of time:  Gareau rushed to the driver's side, unbuckled the unconscious man and dragged him to safety, just seconds before the car burst into flames . Adrenaline rush: Gareau is still not sure how he was able to pick up the victim, who was about 90lbs heavier than him . The 21-year-old opened the front door on the driver’s side and was greeted with a puff of black smoke and a heatwave. He noticed that the driver, a 65-year-old man, was unconscious but his foot was still on the accelerator, causing the wheels to continue spinning, reported GlobalNews.ca. The 5-foot-10, 135lb Gareau then grabbed the elderly driver, who was at least 90lbs heavier, and dragged him about 5 feet away from the car, reported Metro News. Just seconds after pulling the 65-year-old motorist to safety, the vehicle burst into flames. Two police officers who were on their way to a different car crash at the time came to Gareau’s aid and took over the rescue.

He added that while the young woman was scared in the moment, she handled the situation well. The 21-year-old nightclub DJ noted that he does not consider himself a hero and is not interested in fame. Reunion: Four days after the rescue, Steve Guy got to shake the hand of the man who saved his life . New friends: The two men embraced and exchanged phone numbers at the very spot where the collision took place . Guy, 65, marveled at the fact that he walked away from the fiery wreck with only minor bruises .

"A Texas man is suing the store where he bought electronic cigarette batteries after they exploded in his pocket and caused injuries to his thighs and scrotum. David Powell, of Arlington, is seeking a minimum of $1million after receiving first and second degree burns from the incident that occurred while he was playing kickball at his daughter's birthday party. The two lithium-ion batteries Mr Powell bought from Vixen Vapors a couple days earlier were not struck, but exploded in his cargo shorts and sent 'a scathing hot mixture of shrapnel' into his groin. Scroll down for video . Warning: Graphic image below . David Powell (background) was injured during a kickball game in August after e-cigarette batteries he bought from Vixen Vapors in Texas exploded in the pocket of his cargo shorts (foreground) Vixen Vapors (left) now has signs that tell customers about the dangers of storing e-cigarette batteries following the incident that left Mr Powell with first and second degree burn (right, month after incident) It was 'a hot, fizzing kind of explosion. Not a loud kaboom, [more like] a sizzling star. The sparks were shooting from his crotch area' the man's lawyer John Ross told the Forth Worth Star-Telegram. He quickly rushed to a shower to wash off the lithium and other chemicals, but the former Marine still had to spend four days in a burn unit after the August incident. Mr Powell is now able to wear pants again. Vixen Vapors does not make the batteries in question, and they are thought to be manufactured in China. Mr Powell and Mr Ross allege that the products were 'unreasonably dangerous' and 'failed to conform to the applicable design standards and specifications.' In a statement to CBS DFW, Vixen Vapors said 'we work hard to educate our customers on their proper use and storage. We believe that if a product is defective, then its manufacturer should take responsibility.' The brand of batteries that exploded in Mr Powell's pocket, manufactured in China, has not been pulled from the shelves at Vixen Vapors . The shop has put up a sign warning to customers about putting batteries in anything other than a battery safety box. The brand of batteries that exploded has not been pulled. Dangerous incidents associated with e-cigarettes have become more common as the devices, which work by heating liquid with nicotine and turning it into vapor to be inhaled. A collection of media reports show that 25 accidents with e-cigarettes and their batteries occurred between 2009 and 2014 . A 29-year-old man in southern California quit smoking on Monday after his e-cigarette blew up his hand shortly after he pulled it away from his face, according ABC7. The cigarette shot up and stuck in his ceiling. Other incidents have seen homes and cars worth thousands of dollars destroyed because of malfunctioning devices. Most e-cigarette accidents occur while the device is being charged after the battery becomes overheated. While many studies have said that electronic cigarettes are safer than their traditional tobacco counterparts, debate continues about their long-term effects. The UN's World Health Organization released a report last year saying that the devices could be gateways to traditional smoking and called for regulations against advertisements that could entice children. Firefighters have told e-cigarette users to: . - Charge the device on a flat, solid and stable surface, such as a kitchen worktop; . - Keep the device away from flammable or combustible materials when charging; . - Never leave the device on a bed or close to soft furnishings, or in a cluttered space; . - Don’t exceed the recommended charging time, or leave unattended for any significant length of time e.g. overnight while you’re asleep, or if you go out; . - Don’t buy cheap, unbranded chargers and always follow the manufacturer’s instructions. E-cigarette chargers, like this one which set fire to a building in London, are behind an increasing number of blazes .","David Powell, of Arlington, Texas, bought batteries days before explosion .

"Chloe Sevigny has posed with just a lobster covering her modesty. Save her fashion jacket and mirror sandals, the 40-year-old can be seen on the cover of the Marfa Journal stark naked and sprawling out over a retro kitchen work top. The actress, who is considered an influencer within many fashion circles, makes a series of bizarre statements from a nun in chain underwear to scantily-clad Red Riding Hood as she creates four fake movie posters for the magazine. WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT . Claws for draws: Choe Sevigny ditches her underwear for new Marfa Journal pictures as she poses with a lobster over her crotch . The four fake billboards divide the whole magazine into four sections: raw, decadent, romantic and progressive. And they're sure to get attention, though loyal fans' interest in the content may be waning as the shoot sees the Swedish actress in a whole new light. Golden Globe winning and Academy Award nominated Chloe has previously enjoyed roles in Boys Don't Cry and American Psycho but these latest roles appear to put her in an all new-genre. In the most shocking image of the four book quarters, the beauty ditches her underwear in favour of the large marine crustacean. Stark naked: Besides a long fashion coat and a belt, Chloe was stark naked in the snaps . Provocative: Chloe posed on her knees wearing knickers and a chain between her legs . The fashionista was not without her accessories nonetheless and layered on some tribal beads between her bare chest and accentuated her enviable waist with a studded belt. She was seen sporting a subtle plaid coat, tying her tresses into a fuss-free low bun as she posed in a derelict kitchen setting. While it is not believed that the lobster is real, PETA's Managing Director Ingrid E. Newkirk told MailOnline: 'We're too kind to say what a pity it is that the lobster wasn't alive and wearing knuckledusters. 'So all we'll say is that we hope one day Chloë will realise how inferior she seems compared to a little animal who was killed just to cover a t**t. Fashionista: The fashion darling was still styled to perfection in Jean Paul Gaultier and Chanel Cruise . Daring: The actress appeared to poke fun at the movie industry with a series of mock film posters . Chloe, going virginal in white for a second picture, shows off her youthful frame in a second poster while dressed in a nun costume and headscarf. The title reads, 'Two Times A Virgin' and she sports lace knickers with a padlock and chain between her thighs to pose provocatively on her knees. Stylist Haley Wollens uses Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star, as the cover caption indicates, with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier. Chloe, photographed by Brianna Capozzi, enjoys a throwback moment in velvet for one snap and adds a sexy edge to a red cape for another Running With Wolves mock up. Baring her rock hard stomach, the actress sums it up perfectly as she scrawls 'I put the HOT in PSYCHOTIC' across her abs while puffing on a cigarette. Youthful: The star looked sensational with her trim shape on show in a vintage costume . Fashion fan: Stylist Haley Wollens used Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier. Hot: The star summed it up perfectly with Hot In Psychotic written on her bare chest . Retro: The stylish star enjoyed a throwback moment in a velvet bra and trousers . Third issue: The Marfa Journal is a bi-annual European publication that combines of art and fashion . And the cheeky starlet certainly does look hot. Youthful beyond her 40 years, the fashion darling shoots a full view of her bare behind, on which a temporary cherry tattoo can be seen in another daring image. Chloe clashes her moods as she sports a sweet, white bonnet but pulls down her tights to reveal her derriere while leaning over a dirt bike. Bi-annual European publication, Marfa Journal, combines of art and fashion and is now in its third issue, edited by Alexandra Gordienko. Movies appear to be the hot topic for Chloe at the moment, after she publicly named and shamed her favourite (and detested) female movie stars this week. The blonde hit out at Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence in the spring issue of V magazine. She said: ‘I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think Angelina is a great movie star. ‘I like Emma Stone. Whenever she’s herself, she’s really cute. Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying. Too crass.’ Cheeky: The model and actress bent over a dirt bike in her crystal whites, including a bonnet . Wild one: She didn't managed a smile but instead a moody stare while showing off her bare bottom . 'So much is about marketing and selling the product,' the star continued. And her latest photo shoot appears to be yet further poking fun at the movie industry. Moving away from Hollywood, Chloe's latest career move is her sixth collection in collaboration with Opening Ceremony. The Spring/Summer 2015 womenswear line is themed around preppy chic, inspired by the satirical ’80s cult film Heathers. Sassy: Chloe was modelling in a leotard and pointed boots with Hello Kitty designs . Retro: She enjoyed seventies styling in a patterned jumpsuit and long mermaidian locks .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has reacted angrily to a UN report that stated the government's asylum-seeker policy breaches the UN torture convention by saying that 'Australians are sick of being lectured to by the United Nations'. Mr Abbott was furious that the UN did not acknowledge his government for stopping the boats, and questioned the international organisation's credibility. The report by UN special rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez focused on the offshore detention on Manus Island of asylum-seekers by Australian authorities. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a combative mood in Perth on Monday. He was annoyed by a UN report that stated the government's asylum-seeker policy breaches the UN torture convention . It found that the conditions breached Australia's obligations under the Convention against Torture.

"These distressing pictures show a skeletal lurcher found roaming the streets just days from death in one of the worst neglect cases ever seen by an RSPCA inspector. The dog, whose rib cage and spine can clearly be seen, was completely emaciated, had suffered fur loss and was covered in fleas when she was found with a Jack Russell. The mismatched pair, who both appear to have been abandoned, are believed to have stumbled across each other in the wild where they formed a close bond. Scroll down for video . Neglect: This skeletal lurcher was found roaming the streets just days from death alongside a Jack Russell . The dog, whose rib cage and spine can clearly be seen, was completely emaciated when she was rescued by the RSPCA . Neither the lurcher (pictured) or the Jack Russell were microchipped or wearing collars, suggesting they may have been abandoned . The dogs were discovered in Bransgore, in New Forest, Hampshire, earlier this week and were not microchipped or wearing collars. RSPCA Inspector Patrick Bailey said: 'I have come across some pretty poorly dogs in my time as an inspector but I can safely say there have been few that have been as thin as this poor lurcher. 'She was completely emaciated, and looked to be just skin stretched over bone. 'She had fur loss from her shoulders down, was absolutely covered in fleas and her claws were long and overgrown. 'From her body condition I really don't think she had many days left had she not been found. 'We dread to think what would've happened to these dogs had they not been found.' The lurcher was found with a Jack Russell (pictured) in New Forest, Hampshire, and the pair have formed a close bond . Recovering: It may be some weeks before the poorly lurcher is in a fit enough state to be re-homed . An RSPCA inspector said he had never seen a dog as thin and emaciated as the lurcher, which was found earlier this week . The dogs, who are both female, are now recovering however it could be some time before the lurcher is in a fit enough state to find a new family. Because of their bond, the canine companions could be re-homed together, but this may not be the possible because the Jack Russell is likely to be healthy enough to be re-homed sooner. Mr Bailey added: 'We don't know how long these dogs have been straying and we don't know how they got there or where they came from. 'It seems unusual that the two dogs were so polar opposite in their health and wellbeing and as such I am keen to hear from anyone who can offer information regarding them, especially the lurcher. 'It is possible that these dogs have been straying independently before joining up to form this mismatched pair and it could be that the lurcher has been fending for herself for quite some time to arrive in this poor condition. 'However she is extremely affectionate, enjoys fuss and attention and seems very keen to be around people. 'She has clearly been socialised but I cannot rule out the possibility that she has been neglected before straying or possibly even being dumped.' The RSPCA is appealing for the owner or owners of the duo to come forward so they can be reunited, or for anyone with details about where they may have come from to contact them.

"Struck off: Fadi Sukaria joked he could cure a nurse’s intimate medical condition with his ‘magic tongue’ A Syrian dentist who joked he could cure a nurse’s intimate medical condition with his ‘magic tongue’ has been struck off. Fadi Sukaria repeatedly groped his colleague, made sexually explicit comments to her and asked if she had any ‘rude’ pictures or videos on her phone. When he heard she was suffering from cystitis, Sukaria said: ‘I have a magic tongue to make it better.’ His disturbing comments were made while the pair were working together at the Gateway Dental Practice in Barnsley, the General Dental Council (GDC) heard. Sukaria also asked the woman, referred to as Nurse A, if she had ever been raped before stroking her breasts, groping her bottom and biting her arm, the hearing was told. Saba Naqshbandia, for the GDC, said they were working together on November 28 2012, when they chatted about going to the gym. ‘During this Sukaria stroked her bottom very lightly and said it was ""nice"". The complainant responded by saying: ""Don’t ever touch my bum"". ‘He stroked her breast saying: ""I will touch these instead"". She recalled that he was laughing.’ ‘She had to lean next to him, but not over him, to use the computer - as she used the mouse he stroked her right breast again. ‘He grabbed her right arm with his teeth and mouth and sucked it. She said ""how dare you do that"" and he laughed. ‘Later he said: ""I wonder what your bum feels like with jeans on"" and tried to put his hands on her. ‘She recalls being very scared and wondering what he was going to do, by now the complainant was very upset and shocked.’ When she asked another member of staff for a lift home in the evening Sukaria asked if she had ever been raped and added: ‘I’ve never raped anyone.’ The next day she did not attend work, saying she felt unwell. Sukaria also showed another dental nurse - Nurse B - pictures of a woman’s bottom on his phone, saying: ‘Look at that bum, it’s really nice bum.’ He also thrust his groin while laughing, the hearing was told. Giving evidence, Nurse B said: ‘It was a picture of a lady bending over wearing black trousers. He said ""that’s a really nice one to get a hold of,"" and simulated her straddling him with a leg either side. ‘I think he was a bit filthy minded. I don’t think he thought there was anything wrong with what he did even though it was inappropriate.’ Sukaria denied all the allegations against him and fellow dentist Dr Fulya Arda told the hearing: ‘Fadi is a very nice person, he is very trustworthy - I have known him for ten years. His disturbing comments were made while the pair were working together at the Gateway Dental Practice in Barnsley, above, the General Dental Council (GDC) heard . ‘I was very surprised by the allegations. When I read them first I just laughed - there is no way Fadi would do things like this. There is no way I believe them. Sorry.’ Sukaria is the sole breadwinner for his family in Syria as his brother was injured and left paralysed after a bombing, the hearing was told. GDC panel chair Mary Harley said: ‘The committee takes a particularly serious view of your conduct because it took place in a professional setting. ‘Your behaviour towards Dental Nurse A escalated over a short period of time into you deliberately touching her bottom and her breasts and sucking and or biting her arm on 28 November 2012. ‘This escalation continued despite Dental Nurse A making it clear to you that your conduct was unacceptable. ‘Both Dental Nurse A and Dental Nurse B described you laughing during the course of these incidents. ‘As a dentist working directly with these dental nurses, you were in a position of authority over them; you abused that position for your own sexual gratification. ‘Your conduct would be considered deplorable by members of the dental profession and indeed by members of the public.’ Sukaria, of Eastgate, Leeds, was found to have committed a number of offences including making inappropriate and sexual comments and inappropriately touching a nurse. He also inappropriately showed a nurse sexual pictures on his phone.","Fadi Sukaria repeatedly groped his colleagues and made sexual comments .

The actress, who shot to fame in Coronation Street, is currently appearing in Ordinary Lies . Having recently launched her summer Lipsy range, the star spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. She told FEMAIL: 'Keep a fresh-faced feel,' she said. 'With day wear make-up, you can always add to it later in the evening. 'In the summer, I wear much less make-up and it looks better on your skin.' Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin.

'I try and go to the gym as much as I can,' she said. 'It could be three times a week or not at all one week, but I don't punish myself if I don't go.'

Still smiling: Brent Sass of Eureka (right) was disqualified on Tuesday evening from the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race for carrying an iPod touch . Sass told the Alaska Dispatch News that he had no idea that he was doing anything wrong. 'I didn’t use [the iPod touch] and I had zero intent of using it for a Wi-Fi connection in checkpoints, but I was just completely clueless,' he said. 'I mean I gave my dad my cell phone because I knew you couldn’t have cell phones on this race specifically and I was just ignorant.' Sebastian Schnuelle, a Canadian dog musher and dog sled racer from Whitehorse, Yukon, who is not running in this year's Iditarod described Sass' disqualification as 'disappointment'.

'He was running a great team,' Schnuelle added. Sass, owner and founder of Wild and Free Mushing, has been racing and training huskies for 12 years. Originally from Excelsior, Minnesota, Sass moved to Alaska in 1998 to 'fulfill a lifelong dream' of living in the state. He attended the University of Alaska Fairbanks where he graduated with a major in geography and started mushing shortly after. Weather impacts: Iditarod mushers began their 1,000-mile trek across Alaska along a new route after poor trail conditions forced organizers to push the race's start north, bypassing a mountain range .

"A park ranger in south China has caught an enormous Chinese salamander that is the world's largest living amphibian and is known as the 'Living Fossil' because it has remained unchanged for 170million years. The man, named only as Mr Xiao, was shocked to find the rare giant salamander swimming in the water and later released it back into the wild, reported the People's Daily Online. Although it is one of the world's oldest species – dating back more than 170 million years – there are few surviving populations of giant salamander left in the wild. Its appearance has barely changed since the Jurassic period. Scroll down for video . Giant: The salamander found by Mr Xiao measured 83cm in length and weighed in at 5.5kg . Shock: Park ranger Mr Xiao could not believe his eyes when he saw the rare creature swimming in the river . The giant salamander, which measured 83cm in length and weighed 5.5kg, was found in Heyuan City in southern China's Guangdong Province. After keeping it in a temporary tank, Mr Xiao released the creature back into the river, watched by a crowd of fascinated tourists. The giant salamander is listed as 'critically endangered' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and a protected species in China. Prize catch: Mr Xiao shows off his discovery, the first of its kind to be found in the area . Fine specimen: The Chinese giant salamander is the world’s largest living amphibian and has been known to grow up to 1.8m long . Despite its status as an endangered species, it is still regarded a delicacy among China's super rich. The salamander population has declined drastically over the last 30 years due to poaching and destruction of its habitat. Earlier this year Chinese officials were investigated for reportedly eating a giant salamander at a luxury banquet in Shenzhen. A recent government crackdown means that anyone found to be eating endangered species could receive a jail sentence of up to ten years. Attention: A young boy enjoys his moment with the rare amphibian before it is returned to the wild. 30 years ago the giant salamander was relatively common . It is believed by some that the salamander has anti-ageing benefits, although there is no scientific evidence to support this. The giant salamander holds a treasured place in Chinese mythology and is called 'wa wa yu' - or 'baby fish' - in Chinese because its distress call sounds like the cry of a baby. In the past the amphibian could grow to more than 1.8 metres in length and over 50 kilograms in weight, but due to wild harvesting most salamanders today are much smaller.","Ranger was shocked to see the giant salamander while picking winkles .

"A pledge to lift everyone except millionaires out of inheritance tax is to be revived by the Conservatives in their general election manifesto. Official forecasts suggest the number of families paying death duties will double over the next five years unless the current threshold of £325,000 is raised. Leaked Government documents suggest that the majority of estates currently liable would be lifted out of tax under plans drawn up for the Tories. The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Lib Dems . The inheritance tax cut will not feature in today's Budget because it has been blocked by the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives proposed raising the threshold to £1million before the 2010 election, prompting the Labour government to allow married couples effectively to combine their allowances to £650,000. The Chancellor's plan to raise it further was killed off by the coalition with the Lib Dems, who insisted that raising the personal income tax allowance should take priority. David Cameron believes families who do not feel 'in any way mega-rich' are being dragged into the tax bracket, according to Government sources. One option is to create a new tax free band worth £175,000 per person on a family home, that could be transferred between married couples, making it worth a maximum of £350,000. The leaked documents show that by adding the existing maximum combined allowance for couples of £650,000 to the new maximum relief of £350,000, properties up to £1million would escape inheritance tax. The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable (pictured) said the Tory plan was 'very cynical' The paper, written by officials for the Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke, notes the scheme will be 'very popular with the public'. 'It will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax (with up to £1million of assets) exempted in certain circumstances,' the paper states. 'This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house, particularly in London and the South East, paying inheritance tax.' It estimates that by 2019-20, around 20,000 fewer estates a year would be liable for any inheritance tax. Critics of the duty say that money bequeathed at death has already been taxed, so should not face further charges. They also point out that the super-rich often employ accountants to devise trusts and exemptions to reduce their liability. The Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Tory plan was 'very cynical'. 'If taxes can be cut – and it's very difficult within the present budget constraint – we've got to start at the bottom with people on low pay, not at the top,' he said. A revival of the inheritance tax pledge would be another pitch to the 'grey vote' that could prove crucial in May's election. The policy was credited with a surge in support for the Conservatives in 2007, which helped scare Gordon Brown into abandoning plans for a snap election. Experts pointed out that the Treasury has suggested the inheritance tax threshold will remain frozen until 2017-18 to help pay for the introduction of a new cap on the cost of social care. By the following year, it is forecast to be worth almost £6billion a year to the Exchequer. Jonathan Isaby of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Building up a legacy for children and grandchildren is one of the reasons hard-working parents go into work every day, and it's immoral for the taxman to take that away especially after the deceased has paid taxes all their lives.'","Tories want to lift everyone except millionaires out of inheritance tax .

"The pilots of the Delta plane that skidded off a runway at LaGuardia Airport last week during a snowstorm have told investigators that automatic systems designed to slow down the plane were not working properly. They said the plane's automatic brakes were set to 'max,' but they did not sense any deceleration as the aircraft veered toward Flushing Bay, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The flight crew also said the runway appeared 'all white' - covered in snow - when they broke out of the overcast sky and glimpsed it just moments before landing. Scroll down for video . Malfunction? Pilots of a Delta flight that skidded of a runway at LaGuardia during a snowstorm last week (pictured) have told investigators the breaks were not working . The plane's automatic spoilers - flaps on top of the wings that reduce lift and slow the plane down - did not deploy, but the first officer deployed them manually. The captain also reported he was unable to prevent the airplane from drifting to the left. Investigators said the plane was flying on autopilot until it was 230 feet off the ground, indicating a fairly routine landing until the very end. Delta Flight 1086 from Atlanta was carrying 127 passengers, including two lap children, plus five crew members, when it slid off the runway Thursday and skidded about 2,000 feet along a normally grassy area alongside the runway that was covered in snow. Close call: The flight crew also said the runway appeared 'all white' - covered in snow - when they broke out of the overcast sky and glimpsed it just moments before landing. The nose of the plane ended up over the water . For the last 940 of those feet, the plane's left wing was cutting through and destroying the airport's chain-link perimeter fence, investigators said. The aircraft came to rest with its nose leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy Flushing Bay. The plane suffered damage to the left wing, including a punctured fuel tank that caused a leak. The belly of the aircraft from the nose to the first passenger door and the nose itself also were damaged, investigators said. Since Delta took ownership of the MD-88 plane on Dec. 30, 1987, it had taken off and landed 54,865 times, investigators said. Spread out over the past 28 years, that means the plane flew an average of 5.5 flights a day. The MD-88 was a workhorse of U.S. domestic airlines for the past three decades, favored on short, frequent routes. This particular one had logged more than 71,000 hours - or nearly 3,000 full days - in the air. Investigators are also examining an identical MD-88 plane that landed at LaGuardia 13 minutes before the botched landing as a baseline for evaluating the data from Flight 1086.

"Resigned: Afzal Amin was exposed after plotting with far-Right extremists to stir up racial hatred . The Tory Election candidate exposed for plotting with far-Right extremists to stir up racial hatred is a former member of a fanatical Islamic sect that believes the Nazis were misunderstood and that Jews control the world. Afzal Amin, who resigned after The Mail on Sunday published undercover recordings of him meeting the English Defence League, joined the Birmingham wing of the Murabitun, a fundamentalist cult which questioned the Holocaust and praised Hitler. In 1992 when Amin was 18, he left the group, founded by Scottish hippy Ian Dallas, after becoming disillusioned. Two years later, a book crediting him as author Raja Afzal Raza Amin al-Quraishy, was published in which he criticised the Murabitun and called for jihadi warriors to establish a Muslim state in Europe. Amin says his words were doctored to include the extremist views, which he yesterday described as ‘disgusting’. In the pamphlet Amin – described last week by a colleague as a ‘Walter Mitty character’ – demeans women and calls for restaurants that serve alcohol to be burned. The book, which is entitled Ian Dallas: The Shaykh Who Has No Clothes, criticised the group for not being radical enough. It states: ‘My troubles with the Birmingham community began when I realised that we were all illiterate, in Shar’iah terms, ignorant, and nobody had a plan to take the city in which we lived. ‘My pushing for study of the Shar’iah and a militant Islam resulted in my expulsion to Slough. ‘Those of us in the cities of Europe need to free ourselves economically from kafir [unbeliever] institutions, state and private, by creating our own arenas of trade, with Islamic coinage… and the building of independent villages for Muslims, from where the mujahidun [jihad warriors] can burst out and conquer lands establishing Dar ul-Islam [a Muslim region]. Scroll down for video . Extracts: Passages from the pamphlet credited to Afzal Amin . ‘May Allah bless the men currently engaged in military conflict against the kuffar [unbeliever] and may He assist us in preparing the liberation of the Muslims wherever we are.’ Recounting the tale of another Muslim, a passage in the book says that he ‘as any man would, refused to be taught the “methodology of jihad” by a female. You see nobody can be strengthened by somebody that is weaker.’ Discussing Indian restaurants which sell alcohol, he says: ‘My complaint is primarily with the hypocrisy of a group of people who claim to be the “cutting edge” of Islam, yet instead of burning the alcohol-selling restaurants are accepting…’ Last week, former student Abu Abdullah, who said he met Amin while studying at the School of African and Oriental Studies in London, claims Amin proudly gave him a copy of the pamphlet in 1998. Afzal Amin resigned after The Mail on Sunday published undercover recordings of him. Pictured: The Mail on Sunday's front page last week . He said: ‘We were shocked when we saw what he had written and asked him to move out.’ Amin said yesterday: ‘This work is not a book, it is merely stapled photocopied pages. It has been the subject of legal action and any suggestion that I share these views is defamatory. My rights were infringed by the author. ‘When I was 19 years old I was asked by a former member of the group to send him my account of the few months I spent with them. ‘He has inserted phrases throughout which are not my words and the last few paragraphs are a complete fabrication. I have been actively opposing such extreme and rejectionist views my whole life.’ Amin, 40, was exposed for hatching a plot with the EDL to announce a demonstration in his Dudley North constituency which would then be cancelled, allowing him to claim credit for brokering peace. A Muslim campaigner claims Amin asked him to publicly attack his military career to make him more appealing to working-class white voters. Asghar Bukhari, founding member of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, said: ‘He thought it would help distance him from Muslims and get white people to support him.’ Amin responded: ‘If I have met him I do not recall doing so.’ AND... He hinted at Westminster deal for lobbyist . Amin wanted cash in exchange for helping clients once elected, it is claimed. Financial services lobbyist Simon Gentry said Amin told him he would ‘take care of his clients’ and be ‘a friend in the House’. Mr Gentry added: ‘He worded it in a way that sounded financially beneficial to him.’ Amin said: ‘No such discussion took place.’ AND... He 'was always abroad' Amin preferred going abroad to canvassing, according to Anne Millward, of Dudley North Tory Association. She said: ‘He was often disappearing on trips to Dubai and Somalia.’ Amin said: ‘Performance issues should be referred to the party.’ So why DID the Tories let him stand for a seat? Serious questions were raised last night over the vetting process which put Afzal Amin on Tory Central Office’s ‘approved list’ of candidates. Calls for a review came from the leader of his local constituency association, who said Dudley North had been saddled with a ‘complete maverick’. Influence: Amin Afzal with former Tory chairman Baroness Warsi . Anne Millward said: ‘On paper, Afzal Amin was a very good candidate when he was selected in 2013, but I think the whole process needs to be thoroughly looked at after this Election. ‘If someone is on the list, you would have thought that they’d have been thoroughly vetted by Central Office and they’d be there on merit, but you then find you’ve got a complete maverick who doesn’t want to do what he’s told or toe the party line.’ Of Mr Amin’s explanation about the fake EDL march idea – comparing it to ‘negotiations with the Taliban’ – Mrs Millward added: ‘This is not Kandahar. It’s Dudley North.’ Meanwhile, Paul Goodman, editor of the Conservative Home website for grassroots members, said a long and highly critical comment about Amin’s military career – describing him as ‘a fantasist with questionable integrity’ – was posted at the end of an article Amin wrote 16 weeks ago, but was not followed up. ‘I’m sure plenty of senior people in the party would have seen it,’ said former MP Mr Goodman. ‘You might have thought it would ring alarm bells.’","Tory Election candidate was exposed for plotting with far-Right extremists .

"It's not all in the stars for guests when it comes to comparing the best hotels around Europe. While five stars seems like a fairly straight-forward measurement, hotel and resort ratings aren't all created equal as there is  no uniform ratings system to keep it simple for tourists. According to research by Hotels4u.com, 71 per cent of us don't realise that a five-star hotel in Spain can differ significantly to one in Great Britain, Turkey or Italy. The exclusive Goring Hotel must live up to demanding standards of service to be a British five-star hotel . France's ratings system was put together by the tourism  department and enforced by the Government, and five-star hotels such as Marseille's Le Petit Nice Passedat must live up to specific exacting standards . At British five-stars, guests being welcomed on arrival is among their many criteria for qualification . Each country has its own way to rank hotels from one-star to five and beyond, all with their own set of priorities and standards established by a range of authorities from local tourism bodies to government. In Great Britain, star ratings focus heavily on customer service, with a hotel not qualifying as a five-star without a greeting at the entrance and multilingual staff, along with a high quality food and wine menu and many other factors. While British standards are agreed by the AA (Automobile Association), VisitBritain, VisitScotland and VisitWales, France's exacting standards on what makes a five-star hotel - based on rooms, lobbies, services and amenities  - were decided by their tourism authority and are enforced by the French Government. A long list of criteria for a five-star hotel in France, such as the Hotel du Louvre in Paris, includes staff speaking English and one other foreign language, valet parking, multiple pools and kids clubs . Standards for Spanish hotels, such as the Hotel Gran Melia Volcan lanzarote, are regulated regionally . Along with opulent interiors, Spain's Hotel Alfonso XIII must have a 24-hour concierge service to be five-star . IN SPAIN . Must offer the highest luxury . Specially adapted rooms for wheelchair users and will often provide extra facilities . 24-hour reception and 24-hour concierge . Award-winning on-site dining facilities .

High quality menu and wine list . Licensed bar or lounge . Service with attention to detail and quality . Formal reception and porters' desks with uniformed staff offering proactive service . Extensive range of facilities, including leisure, retail and conference services. Spain's five-star hotels are crowned regionally rather than nationally, meaning discrepancies are possible, but to be top of the line a hotel must have 24-hour reception and concierge, award-winning onsite dining facilities and the rooms must be cleaned daily. For the Italians, cleanliness is next to godliness for five-star hotels in their uniform star-rating system established in 2009 - a one-star hotel need only change bed sheets once a week but five-star, you'll be pleased to know, have to change them daily. Most hotels in Turkey are inspected by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism while a similar system in compulsory in Portugal and regulated Ministry of Economy and Innovation. Italy's hotel ratings system, established in 2009, is judged heavily on its standards of cleanliness . Along with its 18th-century design by Alfonso Torregiani, sheets are changed daily in Italian five-star hotels . Free Wi-Fi 65% . English-speaking staff 53% . Swimming pool 48% . Guest parking 41% . 24-hour reception 40% . A safe in the room 39% . Laundry and ironing services 11% . Concierge services 9% . Children's club 7% . A minibar in the room 7% . A computer in the room 7% . Step-free access 6% . Fresh flowers/ present (e.g. chocolates) in the room on arrival 4% . Sewing kit/ shoe polish kit in the room 4% . Source: Hotels4u.com . As a member of HOTREC (Hotels, Restaurants & Cafés in Europe), Greek accommodation has complied with their classification system since 2013 with star ratings covering a combination of 270 compulsory and optional measurements. With such differences, Hotels4u.com's commercial manager Tim Bekir recommends tourists use a combination of peer and official review systems when making travel choices. 'When booking a hotel, it's important to be as well informed as possible and confident with your choice,' says Hotels4u.com's Commercial Manager Tim Bekir. 'Understandably, customers may sometimes find star ratings confusing. The Italian government, for example, have implemented a system that rates cleanliness as one of the most important aspects with the highest rated hotels being cleaned twice a day. France, on the other hand, focuses on more luxury and conveniences, such as room size, the location of the hotel and its amenities. 'Despite the variances, star ratings do give a good indication of the standard of the hotel. That's why we'd encourage using both peer-to-peer reviews and star ratings for the best hotel choice.'","71 per cent of people don't realise there is no uniform hotel rating system .

"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have been trying to paint him as a gullible teen who was recruited by his extremist brother to bomb the Boston Marathon finish line two years ago. But today, prosecutors presented the jury with a never-before-seen photo that tells quite a different story. Seen in the bedroom of his family home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sits at a computer chair and points to a black flag behind him - not unlike the kind used by extremist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. Tsarnaev's former best friend Stephen Silva testified in court on Tuesday that he saw the flag hanging in Dzhokhar's room, the one time he visited the apartment to watch The Walking Dead. Scroll down for video . Decoration: A new picture emerged of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in court on Tuesday, showing the accused Boston bomber posing underneath a black banner of Islam in the bedroom of his Cambridge family home . Silva was also the friend who lent Tsarnaev the gun used to shoot an MIT police officer in a confrontation a few days after the bombings. While the so-called Black Banner or Black Standard has been co-opted by Islamist extremist groups in recent years, it has much deeper origins in the Muslim world. The prophet Muhammed used a black standard when he fought, which is why it continues to be used as a symbol for modern-day jihadists. According to Boston University master Arabic lecturer Giselle Khoury, the flag reads: 'There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah's Messenger'. She told the Boston Herald that the statement is called 'the shahada - the testimony' which declares one's belief in the Islamic faith. However, quickly after the picture of the flag was shown in court today, U.S. District Court Judge George A. O’Toole Jr ordered taken out of court since he found it 'illegible'. Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said another witness, who did not take the stand today, would be explaining the flag's significance further. Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line on April 15, 2013, and shooting dead a university police officer three days later. Where the Boston Bombing was hatched: The jury deciding the federal death penalty trial were also shown other pictures from the Tsarnaev family home, including the image of the right of Dzhokhar's home computer . Authorities release this picture of the flag - which has become a symbol of Islamic terror groups the world over since the 1990s . Where he slept: Dzhokhar's former best friend Stephan Silva says they were friends for several years, but that he only visited the Tsarnaev house once to watch an episode of The Walking Dead on a computer from the top bunk of Dzhokhar's bunk-bed (above) Strict older brother: Silva told the court on Tuesday that he had never met his elder brother Tamerlan (left) and that Dzhokhar (right) described him as 'very strict, very opinionated' His former best friend Stephen Silva, who federal prosecutors contend loaned . Tsarnaev the gun used in the shooting, testified in court on Tuesday that he had long been close with the defendant but had never met his 26-year-old . brother, Tamerlan, who died following a gunfight with police . four days after the bombing. He said his brother was very strict, very opinionated, and . that since I wasn't a Muslim he might give me a little s*** for . that,' Silva said. Defense lawyers opened the trial at U.S. District Court in . Boston with the blunt admission that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had . carried out the crimes he is charged with, focusing their hopes . on the jury sentencing him to life in prison rather than the . death penalty he could face if found guilty. They contend Tamerlan was the driving force behind the . attacks and that his younger sibling followed out of . subservience. Convict friends: Friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Stephen Silva (left), testified at the Boston bombing trial on Tuesday about his 'strict' older brother Tamerlan. He is currently in jail on weapons and drug charges. Tsarnaev and Silva pictured on the right at their high school graduation . Prosecutors called Silva, 21, to the witness stand to . discuss the loan of the rusty Ruger P95 handgun they contend was . used to shoot dead Massachusetts Institute of Technology police . officer Sean Collier on April 18, 2013. Silva has pleaded guilty to federal gun and drug charges, . but was offered leniency in exchange for his testimony. He . testified he had gotten the gun from a friend, intending to use . it to protect his drug business, and also used it in a robbery. Tsarnaev asked to borrow it, saying he too was interested in . committing a robbery, Silva testified. On loan: The gun was part of evidence shown in court on Tuesday. Friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Stephen Silva,  allegedly gave him the weapon which was used to kill MIT officer Sean Collier . Ruined: This smashed-up iPhone was found at the scene of a shootout between the Tsarnaev brothers and police in the suburb of Watertown on April 18 - a few days after the bombings . In the most aggressive cross-examination by the defense in . eight days of testimony, Silva acknowledged having posted on . Facebook and having told the FBI that he believed the bombing must have been Tamerlan's idea. 'At the time that's what I felt, yes,' Silva said in . response to questioning by defense attorney Miriam Conrad. He also acknowledged having told prosecutors in August he . used 'peer pressure' to persuade Dzhokhar to smoke marijuana, . which Silva sold. 'That's what I said but I stated it wrong,' Silva said on . Tuesday. Emerging: Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, bloody and disheveled with the red dot of a sniper's rifle laser sight on his head, emerges from a boat at the time of his capture by law enforcement authorities in Watertown, Massachusetts on April 19, 2013 . Hide-out: In this courtroom sketch, the boat in which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured was depicted on a trailer for observation during Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial on Monday . In court: In this courtroom sketch, Tsarnaev, center seated, is depicted between defense attorneys while the boat in which he was captured in sits on a trailer for observation during his federal death penalty trial on Monday . Message: Inside the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hid for hours before he was captured by police, he carved on wood panels the phrase: 'Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop' Inscription: Another picture of the wood panels taken from inside Henneberry's boat . Silva also testified that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had once called . him a 'kafir,' an Arabic word meaning non-believer or infidel, . in response to Silva calling the defendant a 'Russian refugee'. Tsarnaev is an ethnic Chechen whose family moved to the . U.S. a decade before the attack. Other than the 'kafir' incident, Silva said Tsarnaev had . rarely talked about religion. Also on Tuesday, the owner of the boat where Tsarnaev hid . after a gunfight with police recalled stepping into his backyard . after a day-long lock down was lifted and finding a person in his . watercraft. David Henneberry described waking up the morning after a . gunfight between the Tsarnaev brothers and police rocked his . suburban neighborhood and noticing something wrong about the . winter covering of his boat, but presuming it had been blown . around by the wind. He put off checking it until after authorities had lifted a . shelter-in-place order on Boston-area residents four days after . the bombing, WBZ reported. 'I went to check on the boat and basically see why the strap . was loose and I noticed a lot of blood,' Henneberry said. 'I . just kept fixating on this blood and then, I just, my eyes . looked at the other side of the boat and that's when I saw a . body in the boat ... I got off the ladder pretty quick and went . in the house.' When prosecutors wrap up their case it will be the defense's . turn to call witnesses, who could include Tsarnaev. After that, . the jury will consider Tsarnaev's guilt. If he is found guilty, . a second phase will play out that will focus on sentencing. The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, . graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard. Henneberry said after he called 911, bringing dozens of . heavily armed police who fired scores of rounds into the boat . where Tsarnaev was discovered. The jury also saw two wooden slats from the boat into which . a message had been carved which read: 'Stop killing our innocent . people and we will stop.' On cross-examination, Mr Henneberry was asked by the defense if the blood and bullet holes in his boat were there before April 19. He confirmed that they were not. Final words: Inside the boat, Tsarnaev wrote a series of notes, which the jury saw on Monday. This note, punctured with bullets, explains how he is jealous of his brother Tamerlan because he had died and gone to paradise . The notes also denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. Last week, the jury heard how all the bullets that made holes in the side of the boat were shot from outside the vessel as he hid inside .

"The Islamic State terrorist known as 'Jihadi John' was expelled from Tanzania for being drunk and disorderly on a flight from Amsterdam, the Times has reported. In May 2009, Mohammed Emwazi reportedly indulged in a ten-hour drinking binge to the country en route to Somalia. It conflicts with earlier reports which claimed the 26-year-old was kicked out of the capital Dar es Salaam after the country's authorities were tipped off by MI6. The man who found infamy by fronting a string of brutal execution videos was allegedly traveling with two companions believed to be hellbent on waging jihad. 'Jihadi John': Mohammed Emwazi was expelled from Tanzania in 2009 for being drunk and disorderly on a flight from Amsterdam . Detained: The trio landed at Dar es Salaam airport at 10.50am on May 22, 2009 and after being detained on arrival, they were formally booked into the airport's police station at 1am . Binge: The Times has reported that Emwazi (pictured) and two other men indulged in a 10-hour drinking session on their way to Dar es Salaam en route to Somalia . Jerome Starkey also reports he was traveling to the Tanzanian capital with Ali Adorus, another suspect known to British intelligence services after he was jailed in Ethiopia for terrorism offences. 20 at the time, Emwazi was the youngest of three travel companions made up of Adorus, 27, and a German man from Tanzania known as Marcel Schrodl, 23, who told police he was a translator. The London-born executioner later told the prisoners' rights group Cage he was traveling to Africa to go on Safari. They traveled at a time when Tanzania's borders were easily crossed by jihadists who wanted to join the terror group al-Shabaab, the Times reports. The pilot of the KLM flight they were on warned immigration staff at the airport the trio were causing trouble, the country's home affairs minister has said. It landed at 10.50am on May 22, 2009 and after being detained on arrival, they were formally booked into the airport's police station at 1am. Mr Chikawe claimed MI6 had no role in their expulsion from the country -  insisting that the men were expelled at 8am that same morning for drunkenness. He said: 'They were refused entry because they disembarked from the plane very drunk.' 'They were insulting our immigration staff and other people. They failed to explain why they had come to Tanzania.' Tip-off: The pilot reportedly phoned ahead to inform the airport's security staff of their behaviour . Deported: They were held for questioning in the airport in Tanzania and put on a flight back to Europe at 8am the next morning . He added that other passengers on the flight which made a scheduled stop at Kilimanjaro airport confirmed the men were causing problems in the air. 'The immigration department put them in custody on advice from the pilot that he would not carry them back to Amsterdam,' he said. 'There was no information from anywhere that they were criminal suspects.' Previous reports have suggested that British authorities tipped off security officers in Dar es Salaam because they believed they were trying to join militants al-Shabaab. After being kicked out of Tanzania, the men were questioned in Amesterdam and Dover and later complained about their treatment to Cage. Adorus - whose wife lives in north-London with their child - has since been imprisoned in Ethiopia on terror-related offences. Warning: The pilot on the KLM filight from Amsterdam phoned the security officials in Dar es Salaam to warn them about the trio who had been causing trouble . The British man who claimed to be visiting family in the African nation was sentenced to four and a half years in January. But Cage - which has denied accusations that it sympathising with extremists -  says he signed a 'false confession' under torture. It petitioned then-foreign secretary William Hague expressing concern about the conditions Adorus was being held under. The immigration officer who was on duty that night did not mention drunkenness but said officers were suspicious when the men 'had some queries about their visa forms', Starkey writes. He said: 'Before the passport scan you have to fill out a form. They had some queries about that form and, when we pressed them hard, Emwazi and his colleagues could not respond to our questions, so we took them to the airport police.' A Tanzanian intelligence official said 'there was no stop order' from British intelligence and officials at Interpol also confirmed they had no records of an alert for Emwazi. Now 26, he is known globally as the man who beheaded a number of ISIS hostages including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff - and Britons David Haines and Alan Henning. In a ­series of emails sent to activists at Cage, Emwazi claimed that he was beaten and abused in Tanzanian custody. A Cage statement said: 'The men were threatened with beatings and held for days in inhumane conditions, only to be told that MI5 was behind their rejection from the country.'","Mohammed Emwazi flew to Dar es Salaam en route to Somalia in May 2009 .

"The adoptive parents of a teenager missing from her home for years have received prison sentences from a federal judge who also scolded them for the girl's treatment. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on Friday sentenced Casey Parsons to 10 years in prison for tax fraud. Her husband, Sandy, received an eight-year sentence. Erica Parsons, the couple's niece, lived with the family until she disappeared in 2011 at age 13. She wasn't reported missing until 2013 when her 20-year-old adoptive brother informed authorities of his sister's absence after getting into a fight with his parents. Scroll down for video . U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on Friday sentenced Casey Parsons (right) to 10 years in prison for tax fraud. Her husband, Sandy, received an eight-year sentence . Schroeder said that, after sentencing more than 1,000 people, he has never been more troubled by a case. Last month, the judge delayed the sentencing after a hearing revealed the conditions under which Erica Parsons lived before her disappearance. Prosecutors said the couple routinely abused the girl and continued to collect benefits after she disappeared. Casey and Sandy Parsons collected benefits for their adopted niece after her disappearance,  including a $634 monthly check for adoption assistance. Additionally, prosecutors say the Parsons lied on their income tax returns by using different identities to make up false dependents. According to the indictment, Erica was home-schooled, had hearing problems and learning disability. The Parsons continue to claim that they sent Erica to live with her 'Nan', though the girl's biological mother says no such grandparent exists. The missing teen's biological mother Carolyn Parsons spoke out against the couple's claims, saying she will not give up looking for her daughter, who is now 15. Video from WSOC-TV .

A picture of a younger Erica on the left, while on the right an age-progressed image shows about what she would look like now . She also said she had not wanted to hand her daughter over to her in-laws, but felt she had to because she was unable to bring up the child properly. 'No mother wants to have children and just give them up,' she said. 'I didn't want to. She didn't deserve the life that I had.' Carolyn says she has not seen Erica since January 2011, 10 months before she went missing.

"An oil rig that no longer has any commercial value would usually be destined for the scrap heap, but not off the south-eastern coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah. There stands a redundant rig that's been given a rebirth as a hotel haven for scuba divers keen for a unique holiday exploring the expansive wrecks and reefs next to the tiny Mabul Island. Proud of its origin as a base for oil and gas exploration, Seaventures Dive Rig offers a direct route to stunning dive sites in the famed Coral Triangle. Seaventures Dive Rig  is a refurbished oil rig that was towed to the south-eastern coast off the Malaysian state of Sabah . The refurbished site is also has 27 fully-furnished rooms including twin shares and family rooms, as well as a dormitory . The rig once served as accommodation element of oil rigs around various locations but was given a new lease on life when it was towed from a shipyard in Singapore to the south-eastern coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah. The refurbished site is also has 27 fully-furnished rooms including twin shares and family rooms, as well as a dormitory. There is also more entertainment on offer than one would expect of what is effectively, now it's no longer a working rig, a tin shed in the middle of the ocean. It has a movie room, a karaoke lounge and bar, pool tables, table tennis table, a souvenir shop and a conference room accommodating up to 60 people. It even has free wi-fi access. They also host a weekly barbecue and offer live music in the form of the dive master's band, The Sea Gypsies.

But it's really all about what goes on under water and the remarkably easy access to it, once you get there via boat transfer – there used to be a helipad for helicopter access but that’s now been converted into a sundeck. A major feature of the rig is its elevator that takes divers directly into the reef underneath, which means no longer do divers have to lug their gear on and off a boat. The lift also serves as the main platform for the hotel's 'Rig Jump', which as the name suggests is a chance for guests to leap into the crystal clear Celebes Sea from a height.

"A new 'superviscous' layer in Earth’s lower mantle has been discovered. The breakthrough could explain why parts of Earth’s sinking tectonic plates sometimes stall and thicken 930 miles (1,500km) underground. It could also explain why earthquakes occur deep inside the Earth’s interior, suggesting it is hotter than previously thought. Shown here is a simplified image of a slab from one of Earth's tectonic plates sinking through the upper mantle above,  then stalling and pooling at a depth of 930 miles, where University of Utah experiments suggest the existence of an extremely stiff or viscous layer in Earth . The research was carried out by scientists at the University of Utah by crushing minerals between diamonds to replicate conditions in Earth's interior. Earth's main layers are the thin crust four to 50 miles (six to 80km) deep, a mantle extending 1,800 miles (2,900km) deep and the iron core. But there are subdivisions. The crust and some of the upper mantle form tectonic or lithospheric plates 60 to 90 miles (97 to 145km) thick that are like the top side of conveyor belts carrying continents and seafloors. They are responsible for the formation of continents, and are still active - as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions show. However, researchers have never been able to work out why the Earth developed tectonic plates, but other planets did not. Last year, Yale said it had solved the mystery - and said the key is tiny minerals within rocks. The research suggests how and when Earth came to develop one of its most distinct features - rigid tectonic plates - and why Venus, Earth’s twin-like neighbor, never has. 'We think it all comes down to the behavior of tiny grains of minerals within rocks,' said Yale geophysicist Dr David Bercovici, lead author of research published  in the journal Nature. The researchers argue that in Earth’s early days, mantle convection caused weak zones in the lithosphere - the outermost shell of the planet. These zones persisted, developed into plate boundaries, and ultimately connected to form a global network of tectonic plates. The weak zones, they argue, resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms. This new layer is a ‘superviscous’ region, where liquids are under such intense pressure that they are extremely stiff. It extends from 410 miles (660km) underground to 930 miles (1,500km). In laboratory experiments, the researchers found that an abundant mineral in the mantle called ferropericlase began to increase in strength at pressures equivalent to those 410 miles (660km) underground - the upper-lower mantle boundary. And this strength increased threefold at depths of 930 miles (1,500km) deep. By simulating how it behaves with another dominant mineral at the same level - bridgmanite - the researchers calculated that the viscosity or stiffness of the mantle rock at 930 miles deep is 300 times great than at 410 miles deep. To put that in perspective, on the pascal-second scale the viscosity of water is 0.001, peanut butter is 200 and this stiff mantle layer is 1,000 billion billion. ‘The result was exciting,' said Dr Lowell Miyagi, an assistant professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Utah. ‘This viscosity increase is likely to cause subducting slabs [ones that move under each other] to get stuck - at least temporarily - at about 930 miles underground. ‘In fact, previous seismic images show that many slabs appear to “pool” around 930 miles, including under Indonesia and South America's Pacific coast. ‘This observation has puzzled seismologists for quite some time, but in the last year, there is new consensus from seismologists that most slabs pool.’ Earth's main layers (illustrated) are the thin crust four to 50 miles (six to 80km) deep, a mantle extending 1,800 miles (2,900km) deep and the iron core. But there are subdivisions. The crust and some of the upper mantle form 60- to 90-mile-thick tectonic or lithospheric plates that are like the top side of conveyor belts . University of Utah geophysicist Dr Lowell Miyagi holds a press that houses a diamond anvil, in which minerals can be squeezed a pressures akin to those deep within Earth. Miyagi and a colleague in Germany squeezed mineral crystals in a diamond anvil under pressures like those deep underground . Dr Miyagi added that the stalling and buckling of sinking slabs due to this stiff layer in the mantle may explain some deep earthquakes higher up in the mantle; most quakes are much shallower and in the crust. ‘Anything that would cause resistance to a slab could potentially cause it to buckle or break higher in the slab, causing a deep earthquake,’ he said. Dr Miyagi also said the stiff upper part of the lower mantle may explain different magmas seen at two different kinds of seafloor volcanoes. Recycled crust and mantle from old slabs eventually emerges as new seafloor during eruptions of volcanic vents along mid-ocean ridges - the rising end of the conveyor belt. The magma in this new plate material has the chemical signature of more recent, shallower, well-mixed magma that had been subducted and erupted through the conveyor belt several times. But in island volcanoes like Hawaii, created by a deep hotspot of partly molten rock, the magma is older, from deeper sources and less well-mixed. Dr Miyagi said the viscous layer in the lower mantle may be what separates the sources of the two different magmas that supply the two different kinds of volcanoes. Another implication of the stiff layer is that 'if you decrease the ability of the rock in the mantle to mix, it's also harder for heat to get out of Earth, which could mean Earth's interior is hotter than we think,' he said. The findings could also indicate that Earth's interior is hotter than thought, averaging 2,150°C (3,900°F) at the lower mantle boundary rather than 1,540°C (2,800°F) as previously predicted . Scientists believe the average temperature and pressure 410 miles (660km) deep at the upper-lower mantle boundary is 1,540°C (2,800°F) and 235,000 times the atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface. Dr Miyagi said that at the newly discovered viscous layer's stiffest area, 930 miles (1,500km) deep, the temperature averages 2,150°C (3,900°F) and the pressure is 640,000 times the air pressure at Earth's surface. Such conditions prevent geophysicists from visiting Earth's mantle, so 'we know a lot more about the surface of Mars than we do Earth's interior,' according to Dr Miyagi. 'We can't get down there, so we have to do experiments to see how these minerals behave under a wide range of conditions, and use that to simulate the behavior of the Earth.' The finding was a surprise because researchers previously believed that viscosity varied only a little bit at temperatures and pressures in the planet's interior. The study's simulations also determined that just below the 930-mile-deep zone of highest viscosity, slabs sink more easily again as the lower mantle becomes less stiff. ‘The Earth has many layers, like an onion,’ said Dr Miyagi. ‘Most layers are defined by the minerals that are present. ‘Essentially, we have discovered a new layer in the Earth. This layer isn't defined by the minerals present, but by the strength of these minerals.’","Research was carried out by scientists at the University of Utah .

"A drawbridge, a prince charming and a medieval castle... It sounds like something from a Disney fairy tale, but this is surprisingly all available in Mount Crosby, Queensland (BYO prince charming). Fit with a drawbridge at the entrance and three split level air conditioners throughout, this modern day fortress is available for rent for $550 per week. The property boasts four Tudor-style bedrooms, an open plan kitchen fitted with a gas over and two bathrooms, one with a lion claw foot bath. Scroll down for video . The medieval property is surrounded by small towers on top of the building known as turrets and pointed rectangular windows . A favourite feature of the property is the drawbridge that opens at the entrance and reveals a large timber door . From fine-grained slate floors to long pointed rectangular windows outside of turrets, everything inside the castle, down to the finest detail, illustrates the strong medieval theme. Norma Trench from Brisbane West Rentals told Daily Mail Australia that the background of the Brisbane castle and its owners really is incredibly romantic. 'She was swept off her feet, within four months of meeting, they were engaged,' she said. 'He was her prince charming, so they decided to build a castle.' The castle is located at 79 Sheep Camp Road, Mount Crosby in Queenland and is 22 kilometres South-West of Brisbane CBD . Ben and Penelope Crossman kept the home's original foundations and renovated it in 2009 to resemble their dream castle . The bathroom basins are dark timber and there are old fashioned vanities scattered throughout, the tiles are mostly slate . The Crossman's have relocated to the Gold Coast for work and hope to rent to property out to tenants who will appreciate the fortress's charm . Ben and Penelope Crossman adjusted the original building in 2009 in order to make it look like a medieval castle and once it was erected, they were wed in it and then raised a young daughter. Whilst the property is their dream home,  they have relocated to the Gold Coast for work and hope to rent to property out to tenants who will appreciate the fortress's charm and sentimental worth. 'The love is all in the detail,' Ms Trench said. 'The bathroom basins are dark timber and old fashioned vanities scattered throughout.' The showers in both bathrooms have no curtain or door, continuing the relaxed, open plan theme that the kitchen offers. Outside, the property is completely fenced in and there is a large water tank that is covered in timber to resemble a barrel.

Whilst advertised as a rustic expanse, the property, 22 kilometres South-West of Brisbane CBD, is anything but primitive. Ms. Trench assures that it is a perfect family home with enough modern touches to ensure its security. 'The drawbridge is mainly for visual appeal and there is a really big timber door as the main entrance.'

"It's a job that would make a chocoholic green with envy - eating up to 130 bars of chocolate a week working as an Easter egg tester for Marks & Spencer. That's what Alex Emerson-White has to munch her way through, consuming up to 13lbs of the brown stuff in just five days - and getting paid for it. But it's all in a day's work for the 27-year-old, who lives in London, as she travels the world selecting the perfect ingredients for the store's confectionery - most of which is hand-made in the UK and Ireland. Alex Emerson White travels the world as an Easter egg taster and can get through 6kg of chocolate per week . However, Alex, who so far this year has been testing the luxurious 1.5kg Giant Golden Lattice and children's favourite the Percy The Pig egg, does admit the job does come with a risk - and confesses to going to the gym four times a week to keep off the pounds. And, of course, her friends are always asking her for freebies. Alex said: 'It varies in terms of week-to-week but I can eat 50 or 60 pieces of chocolate, it all adds up to about five kilos. 'I go to the gym before work four times a week to keep fit and healthy.' Although she can get through about 130 bars of chocolate a week, the 27-year-old goes to the gym before work four times a week to 'keep fit and healthy' 'But I can't complain, I have a brilliant job where I get to eat chocolate all day. My friends are always asking for samples.' Alex said she is now planning for Easter 2016 but this year M&S has some star attractions both for the kids and the big kids. She said: 'This year we thought a lot about giving a single Easter egg rather than as many as possible, especially for the adults. 'This year we have the Limited Edition Giant Golden Lattice Egg. We wanted a show-stopping egg that not only looked amazing but tasted divine. Alex tested the 1.5kg Giant Golden Lattice Egg and the children's favourite, the Percy The Pig egg . 'We've been working on perfecting the egg for years but the intricate structure and time it takes to make the egg means we can only make so many. 'We've made the chocoholics' dream come true this Easter - make sure you snap it up before it sells out. 'It weighs a whole one-and-a-half kilos and only 7,500 have been created. Each egg takes over an hour to make and is hand-made and decorated by twelve skilled chocolatiers who are trained to work solely on this egg.'","Alex Emerson-White, travels the world as the Marks & Spencer egg taster .

The launch of Netflix ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the Australian TV landscape in decades. But the online streaming services will still have to convince Australians - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content. This could prove difficult, with a new Canstar Blue survey finding that the majority of Australians are still not willing to pay for TV content. Around one in five are willing to pay up to $20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see.

"A bitter argument has broken out over a city financier's plans to build a vast basement extension under the £11million home where Nobel Prize-winning writer John Galsworthy lived. Caspar Berendsen, a private equity partner in city firm Cinven, wants to build a children's play room, TV room and sitting room underneath the home, as well as adding extra bedrooms. But neighbours, who are already enduring building works at two nearby properties, have branded the new plans 'inhumane', with one long-time resident saying he will move if the work is approved. Vast: Plans submitted by city financier Caspar Berendsen show he wants to add a children's room, TV room, reception room and addition bedrooms to the already sprawling nine-bed, £11million home . The home, in Hampsted, was where Galsworthy wrote much of The Forsyte Saga, his epic series of novels and short stories for which he won literature's highest honour. The author, who was educated at Harrow in West London, and then at Oxford, lived in the property from 1918 until his death in 1933. While there Galsworthy added an extension to the already large property, giving it nine bedrooms. The building work would be knocked down as part of Mr Berendsen's plans. Nobel Prize-winning author John Galsworthy, who wrote the Forsyte Saga, lived in the house from 1918 until his death from a stroke in 1933 . Painter John Constable was fascinated by the house, including it in three of his paintings, including one from the early part of the 20th century named after the property. Speaking to the Evening Standard, actor Tom Conti said: 'It is inhumane to inflict this dreadful noise and everything else connected to such excavation on the people living nearby.' He told the paper that residents had already endured years of noise from a nearby property belonging to former French footballer and Arsenal star Theirry Henry. John Gardiner, 69, a tax barrister who lives next door to Mr Berendsen, said he will consider leaving him home of 30 years if the works are approved by Camden council. Galsworthy was the son of a wealthy solicitor of the same name, and after graduating with a law degree from New College, Oxford,he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1890. After several years of following in his father's footsteps he decided that law was not for him, and instead began writing, publishing his first works under the pseudonym John Sinjohn. In 1904 he first used his own name when publishing novel The Island Pharisees, and in 1906 the first work of The Forsyte Saga appeared, The Man of Property, which was harshly critical of his own upper middle-class background, and based party on his unhappy marriage to Ada Pearson. Galsworthy then moved to Hampsted, where he published The White Monkey, The Silver Spoon, Swan Song, and interludes A Silent Wooing and A Passerby, all of which form part of the Forsyte Saga, alongside plays and other writings. On Forsyte Change was the last volume in the saga, comprising a series of short stories, and was first published in 1930, three years before his death in Hampsted of a stroke. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1932, and was praised as an author and dramatist 'of considerable technical skill', whose works helped drive social change. The Forsyte Saga was made into a hugly popular BBC TV series in the mid sixties, and was brought to life again in 2003 in a series starring Damien Lewis. History: The home featured in three works by John Constable, including this, which was completed in 1922 . Galsworthy wrote the Forsyte Saga, a series of five novels and collection of short stories, between 1906 and 1930. It was made into a TV series in 1967, and again in 2003, starring Damien Lewis (pictured) Explaining his plans for Galsworthy's house, Mr Berendsen said: 'We believe we've approached our planning proposals sympathetically to protect the history of our house and the surrounding area. 'We circulated a detailed leaflet to our neighbours in advance of submitting our application, setting out our planning proposal including a summary of the engineers’ reports addressing, we hope, some of the concerns that we had expected neighbours may understandably have. 'We wish to create a family home for our five children which retains its historical significance in an area of London which we love.'","Nobel Prize-winner John Galsworthy lived at home from 1918 to 1933 .

"Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon has died following a long and difficult battle with colon cancer. The 59-year-old had initially been diagnosed with the terminal illness in 2012 when he was given just three months to live. A big animal rights advocate, Simon had previously announced that he would donate his $100 million fortune to his charity once he passed. He died at home in L.A. on Sunday surrounded by his family and his beloved dog. Scroll Down for Video . Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon has died following a long and difficult battle with colon cancer. The 59-year-old had initially been diagnosed in 2012 when he was given just three months to live . Creators of The Simpsons Matt Groening, James Brooks, and Sam Simon, right, are interviewed about the hit show in the early 1990s . 'For those of us who knew him, his voice will forever echo in our minds; his sense of humor will continue to make us laugh; and his compassion and generosity will continue to impact our lives,' The Sam Simon Foundation said in a statement issued to TMZ. 'Sam, you will be missed by many, but there is a particular sadness among our clinic staff. We have been together for so long, and your absence will forever leave a void in our lives.' 'A great man; I owe him everything,' tweeted The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean, adding that his passing was 'an enormous loss.' Simon was last interviewed in November when he described his illness as the 'most amazing experience of my life', because he was surrounded by his loved ones. After his diagnosis in 2012, Simon immediately teamed up with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) president Ingrid Newkirk, and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation. Having defied that diagnosis' original death sentence, Simon then pushed ahead and has funded projects such as 'Feeding Families' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities. 'They showed me my scans', said Simon to NBC's Maria Shriver Project during last November's interview. Interview last November, Simpsons co-creator Sam Simondescribed his illness as the 'most amazing experience of my life', because he was surrounded by his loved ones . Philanthropy: Simon had decided to donate his estimated $100 million fortune to charity . 'They said these are the scans of a dead man. I said, 'Is it curable?' And they said, 'We don't use that word.' 'I will say that the doctor said, 'I can't cure you, but my job is to keep you alive.' And he has done a remarkable job of it. 'He has done great. I have never been happier, so thank you doctor.' However, Simon did not shrink from the realities of his condition, nor fail to inject some trademark humor. 'Cancer is a horrible disease,' he said. 'Its everything that everybody always tells you. It's a journey, it's a fight. But, if you want publicity and you want to pick up girls, then cancer is the greatest thing in the world.' Simon had no children and wasn't married so had decided to give his millions to causes he cared passionately about. He had been married to actress Jennifer Tilly in the 1980s. They divorced in 1991 and remained close up until Simon's passing. Having already lived longer than doctors initially gave him, Simon told Maria Shriver that amazingly, his happiness was a direct result of his cancer diagnosis. 'Somehow I ended up surrounded by people who love me and take care of me and will do anything for me. That is called happiness. I think I may have had a problem letting it in before. 'Cancer has been a fight, a journey, an adventure and the most amazing experience of my life.' Simon spent his final months funding projects that feed homeless people and saved animals from being killed in animal shelters. Simon created the hit cartoon alongside Matt Groening in 1991. He technically retired from The Simpsons in 1993, but his severance package earned him about $10 million a year. Asked why he decided to dedicate his fortune and final months to animal rights, Simon was unequivocal. Sam Simon, who made a fortune as co-creator of The Simpsons, died on Sunday. Before his death the nine-time Emmy-winning writer-producer used his wealth to, among other causes, help shut down roadside zoos and abusive animal shows, fund a dog-rescue haven in Malibu, and fight hunger . 'The thing about animals that speaks to me so much is that my passion for the animals and against animal abuse is based on the knowledge that these creatures which think and feel can't speak for themselves,' said Simon to NBC. 'I feel it is my responsibility to speak for those who can't speak for themselves.' Simon grew up comfortably in Beverly Hills, where his father was in the garment industry, not showbiz. After turning his drawing talent into a job at an animation studio that made cartoons for kids, Simon submitted a script, on spec, to the ABC comedy Taxi. His script was bought and produced, and Simon, in his 20s, was hired as a staff writer and soon rose to be the showrunner. From there he joined a new NBC sitcom called Cheers, where he was staff writer for its ascendant first three seasons. In 1987 he became a writer and executive producer on the Fox comedy series The Tracey Ullman Show, teamed alongside James L. Brooks, the comedy legend with whom he had worked on Cheers and Taxi, and, of course, cartoonist Matt Groening. They became the founding fathers of The Simpsons. The Simpsons began as interstitial cartoon clips aired during the otherwise live-action Ullman show until, in 1989, it was spun off as a Fox half-hour of its own. Simon was named creative supervisor, and he hired the first writing staff as well as creating several Springfield citizens, including Mr. Burns, the cadaverous industrialist, and Dr. Hibbert, the buffoonish physician. The Simpsons began as interstitial cartoon clips aired during the otherwise live-action Ullman show until, in 1989, it was spun off as a Fox half-hour of its own . Although Simon remained the least-known of the three creators, by many accounts he was the most hands-on. 'You can't overstate his contribution to The Simpsons,' said talk-show star Conan O'Brien, who was a Simpsons writer and producer in the early 1990s. 'No one's smarter than he is.' The show - TV's first successful prime-time animated series since The Flintstones nearly three decades before - caught the public off-guard with its sly but perceptive look at the culture. 'With The Simpsons people didn't know what they were gonna see,' says Simon. 'They didn't have a clue.' The show was given time and free reign to flourish by the fledgling Fox network. 'I don't think you get that sort of creative freedom with any broadcast shows today.' Simon left The Simpsons after its fourth season in 1994 owing to a strained relationship with Groening. But it was a lucrative departure. His exit deal entitled him to royalties from The Simpsons annually pad Simon tens of millions of dollars. Appreciation: Pamela Anderson kisses Sam Simon during award ceremony for her contribution to 'Mercy For Animals' He played no role on the show in nearly 20 years (not even watching it, he said), even as his name remained in the weekly credits along with Groening's and Brooks' - and his checks rolled in. This sweet annuity helped bankroll the causes and alternative lifestyle he came to embrace. Among with his charitable efforts, he established the Sam Simon Foundation, which rescues dogs from animal shelters and trains them to assist disabled veterans and the hard-of-hearing. In March, 2012, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' Norfolk, Va., headquarters were christened the Sam Simon Center in recognition of his support for that organization. Simon's largesse also carried over to humans, too, including a Los Angeles food bank that feeds 200 families each day in Simon style: with a vegan menu.","Sam Simon died on Sunday from colon cancer .

"Jailed: Ali Adorus is currently in jail in Ethiopia after being convicted of terrorism offences . This is the Londoner who travelled on 'safari' with evil Islamic State killer Jihadi John. Ali Adorus, 33, travelled to Tanzania in 2009 with Mohammed Emwazi when the pair were held and questioned by security services before being deported. Adorus, who was born in Ethiopia but grew up in London, is currently in an African prison after being convicted of terrorism offences. The married father-of-one was arrested in Ethiopia in January last year. Authorities say he entered the country in 2011 to try to establish Islamic rule through acts of 'terrorism'. Adorus grew up in a council house in north London and it remains unclear how he befriended Emwazi. He is believed to have worked as a security guard after studying at college in east London. Adorus was also known to the British intelligence services and received support from the controversial human rights group Cage, according to The Times. Along with German national Marcel Schrodl, the three were questioned by security services in Tanzania and later by British intelligence officers in Amsterdam and Dover. They complained about their treatment to Cage, who provoked outrage last week after describing Emwazi as ‘extremely kind’ and ‘beautiful young man’. At his trial in Ethiopia, prosecutors said that Adorus was 'accused of trying to unconstitutionally change the government and introduce Islamic government in Ethiopia by terrorism'. But Cage said that he was simply visiting relatives and gave a false confession in Amharic - a language he does not speak - after being 'brutally tortured'. They said that the case 'confirms a worrying pattern of young Britons of East African descent being harassed by MI5 and later ending up tortured in a third country'. He initially faced the death penalty but was then jailed for four-and-a-half years, along with two other British nationals. An anonymous family friend said that Adorus's relatives would not discuss his case in Ethiopia. Friend: Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as the man behind the 'Jihadi John' mask . Neighbours on the estate where he grew up described him as a 'good lad' and said that they found it difficult to believe that he had been jailed. One of his neighbours in London described him as a 'kind, beautiful and innocent human being'. In August, his wife wrote on a support group: 'We will get him home soon, Inshallah!' Following his arrest and detention in Ethiopia, Cage went on to petition the former foreign secretary William Hague and the Ethiopian ambassador over concerns that Adorus had not received a fair trial. In a letter on the Change petition site, they said: 'I have seen information according to which he was severely tortured in Maekelawi police station. 'According to an urgent appeal made to the United Nations, Ali Adorus was brutally beaten, handcuffed behind his back for an extended period of time, beaten on his hands with heavy wires, hooded, given electric shocks and denied access to a toilet.' Jihadi John: Mohammed Emwazi was expelled from Tanzania in 2009 for being drunk and disorderly on a flight from Amsterdam along with Adorus . In 2009, Adorus travelled to Tanzania with Emwazi and Schrodl, an Islamic convert who may have used the alias Umar and who described himself as a translator. The trio thought to have approached Cage about their 2009 treatment in Amsterdam, after their deportation from Tanzania. The group reported that they and Emwazi were 'repeatedly harassed' by the Dutch and British authorities. Cage compiled a report in which it accused their interrogators of comparing Muslims and Islam to dogs and terrorism. The group said that Adorus had been told by security service officers that 'our details will be passed to the secret services of the whole world'.","Ali Adorus was questioned alongside Mohammed Emwazi in 2009 .

"Hospitals are paying up to £3,200 a shift to hire locum doctors in A&E. Short-staffed trusts are forced to pay exorbitant amounts as they compete to attract agency medics. Full-time doctors say it is ‘demoralising’ working alongside locums earning three or four times as much. United Lincolnshire Hospitals, which runs Lincoln County Hospital, pictured, paid £3,258 for a consultant to work a 24-hour shift in A&E between Christmas and New Year . Figures obtained by Sky News show that United Lincolnshire Hospitals paid £3,258 for a consultant to work a 24-hour shift in A&E between Christmas and New Year. Not all the money went to the doctor as the agency employing them will have taken a sizeable cut. Nonetheless, it is still a considerable amount bearing in mind the locum will have spent much of the shift asleep but ‘on-call’ – where they need to attend only in an emergency. Leeds Teaching Hospitals in West Yorkshire paid £2,099 for a doctor to work a nine-hour shift in A&E over the same period – equivalent to £230 an hour. Three more trusts – the Royal Berkshire in Reading, Derby Hospitals and North Bristol – each paid around £1,800 for an A&E nurse to work 12 hours. The figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show that at one trust, Airedale in West Yorkshire, more than 70 per cent of all doctors’ shifts between Christmas and New Year were filled by locums. As they are generally less experienced and competent than full-time doctors employed by the trust, there is concern that such over-reliance could put patients at risk. The Royal Berkshire in Reading, pictured, Derby Hospitals and North Bristol  each paid around £1,800 for an A&E nurse to work 12 hours . At the Heart of England NHS trust, 58 per cent of shifts between Christmas and New Year were filled by locums, while at the Royal Bolton it was 52 per cent. The NHS is short of A&E doctors partly because staffing levels have not kept pace with the rising number of patients, so trusts have to pay vast amounts to agencies. Dr Clifford Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ‘Market forces really are quite extreme currently, with the lack of permanent people to employ. ‘It means hospitals are desperate to try to find people to fill these slots and are having to pay super premium rates. It can be very demoralising to be working alongside somebody with much less experience, much more junior, who is earning a multiple income compared to you.’ Last month a scathing report by the Public Accounts Committee warned that doctors and nurses were quitting to become locums because the pay rates were three or four times higher. It also highlighted how spending on agency staff had soared by a quarter in the past year to £2.6billion . Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association’s council, which represents doctors, said: ‘Locums play a vital role in the NHS but they should not be used as a long-term solution. Greater reliance on locums is a sign of stress on the system and the result of poor workforce planning by government.’ The Department of Health said: ‘Since May 2010 we have more than 9,500 extra doctors and nearly 8,500 extra nurses. We want to reduce reliance on agency staff and soon hospitals that don’t have their finances in order will have to make significant progress towards halving their agency spend or risk tough consequences.’","Short-staffed NHS trusts pay thousands for locum doctors .

"Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County . An East Tennessee pastor who has appeared on a reality television show about handling snakes in church faces charges of assault and reckless endangerment. Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County. No-one was injured. Elizabeth Hamblin told officers that as she was leaving a park with her four children and Jeremy Henegar, Andrew Hamblin got behind them, and pointed a handgun from his vehicle, reports Knox News. The warrant does not specify the relationship between Henegar and Elizabeth Hamblin, but it states the two share the Hickory Hills residence. Elizabeth Hamblin said that when she arrived home Hamblin pulled up in front of their residence and waved a handgun before he fired a shot in the air. She claims he then pointed a gun at Henegar and fired a second time, missing Henegar and striking the residence, before fleeing. Deputies say Elizabeth Hamblin’s infant child was in the home at the time. Investigators recovered a bullet that was fired into the residence. Hamblin is the pastor of the Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, which uses snake handling in services. Hamblin (pictured)  is the pastor of the Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, which uses snake handling in services . It is thought that the couple have five children including an infant. Deputies say Elizabeth Hamblin’s infant child was in the home at the time . He has appeared on the reality show 'Snake Salvation' on the National Geographic Channel. Hamblin was due in court for arraignment Monday. It wasn't immediately clear whether he had an attorney to reach for comment. In 2013, state wildlife officials seized 53 copper heads and rattlesnakes from Hamblin and cited him for illegally keeping them, but a grand jury declined to indict him. In 2014 Hamblin and his worshipers were evicted from their church because of their fondness for handling venomous snakes while praying and dancing. Clyde Daugherty, who built the LaFollette, Tennessee-based church in 1994, rented the building to Andrew Hamblin for just $267 a month but eventually became fed up with all the serpents slithering about and occasionally injuring or killing congregants. 'Too many people were getting hurt and dying, and that's a proven fact,' Mr Daugherty told . 'He was focused too much on the wrong things, like attention from the media and the TV show, instead of the word of God.' In a November 2013 file photo Andrew Hamblin, with his wife, Elizabeth, arrive for his arraignment. In 2013, state wildlife officials seized 53 copper heads and rattlesnakes from Hamblin and cited him for illegally keeping them, but a grand jury declined to indict him . Hamblin and his wife. He was due in court for arraignment Monday . Investigators recovered a bullet (hole pictured) that was fired into the residence . Hamblin's Pentecostal church practices a rare, century-old Christian tradition of worshiping God with venomous snakes such as timber rattlers, cottonmouths and copperheads, according to Urban Christian News. About 125 such churches exist in the U.S. Pastors use the snakes to show non-Christians that God protects them from harm, holding them aloft as they pray, sing and dance. The belief stems from a literal reading of Jesus' words in the Gospel of Mark: 'And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.' Hamblin's mentor, fellow reality TV star and snake-wielding pastor Jamie Coots, died in February 2014 after being bitten at his church in Middlesboro, Kentucky. His son Cody, 21, took over for him and was also bitten by a snake.","Charges against Andrew Hamblin, 23, stem from a domestic disturbance Sunday at a residence in Campbell County, East Tennessee .

"A Chinese traveller has been thrown in a police detention centre for 10 days after he opened an emergency exit moments before a plane was due to take off. Dong She insists he opened the door by mistake, telling Chinese media he thought the handle was a handrail that he could grab onto for support. The 42-year-old told Chinese news website iyaxin.com: ‘I thought it was like the handrail on a bus.’ The passenger said he had never been seated next to an emergency exit and opened the door by mistake . He told the website that he has flown on a plane before but he had never been seated next to an emergency exit until Saturday’s incident. He said he felt nervous and as a result had stood up and moved to the door to grab hold of what he thought was a handrail. The man, who was travelling with his wife on a domestic flight with Urumqi Airlines in north-east China, said he became scared when the door opened. He told police that escorted him from the plane: 'I didn't see any difference between that and what you see on the underground trains, where you can stand up and hold onto the side if you don't want to be seated. 'I usually find when I'm feeling nervous that it's best to stand up and walk around, and I didn't realise I was doing anything wrong.' In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors on a China Eastern flight in Chengdu . The plane returned to its gate and flight attendants reported the incident to local police, who removed the man from the flight and took him to a police station. He has been detained for 10 days for causing a 30-minute delay for other passengers, who were flying from Urumqi to Zhengzhou. Officials told iyaxin.com that the inflatable slide did not deploy when the emergency door was opened on flight UQ2505. An airline official pointed out that signs are posted on the door to warn passengers not to open it or tinker with its handle. Saturday’s incident was at least the fifth time since December a passenger has opened an emergency exit on a plane in China. Last month, an unidentified man was detained for 10 days after opening a plane emergency exit as passengers were boarding at Nanjing airport, the South China Morning Post reported. He told airline staff ‘The door is not important’ when they asked him why he opened the door, the newspaper reported. In December, a first-time passenger yanked open an emergency door, activating the emergency slide . In January, angry passengers opened emergency exit doors in protest of a weather-related delay as their China Eastern flight taxied to a runway in Chengdu. It led to a longer delay for everyone on board. A month earlier, a man was arrested after he opened the emergency exit ‘to get off quicker’ after a China Eastern flight landed in Hainan. By unlocking an opening the emergency exit, he deployed the emergency slide. Also in December, a rookie traveller yanked open a door on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu to ‘get some fresh air’ shortly before it was supposed to take-off.","Urumqi Airlines plane was preparing to depart Urumqi for Zhengzhou .

"If you've waited until the last minute to book a holiday over Easter weekend, eurozone sunspots are offering plenty of great getaway bargains this spring, a new study suggests. Thanks to a strong pound, the Algarve in Portugal is the cheapest beach resort for a family break, according to a Post Office Travel Money report. Those who aren't sold on Portugal can find similar bargains in the Spanish Costas, Tenerife and Cyprus. Scroll down for video . The Algarve region in Portugal offers the best getaway bargain for the long Easter weekend, a study found . In the Algarve, the cost of meals, drinks and ice creams has dropped 20 per cent over the past year following the pound's rise against the euro. A meal including drinks will cost a family of four just £29.87, which is almost £7 less than last year. The story is similar in the other eurozone resorts, with prices in the Costas almost as cheap as the Algarve following a 15 per cent drop from 2014. Although slightly more expensive, Tenerife and Cyprus also offer tourists exceptional bang for their buck, the study said. Perhaps most important for holidaymakers, the Canary Islands and Cyprus offer more guaranteed spring sunshine than their bargain counterparts. Towns like Albufeira, Portugal (pictured) offer savings of 20 per cent from last year, the study said . In the Spanish Costas, like Costa Blanca (pictured), prices are almost as low as Portugal's Algarve region . Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said in a statement: 'Although holidaymakers will get far more travel cash for their pounds in the eurozone, prices vary significantly between resorts, so the best advice is for canny travellers to cherry pick and book a resort where prices are cheapest.' 'It will be hard to beat Portugal and Spain but, as the weather warms up, Greece is shaping up to be great value too. 'Resorts in Italy and France are more expensive but the good news is that there are big savings for those who want to visit Sorrento or Nice.' Cyprus, while more expensive than Portugal or Spain, does still offer substantial savings - and lots of sunshine . Both Cyprus and Tenerife (pictured) boast the most guaranteed spring sunshine among the eurozone . But Britons looking to save would be wise to stay away from the US, especially in light of a poor exchange rate. For those truly eager to head across the pond, the best value can be found in the family-favourite destination of Orlando, Florida, but prices are still far cheaper on this side of the Atlantic. In Orlando, prices for the six family items surveyed by the Post Office cost twice as much as the Algarve - £68.39 in the home of Walt Disney World compared with £34.31 in the Portuguese coastal region.","Eurozone sunspots offer plenty of bargain holiday prices this Easter break .

"A WWII veteran died a hero  after pushing his wife of 68 years out of the way from an oncoming car. Clark and Betty Biddle, both 88, were high school sweethearts in Ohio. She had waited for him while he served in the army. They had two children, a dog and a vegetable garden. But their  love story took a tragic turn last Thursday as the couple walked across a shopping center to meet high school friends for their monthly lunch reunion. WWII veteran Clark Biddle died a hero after pushing Betty, his wife of 68 years, out of the way from an oncoming car. They were high school sweethearts in Columbus, Ohio . Betty had broken her hip two years ago, and was relying on her husband and a walker to help her move that day. When Clark saw that she was in danger as a car began backing out of a parking space, he didn't hesitate. Betty was bruised, but Clark had been struck. He fell and hit his head, suffering massive brain trauma. He passed away two days later. 'I don't know if I'm going to make it without him,' Betty told the Columbus Dispatch. Betty said she misses Clark 'every minute', and kisses the picture that she carries around of the two of them, sitting at the kitchen table together, 'a number of times a day'. She said she will never get over the sight of seeing her husband on the ground. Betty said she misses Clark 'every minute', and kisses the picture that she carries around of the two of them, sitting at the kitchen table together, 'a number of times a day' Betty said she will never get over the sight of seeing her husband on the ground and that sometimes she wishes she was with him . 'Sometimes I wish I was with him, I really do,' she said. Gary Biddle, the couple's son, said his father was acting on instinct when he saved Betty. He had been her primary caregiver ever since her injury two years ago. 'This is dad, he would sacrifice himself for others and always cared for them, more than thinking about himself,' he told the Columbus Dispatch. Clark was a pilot. He also opened and owned a drive-in restaurant bearing his name for 25 years, and played the saxophone and clarinet for dance bands. He was a well-known member of his community, unable to go to the grocery store without running into people he knew, according to his son-in-law Dan Cress. Clark was also a friendly neighbor. Laura Jones told the Columbus Dispatch that he would let her dog out every day while she was at work after her husband died six years ago. And, without fail, there was always a note and two cookies  waiting for her when she got home. Columbus police said the driver of the car is currently under investigation.","Clark and Betty Biddle, both 88, had been married for 68 years .

"The University of North Florida's deputy police chief has fended off a carjacker with a gun he was given as a gift when he retired from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Bill Strudel, 67, was off-duty and running errands on Monday night when he stopped his SUV to buy ice from a machine, and was approached by a group of young men, including an armed 15-year-old. The teenager demanded he hand over the car and pulled out his gun, which Strudel slapped away. When Strudel tried to knock the weapon away a second time, the teenager pistol-whipped his forehead, leaving a deep gash and damaging his glasses, the Florida Times-Union reported. Not to be messed with: Bill Strudel, the University of North Florida's deputy police chief, was running errands when an armed teenage boy demanded his SUV - but the youngster got a bullet in the behind instead . But the police chief pulled his gun from his waist and fired several times, hitting the 15-year-old boy in the buttocks. He held the teen at gunpoint and several motorists stopped to help until police arrived. The youngster was taken for treatment and he is in custody. Authorities said they were determining whether his weapon was real or a pellet gun. University police Chief Frank Mackesy, who drove his deputy to the hospital for treatment, told the Florida Times-Union Strudel needed numerous stitches. 'The suspect messed with the wrong guy,' he said. 'He was responding in a way he was trained to respond. If it had been anybody else out there, I don't know how this would have turned out.' Scene: Strudel had stopped to collect ice from this machine when a group of youngsters approached him to demand his car. He was pistol whipped by a 15-year-old before he pulled out his own weapon . Support: Strudel's daughter Ashley took to Twitter on Monday to express her admiration of her father . On Facebook, Strudels' wife added that her husband has a bad wound to his nose but has been bandaged up and is doing well. His daughter Ashley added on Twitter: 'Positive of the evening, telling my dad how he's been dubbed a ""badass"" by multiple different people... it made him chuckle.' According to his bio on the university's website, Strudel joined the department in 2005 after serving with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office for 25 years. He has also taught at police academies. When he retired from the Jacksonville force, he was given his service weapon, as is customary when an officer leaves after years of service, according to the Florida Times-Union. 'Things you should be stupid enough to do,' his daughter added on Twitter. 'Attempt to rob a 30 year police veteran that teaches new officers to shoot. #lessons learned.'","Bill Strudel, deputy police chief for the University of North Florida, was running errands on Monday when a group of youngsters approached him .

"Jon Hamm has opened up about his alcohol addiction for the first time. News broke earlier this week that the Mad Men star had just completed a 30 day stint in rehab at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut. The 44-year-old said on Wednesday, ‘Life throws a lot at you sometimes and you have to deal with it as much as you can,’ in an interview with Australian magazine TV Week. After treatment: Jon Hamm completed a 30-day stint in rehab, his rep announced on Tuesday; here he is pictured at LAX airport the same day . When the publication asked him if the life of an actor, where he is often challenged to inhabit dark characters, played a role in his alcoholism he was not entirely dismissive of the notion. 'I've said in varying ways that acting can be a difficult endeavour,' Hamm admitted, 'certainly not as difficult as the recent example I used of being a baby heart surgeon.' ‘But,' he added, 'it does present its own challenges and so does life.’ Just after he checked out: Hamm attended a special screening of Mad Men on Saturday in New York City with the cast of the hit AMC show; here he is pictured with January Jones . One step at a time: Jon was seen heading home in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Staying busy: The same day, he suited up and flashed a smile while celebrating the final episode of Mad Men with the Black & Red Ball in LA . The question was raised as his character Don Draper on Mad Men is not only plagued by personal demons but is a heavy drinker. But Hamm was quick to note how fortunate he felt to have supportive family and friends by his side as he faces his own personal struggles. A rep for the star told TMZ on Tuesday 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon Hamm recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction. 'They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward.' The facility: The Mad Men actor received treatment at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut for alcohol abuse . Inside Silver Hill: Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates . She has helped him: Hamm's publicist told the site, 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon  recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction. They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward'; here the couple is seen in December . On Tuesday he was spotted at LAX looking well dressed in a white double-breasted coat, black cardigan, grey trousers and black boots. He was also wearing a full beard, sunglasses and a hat. It is not known if Hamm has been in rehab before. His Mad Men character Don Draper was known for heavy drinking. The Silver Hill Hospital is a psychiatric hospital that was established in 1931. The facility provides comprehensive psychiatric and addiction treatment services. The campus sits on 42 acres and the buildings have a New England style to them. Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates. His character enjoyed cocktails: Don Draper often drank alcohol; here Hamm is pictured with Mad Men co-star Jessica Paré as they both hold up drinks . Raising a glass: The enigmatic advertising executive is famed for his love of booze . Bottom's up: Don celebrates with a glass of the hard stuff in sixties based drama Mad Men . Speaking to Esquire in 2014, Jon revealed his sisters once encouraged him to see a therapist following the death of his mother from a brain aneurysm. 'I had no concept of what that even meant,' he said. 'I’m a 20-year-old idiot, in the Midwest. This is not Woody Allen New York. We don’t sit around and talk about our feelings. We certainly don’t sit around and compare shrinks.' 'I went to the lady. Sat down and talked to the lady. I gotta say, it helps. Talking to anybody helps. Talking to your friends helps. But your friends are your friends. They’ll tell you what you want to hear. 'The shrink doesn’t sugarcoat it: ""Hey, you’re f***ed up. Do this, this and this. Don’t do this any more."" It’s a wonderful third-person perspective that you get from an analyst. It’s invaluable, I think.' On the move: The 44-year-old actor was seen dressed in layers as he walked through the airport . Work ahead: Jon had a guest starring role on Tina Fey's Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . He added that his performances as tormented advertising executive Don are based on personal experience. He said:  'I hope that lends a deeper resonance. It’s not anything I’m doing consciously. All we can do as actors is bring our own personal experience to the role. 'My mother died when I was ten, so I did have far more experience of being raised outside my family than I had from my own home, probably.' The right scruff! The Bridesmaids star is sporting a generous amount of facial hair that evokes a far more rugged image than his Mad Men Don Draper character . In an interview with the Mail On Sunday in 2012, the actor admitted that his parallels with heavy drinker Don stopped at the character's love of  hard liquor. ‘I don’t drink as much as Don Draper,’he said. ‘I would be unconscious if I did.’ He also revealed to suffering from 'clinical depression' following the sudden death of his father when he was 20. 'I very much knew what the idea of permanence was by that point. I dropped out of school, moved into the basement of my older half-sister Julie’s house, enrolled in a local college and sank into depression,' he said. An end: Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season beginning on April 5 as the AMC drama airs its final episodes . ‘It was the classic definition of clinical depression; you want to stay in bed all day, you sleep till four o’clock in the afternoon. I didn’t have any drive to get up and do anything. It was rough: it stinks. 'Other people who are better than me at putting thoughts into words describe it as a black cloud that descends on you. You become numb. You feel so overwhelmed that it’s hard to take any step towards solving your situation.' Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season, which begins on April 5. He earned a Best Actor  Golden Globe Award in 2008 for his role. Ready to promote the show: On Monday the star was seen with his cast again on the Today show in NYC . Since wrapping the series in July, Jon had a guest starring role in Tina Fey's uproarious Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Jon played Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne, a doomsday preacher who lures four women into an underground bunker for years after convincing them of an impending apocalypse - but they are later rescued. The Office alum Ellie Kemper plays the title character opposite Tituss Burgess, Carol Kane and Jane Krakowski. 'I was very glad they asked me to be a part of it,' he revealed to The Daily Beast. 'Ellie Kemper is a really nice person, and I felt honored to be able to play in the sandbox with the cool kids again.' Incredibly, Jon was 34-year-old Ellie's eighth grade teacher in 1993 after he graduated from the University of Missouri with an English degree and taught acting class at the same school he attended years earlier, John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri. Heavy drinker: Jon told the Mail On Sunday in 2012 that he would be 'unconscious' if he consumed as much alcohol as Don . 'I remember walking the red carpet at the Emmys and seeing Ellie there and going, ""You're here, too! This is so great!""' Speaking to GQ in a recent interview, Jon expressed fear about finding work after his run on Mad Men. 'Look, the one constant thing I've had in my career is now removed,' he said. 'And that's an eye-opener: Are people still going to take me seriously? Am I just going to do romantic comedies for the rest of my life? 'What's next? And I don't know, you know? I wish I was smug enough to have had a grand plan.' Different times: Don flourishes in an age where heavy drinking and smoking are encouraged .

"A victim of child sex abuse herself, former child star Sarah Monahan has weighed into the furore surrounding the Royal Commission into the reporting of child sex abuse, focussing most recently at the elite Knox Grammar School. Monahan was sexually abused as a child by Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes, who was jailed last May for a minimum of six years. On her blog, sarahmonahan.com, the former TV star brought to light the reaction of some people to the allegations against private boy's school Knox Grammar, slamming those who claimed the young boys deserved what they got. 'The Royal Commission into Child Abuse has been uncovering a lot of horrific stories of abuse in Australia,' her post began. Scroll down for video . Former child star Sarah Monahan has voiced her opinions on the Royal Commission into Child Abuse . 'I think while it’s devastating that so many people have been abused, and some of their stories are heart wrenching, some of the reactions to the abuse have been much worse,' Ms Monahan continued. 'Hearing people discuss the abuse at Knox Grammar has kind of shocked me. There are plenty of people online who seem to imply that these kids deserved it because their parents sent them to a fancy pants grammar school.' Ms Monahan, whose claims against Robert Hughes were a catalyst into the investigations which eventually saw him locked up, also recounted her own private school experiences in the strongly-worded post. 'To suggest that the parents of these kids are to blame because they were more interested in sending their kids to a grammar school than a state school is appalling, she also wrote. 'I don’t care if you have a beef with private schools getting money from the government. I don’t care if you once hated a kid who went to a private school. I don’t care if you’re secretly jealous that you didn’t get to attend a private school. Ms Monahan's (centre, front) claims against Robert Hughes (left, front) were a catalyst into the investigations which eventually saw him behind bars . 'Nobody, and I mean nobody, deserves to be abused. Whether you’re a millionaire’s daughter attending Ascham, a janitors kid on a free scholarship at Knox, or a middle class kid attending the local state high school. No matter your status, or income bracket, all children deserve to grow up, free of abuse,' Monahan's piece concluded. Her abuser, Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was sentenced last May after being convicted of 10 child sex offences, committed between 1983 and 1991. Before a packed gallery at the Sydney District Court, Judge Peter Zahra said Hughes had not expressed remorse. 'His conduct continued over 20 years. [Even] after he was questioned by police in 1986 it continued,' he said. 'The offender took advantage of when he was with victims in social settings in his home or at victims' homes. 'He lacks insight into his offending and he is unlikely to access treatment programs.' Ms Monahan (left) was one of the first to speak out against Hughes (right), and in a recent blog post addressed the discussion surrounding Knox Grammar . Once he was found guilty, Monahan reacted to the news by saying she was 'happy' and that she hopes Hughes now 'realises he's a bad man' Monahan's most recent comments come following last week's revelations that former head of Knox Grammar Ian Paterson denied touching a young woman's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys, as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse. In the second shocking day of evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, Dr Paterson said he did 'absolutely not' touch Lucy Perry, who was 15-years-old, during a rehearsal of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1989. 'They were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer,' Dr Paterson told the inquiry, under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission David Lloyd. Dr Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Knox Grammar, provided evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse last week . Lucy Perry, the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of Guys and Dolls. She said the action was greeted by a 'roar of approval' from young men in the crowd . Lucy Perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry, with many standing up to applaud her as she left . In explosive testimony on Wednesday, Dr Paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by Inspector Elizabeth Cullen in 1996. He said on Wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at Knox about whom there had been complaints, he did not give her full information. In reply to David Lloyd counsel advising the royal commission, which is inquiring into Knox's handling of sex abuse complaints, Dr Paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation. Ms Perry, 41, now the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson, the show's producer, had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between Knox and Roseville College. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and (I) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Knox Grammar former headmaster Ian Paterson said on Tuesday that he is 'deeply and profoundly sorry' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student . Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' Ms Perry was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. An arrest warrant has been issued for former Knox teacher Christopher Fotis after he failed to appear at a royal commission hearing last Tuesday . 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. His testimony followed a day of evidence on Tuesday where it emerged Dr Paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years. Others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to resign and Dr Paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures. The hearing on Tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school, and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files. Dr Paterson said Knox conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities, but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or DOCs to protect the school's reputation. He said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had 'made a very silly mistake' and had 'enormous potential in the profession'. In a case involving another teacher in 1987, Dr Paterson said he sent a 15-year-old student to the library to 'think about what he said' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a 'dramatical boy' who 'liked to exaggerate stories'. Purple ribbons were tied out the front of Knox Grammar School in honour of victims of paedophile teachers . Dr Paterson read out a statement apologising for his failings at the beginning of the commission's hearing in Sydney today . Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student in 1988. He added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member. On Tuesday, Dr Paterson was questioned about former teacher Craig Treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite Dr Paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987. Treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years. Dr Paterson said former Knox general duties master Stuart Pearson called him late in 1987 and told him Treloar had shown pornography to a young student. He said he had not asked any further details, including how many boys were shown the tape, how often it had occurred or if he'd propositioned any boys. The hearing continues.

"Most of us welcome the beginning of summer, with its brighter weather and longer days. But for one teenager, it spells the beginning of virtual hibernation - for fear of agonising pain. Autumn Everitt-Brick, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, suffers an extremely rare reaction to UV light and heat. Exposure causes immediate reddening and blistering to her skin, leaving her confined to her home for fear of a painful attack. Autumn Everitt-Brick suffers a extremely rare reaction to UV light and heat. Exposure causes immediate reddening and blistering to her skin . She has since been diagnosed with multiple allergies and conditions including Solar Dermatitis, Vasodilation Disorder and Chronic Actinic Dermatitis . The 18-year-old said: 'Being allergic to the sun and heat has meant I can't lead a normal life like any other teenager. 'Instead I've become nocturnal to escape the sun. 'People often think I'm lying, but it's absolutely devastating. 'All I want to do is simple things in life like walk to the shops or learn how to drive.' While she had always suffered from skin problems, Autumn's condition began to cause severe complications when she was 13 - and suffered a severe reaction to the sun. 'I'd only been out there for ten minutes but my shoulders burnt so badly that my dad compared me to a human candle,' she recalled. 'It was as though my skin was melting and I was inconsolable - the pain was horrendous. 'That's when I think we all knew that something was really wrong as no-one burns like that, it wasn't normal.' Autumn went to see various doctors and dermatologists before undergoing dozens of tests - including one to see if she was allergic to the family's pets. She has since been diagnosed with multiple allergies and conditions including Solar Dermatitis, Vasodilation Disorder and Chronic Actinic Dermatitis. She said: 'All of the different allergies and conditions combined are crippling and make life extremely difficult. 'Even when I go to the hospital or doctors I go beetroot red, because the lights in the waiting rooms are so fluorescent.' Indeed, any UV light or temperature change can cause her skin to dry, crack and come out in hives and lesions which are extremely painful. Autumn's condition has left her confined to  home for fear of a painful attack; she can't even attend school . While she had always suffered from skin problems, Autumn's condition began to cause severe complications when she was 13 - and suffered a severe reaction to the sun . After 10 minutes in the sun as a young teenager, she suffered a severe reaction. 'It was as though my skin was melting and I was inconsolable - the pain was horrendous,' she said . She added: 'It took a long time for me to be diagnosed and I had to wait over six months to see a leading specialist. 'In this time I was prescribed steroid tablets but disastrously they made me put on six stone in a really short space of time. 'I was unrecognisable and developed two near fatal conditions on top of everything else.' As Autumn's condition became worse her parents had to make the tough decision to home school her. She said: 'School became hard as no-one understood what was wrong and people judged me. Matthew Gass, spokesperson for the British Association of Dermatologists said: 'Solar urticaria describes a relatively rare type of urticarial (also known as hives and weals) which is induced by exposing your skin to sunlight. 'While it can start at any age, it appears to be those aged between 20 and 40 who are most affected. 'Solar urticaria is caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells. 'The main symptoms of solar urticaria are itching, stinging and burning. 'Rarely the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties and low blood pressure. 'Taking measures to avoid to sunlight exposure is important to prevent its occurrence and you can do simple things like wear sun cream, sensible clothing, gloves, photo protective window films and take antihistamines.' 'I began to miss most lessons as the florescent lights everywhere were causing me to react and I couldn't escape the daylight. 'It was easier to learn from home and over time we've managed to get my allergies somewhat under control.' Her typical day now consists of waking up at 5pm. 'My dinner has become my breakfast and I stay up all night chatting to people from Australia,' she explained. 'I paint a lot to pass the time while everyone else sleeps and it's become a real passion of mine. 'I can't really remember life before my allergies, but I wish I could do normal things other people are doing my age.' She has been told that as she gets older, the allergies should calm down - but she still worries about the future. Even as a child, Autumn suffered with skin problems. She had eczema by the time she was just six weeks old, but her parents, Andy and Sally, dismissed it and thought it was just irritated skin as she was born healthy with no complications. Mr Everitt-Brick, 45, a freelance software developer said: 'From the age of three, Autumn's skin gradually became more and more irritated. 'We just didn't know what was wrong with her, we tried everything to sooth her skin but it would always dry out again and become really sore. 'It's horrible watching your little girl grow up and not being able to help or know what's wrong. 'It's so tragic as Autumn is now 18 and she should be able to go out and socialise and not be stuck in her room hiding behind curtains.' He added that despite being well educated, his daughter has been unable to sit her exams due to the fluorescent lighting in exam halls. 'She's really bright but it means she has minimal chances of employment, as well as her being asleep all day and awake all night,' he said . Autumn (pictured) has been told that as she gets older, the allergies should calm down - but she still worries about the future . The main symptoms of solar urticaria are itching, stinging and burning. Sometimes the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties and low blood pressure . Autumn's family has now begun fundraising to try and help Autumn lead a normal life. 'Until now we've worked extremely hard to do support our daughter on our own,' her father said. 'But being self-employed is tough sometimes and we can't afford the small things that would make a huge difference to Autumn's life. 'We would like to get UV films for the windows so we can all look outside and know she's safe. 'Even UV safe clothing would mean she could go outside in the day when her friends are out. 'There are a number of things that could help. 'Despite all of this though Autumn is brilliant, she always puts other first, she even donated her hair to The Little Princess Trust last year. 'We are so proud of her, we just want to do everything we can to help her.'","Everitt-Brick, 18, suffers an extremely rare reaction to UV light and heat .

"A necropsy revealed that a mountain lion that wandered near a southern California shopping center on March 6 died after a game warden missed his mark and shot a tranquilizer dart into the animal's lung, officials say. A necropsy revealed that the dart entered the mountain lion's chest cavity and delivered the tranquilizer to the cat's lung tissue, the Press Enterprise reports. A game warden with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife meant to shoot the three-year-old animal in the shoulder or the rump after officials cornered the cat in a loading dock at The Promenade mall in Temecula. Mountain Lion: A mountain lion (photographed) that wandered near a southern California shopping center died after a game warden missed his mark and shot a tranquilizer dart into the animal's lung . The Riverside County Sheriff's Department received several reports of the cat prowling around the mall around 6am and contacted Fish and Wildlife wardens who arrived at around 7am, the Enterprise reports. The game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be released back into the wild,The Los Angeles Times reports. The lion died while it was being transported and no one knew why. However, recent necropsy results show that the male cat, otherwise healthy, stopped breathing shortly after being darted. Kevin Brennan, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife department, told the Enterprise that in most circumstances, wardens don't have the luxury of waiting for the perfect shot. Breathing: Necropsy results show that the male cat, otherwise healthy, stopped breathing shortly after being darted . He said that though the tranquilizer is safe when entering a muscle tissue, it can be fatal when delivered to the heart or lungs. Brennan said that the animal was not menacing to humans and the biggest threat it posed was the possibility of creating a traffic hazard. Wardens intended to release it safely back into the wild, and Brennan said that it is always better if wardens don't have to 'chemically immobilize' an animal. Usually, wardens attempt to simply chase mountain lions away from a populated area if there is a safe route available, but in this case, there was no good exit for the cat, as he had wandered into the middle of town, Brennan said. Fatal: An official said that  though the tranquilizer is safe when entering a muscle tissue, it can be fatal when delivered to the heart or lungs . Rare: A spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being struck with a tranquilizer, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine -- or, in this case, the lung . A spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being struck with a tranquilizer, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine -- or, in this case, the lung. 'They tried to do the right thing,' Lt. Patrick Foy, a Fish and Wildlife spokesman told NBC. 'They have the training and equipment to do the right thing... and it doesn't always work out.' A witness told KTLA that the animal was underneath a trailer for about 45 minutes before authorities arrived. The mall wasn't open, and only a few store employees were around in the early hours. But the mountain lion was reportedly first spotted near a freeway. The animal was not aggressive, the LA Times reports. Officials say the animal could have made his way to the mall area for a number of reasons including simply looking for a suitable habitat.

"When it comes to making embarrassing gaffes, few in public life can match Mexican mayor Hilario Ramirez Villanueva. Already in hot water over admitting it was okay to steal - as long as it was only a little bit - he's now caused anger by flashing a young girl's bum on stage during his recent birthday party on the Pacific coast. To make matters worse, he then sent domestic appliances to women who complained. Mexican mayor Hilario Ramirez Villanueva is in hot water after exposing a girl's knickers to a crowd of 50,000 during his birthday celebrations . Local media said the young woman was a teenager under the age of 18, but there was little public criticism . The faux pas occurred when 44-year-old Villanueva, who is mayor of the city of San Blas, was invited to perform on stage with the band El Recodo. He was filmed dancing with a young girl as the group played then, as members of the 50,000-strong audience cheered, he lifted her skirt up, exposing her knickers. Local media said the young woman was a teenager under the age of 18, but there was little public criticism of him. After the tactless stunt he was bombarded with complaints from women's groups, but he exacerbated the issue by sending them irons and other domestic appliances such as refrigerators and cookers. The girl was clearly embarrassed and immediately pulled her skirt down afterwards . Villanueva was previously in the public spotlight when he admitted that during his first term as mayor he had stolen 'just a little bit' of cash from the public purse . He said that he recognised the equality of women with men 'and their right to develop as a person'. He was previously in the public spotlight when he admitted that during his first term as mayor, when he was a member of the right-wing political party PAN (National Action Party), he had stolen 'just a little bit' of cash from the public purse. Yet there were no official sanctions following the confession by Villanueva, nicknamed locally as 'Layin'. Birthday party reveller Irineo Galindo, 39, who was interviewed by local TV, said: 'I don't care what they say about him, he knows how to throw a good party. And that gets my vote in any election.' The party was reportedly kept moving not only by the band, but by the fact that the politician had provided 1,200,000 beers and meat from 50 cows that were butchered and roasted. According to local media, the party for 50,000 guests had cost 15million Mexican pesos (around £650,700/$970,000).","Hilario Ramirez Villanueva once admitted stealing from the public purse .

"It looks like the aftermath of an earthquake in suburbia. But this broken brickwork is actually the result of a botched building job that brought the house down on a couple’s plan for a basement extension. Ed Goldswain and his eight months pregnant fiancée Jacquie Hale fled for their lives when the building cracked in half, escaping from their ground floor flat with their upstairs neighbours as debris fell ‘like something out of a disaster movie’. That was just the start of their nightmare. For although the builders were found by a judge to have been ‘incompetent’ and were ordered to pay £287,000 damages, the firm is believed to be insolvent, the High Court heard. And while the couple had buildings cover, the insurance company has so far refused to pay up. Now the pair fear they will never see their money – and they are still saddled with a 23-year mortgage on the £345,000 flat. Edward Goldswain and his partner Jacqueline Hale, who was eight months pregnant at the time, were planning to extend their £345,000 ground-floor flat into the basement of this property in Finchley, north London, when disaster struck . Mr Goldswain said AIMS Plumbing & Building Services Ltd were paid to do the work, but he and his partner soon noticed cracks appearing in the walls of the Edwardian home . After a bout of heavy rain Mr Goldswain said he noticed the cracks widening dramatically. The pair alerted their upstairs neighbour and all of them were forced to flee as the building fell down into the basement . Yesterday 39-year-old investment banker Miss Hale described how, in ten or 20 seconds, cracks in the wall went from 1cm wide to 10cm before one side of the building fell away. The trauma caused her early contractions and she had to be taken to hospital. The baby boy was born unharmed six weeks later. Miss Hale and marketing manager Mr Goldswain, 40, bought the house in Finchley, North London, four years ago and decided to extend into the basement. AIMS Plumbing & Building Services Limited began work in September 2012. It went wrong within two months and the couple sued. Last week Mr Justice Akenhead said the ‘overwhelming probability’ was that the builders failed to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill. Barnet council has demolished the building and made the site safe. And the couple – who now have a second son – have been renting as they contest the insurance company’s decision. Miss Hale said: ‘The good news is that we’re happy and healthy and we’ve got two lovely kids.’ The judge ordered AIMS Plumbing & Building Services Limited to pay the couple almost £290,000 for the destruction of their Edwardian home. Mr Goldswain and Ms Hale were forced to move out of their dream property, along with their neighbour, and subsequent checks by Finchley Council revealed the house would have to be pulled down . Broken home: Workers dismantle the property in north London after the botched basement extension. A judge today ruled that it was the builders' 'incompetence' which led to the collapse . In tatters:The builders were ordered to pay £290,000 in compensation to Mr Goldswain and Ms Hale, but the couple were told they may not see a penny because the firm has gone bust . All gone: The couple were forced to live a nomadic existence after the house was taken down (pictured), moving through a string of temporary homes, but have now settled in Harpenden . There is now nothing more than a hole where their old house used to be, with supporting beams used to keep the neighbouring properties up . Edward Goldswain and his partner Jacqueline Hale, who was eight months pregnant at the time, had to run from their flat as the house collapsed . But the court heard AIMS is 'believed to be insolvent', so the couple may well never see any of the money. Describing it as 'a sad case', the judge said the couple bought a lease of the ground floor of 4 Stanhope Avenue in 2011. They needed more space for their growing family and decided to extend into the basement, AIMS starting work in September 2012. However, it all went horribly wrong on November 24 2012 after a heavy rain storm, said the judge. Cracks which the couple had already noticed began to widen fast and 'they could actually hear the fabric of the house tearing apart'. The couple and the upstairs tenant, who had a baby, hastily evacuated and watched as the building crumbled. 'Deeply shocked', Mr Goldswain and Miss Hale escaped with little more than the clothes they stood up in, the court heard. They watched as the flank wall first ballooned outwards before collapsing in on itself. The next door house was also badly damaged. Heavily pregnant Miss Hale went into premature labour due to the trauma, although her baby was happily delivered unharmed. The council took emergency steps to shore-up what remained of the building and it has remained derelict ever since. Since the destruction of their home, the couple have led a nomadic existence, moving between temporary homes, but have now settled in Harpenden. And they suffered yet another blow when they discovered that the loss was not covered by their home insurance. They now face paying off the remaining 23 years of the mortgage, while dealing with the heart-breaking loss of their house, according to the Evening Standard. The couple's lawyers argued that AIMS was 'completely out of its depth' and 'not competent to do the job which it had been employed to do'. And the judge ruled: 'The overwhelming probability is that AIMS failed to carry out their work with reasonable care and skill'. 'The firm had taken no effective steps to to prop up the flank wall or to lay a concrete floor slab which could have averted disaster.' However, the judge said AIMS had 'played no part' in the case and was believed to be insolvent. The couple also sued engineering firm, Beltec Limited, who designed the essential structure of the basement extension. However, whilst expressing 'the greatest sympathy' for the couple, the judge ruled that the company had not been negligent and bore no responsibility for the disaster. AIMS was ordered to pay £287,754 damages - although the couple are likely to face an uphill struggle in getting hold of any of that. Denying claims they opted for the cheapest service on offer, Miss Hale said she considered quotes from a number of builders before selecting AIMS. She and Mr Goldswain checked references and chose a firm that said it had carried out basement extensions in the past. She added: ‘The builder did have insurance, which I made him get, and checked before he started. I also called the company to make sure he had it. But they also declined to cover him.’ Some neighbouring houses were damaged by the collapse, including one that the wall fell against. Some of those neighbours’ sued the couple. ‘They will be paid,’ Miss Hale said. 'Everyone but us gets paid, basically.’","Edward Goldswain and Jacqueline Hale paid AIMS Plumbing & Building Services Ltd to extend ground floor flat .

Rodner Figueroa, left, made the racially insensitive remark on the entertainment news show El Gordo Y La Flaca on Wednesday . Figueroa, 42, was talking about how Ballesteros had transformed himself into the First Lady when said: 'Well, watch out, you know that Michelle Obama looks like she's from the cast of Planet Of The Apes, the movie.' When hostess Lili Estefan countered with 'What are you saying?' and host Raul de Molina said Obama was very attractive, Figueroa defended his remark, saying 'but it is true.' The show aired live on the East Coast, but his remarks were edited out of the version broadcast for the West Coast, reports Latino Voices. Later Figueroa co-hosted the evening gossip show Sal Y Pimienta, but by Wednesday night his photo had already been removed from the network's website. In a statement on Thursday, Univision called Figueroa's comments 'completely reprehensible' and said they 'in no way reflect the values or opinions of Univision.' 'Yesterday during the entertainment show El Gordo y La Flaca, Rodner Figueroa made comments about First Lady Michelle Obama that were completely reprehensible and in no way reflect the values or opinions of Univision.

Venezuelan-born Figueroa made the remark in a segment discussing the work of make-up artist Paolo Ballesteros who posts photos of himself transformed into female celebrities such as the First Lady . On Thursday he issued an open letter apology to Michelle Obama. In it he claimed his comments were taken out of context and that as a member of a 'bi-racial Latin family' he isn't a racist, reports Latin Times. 'I can't accept that I am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years,' he said. 'I come from a bi-racial Latin family, with family members, like my father, who is Afro-Latino.

Univision is the largest Spanish-language network in the United States, reaching an estimated 94 million U.S. homes. It ranks fifth among all television networks in the U.S. Figueroa, who won the Outstanding Daytime Talent in Spanish category at the Daytime Emmy Awards last June, issued an apology on Thursday . Dear First Lady Michelle Obama, . I offer my sincerest apologies for a comment that I made about the characterization from a make-up artist that I made about you in the Univision entertainment program El Gordo y La Flaca. I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and it was directed personally to you, but to the characterization of the artist, that left a lot to be desired. The clip in full context is proof. I feel embarrased, I ask for forgiveness, because there is no excuse for a professional like me to make those types of comments that can be interpreted as offensive and racist in a volatile moment that we live in our country. I take responsibility for this lack of judgement in my part, but I can't accept that I am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years. I come from a bi-racial Latin family, with family members, like my father, who is Afro-Latino. I am the first presenter on Hispanic TV that is openly gay and I am an activist for causes that favor minorities, that have been discriminated against just like me. I openly voted twice for your husband Barack Obama, because I consider him a great man that respects minorities, like me, in this country. I worked on two Univision shows where I commented about celebrity style, including the real family and Latin first ladies and I have never offended anybody because of their skin color, sexual orientation or nationality. I am a decent person, but a human in the end that makes mistakes like this one. Although the comment was unpleasant and out of line I do not deserved being called a racist and I have to defend myself for respect and love to my family, my father, my fans and my community. I was notified verbally that due to a complaint from your office I was fired. An information leak from Univision executives, I was condemend in social media, trying to destroy my career in an unfair manner, without letting me know personally and without an investigation that would allow to clear up the situation. Again, I offer my humble forgiveness for the misinterpreation and I assume the responsibility. Yours respectfully, .

"Zubair Nur, 19, is suspected of attempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS . The deputy head boy of a prestigious Church of England school is feared to have fled the country to join Islamic State. Zubair Nur, 19, is suspected of attempting to travel to Syria to join the terrorist group after he began posting messages praising hate preachers and extremist leaders. The formerly 'happy-go-lucky' student had also started dressing in traditional Muslim attire. Nur's family had raised the alarm after hearing that he had gone missing from university. Police are on high alert for the teenager who they believe may try and cross the border in Turkey. Nur was once a former assistant head boy at Chelsea academy in Surrey and had left the school with good A level grades last year. Former pupils at his school described him as a 'normal' teenager who loved comedy -  particularly Michael McIntyre.' One friend told The Sun that his Facebook posts praising terror chiefs had been out of character. 'It set off an alarm bell among people who knew him,' they added. 'He wasn't known at all for causing trouble or having extreme views.' An anti-radicalisation team from the the Home Office has now been sent to the school to speak to sixth formers. Nur was once a former assistant head boy at Chelsea academy in Surrey and had left the school with top A levels last year .

Lax security has prompted calls for checks on unaccompanied teenagers travelling to Turkey – after it emerged children as young as 13 are allowed to fly with no questions asked. Counter-terrorism officers revealed three girls, two aged 15 and one of 16, all from London, had flown to Turkey, a staging post for extremists wanting to cross the border to join IS. They were not challenged as they boarded a flight to Istanbul at Gatwick on Tuesday. The girls were travelling with Turkish Airlines, which allows 13- to 17-year-olds to travel without supervision. The teenagers were linked by police to another 15-year-old girl who joined IS in December. Exit checks at UK borders were scrapped in 1997. Home Secretary Theresa May has pledged to reintroduce them from April. Emily Dyer, a research fellow specialising in terrorism at the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: ‘Security needs to be stepped up. It should have alerted suspicions.’ The university had written to his family to inform them that Nur had not attended lectures since January and his mother Muna, 43, from Fulham, West London, then reported him missing to Scotland Yard. An Interpol manhunt is now under way to track down Nur in Turkey where ISIS recruits attempt to cross the border into Syria. Zubair Nur is the latest in number of young Muslims who are feared to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS. Last month, three schoolgirls, aged 15 and 16, flew out of the UK to join jihadists in Syria. Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and a 15-year-old German girl, who has not been named at the request of her family, were believed to have left to marry jihadi fighters. It is understood the three girls – all straight-A pupils – were lured to Syria via social media by a school friend who is already there. There have been growing calls to tighten up security checks on youngsters flying out of the UK. Around 550 young Britons are thought to have made the journey to join Islamic State. Just last week, nine British medical students and doctors were believed to have travelled to the war-torn country to work in areas controlled by Islamic State militants. Around 550 young Britons are thought to have made the journey to join Islamic State including three schoolgirls, aged 15 and 16, who flew out of the UK to join jihadists in Syria . The group, all in their late teens or early 20s, had been studying medicine in Sudan and some have sent messages home to their parents to say they were doing voluntary work. They include Mohammed Wael Fadlallah, Tasneem Suliman, Ismail Hamdoun, Nada Sami Kader, Mohammed Elbadri Ibrahim, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tamir Ahmed Abusibah, Lena Maumoon, Sami Ahmed Kadir. Family of the medical students were said to be extremely concerned about their welfare and some had travelled to Gaziantep in southern Turkey to try to find them. Islamic State has even published a detailed travel guide for would-be recruits with information on how to get to Syria and what they should pack.

The 50-page manual called Hijrah, meaning 'holy emigration', includes details of safe houses and routes for Western wannabe jihadists and has been compared to a gap year travel guide. Aimed specifically at young people, its full title is 'Hijrah to the Islamic State: What to pack up, who to contact and where to go. Stories and more!' Published in English, it boasts that ISIS members 'live in Turkey in some peace because Turkey fears revenge attacks', enabling them to help ISIS recruits slip over the border into neighbouring Syria without being caught.

"The captain of the Germanwings plane which crashed into the Alps tried to break down the cockpit door with an crowbar after his co-pilot locked him out, it emerged on Friday. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is believed to have deliberately flown the Airbus A320 into the side of a  mountain after locking the captain out of the cockpit,  killing himself and all 149 others on board. The flight recorder showed that Patrick Sonderheimer repeatedly knocked on the door of the cockpit as the plane began to descend. But he resorted to using a crowbar to try and get through the armoured panel as the plane plunged fatally towards the Alps. Scroll down for video . French prosecutor Brice Robin sensationally reveals that the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings Airbus A320 locked his captain out of the cockpit before deliberately crashing into a mountain to 'destroy the plane' Audio taken from the black box voice recorder (pictured) salvaged from the obliterated wreckage of the Airbus A320 reveals that co-pilot - 28-year-old German Andreas Lubitz - locked the captain out of the cockpit . First picture: Germanwings co-pilot - 28-year-old German Andreas Günter Lubitz (above) - deliberately crashed into a mountain to 'destroy the plane', it has been revealed . Rescue workers sift through the wreckage of Germanwings Airbus A320 which was deliberately flown into the French Alps . German newspaper Bild yesterday reported that he had attempted to use an axe, and a Germanwings spokesman confirmed that such a tool was on board the aircraft. But it emerged last night that the only axe on the plane would have been in the cockpit, meaning it was out of reach of the captain. The latest revelation came after the final moments of the flight, were described in horrific detail by Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin. Data extracted from the black box recorder shows that co-pilot - 28-year-old German Andreas Lubitz - locked the captain out of the cockpit and intentionally destroyed Airbus A320 on Tuesday. Mr Brice said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'. Mr Brice said that earlier in the flight Lubitz's responses, initially courteous, became 'curt' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane. The captain - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter. Mr Robin said: 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something. 'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane. 'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit.' The pilot is heard asking the co-pilot to take over and it is assumed the captain left the cockpit (pictured) and 'went to the toilet or something' Obliterated: Search and rescue teams sift through the wreckage of the Germanwings plane on Wednesday . Debris from the jet, operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline, was found near Barcelonnette . Mr Robin said Lubitz 'voluntarily' refused to open the door and his breathing was normal throughout the final minutes of the flight. 8.55am - The Airbus A320 takes off from Barcelona, Spain, and is expected to land in Dusseldorf, Germany, approximately 90 minutes later. It is carrying 150 people: 144 passengers and six crew members. A transcript recovered from the black box of the plane's final 30 minutes reveals that for the first 20 minutes the two pilots talk in a 'normal fashion', according to Mr Robin. Preparation for the plane's arrival can then be heard in the cockpit. It is at this point the pilot asks Mr Lubitz to take over, a chair is pushed back and the door closes. Co-pilot Mr Lubitz uses the flight monitoring system to start the plane's descent, an action which can 'only be done voluntarily'. Through the on-board intercom system, the pilot is heard trying to regain entry to the cockpit, but there is no answer from Mr Lubitz. The pilot then knocks on the door, again getting no reply. 9.30am - Air traffic controllers get no response from the plane after they attempt to make contact. It is at this time that the plane reaches a height of 38,000ft, according to flightradar24. 9.30am- 9.40am - The plane drops from 32,000ft to 6,175ft, where flightradar24 logs its final position on radar. All that can be heard from the cockpit from this moment until the plane crashes is the co-pilot breathing, apparently normally. During this descent, the pilot can be heard trying to break the cabin door down and alarms go off - indicating the plane's close proximity to the ground. A first crash is audible, but the final impact happens several moments later. During this time, no distress signals are sent out. Passengers are only heard screaming during the final few moments of the recording, implying they were initially unaware anything was wrong until just before the plane crashed. He said: 'His breath was not of somebody who was struggling. He never said a single word. It was total silence in the cockpit for the ten past minutes. Nothing.' Air Traffic Control at Marseille asked for a distress signal, but there was still no response, said Mr Robin. He added: 'So the plane becomes a priority for a forced landing. 'Control asks other planes to contact this Airbus and no answer is forthcoming. 'There are alarm systems which indicate to all those on board the proximity of the ground. Then we hear noises of someone trying to break into the door. 'The door is reinforced according to international standards.' Mr Robin went on: 'Just before final impact we hear the sound of a first impact. It's believed that the plane may have hit something before the final impact. 'There is no distress signal or Mayday signal. No answer was received despite numerous calls from the tower.' Lubitz had just 600 hours of flying experience after joining Germanwings in 2013 straight from training. He was, however, highly regarded, having won an award from the Federal Aviation Administration in 2013 for his outstanding flying skills. The investigation is now a full-blown criminal enquiry. The plane was carrying six crew and 144 passengers, including 16 German teenagers returning home from a school trip, who had reportedly won the trip in a lottery of their classmates. It was the deadliest air crash on the French mainland since 1974 when a Turkish Airlines plane crashed, killing 346 people. Lufthansa said the aircraft was carrying citizens of 18 countries. Three Americans and three Britons were confirmed among the victims. Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, France, Holland, Israel, Japan, Mexico and Morocco also had nationals on board, according to officials.

"Ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez's fiancée took the stand in his murder trial on Friday as a key witness who was granted immunity after charges she initially lied to a grand jury investigating the case. Shayanna Jenkins, 25, was seen entering the Fall River court in Massachusetts on Friday accompanied by her lawyer and wearing her large diamond engagement ring. She told the jury that Hernandez was intoxicated and had smoked marijuana in the hours before the slaying of her sister's boyfriend, Odin Lloyd. Jenkins said she watched her partner leave their home with alleged accomplices, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, on the night of the June 2013 murder. Jenkins also told jurors that she found a handgun in a kitchen 'junk' drawer before the June 17 murder of Lloyd, who was also her sister Shaneah's boyfriend. When she woke the following morning, her fiancée was not in their bedroom and she did not see him for several hours - but when she did, Hernandez was acting 'normal'. Scroll down for video . Shayanna Jenkins, fiancee of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, testifies during his murder trial on Friday. Here, she demonstrated the length of the gun kept in their 'junk' kitchen drawer . Aaron Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, entered court on Friday in Massachusetts where it was expected that she would testify at his murder trial. The 25-year-old was sporting her huge engagement ring . Shayanna Jenkins' sister and the victim's girlfriend, Shaneah Jenkinds, listened to her sister describe their relationship as estranged while on the stand on Friday. Ursula Ward, the victim's mother, sits to her right . Shayanna Jenkins was granted immunity by the court in February, which meant she could be compelled to testify or face time behind bars. Jenkins cannot be charged in connection with Odin Lloyd's murder but can still face perjury charges if she is caught out lying on the stand. There had been a question about whether prosecutors would call Jenkins, who has been in a relationship with Hernandez, 25, since high school and is the mother of his two-year-old daughter. On Friday morning, she told the judge and lawyers during a session without the jury present that she had spoken with Hernandez after she found out about the murder of semiprofessional football player Lloyd. 'I asked him if he did it,' she said. 'He said ''no.''' Before Jenkins took the stand, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh announced that a male juror had been dismissed from the case, but she didn't elaborate. He is the third juror to be dismissed from the trial. Fifteen jurors remain, and three of those will be alternates chosen randomly after closing arguments. She avoided looking at Hernandez as she testified. As she left the stand for recess, she mouthed something to him, and her face looked ashen. The 25-year-old took the stand on Friday morning, wearing a long, full pink skirt and black turtleneck sweater. Shayanna Jenkins, right,  fiancee of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, left, walks away after testifying at his murder trial for lunchtime recess . She appeared confused by some questions and took long pauses as she testified about her actions in the days surrounding Lloyd's murder. Her testimony was peppered with 'don't know' and 'maybes'. Fox 25 reported that Shayanna's younger sister, Shaneah Jenkins, who was dating murder victim Odin Lloyd at the time of his death, was also in court on Friday. She sat alongside Odin's mother, Ursula Ward. The prosecution asked Shayanna about the sisters' relationship. She struggled to come up with a response, before answering: 'We're estranged.' Aaron Hernandez nervously watched his fiancée as she gave testimony at his murder trial on Friday . On Friday, Jenkins testified that she had found a black gun in the house in North Attleboro where she had moved with Hernandez and their daughter in late 2012. 'I found it in my junk drawer,' she told Assistant District Attorney William McCauley. 'I don't really remember the size.' When she found it, she found Aaron and gave him a 'stern look' - but didn't remember having any conversation about the firearm. Later, the gun was gone. It was the only gun she had seen at her home, she said. Miss Jenkins was then asked if the gun she had seen in the junk drawer was the same as Hernandez was allegedly seen on surveillance camera holding by his basement door. Jenkins told the court that she couldn't be sure if her fiancée was holding a gun, as it looked like a 'black blob'. Assistant District Attorney William McCauley held up a Glock in the courtroom, and Jenkins said it was similar in color and shape, but she was unsure how it compared in size. Jenkins furrowed her brow when the weapon was brought close to her and asked if the gun had been secured. Prosecutors earlier accused Jenkins of lying to a grand jury 29 times as it probed Lloyd's murder, including falsely saying she did not know where she had disposed of a box Hernandez asked her to get rid of after the killing. She pleaded not guilty to the charges, but acknowledged on Friday she had taken steps to conceal the box. On Friday, chief prosecutor McCauley tried to have her reveal her actions based on a cryptic text message that Hernandez sent her about an electronics box, which contained home surveillance tapes, in their basement. Jenkins claimed not have understood his message. Prosecutors say she lied to a grand jury investigating the June 17, 2013, killing of Odin Lloyd, 27, who was dating her younger sister, Shaneah. Lloyd was found shot to death at an industrial park less than a mile from the home that Jenkins and Hernandez share. The sisters introduced Lloyd and Hernandez in 2012, during a game at Gillette Stadium. Shayanna Jenkins has been coming to court sporadically and sitting behind Hernandez, whispering 'I love you,' to him and occasionally joking with him. Jenkins was shown a firearm in court on Friday and was asked to confirm if it was similar to the gun she had found in her 'junk' drawer of the kitchen at her home .

Terri Hernandez  listens during the murder trial of her son and former NFL player Aaron Hernandez at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River on Friday . Prosecutors earlier accused Shayanna Jenkins of lying to a grand jury 29 times as it probed Lloyd's murder, including falsely saying she did not know where she had disposed of a box Hernandez asked her to get rid of after the killing. Here she is seen on her home's surveillance tape carrying a trash bag from inside . She has not appeared in court since March 6. That day, she was not wearing a large diamond engagement ring that she usually wore. Meanwhile, Shaneah Jenkins sits with Lloyd's mother and other family members. When Shaneah was called to testify earlier in the trial, Shayanna scribbled notes and then passed them to Hernandez's lawyers, occasionally sighing as her sister spoke. Surveillance video played for the jury showed Shayanna removing from their home a garbage bag with what appeared to be a box inside. Prosecutors said before the trial that they believe the box contained the murder weapon, which has never been found. Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was dropped from the team after his arrest. His suspected accomplices, Wallace and Ortiz, have also been charged with murder and will be tried separately. They have pleaded not guilty. On Friday, police arrested a man who they allege called in a bomb threat that forced the evacuation of the Massachusetts courthouse where Aaron Hernandez's murder trial is being held. Fall River police on Friday announced the arrest of 55-year-old Paul Haddad of Westwood. Haddad was scheduled to be arraigned Friday. It's not known if he has a lawyer who could comment on the accusations. Police said Thursday's threat had nothing to do with Hernandez, the former New England Patriots player. Police did not disclose a motive. Westwood and Fall River are about 50 miles apart. The Fall River Justice Center was evacuated for about an hour on Thursday while the building was searched. Nothing dangerous was found.","Shayanna Jenkins, 25, entered the Fall River court in Massachusetts on Friday morning accompanied by her lawyer .

"Guests at a wedding service saw triple when three identical sisters tied the knot together at the same ceremony. Triplets Rafaela, Rochele and Tagiane Bini share the same birthday, the same looks and tastes, and now - after marrying men who look strikingly similar - the same wedding anniversary too. The 29-year-old sisters, from Passo Fundo, southern Brazil, even wore the same wedding dress, as well as hair style and make up, for their big day on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Triplets Rafaela, Rochele and Tagiane Bini share the same looks and now the same wedding anniversary after getting married on the same day . The triplets, pictured with their new husbands Rafael, Gabriel and Eduardo, wore the exact same wedding dress, as well as hair style and make up, for their big day on Saturday . A different colour of bouquet was the only clue to help bewildered friends and family distinguish one bride from the other. Even the grooms - Rafael, Gabriel and Eduardo - admitted they had worried they might mix up their wives-to-be when it came to exchanging vows. Rafael, who married Rafaela, told how the girls sometimes deliberately confused their fiances. He remembered: 'There was a time when we were all in the kitchen making dinner. So Rochele, who is Gabriel's, was doing stuff at the sink, and Rafaela was at the stove. 'We were there chatting and they changed places. I went behind to hug her, and said ""oops"" when I realised I'd got the wrong girl.' On the day, though, the men insisted they didn't have a problem recognising the loves of their lives. 'Oh yes, I knew which one was mine, for sure. I knew as soon as she entered the church, she was the most beautiful,' said Eduardo, who married Tagiane. The sisters told how, like other identical siblings, they have always been close and shared the same tastes and interests since they were babies. Bond: Like many identical siblings, the sisters told how they have always been close and shared the same tastes and interests since they were babies . Together: It was parents Pedro and Salete who suggested the girls all get married together after Tagiane also got engaged to Eduardo . Their parents, Pedro and Salete, already had one daughter, Liziele, when they decided to increase the family - but never imagined three more girls would come at once. Mother Salete fainted when she was told she was expecting triplets, according to the girls. Rafaela was the first to find her future husband, Rafael, ten years ago while studying at university. A year later, Rochele got together with Gabriel. It was parents Pedro and Salete who suggested the girls all get married together after Tagiane also got engaged to Eduardo. The only dilemma for Pedro, a farmer, was how he would walk all three daughters down the aisle at once. He said: 'We decided that we would all walk down the aisle until half way down the church. From there, I would take one at a time.' The pews at the Nossa Senhora Aparecida catholic cathedral in Passo Fundo were moved apart to allow more space for the three brides to walk down the aisle together. They were followed by 18 bridesmaids and page boys, each using the chosen colour of the bride they were representing, yellow for Rafaela, blue for Rochele and red for Tagiane. The first to be taken to the altar by their father was Tagiane, who was the first to be born. She remembered: 'I tried to hold back my emotion, but I couldn't. To see my dad there, at that moment, was a feeling I can't explain.' Event: The pews at the Nossa Senhora Aparecida catholic cathedral in Passo Fundo were moved apart to allow more space for the three brides to walk down the aisle together . Lookalike: The girls explained how they all went together to get their hair and make-up done with the intention of looking different - but they all ended up liking the same style . The girls explained how they all went together to get their hair and make-up done with the intention of looking different. But, said Rochele, 'We tried a number of styles, but we all liked the same one. It's not even worth trying, it always ends up like that.' After the ceremony, the fact that there were three bouquets to be caught was not lost on the female guests, according to the sisters. And for Eduardo, the fact that triplets run in their wives family hasn't put the husbands off. He said: 'We're going to think about starting our family. If we have triplets, it won't be easy, but they will be a blessing and we'lll raise them with love.'","Rafaela, Rochele and Tagiane Bini from Brazil all got married on same day .
