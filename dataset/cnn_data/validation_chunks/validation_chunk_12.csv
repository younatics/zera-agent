"After carrying the Dallas Cowboys into the playoffs, DeMarco Murray will stay in the NFC East. But he will be suiting up in Philadelphia as a vital cog in Chip Kelly's offense. The NFL's Offensive Player of the Year is set to sign a five-year deal worth more than $40million, with more than $20m guaranteed, according to NFL.com's Albert Breer. Murray became the NFL's leading rusher thanks to a career-high number of carries (392) and working behind one of the best offensive lines in football. DeMarco Murray is set to join the Philadelphia Eagles after four seasons with the Cowboys . In a career-high year, Murray carried the Cowboys into the playoffs for the first time in five years . With rumours that veteran Evan Mathis is to be traded, the Eagles do have the youth or consistency in that position group. The 27-year-old had a career-high season with 1,845 yards and 13 touchdowns, but Dallas let him enter the free agent market. And it was Murray who initiated the meeting with the Eagles head coach Chip Kelly, ESPN report. Kiko Alonso (LB, from Buffalo) Byron Maxwell (CB, from Seattle) Walter Thurmond (CB, from New York Giants) Sam Bradford (QB, from St Louis) DeMarco Murray (RB, from Dallas) Ryan Mathews (RB, from San Diego) Expressing a desire to play in Kelly's fast-paced, spread offense, he spoke of his friendship with Sam Bradford, with whom he played at college in Oklahoma for two years. After joining from St Louis in the remarkable trade with Nick Foles, Bradford confirmed he played a part too. 'Absolutely. I've been trying my hardest,' Bradford said. 'I've called him. I've texted him. I've done everything. We've been in communication. If we can somehow land him, it would be a great pickup. Not only is he a great player, he's a great person. He's a really close friend of mine, too. I think he can really help this ball club.' The Eagles, who have had an eventful free agency, also announced the signing of fellow running back Ryan Mathews. The former San Diego Charger joins on a three-year, $11.5m contract, with a guaranteed $5m. With Darren Sproles already in situ, it gives Kelly a loaded backfield and the ability to use multiple backs.","Murray has signed a bumper five-year deal worth more than $40m with more than $20m guaranteed .

"After winning the Super Bowl, Darrelle Revis is heading back to the New York Jets. Two years after his acrimonious departure to Tampa Bay, the shutdown corner again showed his mastery of free agency, signing a vast five-year, $70million deal. With $39m guaranteed, Revis will pocket $16m-a-season in the first three years, NFL insider Ian Raport reports. At 29, the six-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro is among a number of new additions as the Jets look to break their four-year spell without a play-off place. Darrelle Revis defends Jeremy Kerley in the Patriot's narrow 17-16 win over the Jets in December . Revis lasted a year with the Buccaneers after penning a six-year, $96m deal with no guaranteed money. The Patriots moved swiftly following his release last year, with the parties agreeing on a $32m two-year deal. Owner Robert Kraft declined to take up the $20m second-year option, opting to re-sign safety Devin McCourty on big money instead. The deal appears a questionable one for the Super Bowl-winning Patriots. Revis and the recently released Brandon Browner gave them a secondary that was the envy of the AFC. But they lose a locker room leader  to an AFC East rival and Bill Belichick has to rebuild his secondary once more. With $50m cap space, it has already been a busy free agency for Gang Green and new head coach Todd Bowles. Alongside the marquee signing of Brandon Marshall, cornerback Buster Skrine joined from Cleveland, guard James Carpenter comes in from Seattle and linebacker David Harris was re-signed.","Revis rejoins the Jets, the franchise who exchanged picks with Carolina to move up and draft him 14th overall in the 2007 .

"Not content to bring back Darrelle Revis, the New York Jets have re-signed Antonio Cromartie too. The pair played together for the Jets from 2010-12 and after his return to Gang Green after winning the Super Bowl with New England, Revis announced he would reach out to recruit 30-year-old Cromartie. 'I’m going to get in contact with him very soon here,' he said, 'and try to convince him to hopefully come back and join our Batman-and-Robin tandem we had a couple of years ago,' Revis said. Cromartie obviously liked what he heard and re-joins on a four-year, $32million contract. He expressed his delight on Twitter, saying: 'Something like a dynamic duo.. Happy to shutdown QB's with my bro @revis24 again!' Antonio Cromartie breaks up a pass broken aimed for Denver Broncos' wide receiver Andre Caldwell . As Todd Bowles begins to put his stamp on the franchise, Cromartie is the third cornerback to join after Revis and Buster Skrine, who signed from the Cleveland Browns.

They are said to be interested in Marcus Gilchrist, who is now a free agent after four years with the San Diego Chargers, ESPN report.

"Reggie Wayne's 14-year career with the Indianapolis Colts is over. The 36-year-old six time Pro Bowler is second in franchise history in receptions (1,070), receiving yards (14,345), touchdown catches (80) and 100-yard games (43). He was a cornerstone of the Colts' Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears, hauling in a 53-yard touchdown pass to open their scoring in Miami. Wayne did not miss a game from 2003-2012, but his career stalled after an ACL injury in 2013 and an elbow injury the following year. Reggie Wayne joined the Colts in 2001 as a first round draft pick and won the Super Bowl in 2007 . Wayne remains one of the Colts' most popular players with fans celebrating their hero in 2011 . 'Reggie is one of the greatest men to ever wear the horseshoe, and we have been blessed to watch him play for the past 14 years,' Colts owner Jim Irsay said in a statement. 'When he first took the field with us in 2001, we knew this day would eventually arrive. That reality is one of the things that makes pro football such a tough business.' He remains the league's active leader in receptions and receiving yards, and third in touchdowns.","The Colts part ways with one of the greatest receivers in franchise history .

"For a man who had just made it to the Champions League quarter-finals and broken the record for goals scored in European competition, Cristiano Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure as he left the pitch shaking his head on Tuesday. The mood of the world's best player hadn't changed when he emerged from the home-team dressing room and told waiting television crews that he would not be talking again publicly until the end of the season. The significance of 'the end of the season' is that by then we will know just how much a campaign that promised so much for Real Madrid has delivered. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring, but he couldn't prevent his side slumping to a 4-3 defeat . Ronaldo vowed he would not talk publicly again this season after the defeat by Schalke on Tuesday . Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo watches on with his hands on his hips as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar celebrates . Much more will also be known about the futures of Ronaldo - Real Madrid's top scorer — and also his team-mate Gareth Bale and his coach Carlo Ancelotti. Supporters at the Bernabeu turned on Ancelotti even before Real's 4-3 defeat by Schalke had started, with the manager's name jeered as it was announced before kick-off. Bale was whistled at in the second half while goalkeeper Iker Casillas also bore the brunt of the discontent, more justifiably because he could have done more about Schalke's first two goals. When Casillas, as captain, summoned his team-mates into the centre-circle at the final whistle they went reluctant — Ronaldo more than most — but were met with more resounding boos and a show of white handkerchief protest. Casillas has said he wants to stay until he is 40 but Real want Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, and every day that passes without him signing a new deal at Old Trafford leads them to believe they still have a chance. Some Real Madrid fans waved a white handkerchief after the final whistle on Tuesday night . Iker Casillas has been below his best for some time, but replacing him is not as simple as it sounds . Casillas called on his team-mates to acknowledge the home supporters following the surprise defeat . Casillas pulls midfielder Isco toward the centre circle to applaud the fans . United will be watching the potential unravelling of Real's season closely. The campaign could still end gloriously if important injured players like Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez and the fit-again Luka Modric return to their best ahead of the Champions League latter rounds. But what if things don't end well? United have made little secret of wanting Bale at the end of this campaign. He is happy in Spain but how many times can a player have his first mistake verbally chastised by his own fans before he starts to wonder if he might not be better off elsewhere? The former Tottenham star is not a particularly social animal and has not put down any great emotional roots in the city. United must be encouraged by the fact that despite him winning four trophies in his first year at the club, supporters are doing nothing to cultivate a lasting bond. Gareth Bale was subjected to boos from Real Madrid fans as they were beaten at home by Schalke . Bale has not scored for the Champions League winners in his last nine appearances . The former Tottenham player endured another night to forget as Real were beaten but crept through . United have also considered the impact that recapturing Ronaldo would create. And they were interested in Ancelotti before they turned to Louis van Gaal to replace David Moyes. The Italian stayed at Madrid and won his third Champions League but he is now drawn to the idea of an English return and the wheels have been set in motion to push his profile in England – not that anyone needs reminding how well he did at Chelsea. No-one at Madrid is suggesting Ronaldo, Bale and Ancelotti all park up at Old Trafford this summer with De Gea moving the other way but there is a sense that there will be an overhaul at the end of the season and with instability prevailing it might not just be squad players such as Alvaro Arbeloa, Fabio Coentrao, Asier Illaramendi and Sami Khedira who leave. At any club such rumblings would be dismissed as ridiculous but the knee-jerk short-termism at Madrid is nothing new. Carlo Ancelotti, pictured hugging Roberto Di Matteo, is under growing pressure at the Bernabeu . Ancelotti's future at Real is the subject of discussion despite delivering the club their 10th European Cup . Ancelotti looks to the skies as his side sneak into the last eight of the Champions League . An online poll asking which striker should be dropped from the 'BBC' front three of Benzema, Bale and Cristiano (the one that was 'the best in the world' just three months ago) was carried out this week by Diario AS. Bale registered 40 per cent and Ronaldo 33 per cent. Ancelotti sticks up for both but no one sticks up for him. As he said earlier this week: 'When we win it's got nothing to do with me, when we lose it's my fault.' Post match on Tuesday he was even asked if: 'Knowing the business as he does, would he be surprised if he was sacked after defeat to Schalke?' He has them in the last eight of the Champions League in spite of an injury crisis; Ronaldo has already scored as many goals this season as last; and Real are only a win in next week's Clasico away from returning to the top of the league but you would never know it from the faces of those who were winning the European Cup just 10 months ago.","Real Madrid were beaten 4-3 by Schalke in the Champions League .

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told Qatar 'more must be done' to improve working conditions in the country as it prepares to stage the 2022 World Cup. Blatter visited Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who has previously acknowledged setbacks in development work that according to the International Trade Union Confederation has already cost 1,000 migrant worker lives. The Emir said last year that new legal frameworks have been introduced to improve the situation on the ground.

Ahead of the FIFA executive committee meeting in Zurich on Thursday and Friday, when dates for the 2022 tournament are expected to be determined, Blatter urged Qatar to ensure all workers are guaranteed 'fair' conditions. Blatter said: 'It was important for me to have an opportunity to get the latest information directly from the highest political authority, ahead of the executive committee meeting next week. 'It is encouraging to hear the Emir's personal commitment to workers' welfare and to get a sense of the improvements planned for all workers in Qatar. The decision to award the World Cup to Qatar, which has questionable labour laws, has been controversial . 'As various human-rights groups have recently noted, progress has been made already, especially with regard to the standards introduced by the supreme committee relating to 2022 construction sites, but more must be done in Qatar to ensure uniformly fair working conditions for all. 'This will only be possible through the collective effort of all stakeholders - from the construction companies to the authorities.

"Andre Johnson and college team-mate Frank Gore moved to Indianapolis to win a Super Bowl. After being released by the Texans, the 33-year-old wide receiver was left to ponder his next move. But both he and Gore - who left the 49ers - were settled on the same landing spot. 'After I got released by the Texans, Frank called me,' Johnson told NBC Sports. 'He called me right after it happened and was just like, ""What are you gonna do?"" I’m like, ""Frank, I don’t know. I just got released. I don’t know."" 'I asked, him ""Who do you think has the best chance to win a Super Bowl?"" And he was like, ""Indy."" And I was like, ""That’s my same choice too so let’s do it, let’s go for it."" And they were able to get both of us here.' Andre Johnson leaves the Texans after 12 seasons with the franchise and has his sights set on a Super Bowl . The rampaging Frank Gore gives Indianapolis a bulldozing, reliable running back . According to ESPN, Johnson's deal is worth $21million over three years. Drafted third overall in 2003, Johnson goes down as the greatest player in the expansion franchise's history. He caught 1,012 passes on 1,599 targets for 13,597 yards and averages 6.0 receptions per game, an NFL record. And for the first time in his career, the seven-time Pro Bowler has the chance to play with a quarterback of elite quality in Andrew Luck. 'That was a very big part of it, wanting to be in a place with a stable quarterback,' he said. 'Andrew is arguably the best quarterback in the game.' After reaching the AFC Championship last time out, the addition of former Miami Hurricanes team-mate Gore gives Indianapolis the chance to bookend the Trent Richardson experiment.

"Marshawn Lynch will remain with the Seattle Seahawks. The enigmatic running back had apparently pondered retirement, but he penned a new two-year, $24million extension to keep him in the NFL until 2017. Lynch travelled to Seattle to meet owner Paul Allen and Seahawks top brass and put pen to paper, according to NFL Insider Ian Rapoport. Marshawn Lynch has signed a new two-year deal which will keep him in Seattle until 2017 . Lynch propelled Seattle to within a yard of back-to-back Super Bowl titles, but the Seahawks were thwarted . The 28-year-old has rushed for over 1,200 yards for each of the past four seasons. Since joining Seattle from Buffalo in 2010, no running back has rushed for more touchdowns than Lynch, with 54. If Russell Wilson is the face of the franchise, 'Beast Mode' is its heart and soul. After helping Seattle to their first Vince Lombardi trophy in 2014, Lynch played through the pain of a compressed cartilage in his back and carried the Seahawks to within a yard of retaining their title. Lynch gave a lengthy interview to Turkish TV station NTV Spor last week about the final play of Super Bowl XLIX. 'To be honest with you, I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I was expecting the ball. Yes, I was expecting the ball. 'But in life, these things happen.

"David Moyes has threatened to find the dressing room mole at Real Sociedad and remove him from the club. The former Manchester United and Everton manager is upset that his selected 11 appeared in the media last weekend before his team’s Sunday lunchtime game against Valenica. In a press conference on Friday he said: ‘For some reason our team is in the newspapers [on the day of the game]. I don’t get the opposition team. I didn’t get Valencia’s team but the opposition get my team. I don’t think that’s right. Real Sociedad's starting XI was leaked to local media ahead of their match against Valencia . David Moyes promised to find the person responsible for the leak and remove them from the club . ‘It doesn’t seem correct to me that our rivals find about our team selection because of leaks.’ When asked if a story circulating in San Sebastian that he has warned the players that if he finds one of his team has been leaking the team to the press he will make sure they leave the club, he replied: ‘Yes, correct!’ Moyes made several changes when he arrived at the Basque club last November, reducing the number of public training sessions in the lead up to match days and limiting daily injury updates because he believes it helps inform rivals. Real Sociedad midfielder Sergio Canales battles during the 2-0 defeat by Valencia last weekend . Valencia manager Nuno Espirito Santo had the advantage of knowing Sociedad's team in advance . He also prefers not to announce the squad for games on the Friday before a match – something that has not gone down well with some local reporters. Real Sociedad face Espanyol on Saturday.

But while the United boss welcomed the fact that - with the exception of Nadir Ciftci - neither of the two finalists will be hindered by suspensions, he believes Celtic’s readiness to question the loophole that got Butcher off the hook was inappropriate. Virgil van Dijk was sent off in the first half of the Scottish Cup draw with Dundee United . ‘If you ask me, I would prefer that all the guys were playing – Nadir as well even though he picked up two yellows,’ McNamara said. ‘You want all of your best players to be playing in Cup Finals - you don’t want anyone to miss out. ‘I can understand the decisions. The two of them – Butcher and van Dijk were in a melee at that point but due to the loophole or rules, whether it’s right or wrong, that’s just the way it is. ‘I don’t think the whole thing is right. But again, it’s outwith my control. The Celtic defender went in hard on opposing player Callum Butcher at Tannadice . ‘From our point of view, we have kept our silence and our focus on Sunday. ‘We haven’t mentioned anything about wanting anyone suspended or that this guy has done this or that. ‘We’re focused on our own team. The last thing I would want is for any of my players to speak out about the opposition and what-not when it’s been dealt with by the authorities. I’m pleased that they haven’t.’ The fall-out from the Scottish Cup quarter-final at Tannadice has threatened to overshadow the build-up to the first showpiece occasion of the season. McNamara, for one, feels the myriad issues to come out of the spicy 1-1 draw on Tayside last weekend point towards the imminent introduction of video evidence. ‘I don’t think it would be a bad thing in certain instances. There’s got to be a real call for it,’ he added. ‘On Sunday, with the time it took them to make a decision, I think it would have been helpful. ‘But again, it’s affordability. Where do you draw the line in terms of games that are and aren’t on television? ‘The game has changed so much with the appeal system and tribunals. Video evidence … it seems to be going that way.’ Dundee United players appeal to the linesman after the clash in the Scottish Cup . Dundee United lost the Scottish Cup final to St Johnstone at the end of McNamara’s first season in charge. Rank outsiders to upset Ronny Deila’s Treble-seeking side this weekend, the former Celtic star believes it’s imperative that his side maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of lifting the League Cup trophy. ‘I think that’s key to it,’ he continued. ‘It’s Celtic again, but you play most teams four times a season anyway and you get to know everybody really well throughout the campaign. ‘It shouldn’t come into play at all what happened last Sunday. I’ll make sure that the players understand the importance of discipline. We have to be committed, we have to compete, but first and foremost we have got to make sure we keep our cool.’ The second of four back-to-back games between the clubs this month spanning the three domestic competitions, McNamara believes that Celtic’s superior depth in squad is another factor in Deila’s favour this Sunday. The Dutch defender will be able to play in the Scottish League Cup final after having his red card rescinded . ‘You could argue that (it’s easier for them) as they have the biggest squad in the league,’ he added. ‘But that’s not changed from the start of the season. We just have to make sure everybody is ready. In certain games I have moved players around, I have maybe made five or six changes in a game as I need everybody ready. Not just for one game, but for a full season. Sometimes it’s not worked and sometimes it has.’ McNamara had revealed how he has changed his squad’s routine this week, consciously making it a different experience to the build-up to last season’s Scottish Cup final. Last year, the Tannadice squad were holed up in a plush St Andrews hotel for four nights whereas this week they have spent just one night there – with another overnight stay to come outside Edinburgh on Saturday. ‘We only went for one night this year – cost cutting!’ said McNamara with a smile. ‘The media day was our day for the players so we just decided to stay up after training and just settle them down. We wanted to make sure they were all relaxed and ready for Sunday. ‘There are certain things that we need to work on that I feel will help us if we want to win the match.’ United striker Nadir Ciftci (centre left) was also cleared for kicking Scott Brown (centre right) in the head . Asked if, with the benefit of hindsight, he regretted some aspects of last year’ s preparations for the Scottish Cup final, McNamara replied: ‘No because that’s what I did at the time. ‘I don’t look at anything like that, what-ifs. I’m a great believer that things happen for a reason. I’m just delighted that, within a year, we find ourselves in another cup final. ‘That says a lot about what we have at our club, what we have in the dressing room, the mentality that we’re trying to instil into them. It’s something that Celtic have, the belief that they can go and do it. ‘The games that we’ve struggled in this season have been when we haven’t handled the expectation. Against Celtic and Aberdeen, however, we have held our own. We’ve lost one, we’ ve won one with both teams. In other games, where we have been expected to win, we’ve fallen by the wayside. ‘That’s something we are building on. We’re getting closer, but we are still way apart on the consistency side of it. Last year, we won 16 league games. This year, we have won 14 already. So we’re getting there.’","Celtic drew 1-1 with Dundee United in Scottish Cup on Sunday .

"Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association following his touchline tantrum and spat with Steve Bruce during Tuesday’s 1-1 draw at Hull. The Black Cats boss was sent off by referee Mike Dean for kicking over a cooler box in protest at Jack Rodwell’s booking for diving before he clashed with his opposite number. Poyet, who has until 6pm on Monday to respond, sarcastically applauded in Bruce’s face and goaded him with a comment which the Hull manager later said was ‘not very pleasant’. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet (right) was involved in a touchline row with Hull City manager Steve Bruce . The two men argued after Sunderland midfielder Jack Rodwell was booked for simulation . Hull defender Alex Bruce has since attempted to play down the row between his father and Poyet . Bruce (left) had to be held back by the linesman as the row between the pair escalated . Coaching staff from both teams had to help separate the two managers . Bruce was only kept from getting to Poyet by the intervention of assistant referee Stuart Burt. But now the Uruguayan looks set to be hit with a touchline ban following the FA charge. Sunderland have also been fined £25,000 after six of their players were booked, including Lee Cattermole who picked up a two-game ban following his 10th yellow of the season. Poyet refused to apologise for his behaviour on Tuesday, and said: ‘Kicking a bottle of water is nothing serious. ‘I was not happy with Paul McShane (Hull defender) dancing like he was in the theatre, or like he’d been shot, and won a free-kick before that. ‘Jack then dived and got a free-kick against him, I just want fairness. The Uruguayan was sent to the stands by referee Mike Dean after his row with Bruce . Poyet celebrates Rodwell's equalising goal from the stands at the KC Stadium . ‘I have no regrets whatsoever. I now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me.’ Bruce, has been reminded of his responsibilities. An FA statement read: 'Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has been charged by the FA following the game against Hull City on 3 March 2015. 'It is alleged that his behaviour in the 35th minute of the fixture amounted to improper conduct. 'He has until 6pm on 9 March 2015 to respond to the charge. 'Meanwhile, Hull manager Steve Bruce has been contacted by the FA in relation to the same incident and formally reminded of his responsibilities.'","Gus Poyet and Steve Bruce were involved in a furious touchline bust-up .

"A woman's first date with a man she met on OkCupid turned to disaster after he allegedly stole her car. The woman, who has not been named, went for dinner with Gerald Tietz, who charmed her into meeting him at a restaurant in New Jersey last month. The two later went back to the woman's house - at which point Tietz is accusing of filching her car keys and driving off in her red Toyota, along with some of her jewelry. 'Car thief': Gerald Tietz, pictured above on OkCupid, allegedly tempted a New Jersey woman to a restaurant then stole her car . Police caught Tietz Saturday night after sharing his dating profile and pictures of the 2007 Solara, which had custom plates that read JSRYGRL. According to officers, Tietz lured the woman to Racks Restaurant and Sports Bar in Atco, New Jersey after posing online as a 53-year-old called Gennaro Aladena. Detectives also believe he could have tried the same trick on other women, also employing the pseudonym Mike Rossman, or his apparent nickname, Gooch. Taken: Police published this image of the woman's 2007 Toyota Solara, which has custom plates reading JSRYGRL . Tietz, who is 5'1"", and a bald smoker in his 50s, was arrested Saturday in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and booked into the Camden County jail. Police did not explain what happened at the house before the car theft, and would only say that 'at some point' during the encounter 'the male got a hold of the keys'. Tietz said he was from Atlantic City while allegedly posing on the dating site, and officers think he has strong ties to Atlantic County and Philadelphia. First date: Tietz allegedly took the woman to Racks Restaurant and Sports Bar in Atco, New Jersey, before taking the vehicle from her house .","Gerald Tietz allegedly enticed woman to meet using fake name on dating site .

"The NFL’s free agency began and blurred the boundaries between fantasy football and reality with a breathtaking first five minutes. Jimmy Graham is now a Seahawk. Haloti Ngata left the Ravens for Detroit and Nick Foles heads to the Rams with Sam Bradford heading the other way. Seattle gave up a first-round and a fourth-round pick from this year’s draft - and center Max Unger - to give Russell Wilson a red zone target in the shape of 28-year-old Graham. Jimmy Graham (right) has joined the Seattle Seahawks following four years at the New Orleans Saints . Max Unger moved in the opposite direction to complete a switch to the New Orleans Saints . With 4,752 receiving yards and 51 touchdowns since entering the NFL in 2010, Graham’s move is an admission by New Orleans that they mismanaged their cap. Meanwhile, Seattle welcome a player to their ranks once called ‘soft’ and ‘the most overrated player in the NFL’ by defensive end Michael Bennett. Ngata's move possibly signals the introduction of a 3-4 in the wake of Ndamokung Suh’s imminent departure to Miami. The Ravens reckoned that the nose tackle was too expensive going into the final year of his current deal. Detroit gain a 31-year-old run-stuffer capable of anchoring a defense and with experience of working with defensive co-ordinator Teryl Austin. Baltimore acquire fourth, fifth and seventh-round picks as part of the deal, ESPN report. Arguably Bradford is the happier of the two following the quarterback trade. He joins Chip Kelly’s fast-paced offense where his accuracy will put up the big numbers. That’s if he stays fit. After missing the entire 2014 season after tearing his ACL - his second such injury in as many years - injury concerns will plague Bradford for the rest of his career. But if he stays fit, the opportunity is there. Sam Bradford has joined the Philadelphia Eagles, while Nick Foles moved in the opposite direction . Haloti Ngata, pictured in white, has left the Baltimore Ravens to join the Detroit Lions . It is tough to say the same for Foles, who started 18 games for Kelly and won 14 of them. But after breaking his collarbone, he was jettisoned to St Louis, joining the likes of LeSean McCoy and Jeremy Maclin out of Philadelphia, who also re-signed quarterback Mark Sanchez on a $9m, two-year deal on Sunday. Elsewhere, the future of serial free agent and now Super Bowl-winner Darrelle Revis is uncertain and Percy Harvin is visiting the Buffalo Bills since his release by the New York Jets. Verstile tight end Julius Thomas heads to Jacksonville after agreeing a deal worth around $9m a season. Torrey Smith follows thew path successfully trodden by Anquan Boldin by joining the 49ers from the Ravens after agreeing a five-year, $40m deal. Frank Gore joined the Colts after ten bruising years in San Francisco. The bulldozing running back had looked to join the Eagles, but will be in the backfield behind Andrew Luck. Five-time All-Pro linebacker Patrick Willis announced his retirement from the game in a further blow to Jim Tomsula’s new-look franchise. And Jake Locker decided to call it a day at the tender age of 26. After four seasons with the Tennessee Titans, the quarterback says he no longer has ‘the burning desire’ to play in the NFL.","The Philadelphia Eagles and St Louis Rams agree a rare quarterback trade with Nick Sam Bradford and Nick Foles heading in different directions .

"Great Britain may be perennial underachievers in world tennis but when it comes to the sport's premier team competition Wimbledon's host nation continues to punch over its weight. In the city of his birth an emotional Andy Murray carried his side into the last eight of the World Group knockout by fending off a ferocious challenge from American giant John Isner to secure a 3-2 victory. To the deafening acclaim of Glasgow's Emirates Arena the former SW19 champion survived a tough opening set to win 7-6 6-3 7-6 against the world number 20 to wrap up the tie with his second point. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly after winning the first set on a tie break to leave Great Britain just two sets from the quarter-finals . The British No 1 was spurred on by the Glasgow crowd to secure a 3-1 win over the USA and book a quarter-final against France . Murray is forced to stretch to reach a backhand as John Isner put in a much better performance on Sunday in the Davis Cup . Against one of the best servers ever seen in tennis Murray's coolness in the tiebreaks was the key, as was his ability to save seven break points in the opening set. 'It was a great win for the team, everyone played their part,' said Murray. 'Togetherness was a key, everyone was pulling in the same direction. 'I managed to find a way through the first set. I was over complicating my service games at first and he was going for broke on the first point of every rally. The huge American showed aggression in a first set where he forced seven break points on the Murray serve, but couldn't take any of them . Murray was well supported by a partisan Glasgow crowd as he sought to book Great Britain's place in the Davis Cup quarter finals . Isner plays a forehand on the run as the USA's top player started fast in a game his country needed to win to stay alive in the match . Murray was not at his best early on, but rallied to take the first set on a tie break after saving three set points . GB are through to the elite World Group quarter finals for the second year in succession and now face a home tie against France – 3-0 winners over Germany - immediately after Wimbledon in July. If on grass it is likely to be held somewhere like Eastbourne or Nottingham, but if they opted for an indoor court it would likely come back to Scotland, as the fans here have been outstanding in this match. 'If everyone plays to their abilities we have the chance to win more matches. We don't have huge margin for error but if Wardy (James Ward) plays like this we have a chance, although France have huge strength in depth.' This match turned out to be remarkably similar to last year's World Group first round against the same opponents: Ward upset the American number one on the first day, before the Bryans pulled the doubles point back for the USA and then Murray finished it off with his second singles win. Great Britain captain Leon Smith and his staff celebrate as their talisman Murray wins a crucial point against the American Isner . Isner looks stunned during a tough first set where he played plenty of good tennis and earned seven break points, but couldn't break through . Isner looked to have put everything he had into the opener, and looked exhausted after losing the first-set breaker . Isner once beat Roger Federer in an away match against Switzerland so is no shrinking violet in the cauldron of Davis Cup competition and British Captain Leon Smith – low profile but with an excellent record in this job – knew that he could be a danger. That did not take long to be confirmed and the 6' 10' American, revelling in his underdog status unlike on Friday against Ward, came out swinging. A more under pressure was a little hesitant and he had to fend off seven break points in total before the tiebreak, once at 1-2, three times at 3-4 and three more times at 4-5. Isner twice took enormous forehand cuts and shaky second serves and will have been massively frustrated not to have taken the lead. Smith whispers some advice and encouragement into his player's ear between games as Murray booked Britain's place in the last eight . Murray continued to show his emotion as he began to find his best form in front of a raucous crowd in Glasgow . Murray's serve had come under pressure in the first set, but as Isner tired the British No 1 became more secure . His serve was as potent as ever but, crucially, he double faulted at the start of the tiebreak and after that Murray clung on to his lead to clinch it 7-4, a massive psychological blow as he had been outplayed. The nerves of him and another hugely committed crowd were eased by that, especially as Isner needed to play nearly five hours on Friday. A brilliant backhand lob at 3-2 in the second set secured the key break there, but to give Isner his due he kept fighting to take it to second tiebreak. Murray went ahead 6-2 and then finally finished it with a swinging serve ace at 6-4 to complete his weekend's work. Murray stretches for a forehand as he wore down his opponent before pulling out an array of stunning passing shots in the later sets . Isner had played five sets in his defeat to James Ward on Friday, and the effort caught up with him after a brave first set on Sunday . Isner is consoled by his USA Davis Cup captain Jim Courier as he struggles to cope with Murray's athleticism in Glasgow .","Andy Murray takes first set on a tie-break after saving seven break points .

"He may not have played since the FA Cup defeat by Leicester on January 24 but Emmanuel Adebayor does not appear to be giving up his Tottenham career easily. The out-of-favour striker took to Instagram on Monday to post a cryptic message, perhaps making reference to his current situation under manager Mauricio Pochettino. Alongside a picture of himself sitting in a car, the former Arsenal man wrote: 'When life puts you in tough situations. Don't say 'why me'. Just say 'try me'.' Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor attached a defiant message to this picture of himself on Instagram . Adebayor has made just 11 Premier League appearances for Tottenham so far this season . Adebayor came close to joining West Ham on loan in the January transfer window and he has found it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino's starting XI this year. His last Premier League appearance came as a substitute against Sunderland on January 17 and he has just two top-flight goals to his name this season. Younes Kaboul and Etienne Capoue have also struggled for playing time in 2015 but Pochettino has refused to confirm whether the trio will leave White Hart Lane this summer. Former Arsenal striker Adebayor last played for Tottenham on January 24 in the FA Cup against Leicester . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has demoted Adebayor to the club's third-choice striker in recent months . Speaking about squad selection ahead of his side's 2-1 win at QPR on Saturday, the former Southampton boss said: 'Always for every game it's my decision, my choice. 'I think that you understand. In the end, all of our squad is fully fit and you need to pick players. 'I am happy with all, but if we have 26 or 27 players in the squad then more than 18 is impossible.'","Emmanuel Adebayor has not played for Tottenham since January 24 .

"In assessing his options for the traditional pre-cup final getaway, it can be safely assumed that Ronny Deila would have sooner set sail for Anchorage, Alaska, than make the short hop to Dublin. As his side left McDiarmid Park with three points in the bag in the middle of last month, the Norwegian thought it best to grant his players a day off to clear their minds before the small matter of Inter Milan at Celtic Park demanded their full focus. By the time the squad reassembled at Lennoxtown on Monday morning, though, their numbers were depleted by one. Anthony Stokes, a native of Dublin, had failed to make his scheduled flight back to Glasgow after returning home for a family visit. Anthony Stokes missed Celtic's big game with Inter last month, but is keen to make the most of the next one . Whether or not Stokes would have featured against the Italians was beside the point. His absence left Deila with no option but to banish him from what was left of the build-up. An unnecessary distraction, if ever there was one. For those lucky enough to witness the pulsating 3-3 draw that ensued, a sense of bewilderment as to why someone would jeopardise the chance to live out their boyhood dream was compounded by the fact that Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven had only recently put further pressure on the Irishman’s position. Yet, if there is a sense of deep regret from the player regarding what transpired, he’s doing a mighty fine job of hiding it. In his eyes, neither a private apology nor a public explanation were warranted. Only a need to hastily draw a line under the affair. Asked if he regretted what happened, Stokes replied: ‘No. Look the situation has been dealt with. It’s as simple as that. I’ve spoken to the gaffer about it and there’s no issue now.’ Stokes has been battling for his place in the side since failing to return to Celtic on time before the Inter game . Had he apologised to Deila over what had taken place? ‘No,’ he repeated. ‘Look, I said I spoke to the gaffer about everything and that’s it – it’s been dealt with. It’s done.’ So what actually happened? ‘There’s nothing. It’s dealt with,’ he said. But it must have been tough to sit such a huge game out? ‘It was difficult,’ he admitted. ‘It’s difficult for me to miss any game as I want to play every minute of them.’ Try as he might to consign the matter to history, Stokes is going to have to go some way to erase it from the minds of his manager and the supporters who pay his wages. Deila initially left him out of the squad for the subsequent game with Aberdeen but 59 minutes against St Johnstone and 64 minutes against Dundee United on Sunday did at least suggest he’s now edging off the naughty step. With Mackay-Steven and Armstrong cup-tied for Sunday’s final, Stokes has every chance of featuring at Hampden. And to his credit, he acknowledges that the instant impressions made by the recent acquisitions have raised the bar for him. ‘There’s a lot of competition for places here at the minute and even after that (missing Inter) it’s not as if I’ve been a regular in the squad the past few weeks,’ he stated. Stokes has not made a public apology for his behaviour, but was keen to draw a line under the incident . ‘I’ve played the last two games. Even for myself, I would have liked to have played a little bit better because I know the situation with the boys from Dundee United. ‘They will be straight back in contention as soon as we have these games by us. It’s up to me to obviously go out and try to put my stamp down and keep myself in the team. ‘I haven’t been outstanding since I came back in but I have been creating and getting into positions to score but I just haven’t. ‘I know the goals will come. I have had spells like this before where things haven’t clicked. I just need to keep my confidence up and to have enough belief in myself that next time I get an opportunity I will put it away.’ There would be no finer time and place to start than Sunday at Hampden. ‘Yes, it would be, especially after the last week,’ he reflected. ‘I had one or two chances but the ball just won’t go in the back of the net for me at the moment. ‘I have been working hard in training and I have scored a few goals there and that has given me confidence. You just need to go out on the pitch and keep doing right things.’ The National Stadium wouldn’t immediately spring to mind as an obvious backdrop for the salvation to start. Stokes played in the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Hearts in 2012, the League Cup Final loss to Kilmarnock the same year, as well as a semi-final reverse in the same competition to St Mirren the following season. But his memories of his last trip there provides a welcome analgesic to the pain that went before. The striker has not been in the best of form recently, but is likely to get another chance to prove himself . ‘Probably, the (Scottish) Cup final against Hibs (in 2013) when I got man of the match,’ he replied when asked of his favourite day on Mount Florida. ‘That was one of the highlights of the season for me because I had been out injured previously for five or six months. ‘To finish that way and on a high was massive for me because I had been out for so long. I didn’t know how I was going to come back. ‘When I first came back my ankle was still at me. So I was glad that was behind me and I showed I could still perform on the pitch.’ He didn’t score that day – a Gary Hooper double and Joe Ledley’s goal completed the Double for Neil Lennon – but there was much for him to savour. ‘Yes, I had a couple of crosses for Gary and it was good to finish on a high, more so because of the injury because it had been a long season,’ Stokes recalled. ‘The injury had drained me a bit being out for so long and it had been the first time in my career that I had been out for more than a few weeks.’ Assists are all very well, but a man who’s known little more than life in the penalty box appreciates they are rarely the hard currency on which you are judged. ‘I would rather be in the middle scoring goals but it is difficult the way we play just now,’ he added. ‘There is so much emphasis on getting back and defending and putting in the graft for the team. ‘I have been trying to adapt my game to that, as well. It has been a bit of a strange season for me. I actually don’t mind playing on the left but you are never going to get the same plaudits as playing up front and scoring all the goals. ‘It is different because even when I played up front, I’ve been on my own and I have always played in a two. I have just had to adjust. The main thing is the team.’ Even if Stokes plays and scores the goal to win the cup on Sunday, it will be hard to view him as the identikit of Deila’s ideal player. Yet, notwithstanding the Inter episode, he believes he has now adjusted to the heightened demands of the Norwegian. ‘The one thing about the gaffer is that our base for every game is our work rate,’ he added. ‘It stems from there. The way we are playing is probably tactically a bit different from before. ‘There aren’t many spells when we keep possession for maybe 20, 30 passes.

"Chelsea No 1 Thibaut Courtois insists he holds no fear in facing Zlatan Ibrahimovic when the pair meet in their Champions League last 16 second-leg clash on Wednesday. The Blues carry a 1-1 first-leg score into the game at Stamford Bridge after Courtois pulled off a succession of impressive saves at the Parc des Princes, which included denying the Sweden striker with a late stop. The 22-year-old remains confident of keeping out the former Juventus and Barcelona forward again as Jose Mourinho's in-form side chase a treble in the manager's second spell in west London.

Jose Mourinho (left) congratulates Courtois after keeping Chelsea in the game in the first leg . The Blues No 1 is not afraid of facing PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Stamford Bridge . Speaking to RMC, the Belgium international said: 'No, I'm not afraid. 'I played against him three weeks ago, and I played well. I hope to stop him again on Wednesday. I know he's a great striker, and that it's always difficult to stop him, but we have to do that if we want to go through.' 'We're confident, but we expect a very difficult game. Paris are going to come here to score goals. It'll be a very complicated game. We're ready, and we hope to win in front of our fans. We'll have to see the tactics the coach puts in place. What is certain is that we cannot sit back and wait. 'We have to defend well, but we mustn't go for the 0-0 because if we concede a goal, Paris will qualify by winning 1-0. We have to play to our strengths by trying to score goals and win the game.' Chelsea team-mates congratulate Courtois after another impressive performance against West Ham . Ibrahimovic scores from the penalty spot in PSG's 4-1 victory over Lens at the weekend . Courtois added: 'As we're playing at home and we drew 1-1 in the first leg, we're slight favourites. But with the team that Paris has, they also have a lot of hope. It's going to be a very close match. The small details will decide who goes through.' The Premier League leaders required a late goal by Demba Ba to eliminate the big spending French side at the quarter-final stage last season, but are arguably a better team this term.

We're going to have to be very careful because we mustn't lose. 'If you play for a team like Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich or PSG, the aim is always to win the Champions League. After that, it depends on the circumstances, the opponents you are drawn against. The aim is to win, but you have to see if it's possible.

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche believes dressing-room spats between players are 'a natural occurrence' at the highest level. Manchester City visit Turf Moor on Saturday at the end of a week where the club have been forced to play down reports that captain Vincent Kompany was dropped following a bust-up with team-mate Fernandinho. The row allegedly came at half-time during their defeat by Liverpool earlier this month, with neither player in the starting line-up for the clash with Leicester three days later. Vincent Kompany (left) and Fernandinho (right) were involved in a dressing-room row at Liverpool . But Dyche dismissed suggestions it was a good time to face City and can understand why passions occasionally run too high. He said: 'I think it's a natural occurrence. You've got highly-talented, highly-motivated people, all in a working environment that's very challenging. 'Everyone wants a shirt, everyone wants to play, and also, I can only imagine, at that level you're borderline into 25 mini companies. It's not just players, you're dealing with the whole shebang - PR consultants, agents, PAs, who knows what else. 'I imagine it's like having 25 CEOs and trying to align them all with whatever the bigger picture is. There's always going to be challenges because they're powerful-minded people, which is why they're at the top of the game.' Kompany was dropped to the bench when Manchester City hosted Leicester City . Burnley are without a win in two months and sit second bottom of the Premier League table, three points from safety. But City and manager Manuel Pellegrini will certainly not underestimate the Clarets after their stunning performance at the Etihad in December, when they fought back from 2-0 down to claim a draw. Dyche said: 'They've got some fantastic players. We experienced that once before, we gave a good performance and I think overall deserved a point out of the game. But that doesn't guarantee us anything this time around. 'They're a highly-motivated group of players, still in the hunt, still right up there, very experienced and a fantastic manager, so obviously it's a big challenge once again.' Kompany attempts to tackle Raheem Sterling during City's 2-1 defeat by Liverpool . Dyche added to his squad this week with the recruitment on a three-year deal of Norwegian midfielder Fredrik Ulvestad. The Burnley boss has been keen for the club to expand their scouting network into Europe and signed 22-year-old Ulvestad after a two-week trial. The Clarets were already short in midfield before Dean Marney was ruled out for the season with a knee injury last month but Dyche insisted Ulvestad will not be rushed. 'He wanted to come in and I think it's a good way of doing business because he gets a chance to have a look at us and we can have a look at him, and he fitted in straight away,' said the Burnley boss. 'That was probably the key thing. Sometimes players who are with you and are not part of the group, they look not part of the group, but he fitted in seamlessly and we thought there was more to come from him, so that's why we signed him. Burnley boss Sean Dyche can understand why passions occasionally run too high . 'At the moment it's that cooling-off period, getting used to how we work. I don't know that much about the Norwegian league but I know it's not the Premier League. 'He's been to a couple of games so he knows how we operate and how the Premier League operates. We're looking forward to him working with us and developing further. 'We have been light in midfield but that's not why Freddie's come in, because if it was he'd have to operate immediately. We think there's more to come going forwards than right now. 'If he's needed this season and we think he's ready, then that's different, but he's only been in the building a couple of weeks, so we'll see how he continues getting used to what it is to be here and obviously then looking at the idea of being in the first team, but there's no rushing that situation.'","Captain Vincent Kompany had a bust-up with team-mate Fernandinho .

The Black Cats boss was sent off by referee Mike Dean for kicking over a cooler box in protest at Jack Rodwell’s booking for diving before he clashed with his opposite number.

"Jackie McNamara rounded on the Hampden officials for costing his side the chance of League Cup glory against Celtic. Referee Bobby Madden made two huge calls against Dundee United when, first of all, he denied Ryan Dow a first-half penalty following a nudge in the back by Parkhead skipper Scott Brown. The whistler then instantly dismissed Tannadice captain Sean Dillon for a dangerous tackle on Emilio Izaguirre in 56 minutes, thus ending any hopes of a United comeback. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara was furious that his side were not awarded a penalty on Sunday . ‘I feel frustrated and disappointed,’ said McNamara. ‘But I’m proud of how the players responded. ‘I thought a lot of things went against us today. We stuck to the task and went right to the end, despite the disappointments and setbacks in the game. ‘Decisions didn’t go for us and certain other things didn’t go for us. I can’t fault the lads for their effort and commitment. ‘I feel we should have had a penalty. It looked like a penalty, I’d like to see it again. The referee was very slow to make a decision, or not make a decision. But in Celtic’s case, he was very quick to point to the spot. ‘I’d like to see the challenge again that caused the damage to Sean Dillon’s leg. Celtic ended up getting a throw-in from it. Sean has got a bad gash on his shin. I’d like to see the incident again, to see if it was a fair one. Dundee United's captain Sean Dillon is sent off by referee Bobby Madden for a tackle on Emilio Izaguirre . ‘For the red card, Sean has given the referee a real decision to make. It was his momentum and pace, I don’t think he has gone in to cause damage. But he’s given the ref a decision to make and we know what happened.’ United midfielder John Rankin, meanwhile, accused Celtic of piling pressure on to Madden ahead of Sunday’s showpiece occasion. Following the stormy Scottish Cup draw at Tannadice, Celtic manager Ronny Deila had accused United youngster Aidan Connolly of a ‘blatant’ dive to win a spot-kick. That was then repeated by Brown, who also pointed the finger at Nadir Ciftci over a kick that struck him on the head. Anthony Stokes further spoke out by expressing his bemusement that Connolly hadn’t been retrospectively punished. ‘I think it did influence things,’ said Rankin. ‘It put pressure on the officials and I don’t think it’s merited. Ryan Dow was denied a first-half penalty following a nudge in the back by Parkhead skipper Scott Brown . ‘The officials’ jobs are hard enough without putting pressure on them. They’re under scrutiny. ‘You saw it last week with us going down to nine men and people questioning the decisions made then. ‘There has been a lot of pressure put on Bobby Madden and his three officials this weekend with what they’ve been saying in the press this week. ‘I don’t think that’s merited and it doesn’t help. But at the end of the day we’ ve got to deal with it. We’re bitterly disappointed but we need to look forward to the Scottish Cup replay on Wednesday and bounce back.’ Tensions sure to be raised once again when the sides meet for the third act in what has become a four-match saga. For United, keeping 11 players on the park will be a priority. ‘It will be easy to lift the players for Wednesday,’ said McNamara. ‘That’s what we are in it for. Dundee United captain Sean Dillon (right) is sent off for this late challenge on Celtic defender Emilio Izaguirre . ‘Had we won today, we would have got back up for Wednesday. So we will dust them down and see who is available. Paul Dixon and Sean will both be missing. ‘But the lads have another opportunity to put everything behind them. Hopefully there will be a bit of consistency in everything on Wednesday. ‘We defended well with both 11 and 10 players today. Last week, we defended well with nine players, as well. Hopefully we keep 11 men on the pitch on Wednesday night. It’s imperative that we do. ‘Up until the last third of the pitch, we competed well with Celtic. But our last pass just wasn’t there, although we had opportunities to create something. It’s just that little bit of quality we were lacking. ‘But they gave us everything and that’s all you ask as a manager. We can take lots of positives from it - they way the players stuck together, how they worked and didn’t give up right until the final whistle.’ The Celtic players celebrate on the podium with the QTS Scottish League Cup after beating Dundee United 2-0 .","Ronny Deila's Celtic side won their 15th Scottish League Cup .

"As the clock ticked down on Celtic’s League Cup Final win, goalkeeper Craig Gordon looked in a world of his own as he glanced around Hampden, savouring every last moment. When the final whistle confirmed his first winners’ medal since the Scottish Cup victory over Gretna on penalties with Hearts in 2006, the goalkeeper immediately searched out the twin lights who had inspired his incredible comeback story. Over the course of his two long years out injured, four year old daughter Freya and then the arrival of little Emma, now 22-months old, provided both fortitude and hope in what was a seemingly endless dark tunnel for Gordon. Scott Brown lifts the Scottish League Cup alongside keeper Craig Gordon (right) on Sunday . Once Britain’s most expensive keeper, his girls now found their daddy a house-husband, unemployed after being released by Sunderland in the summer of 2012 due to knee tendon and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Neither daughter knew him as Craig Gordon, Scotland hero and Cup-winning goalkeeper; the man who had once been voted as having made the best save in the 20-year history of the English Premier League. And the longer his spell out of the game continued, the more the 32-year-old’s retirement looked a weary inevitability. Keeper Craig Gordon gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne as his team-mates . On Sunday, however, as Celtic looked to the future with the first trophy of the Ronny Deila era, Gordon celebrated with his family present at Hampden Park, including wife Jennifer. It was, he conceded, a day he feared may never happen. ‘I took a moment or two towards the end to think about things,’ admitted Gordon, his lips visibly quivering with emotion after the 2-0 win against Dundee United. ‘When the game was already won, and Dundee United weren’t going to get back into it, it was nice to stand up the other end of the pitch and just have a look around at the fans celebrating and singing all the songs. Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon poses with the Scottish League Cup trophy in the winning changing room . ‘To win it feels brilliant, absolutely fantastic. It’s the manager’s first competition and he’s won it — so it’s great for him but it’s also great for me personally. ‘I just wanted to take it all in, to realise that this was really happening for me. That I had won a cup again. It had been a long time coming since the last one at Hearts. It’s a dream come true. ‘I took my two little girls, Freya and Emma, out on to the pitch with me afterwards. It was so nice to be able to do that for them. They have stood by me and they have supported me for the two whole years when I wasn’t working, while I was concentrating fully on getting back into football. Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon maintains his clean sheet during the Scottish League Cup final . ‘It must have been a hard thing for them to have to deal with. They were so young that they never really knew what Daddy did for a living. They were a big part of my inspiration to get back to top level football. I wanted to show them what their Daddy used to do! ‘And I managed to do that. It means the world to me to share that moment with my girls out there on the pitch. And they absolutely loved it, dancing around and picking up all the confetti. It was such a special moment for me and for my family; a moment I will never forget.” As he danced across the park with his girls and his jubilant team-mates, gone were memories of surgery and the seemingly interminable healing process. ‘To come from where I was, all the hard work makes it special,’ he smiled. ‘At times it might have been easier to give up but the support I’ve had to keep going, to carry on and to get to here is just brilliant. It feels like I am back now. Gordon pumps his fists in celebration as Celtic defeated Dundee United in the Scottish League Cup final . ‘When I was injured, I just wanted to play a game of football again. But once I managed that I realised I was capable of getting back to a high level. And that’ s when I started to think about what is possible. ‘But to do this in my first season back is just amazing. When I first signed for Celtic last summer, Fraser Forster was still here as No 1 goalkeeper. ‘So to get in and have 40 games under my belt – plus a medal in the bank – is just so hard to contemplate. This is more than I could ever have hoped for when I was making the journey back from where I have been. ‘But I can’t afford to look too far back because we’ve got a busy run-in to come this season. ‘We’ve got a difficult game on Wednesday night against Dundee United in the Scottish Cup quarter-final replay and this result today might give United an added incentive to come out and have an even bigger go at us. ‘I thought United played pretty well today even with 10 men. They stuck to their tasks and they are a tough team to break down. So if we are not at our best, 100 per cent ready, they will have every chance to do well against us.’","Celtic beat Dundee United 2-0 in the Scottish League Cup final .

"With injuries piling up ahead of Scotland’s final Six Nations match against Ireland, Vern Cotter has identified a solution to his selection problem. ‘We will play the Under-20s against them,’ said the Scotland head coach in his laconic, deadpan style. ‘We had eight players injured against England. How many are doubts for the Ireland match? All of them.’ Jim Hamilton, seen here tackling England's James Haskell, is one of five doubts for the Ireland game . Such was the despondent air hanging over the Scotland head coach as he spoke in the bowels of Twickenham on Saturday evening, he could be forgiven for thinking the worst at the time. Thankfully, a Scottish Rugby Union medical bulletin issued on Sunday suggested it was five players — not eight — who will require further treatment ahead of the match at BT Murrayfield. Second row Jim Hamilton, who had to come off for a time after being concussed in the first half, then had to be replaced following a back spasm, is the biggest doubt to face Ireland. Matt Scott suffered a ‘dead leg’ with bad bruising and now faces a race against time to be ready. Alasdair Dickinson has a leg injury he picked up in a tackle, winger Tommy Seymour an elbow problem and flanker Blair Cowan a calf strain. The walking wounded will be excused training on Monday, with an SRU spokesman saying the medical team will be working with them over the next few days to try to ensure they can put some work in before the final Six Nations match. Vern Cotter was downbeat after the defeat, which came with a heavy price in terms of personell . Others who Cotter thought were more seriously hurt, such as Finn Russell, David Denton and Euan Murray, should be fit. ‘We have been unlucky with injuries, which hasn’t helped us,’ said Cotter, who lost Alex Dunbar in the build-up to the Calcutta Cup encounter. ‘Everybody has to be patient. We can turn the corner, come back strong and do well against Ireland. ‘Right now, we have to take that defeat to England on the chin and keep working, analysing what went wrong, what went right and moving forward. ‘I thought there were some real positive aspects for us in our game at Twickenham but we have Ireland next week and they beat England — so it will be very tough test.’ Cotter continues to insist his side are ‘heading in the right direction’ despite a fourth Six Nations defeat and a likely wooden spoon. Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw takes a heavy hit as he brings down Ben Youngs during the narrow defeat . VIDEO O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . He praised his players for battling back against England after losing a fourth-minute converted try from Jonathan Joseph. ‘England based their strategy on starting well and they did just that,’ added Cotter. ‘What I saw from our team after that pleased me. I saw great character. They didn’t panic, got themselves back into the match and I got a message down to them to say don’t worry about it. ‘They also showed they could change tactics when needed, which is a great thing. ‘On top of that, I thought our line-out defence and our scrum, after the first one, was very good. ‘If I thought we were being dominated from start to finish I might worry but I don’t think we are. There is more to come from this team, no question.’ Captain Greig Laidlaw was instrumental in dragging Scotland back in the face of England’s early onslaught. He inspired those around him with his leadership qualities. Laidlaw admitted Scotland needed to be more intelligent with the ball, but praised his team's spirit . He gave the backs quick ball and put over two penalties and a conversion in a top-class display. Laidlaw admitted. ‘England came flying out the blocks but, once that happened, we had to deal with it. ‘The response I got from the guys was calm and controlled. ‘From then on, we played some magnificent rugby until half-time. In the second half, a couple of times there was a bounce of the ball that maybe went against us and the game just went away from us a little bit. We should know when to offload and when to hold the ball. ‘When we did get into their half, we put little kicks through when we should have held the ball. We need to learn that Test-match rugby is won by small margins.’","Soctland lost eight men during defeat to England on Saturday .

"Christian Benteke is still to fully recover from his hip injury but is in contention for a return to the Aston Villa team for Saturday’s crucial match against Sunderland. The Belgian striker missed Villa’s FA Cup victory over West Bromwich Albion after suffering the problem in training but has improved and should be in the squad, manager Tim Sherwood said. Sherwood could yet continue with the attacking line-up that got Villa to the FA Cup semi-final for the important relegation encounter at the Stadium of Light. Christian Benteke will be in Aston Villa's squad for Saturday's trip to Sunderland, says boss Tim Sherwood . Benteke (left) missed their FA Cup win over West Brom on March 7 due to a hip injury . That would mean Gabriel Agbonlahor up top, supported by Charles N’Zogbia and Scott Sinclair on the wings. ‘Christian's still feeling it,’ said Sherwood. ‘He’ll be in the squad, we’ll give him as much time as we can to get him fit. All I need to know is when he’ll be back fit and he’s got an opportunity to be fit for this weekend. 'But we changed it around and the boys that came in did well. We’re not always looking for one guy. It’s a team effort, we have to attack together and defend together. There is no onus on one person to score the goals. Villa players were put through their paces during Thursday's training session at Bodymoor Heath . On loan midfielder Tom Cleverley will be hoping to start for Villa at the Stadium of Light . Cleverley could line up alongside Ashley Westwood in midfield for the clash against the Black Cats . 'I don’t think Christian feels the pressure, it doesn’t look like it.’ Sherwood also reflected on the pitch invasion at the end of last Saturday’s 2-0 victory over West Brom, which marred the result in the eyes of many. Sherwood joked he would agree to a replay. 'No-one wants to see anyone enter the field of play while the match is still going on. If we have to replay the game we’re happy to do that,’ he laughed. 'It didn’t take the shine off for me. Other people can deal with the aftermath of what was a very jubilant crowd on the pitch.'

"This is the look of terror a woman pulled for her jailhouse mugshot after being booked over driving offenses. Ashley Stabler, 23, was pulled over by sheriff's deputies in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, last week and locked up after allegedly driving without insurance and on a suspended license. She was also booked over driving with improper license plates, and thrown in the Tulsa County Jail - where she pulled this shocked expression for her mugshot. Seen a ghost? Ashley Stabler, 23, pulled this face in the Tulsa County jailhouse after being booked . According to The Smoking Gun, Stabler was being held on a $600 bond ahead of a court appearance, the date for which has now passed. Is is unclear what has become of Stabler since. She was due in court last week, and the Tulsa jail confirmed they are no longer holding her. However, court records show Stabler's shock may have been unwarranted - as it was far from her first time in a jail. She was arrested for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in 2011, but the case was dismissed. Two years later, she pleaded no contest to a larceny charge, and also has a pending court case linked to her driving suspension.

"Nigel Pearson is hoping Leicester City can take their relegation fight to the final day where he has a remarkable record of success. The Leicester manager has twice before worked last-match miracles in charge of teams in trouble and would love the opportunity to complete a hat-trick. ‘Of course I would. I’ve been in plenty,’ said Pearson. Nigel Pearson barks orders from the bench at King Power Stadium as Leicester manage only a draw to Hull . Pearson knows he's in a scrap for survival in the Premier League but fighting to the end isn't new to him . Leicester, rooted to the bottom of the Premier League and seven points from safety, look to have bleak prospects of reaching that stage still in contention to avoid the drop. The draw against Hull was a significant opportunity missed. But Pearson has history of achieving the improbable. In his first manager’s job at Carlisle he masterminded one of the most famous last day survival acts when goalkeeper Jimmy Glass struck decisively with the last kick of their Division Three season in 1998-99. Nine years later Pearson was brought in to take charge of Southampton, struggling in the Championship, and guided the team to safety with a last-gasp victory. He was also Bryan Robson’s assistant when West Bromwich Albion stayed up against the odds in the final game of the 2004-05 Premier League campaign. Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso fights to dispossess Hull's Jake Livermore in a disappointing draw . Leicester keeper Mark Schwarzer punches clear despite the jumps of Dame N'Doye (Hull) and Ritchie De Laet . He is aware Leicester, without a Premier League victory in eight games, must start wining soon to have any chance and he was disappointed with his team’s display. ‘It’s another opportunity lost against a side who we needed to pick up three points against,’ he said. ‘In some ways I’d stomach us losing the game being more positive trying to win it, than picking up a point having been a bit safe. Time will tell whether that is the right way to look at it or not. ‘(The gap) is a lot at this stage of the season. We’re going to have to turn our form on its head. The point is we’ve got to perform. The players know we haven’t done enough to win the game. I would like to have seen us show a bit more intent.’","Nigel Pearson twice orchestrated last-day survival miracles as a manager .

"Ireland will be forced to 'take it a little bit easy' in training on Monday, counting the cost of playing 'one-and-a-quarter Test matches' in their 23-16 defeat to Wales. Head coach Joe Schmidt conceded he would hand his shattered players extra time to recover as Ireland come to terms with their 'straight-up' lesson in failing to convert pressure into tries. Ireland can still win the RBS 6 Nations on points difference if they beat Scotland in Edinburgh handsomely on Saturday, despite blowing their Grand Slam chances in Wales. Ireland are feeling the strain after a narrow defeat to Wales that ended their Grand Slam chances . VIDEO Wales dash Ireland's Grand Slam hopes . Kiwi boss Schmidt believes the carrot of retaining the championship title for the first time since 1949 will allow Ireland to shake off their frustrations from Saturday's Millennium Stadium loss. 'Probably Monday we might have to take it a little bit easy on the back of there being a lot of ball in play,' said Schmidt, who confirmed no new injury worries. 'There were a lot of long phases of play, we probably played one-and-a-quarter Test matches in the context of some of the other Tests we've played. 'And there's a lesson we've got straight-up - if you're going to play like that then you've got to be able to keep going in those moments that you do get pressure on them. 'The players all left the field able to play, but they'll have some bruises for sure which will limit anything we do (on Monday).' Ireland's starkest lesson from Saturday's aborted Grand Slam bid surrounded killer instinct, or the lack of it. Former Leinster boss Schmidt has already admitted Ireland 'didn't achieve anything' by expecting to see off Wales by accumulating penalties in Cardiff. Joe Schmidt admitted there were plenty of tired bodies in the Irish camp, and said he would take things easy . Ireland, Wales and England can all still now claim the Six Nations title, but Schmidt continued to warn his side about being sidetracked by trying to gauge what points difference could secure further glory. 'We learned from those 10 wins and we will learn from this loss as well,' said Schmidt, after Ireland suffered their first loss since 13-10 defeat to England in last year's Six Nations. 'What we can learn is that we won't lack for character, we don't lack for endeavour and those are important starting points. 'What we do know is we are still in the championship and we still have a fantastic opportunity to do something that hasn't been done for a long time if we can create enough opportunities in Murrayfield next week. The match against Wales was a bruising encounter, with Ireland failing to take their chances . 'But if you go looking for differentials without first of all making sure you have targeted the result, you are going to make it a pretty tough day for yourself.' Schmidt admitted he will push his Ireland side to sharpen up their attacking accuracy this week in a bid to combat the blunt edge that emerged against Wales. 'It's funny because people were talking about us not making enough line breaks, not making enough passes, even though we'd obviously made more than any other team and I think that would definitely be true after Saturday,' said Schmidt. 'I felt we showed fantastic endeavour, but that accuracy is what we're going to need and that's what we'll work on this week, . 'We didn't quite get our rhythm and if you don't quite get that right against a defensive side that Wales have, particularly their ability to be very physical. 'I felt we did a lot of that right, but not enough of it right to convert it into points.' Two Irish defenders feel the full force of George North in a game Schmidt admitted took plenty out of his team .","Ireland lost Grand Slam hopes with 23-16 defeat to Wales .

"A freshman basketball player with rare brain cancer who made it through full season despite being given only a few months to live is now having problems swallowing as her condition worsens. During her senior year of high school, Lauren Hill was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent. But she still made it through a full season at the Cincinnati university while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor she has. Scroll down for video . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19 (pictured), made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . Her mother Lisa updates her followers on her Facebook page about her daughter's progress and said this week that Lauren was having trouble swallowing, although her humor and bravery are shining through. She posted: 'Lauren sleeps about 12 hours a day and still does not like to take naps. 'Her appetite is not as big as it use to be. She has been having increased issues with swallowing. We had to add some thickener to her water to make it easier to swallow. Food we cut down into bite sizes these days to prevent chocking.' Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . She said her daughter's pain medication has been increased to help her deal with headaches and aches across her body. She added: 'She still has a sense of humor even if her legs give out and she falls. My favorite quote of the week.... ""I didn't fall, I gracefully assaulted the floor."" Got to love her.' Despite the diagnosis, Hill decided to attend college and play for the Division III school. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The Team: The Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team (pictured) held its postseason banquet in a hospital room with Hill . The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center at hospital) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain .","Lauren Jill has DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent .

"Ivan Rakitic says he is happy to fill Sergio Busquets' role as a holding midfielder as Barcelona head into the business end of the season. The Croatian has been used all around the midfield since joining from Sevilla last summer, and looks likely to be used at the base of Barcelona's formation in the coming weeks.

"If Saturday night’s victory over Ireland does prove to be Shaun Edwards’ final RBS 6 Nations hoorah in Cardiff, then the former rugby league man could not have picked a finer evening to bow out. The Wales defence coach is out of contract after the World Cup and his players delivered a tackling masterclass at the Millennium Stadium. They repelled wave after wave of attacks to send Ireland’s Grand Slam ambitions up in smoke, providing the 48-year-old with one of his finest hours behind the glass wall of the tactical box. Made from stuff the local steelworks would be proud of, his Welsh rearguard saw off almost 50 phases in seven second-half minutes to set up a three-way title showdown in the final weekend. Shaun Edwards and his players delivered a tackling masterclass at the Millennium Stadium against Ireland . Cian Healy is held up by the huge Welsh defensive effort on Saturday, with the home side winning 23-16 . VIDEO Wales dash Ireland's Grand Slam hopes . ‘Only a Six Nations game can bring the emotion out like that,’ said Edwards. ‘Potentially it could be my last Six Nations game with Wales. If it ends up being that way, it was a great way to sign off. ‘It was a victory for team effort and fitness. To keep tackling for that long, you have to be fit. Our attack was very good in the first 20 minutes and it was an incredible Test match. Ireland are a team that never ever give in; they are coming back at you all the time. It was everything that is good about the Six Nations.’ Edwards punched the air in delight on the final whistle. His players racked up a record count of 250 tackles — missing just 22. It did little to damn the notion that northern-hemisphere rugby is geared towards defence, but there was no question about the entertainment value, with the absorbing close-quarter battles making for the best tie of the championship. Taulupe Faletau puts in one of Wales' 150 tackles on a superb defensive display by Edwards' men . The win over Ireland could be Edwards' last RBS 6 Nations game in Cardiff, it was a good way to bow out . ‘To defend in your own 22 for nine and a half minutes and concede one try from a maul is a great credit to the lads,’ said Edwards. ‘We kept getting off the floor and into position very quickly, which is a massive part of your defence. If you are on the floor, you are out of the game. ‘Our tackling, in particular our leg chops, was of the highest order. The best form of defence is having the ball, but some periods in a Test match you are going to be asked to defend. I said to the players during the week that potentially we would have to make 150 to 200 tackles.’ His predictions were right. Ireland had 66 per cent of the possession but lacked the wherewithal to break through the wall of red. The bruising hits took their toll on the hosts, with Wales going into their defining tie against Italy with injury worries in the front row, where Samson Lee (achilles) and Gethin Jenkins (hamstring) are expected to miss out, while Richard Hibbard will also face concussion tests. Simon Zebo is sent flying by a tackle as Ireland fail to break the Welsh despite having a lot of possession . Ireland's Sean O'Brien keeps a grip on the ball but the Welsh defence was brilliant at the Millennium Stadium . Jamie Roberts is also doubtful after suffering a blow to the head. The centre is likely to be replaced by Scott Williams, who scored Wales’ only try on Saturday and is in line for his first start of the competition. With Wales needing to improve their points difference in the championship race, the Scarlets midfielder will be expected to add an attacking edge in Rome. With Wales being the early kick-off this weekend, it will be a case of hit and hope as they watch other results unfold. They have won their last seven games against Italy by an average of 17 points, although an even greater victory is likely to be the minimum requirement at the Stadio Olimpico. ‘We have given ourselves a fighting chance to go out to Rome and win this title again,’ said fly-half Dan Biggar. ‘If we can win it, after everybody writing us off when we lost at home to England, it will be one of this team’s best achievements. Maybe Scotland can do us a favour at home to Ireland and France against England at Twickenham. We know we have to score some points in Italy.’ Luke Charteris (right) celebrates with Liam Williams at full time after a Championship-defining victory .","Wales beat Ireland 23-16 in Cardiff in the RBS 6 Nations on Saturday .

"Ben Mee is more concerned with the impact Burnley’s win could have on their bid for Premier League survival than the blow it has dealt to his old club Manchester City. Sale-born Mee captained City to victory in the FA Youth Cup in 2008, just four months before the Abu Dhabi takeover, but was one of a number of youngsters who realised their futures lay elsewhere.

City have got a lot to do now. 'I had a couple of mates in the City end and I’m driving two of them home so I’ll enjoy that.’ Mee was relieved that referee Andre Marriner didn’t award a penalty for his challenge on Pablo Zabaleta late in the game. He added: ‘You always worry the referee has seen it from an angle and will give it, but we deserve a bit of luck.’ The left back attempts to console City's Sergio Aguero after the match which ended in a massive upset .

"She's a pistol! Jennifer Ullery, 40, has been arrested and charged with firing a rifle at a TV in front of her three children . A suburban Chicago woman was arrested after police say she grabbed a rifle and shot at her flat-screen television because she was mad her children were watching too much TV. Jennifer Ullery, a mother of three from Algonquin, pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of aggravated reckless discharge of a firearm, possession of a firearm without a firearm owner ID card and three counts of child endangerment in connection to the incident that took place back in January. Police learned of the shooting about a month later and responded to the Ullery family's home on Talaga Drive February 9 to investigate. Inside, responding officers said they found a 50-inch Panasonic TV with its screen shattered. Police also recovered a Ruger .22-caliber rifle, which they believe Ullery used to fire at the device, reported Northwest Herald. When interviewed by police, the 40-year-old mother admitted she was upset with her three children - ages 6, 11 and 15 - for indulging in TV-watching. She said she also did not like the program that was on January 20 - a music video by the rock band Primus. Algonquin Deputy Police Chief Andrew Doles said Ullery fired multiple shots at the TV screen as her children were sitting on the couch.

"From Burnley to Barcelona, the signposts all point to trouble ahead for Manchester City and their beleaguered manager Manuel Pellegrini. It will require his best win as City boss against Barca at the Nou Camp on Wednesday for Pellegrini to save the club’s Champions League dream and, possibly, his job. But City set out for Spain on Monday on the back of a dismal defeat at Turf Moor and a withering assessment of their shortcomings from Burnley’s match-winner George Boyd. George Boyd celebrates his sweet strike that saw Burnley upset Manchester City on Saturday . Burnley's Ben Mee tackles Pablo Zabaleta with the kind of physical presence he says helped them win . The Scot accused the Premier League champions of lacking both the appetite for a physical battle and willingness to track back and defend. It was something Burnley detected when they recovered to draw 2-2 at the Etihad in December and exploited again after analysing City’s defeat at Anfield earlier this month. ‘You saw it recently against Liverpool, they don’t track back as well as they go forward so we knew we could exploit that and we did,’ said Boyd, who scored with the sweetest of strikes after an hour. ‘I think it was playing to our strengths and getting in their faces that got us the win. You find with the bigger teams if you get in amongst them, press them hard and tackle they don’t really like it, and we did that. ‘I don’t think Barcelona will be in their faces as much as us and playing the long balls we play, but I thought we fully deserved the victory. ‘We didn’t think they would play as strong a team with Wednesday in mind, but obviously they came here to win and we were better than them.’ Boyd drills home his left-footed shot for the famous win against a side that goes to Barcelona on Wednesday . City boss Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure although his future will be decided at the close of the season . It is not the first time City’s work ethic has been questioned this season, but there appeared to be a deeper malaise. It was as bad as anything in the post-title slump under Roberto Mancini. They were flat, dull and at times almost uninterested. Everything that Burnley weren’t. Sportsmail’s Jamie Redknapp said it was the kind of performance that gets a manager the sack. No wonder Pellegrini’s agent was touting him to Napoli last week. There won’t be any knee-jerk reactions from City, however, Pellegrini’s performance will be assessed at the end of the season. City prepare to kick off after conceding the first goal at Turf Moor that they were unable to peg back . Edin Dzeko's attempt on goal is blocked by some desperate Burnley defence . The Chilean could yet mastermind a recovery in Barcelona and take City into the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time, having emerged from the first leg only 2-1 down. But apart from Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov this was close to the team that Pellegrini is expected to put out at the Nou Camp and they lost to a side battling relegation. Instead of making up ground on Chelsea in the title race, City are now in danger of getting swallowed up in the chase for places in next season’s Champions League and that would test the patience of Pellegrini’s employers. He maintains that the situation is not as bad as the corresponding period last season when City went out of the FA Cup and Champions League in the space of four days, losing at home to Wigan and away to Barcelona. The 61-year-old said: ‘It’s always the case before a big game that maybe the minds are not completely on this game,’ he said. ‘But I don’t think it was a case of them not trying. I don’t think Burnley had any chances to score apart from the free-kick which led to the beautiful goal. ‘Of course we are not doing well. You can see that from the amount of points we have dropped. The only thing I can tell you is that it’s not down to the effort of the players. They want, but maybe they can’t at the moment.’","George Boyd scored as Burnley toppled Manchester City 1-0 on Saturday .

"Paul Nicholls has set his sights on cracking the £3million prizemoney barrier for the third time in his career after revealing he expects many of his big names to be in action at next month’s Grand National meeting at Aintree. Paul Nicholls will run some of his biggest names at next month's Grant National meeting at Aintree . The man who has his ninth trainer’s title as good as in the bag also revealed he is likely to have more runners during the summer months in an attempt kick-start stable jockey Sam Twiston-Davies’ title challenge in the post-AP McCoy era. Definitely not heading to Aintree are Champion Chase winner Dodging Bullets and Coral Cup victor Aux Ptits Soins, who have run their last races of the season. But Aintree-bound are Silviniaco Conti, a disappointing seventh beind Coneygree in the Gold Cup, as well as World Hurdle second and third Zarkandar and Saphir Du Rheu, with the latter possibly reverting back to steeplechasing. Nicholls’ Grand National challenge is headed by Rocky Creek and Unioniste, whose Denman Chase third when trying to give weight to Gold Cup winner Coneygree at Newbury last month now looks a fair effort. Nicholls, whose double at Kempton on Saturday following his three successes at the Cheltenham Festival took him to 97 winners and £2.63million for the campaign, said: ‘I love going to Aintree and the aim is to crack the £3m in prizemoney. There is a long way to go in the season yet. It would be nice to do that. ‘But there are a lot of horses I will finish now and save for next year. We want to help Sam be champion jockey . Anything a bit below top class could run on through the summer to try to get him as many winners before we properly get going. Silviniaco Conti (right), a disapponting seventh in the Betfrd Gold Cup, will line up at Aintree . ‘Last year we had a very slow start and Sam only had five winners for us by October.’ Whether Silviniaco Conti runs in another Gold Cup has yet to be decided but after a third defeat in the race, Nicholls knows his priority with the gelding will be trying to win a third King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day. Nicholls, who revealed RSA Chase runner-up Southfield Theatre has underone an operation to prevent infection in the bad leg cut he picked up during the race, added: ’The plan with Silviniaco Conti will be Aintree if he is alright.

"Andy Murray admitted Great Britain's Davis Cup win over the United States in his native Glasgow had been a 'very emotional' experience after he sealed victory with a straight-sets win over John Isner. Murray overcame some difficult moments in the first set to secure a 7-6 (7/4) 6-3 7-6 (7/4) triumph at the Emirates Arena and line up a World Group quarter-final home tie against France. The 27-year-old had set Britain on the way by taking two sets inside 46 minutes against Donald Young on Friday afternoon but the drama was only just beginning. Andy Murray described leading Great Britain to Davis Cup victory over the United States as 'very emotional' Murray celebrates during his straight sets win over John Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place . British No 1 Murray was pumped up by his home Glasgow crowd as GB secured a 3-1 win over the USA . Murray stretches for a backhand as Isner put up a fight on Sunday in the Davis Cup tie in Scotland . Murray then watched team-mate James Ward come from two sets down to win an epic tussle with world number 20 Isner before his brother Jamie and Dom Ingol came back from a similar position against Mike and Bob Bryan, the best doubles team of all time, only to fall just short in another marathon tie. And Murray was proud to have been part of an effort that repeated Britain's win in San Diego at the same stage last year. The former Wimbledon champion said: 'The effort and attitude of everyone in the team was excellent. I feel we deserved to win because of that. 'Everyone fought extremely hard especially when we were behind in the matches, no-one gave up and everyone played every point extremely hard. 'It's a big win. It means a lot to everyone, all the staff and the players. 'There's a great synergy in the team and that builds the emotion and togetherness. It gives you that extra incentive to perform and fight for every single point. 'I was very emotional the whole weekend. I know the team extremely well, the players and the staff. 'I was proud of them as team-mates and also as friends and my brother of the way they performed and thought in this arena and under that much pressure. All of them did incredibly well. I was proud to be part of their team.' Murray, embracing GB team captain Leon Smith, praised the 'effort and attitude of everyone in the team' Big American Isner fell to Murray after James Ward come from two sets down to beat him in an epic tussle . Murray says he was proud to be part of the GB team and of how they all handled the pressure of the stage . Murray admitted he had felt the pressure a bit too much at the start of the final day's play. He fought off three break points after two double faults to tie the score at 4-4 and then saved three set points in his next service game, producing aces at crucial moments. Big-serving Isner hit 12 aces before the tie-break but some excellent backhand slices gave Murray the advantage and a brilliant lob saw him break in the second set. Murray stayed out of trouble in the third and his mental strength was again on show as he wrapped up the victory. 'I felt a little bit more pressure today to try to close it out and also the way John approached the match made it difficult,' he said. 'I knew James was extremely tired and it would be very tough ask for him to win that match after me. There is real pressure to help your team-mates out. 'He put in such a big effort on Friday that I wanted to finish the tie there and not have to make him go out there and try to win the last point.' Great Britain captain Smith celebrate as their talisman Murray wins a crucial point against World No 20 Isner . Murray also paid tribute to his opponent Isner: 'The way John approached the match made it difficult' Murray produced the right results in points at key moments to overcome the fancied American . Ward won the first set of his dead rubber 7-5 against Young before pulling out early in the second set to make it a 3-2 win for Britain. Ward, who flies to California from London on Monday along with Murray, said: 'My knee hurt so I pulled out and I'm playing on Tuesday in Indian Wells. So I need to get going and I probably wouldn't have made my flight tonight. It was a dead rubber and I'm sure everyone understood the situation.' Isner later took the blame for his country's defeat. 'This one's on me,' he said. 'My team-mates may say otherwise but my loss on Friday put us in a huge hole. It's so, so disappointing for me. 'Beating Andy in this atmosphere, I tried my best, but there are not many people can beat him out there. 'What happened on Friday in my match hurt us. It's going to stick with me for a while. I feel like I let us down. It's a terrible feeling.' Britain will again be at home in the last eight on July 17-19 against France, who beat Germany 3-2 after winning the first three matches including singles triumphs for world top-20 players Gilles Simon and Gael Monfils. Isner took responsibility for the loss saying 'This one's on me' after his loss to Ward . Isner, however, says there were ew players in the world who could have conquered Murray in Glasgow .","Andy Murray beat John Isner in straight sets to secure GB win over US .

"The baseball player who lost a staggering amount of weight has piled the pounds back on after discovering he plays worse as a slimmer man. The death of his cousin to heart disease inspired Carsten Charles Sabathia to lose a massive 17kg between October 2013 and March 2014. But the 34-year-old played poorly and many - including himself - believe his skinny figure could not support his towering six-foot, seven-inch frame. So after dropping down to a much healthier 122kg, the Major League baseballer has again ballooned to around 136kg. Before and after: New York Yankees' pitcher CC Sabathia lost 17kg for the 2014 season (left) but piled the pounds back on this year (pictured) The struggle: Sabathia (pictured this year) says the reason he played worse as a skinny man is because he felt 'off balance' Toning up: Sabathia (left) looked in the best shape of his life as he toned up for his wedding to Amber (pictured) in January last year . The New York Yankees pitcher looked in the best shape of his life during on his wedding day in January 2014. Famous for having a more rotund figure, the sportsman showed of his newly toned body in a suit he could not have dreamed of wearing a year before. He said: 'I feel like this is a good weight. I feel a little stronger. I feel my legs under me, being a lot stronger, and being able to push off the mound.' The six-time All-Star put on around 9kg while recovering from a knee injury, and 5kg more over the winter. During his 14-year-career, he has weighed as much as 142kg but the loss of his cousin in 2012 inspired Sabathia to battle his obesity for fear he would suffer the same fate. He said: 'I lost a bunch of weight drastically, pretty quick, two years ago. 'Kind of was off balance and didn't know really how my body was working. So just talking to Dr. Ahmad and to the trainers, I feel like this is a good weight.'

He told the Boston Globe: 'The weight loss has created a balance problem for him. He's all over the place. 'He's learning how to pitch in that body, a body he's really never had. I don't think there's anything wrong with him other than that. 'Sometimes you pitch at a certain weight all your life and then someone has the brilliant idea that you should lose weight because it's putting stress on your knees, you do it, and then you're dealing with something else.'","CC Sabathia lost staggering 17kg in just five months to improve his health .

"Ronny Deila secured his first trophy triumph as Celtic manager – then cut short the celebrations by slapping a midnight curfew on his players. Goals from Kris Commons and substitute James Forrest – who also missed a late penalty – secured the Scottish League Cup against 10-man Dundee United. With the sides set to meet for a third time in 10 days in Wednesday’s Scottish Cup replay, however, the Parkhead coach warned his players to forget any notions of a Scott Brown-style blow-out. Ronny Deila hopes to become the third Celtic manager to achieve a domestic treble with The Bhoys . ‘We should enjoy the moment, but there is not going to be any nightlife,’ Deila said, reacting to the furore created by his skipper’s revelry in Edinburgh strip clubs four nights before the final. ‘The players will have a calm night. We will go back to the stadium and have a couple of beers and enjoy it, but it will be early to bed before midnight and be ready for training tomorrow at 1pm.’ Deila then joked: ‘For the staff it’s a little bit longer.’ Despite urging his players to be ‘24-hour athletes’ earlier this season the Norwegian played down the seriousness of the Brown incident, with pictures of the skipper slumped on a pavement plastered over the pages of newspapers. Scott Brown lifts the Scottish League Cup alongside Craig Gordon (right) after a difficult week in the headlines . Insisting there was no question or disciplinary action or dropping the 29-year-old, Deila added: ‘This case, for me, is not a big one. He was home at 10.30. It just looks like he was home at six in the morning. ‘He was drinking, he had a day off the day after. I have no rules about that. I said the players have to be fit – and Scott Brown is the fittest player we have. ‘But we have a reputation to take care of and the way the pictures appeared in the newspaper was nothing for him or me to be proud of. So we have to learn from this. ‘When you play for Celtic everybody chases you and you don’t get the personal time. ‘You have to always know what you are doing. Celtic manager Ronny Deila gets ready to lift the Scottish League Cup with his players on Sunday . ‘This is something everybody has to learn from – but, again, it was not a big issue for me.’ Asked if Brown had apologised, the Parkhead boss added: ‘He was not happy about it, but he didn’t do anything big or harmful for me. ‘It’s not a positive example for youngsters. But Broony has played 60 or 65 matches this year, he had a day off and wanted to be out with his friends. ‘As I said he was home at 10.30pm so it was not a big thing. We will see if he learns in the future but he made up for it today – he played a very good game.’ Keeper Craig Gordon gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne ast his team-mates . Stefan Johansen was also quick to support his captain with the 29-year-old leading his club to the first leg of what Celtic hope will be a rare treble. And despite admitting it was ;not what you want to see’, Johansen insists his midfield colleague showed his class in Sunday’s 2-0 win. ‘I think Broonie showed what a captain he is today – a captain with a big letter at the front,’ Johansen said. ‘I thought he was absolutely fantastic. He’s 100 per cent in training every day so when that (night out picture) came up I wasn’t concerned, not even a little bit. Celtic manager Ronny Deila urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble . ‘It’s not what you want to see happening, but it’s happened and you have to move on. But what Scott Brown did today was unbelievable. He showed today what a player he is.’ Deila meantime believes his side fully merited their step towards his target of a domestic treble and said: ‘It is a great feeling. ‘It is good to get a good start when you are the manager in a big club such as Celtic and this was the first trophy we could win. We did it and you get an appetite from this. ‘You want more and I am happy for the boys and proud of them. I think we put in a professional performance. You should really enjoy this moment. John Guidetti (left) celebrates James Forrest's strike for The Hoops as they beat Dundee United . ‘You can never rest on what you have done before. ‘We have talked about the treble many times and it is a dream. It is so tough to do it, but it is possible and the dream is still alive. We have one trophy and we have to be back again on Wednesday if we are to win another cup trophy.’ Deila, meanwhile, insists he knows nothing of reports of a loan deal for Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard during the MLS off-season next January. Amid claims Celtic could help the former England captain keep fit for three months Deila said: ‘No, that’s a new thing to me. That’s a year away until that time and we have to take it day by day instead. But Gerrard is a hero. He is a Liverpool star and best player of all time. It’s a good name, but we will see if that’s possible in January. It’s something you know more about than me.’ The Celtic players celebrate on the podium with the QTS Scottish League Cup after beating Dundee United 2-0 .","Ronny Deila won his first trophy as Celtic manager on Sunday .

"It was a decade ago that John Terry, who has captained Chelsea 528 times, first learned the tricks of the role under the tutelage of Jose Mourinho. After impressing Mourinho upon inheriting the armband from Marcel Desailly, the manager wanted to see Terry evolve from a very good centre half into a great captain, using his profile to control games and influence decisions in the way Roy Keane, Patrick Vieira and Alan Shearer did. Like them, Terry proved quite an expert. It is partly why he has been one of English football’s most successful modern captains and why Fabio Capello risked — and lost — his job trying to restore him as England skipper. The Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers at Stamford Bridge as he brandishes the red card . Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half . John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge . It is also why Mourinho has promised another one-year deal to the defender, who turns 35 this year. Terry understands what his manager wants. This includes turning the heat on officials, as he did on Wednesday against Paris Saint-Germain when he led nine excited team-mates in pursuit of referee Bjorn Kuipers to ensure Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off. Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona knew how to exaggerate fouls, pressure the referee and cultivate their reputation as the team most sinned against. Mourinho and PSG midfielder Thiago Motta discovered this when they were at Inter Milan. No-one can make slight contact appear quite as painful as Sergio Busquets. Chelsea's players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic (second right) Chelsea went close up with Barca at times, including the nights when Tom Henning Ovrebo found infamy and Terry was sent off for kicking Alexis Sanchez and banned for the Champions League final. Everyone is at it, as Terry said. Everyone always has been, to some degree. But Chelsea always manage to offend. Even when there is much to admire about them. Graeme Souness claimed it’s ‘not the British way’ but traditional sporting integrity has faded from view. Winning matters more than ever. Managers find ways to do it. Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic grabs Everton's James McCarthy around the neck last month . Chelsea striker Diego Costa (right) stamped on Liverpool's Emre Can during a fiery Capital One Cup clash . Wednesday’s snarling exit from Europe epitomised Chelsea from the first Mourinho era: winning ugly and losing badly. This was one of the issues which drove owner Roman Abramovich and Mourinho apart in the first place. There are differences this time but the defining image of the second leg against PSG is the latest in a series of skirmishes. Last month, Branislav Ivanovic grabbed Everton’s James McCarthy by the throat as Chelsea swarmed around referee Jon Moss in reaction to a tackle by Gareth Barry, which also led to a red card. Both teams were fined £30,000 by the FA for failing to control their players and Chelsea were warned about surrounding the referee. Chelsea striker Diego Costa makes a beeline for Ibrahimovic as the referee raises the red card . Last month, Diego Costa was banned for stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can during a physical Capital One Cup semi-final. There were flashes last season: two red cards at Aston Villa and touchline eruptions featuring Mourinho and Rui Faria. More recently, Nemanja Matic was dismissed for pushing Ashley Barnes over. The tackle by Barnes was bad and sparked a furious reaction from those in blue, who rushed Martin Atkinson. Ivanovic grabbed his hand to stop him raising the red card. Others deploy such tactics — Angel di Maria was sent off for pulling the referee’s shirt on Monday in a game where Wayne Rooney seemed joined to Michael Oliver — but Chelsea are perhaps the most committed. The Sky Sports pundits were scathing of Chelsea's 'pathetic' behaviour at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday . At the slightest contact in the penalty area, they hit the deck and if the appeals are rejected the ensuing mass protest can feature half-a-dozen people fuming on the touchline. Repeat to build pressure. If there is a fierce tackle, the victim exaggerates the pain, while the team swarm around the referee. Some sprint half the length of the pitch to create panic and cloud the referee’s judgment. Get enough around the ref and he has no idea who said what or who to book. It creates panic. Call it protection for Eden Hazard, who has been kicked a lot. Call it a protection racket. Under Premier League rules Chelsea would probably have been charged with failing to control their players, who constantly surrounded the referee on Wednesday. Fortunately for them, no such action exists under UEFA rules. Jose Mourinho, questioning a decision with the officials, saw his Chelsea side crash out of Europe . The Chelsea squad are left reflecting what might have been after the costly 2-2 draw with PSG . Mourinho muddies it all with his quotability and media strategy, always seeking to gain a small advantage, which can be vital at the rarefied end of European competition where teams are so tightly matched that each big decision is magnified in importance. Perhaps it is a by-product of the arrogance the best teams need, because Arsenal and Manchester United over-stepped the mark when they ruled the roost. Mourinho’s first spell at the Bridge was littered with on-field confrontations and associated fines. He had been sacked but the tone was still set when, in March 2008, Ashley Cole turned his back as he was booked by Mike Riley and the FA rolled out their Respect campaign, intended for the grassroots game, in the Premier League too. It might be time to rekindle the spirit of the Respect campaign, because seven years is a long time in football and unlike the words of wisdom from Mourinho into JT’s shell-like, many of the basic points have been forgotten.

"Spanish paella, pulled pork burger, red velvet cupcakes - These all sound like delicacies from an upscale restaurant not meals for our pooches. But Asia Upward wanted to be quirky and combine her love for food photography with her love for her dogs, and thus the book 'A Dog's World' was born. She told Daily Mail Australia that she wanted to raise the stakes and come up with something quirky that would humour people and wasn't the everyday image. So she substituted humans for dogs. Scroll down for video . Asia Upward has released a book that combines recipes for dogs and photography titles 'A Dog's World' She said she wanted to raise the stakes and come up with something quirky that wasn't the everyday image. Asia has tested out most of her recipes on her 10-year-old Ridgeback cross cattle dog, Bear . 'I am based in Melbourne and what I have noticed is that there is always a new trend, like the pulled-pork fad,' she said. Mash the banana thoroughly. Add all of the ingredients into a food processor or blender and mix until smooth. Place mixture into ice cube trays and freeze. Once frozen they are ready to serve. 'I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great to do this for my dog - so I did and then started brainstorming more and more ideas for dog recipes.' Recipes that you will come across in the book range from icy pole bones to winter warming vegetable soup and her personal favourite - red velvet pupcakes. The healthiness of the meal for the dog is paramount to Asia, so with the cupcakes, she uses beetroot to get the deep red colour and sugar-free yogurt for the icing. So as delicious as these meals appear in the images to anyone's eye, they are aimed purely at dogs. 'I actually ate the pulled-pork burger once,' Asia said. 'There is obviously no seasoning in any of the meals, its really simple plain food, so I had to add some relish.' Recipes in the book range from icy pole bones to winter warming vegetable soup and red velvet pupcakes. Asia used Gumtree to source the dogs as she was new to Melbourne and did not know many dog owners . Her inspiration for the book has stemmed from her deep, childhood love for dogs . Asia tested out most of the recipes on her 10-year-old half ridgeback and half cattle dog, Bear. Her mum rescued Bear from the blue mountains when he was 4-weeks-old. He was the runt of a litter of puppies whose mother could not adequately care for them so he has been with Asia ever since. Her inspiration for the book has stemmed from her deep, childhood love for dogs. 'I found a picture of myself when I was three-years-old at my parents house absolutely surrounded by dogs,' she said. 'I didn't have many kids to play with, so I had pets my entire life instead.' Further motivation came when the Melbourne-based photographer was travelling in Sumatra and experienced the strewn mange, disease and dejection of the street dogs. 'I found a picture of myself when I was three-years-old at my parents house absolutely surrounded by dogs' Motivation for the book came when she was travelling in Sumatra and experienced the disease and dejection of the street dogs . Icy pole bones with natural low fat yogurt, 1 banana, peanut butter and honey . Asia is planning another trip to Sri Lanka in September to advocate animal welfare . 'There was a tiny puppy crossing the road in front of the car, skinny and sick so I asked the driver if we could do something and he just laughed at me,' she said. 'It broke my heart.' Chop and brown the beef hearts . Put the browned meat and other ingredients into large pot and bring to boil . Reduce heat once boiling and simmer covered for 30 minutes . Serve at room temperature with brown rice . As soon as Asia returned home she began working on her book and with its release, she aims to raise awareness and funds for Animal SOS Sri Lanka, a charity dedicated to not only rescuing street animals but also educating the people of Sri Lanka in animal welfare. She is planning another trip over there on the 20th of September to help Animal SOS campaign and advertise their strong message. On being asked how she sourced the pooches for the shoot, Asia admitted it was not the most orthodox method. 'Believe it or not, I used Gumtree,' she laughed. 'I was new to Melbourne and didn't know any dog owners so I put an ad up on Gumtree and was taken aback by how many people responded. Asia evidently could not use them all but is keeping everyone in mind for her second book as the characters that she found on set were priceless. 'There was a little French Bulldog who was hilarious, I wanted to get a shot of him looking at the cake but he just launched into it and devoured the entire thing before even looking at it.'","Asia Upward released a photography and recipe book titled 'A Dog's World'

"Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, has apologised for the confusion over Fernando Alonso’s condition, and predicted that the Spaniard would race again in Malaysia a fortnight on Sunday. At a dinner in Melbourne ahead of the opening grand prix in Australia this weekend, Dennis set the record straight after saying erroneously that Alonso was not concussed in an accident in testing in Barcelona on February 22. Dennis said: ‘It was not the best performance by me. I understand why the press beat me up - for being inaccurate. I wanted to be open and honest. Ron Dennis apologised for saying Fernando Alonso wasn't concussed when he crashed in testing last month . Italian Alonso had an accident during in testing for McLaren in Barcelona on February 22 . ‘I failed. But it is, as always, my objective to try to be as honest as possible in the future. ‘There are complexities about concussion. It is difficult to quantify, and it goes beyond my area of expertise. It is not my decision whether he will race in Malaysia, but as far as I know he will be there. I have every reason to believe he will be. ‘I spoke to Fernando on the way to this dinner. ‘He wants to race in Malaysia. I hope he does, but it is his decision, not mine.’ Alonso, here being wheeled away from the crash site, says he wants to race in the Malaysian Grand Prix . McLaren boss Dennis relayed Alonso's desire to race a fortnight from Sunday and says it's the driver's choice . Meanwhile Formula One’s penchant for chaos was never better demonstrated than in a bizarre court case unfolding just down the road from the Albert Park track that will host Sunday’s race. At issue is whether a Dutch driver called Giedo van der Garde should drive for Sauber. Subject to an appeal in Melbourne on Thursday, he will win that right - a decision that could even mark the end of Sauber’s participation in the sport after 22 years. This pickle came about after Sauber seemingly reneged on a contract that said Van der Garde would race for them this season. They instead hired two drivers, Brazilian Felipe Nasr and Sweden’s Marcus Ericsson, who between them bring £20million to the team. But Van der Garde went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, clutching his contract. Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde has taken Sauber to court claiming his right to drive for the team . They found in his favour, a ruling that was upheld by the Supreme Court of Victoria here on Wednesday. Sauber decided to appeal, the result of which is expected on Thursday. The team’s lawyers argued that - only days away from this weekend’s race - installing a different driver was an unacceptable safety risk. They said the cars had been fitted to the specifications of Nasr and Ericsson. Rodney Garratt QC told the court that the absence of the correct seatbelt meant Van der Garde could not compete safely given the 210mph speed of the cars and g-forces ‘up to five times their bodyweight’. In truth, Sauber’s argument was melodramatic rubbish. Even if they need to make some late changes, why is it less safe to let Van der Garde drive than Roberto Merhi, who was only named as Manor’s driver on Tuesday? Merhi has never driven the Manor car. Nobody has. It only passed its crash test last week. Sauber's Marcus Ericsson (left) and Filipe Nasr wait to se if they will drive in Melbourne this weekend . And Van Der Garde, 29, was even Sauber’s test driver last year. They know his measurements. No, Sauber cannot afford to drop Nasr, who is backed by Banco do Brasil, or Ericsson, who brings in a sponsorship package worth £10million. Much of the pair’s money has been paid up front. Those backers would not react kindly to being told their man is suddenly out of a job. One solution would be Van der Garde agreeing to receive compensation, but it is said he would prefer to get the drive rather than the money. However, even this is illogical because without Sauber’s two high-paying drivers the whole team could be forced into administration, meaning therefore, he would have nobody to drive for.","Fernando Alonso could race again in Malaysia a fortnight on Sunday .

"Giedo van der Garde stands on the brink of driving in this weekend's Australian Grand Prix after Sauber suffered another defeat in their legal battle with the Dutchman. Van der Garde was axed by Sauber from his role as test driver at the end of last year as the Swiss-based marque employed Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. But, with a contract from the team stating he was to be given a full-time seat for this season, Van der Garde has pursued Sauber through the courts these past few weeks. Giedo van der Garde, outside the Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday, has charged Sauber with reneging on a deal to give him a race seat after they signed Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr . An arbitration panel in Switzerland initially ordered Sauber 'to refrain from taking action' that would deny Van der Garde a drive. That decision was then upheld on Wednesday by the Supreme Court in Victoria, Australia, following a hearing on Monday. Although Sauber immediately launched an appeal, that has now been rejected following the latest hearing on Thursday. At present, Van der Garde is now pursuing an enforcement of the order to ensure Sauber comply, which would result in the 29-year-old taking part in first practice from 12.30pm local time on Friday. Sauber are now left with three drivers; Van der Garde, Marcus Ericsson (left) and Felipe Nasr (right) For Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn, she has three drivers on her books, but only two seats available. Should Kaltenborn ignore the ruling and opt to continue with Ericsson and Nasr she and the team could find themselves in contempt of court. In pursuing the enforcement in a separate hearing and in front of a different judge less than an hour after the appeal verdict was handed down, van der Garde's lawyer called for the potential sequestration of Sauber's assets and committal of its directors if the team failed to comply. Sauber have since been asked to provide a list of those assets, which includes their cars and equipment at Melbourne's Albert Park in place for the race. Court proceedings are due to continue at 10.30am local time (11.30pm UK), just two hours before the start of first practice. Sauber's failure to comply could result in the sequestration of their assets, and the possibility of action being taken against Kaltenborn given her position as a director. For his part, Van der Garde is also attempting to acquire a valid and temporary super licence - required for any driver to compete in F1 - as the one in place for last season has since expired. The 29-year-old must do so through his local motor-racing authority in Holland, who in turn contact world governing body, the FIA. Van der Garde had said he was looking forward to going back to the team and driving for them this weekend . Felipe Massa has praised Van der Garde's actions, claiming 'it is a good thing for all drivers' Speaking outside court, Van der Garde said: 'Sauber has to work with us now. There is no other issue. I'm also confident the super licence can be fast-tracked.' Former Sauber driver Felipe Massa, now with Williams, speaking ahead of the appeal verdict, believes Van der Garde had taken the correct steps to pursue his case via the legal system. Massa, speaking in the paddock at Melbourne's Albert Park, said: 'It shouldn't be the way people should be treating drivers. They should respect drivers. 'A driver can be quite powerful. We are working here, we need the work, the career, so it's not fair when people treat you the way he has been treated. It doesn't matter if you are a driver or an engineer. 'Everyone should be treated fairly, and if there is a contract then that should be respected because there are rules and they have to be followed. 'Sometimes you hear stories in F1 of drivers having a contract with a team and they just get kicked out, or drivers who are owed money. 'Giedo is a good example. Drivers should stand up for their rights, so I see it as a good thing for all drivers, but also anyone in F1 as they should be treated the same as any worker in the world.'

"John Terry has launched an extraordinary defence of Chelsea's bully-boy tactics. Nine Chelsea stars - including captain Terry - surrounded the referee to successfully get Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off for a lunge on Oscar in their Champions League defeat. But Terry has attempted to excuse the players' behaviour and insisted it was simply retaliation for PSG's antics. Chelsea's players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic (second right) in the first half of the Blues' defeat . John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge in the second leg clash . The referee is almost completely hidden from view as the Chelsea players make their case as they gained an early advantage . He said: 'If I have to run 20, 30 yards, it doesn't look great but when you're standing back and seeing five or six of their players surrounding the ref, for me I think I support my team-mates. 'And once I go, four or five go with me. It doesn't look good at all but that's part of the game. We'll match it if people want to mix it, that's part of our game as well. 'There was an awful lot going on but ‎I don't think anyone got caught up in it. 'Once they're charging the ref, the only thing we can do is respond. You can't as a group of players let them surround the ref, trying to get our players booked.' Ibrahimovic's challenge on Chelsea midfielder Oscar which earned the striker a red card many perceived to be harsh . Ibrahimovic holds his hands up after the challenge as the Chelsea players begin their protests which later drew criticism . Chelsea striker Diego Costa makes a beeline for Ibrahimovic as the referee raises the red card to send the Swede for an early bath . Terry also hit back at critics who accused Chelsea players of behaving badly as they crashed out of the Champions League. Ibrahimovic branded them 'babies' for their reaction to his tackle on Oscar which persuaded Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers to send him off half an hour into the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. On TV, Jamie Carragher called the pressure they put on the officials 'disgraceful' and said it came from manager Jose Mourinho, while Graeme Souness said Oscar's play acting was 'pathetic'. 'Coming from them?', was Terry's initial response. The Chelsea captain added: 'I don't want to get involved in a row but as a group it's difficult. It's there and you have to stick up for your team-mates. 'The fans want to see that and that's the same with every side. Every other side is as bad as each other. It's part of the game. It's maybe an excuse they're looking for but certainly not from our point.' It made for a disappointing night for Mourinho's players, dumped out on away goals despite leading twice and left to focus on the title race. Ibrahimovic called Chelsea 'babies' for their reaction to the challenge which led to his dismissal but he has the last laugh as PSG progressed . Sportsmail columnist and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said the pressure Chelsea put on the referee was 'disgraceful' Carragher, Thierry Henry (centre) and Graeme Souness disect Chelsea's exit from the Champions League on Sky Sports . Terry said: 'We have to pick ourselves up and go again at the weekend now. We've got another big game against a very good Southampton side. 'We've got the Capital One Cup in the pocket and the Premier League is a massive one to go for. We're a few points clear and we need to keep that gap and maintain it. We can only do that by responding and doing that the right way and coming back here and picking up three points. 'The manager said then if we can win the Capital One Cup and the Premier League, it will be a very successful year. There is an awful lot to do but it's in our hands and we have to respond. We've got four or five days until Sunday's game. '[We will have a] couple of days warm down, train and then pick ourselves right back up. As a group of players, there's enough experience in the squad to rally round and get everyone going again.' There will be no English teams in the last eight of the Champions League unless Arsenal or Manchester City can overturn first leg defeats next week in Monaco and Barcelona respectively. Terry said: 'We've had our fair share of maintaining interest for English sides in the competition over the years. It's disappointing to go out early. It's different for us, we're normally in the hat for the next round for sure but from the club's point a view and the players and the fans, we're obviously really disappointed. 'They probably deserved the win and going down to 10 they were probably the better side as well. So I wish them good luck and we regroup and go again in this competition next season.'

"Last January, former Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert slammed the FA Cup as a distraction — claiming that most Premier League managers would prefer to avoid the grand old competition. Phil Parkinson of League One Bradford City would probably be inclined to disagree. On Monday night, the Valley Parade side will kick off their 37th cup tie in the last four seasons when they travel to Reading for an FA Cup quarter-final replay. Phil Parkinson has had terrific success in cup competitions with Bradford City in the last four years . Since taking over in August 2011, Parkinson has led his side to an average extra 10 games each campaign as Bradford have reached the Capital One Cup final and enjoyed lengthy runs in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy and FA Cup. These exploits have seen them play 37 cup ties on top of their four 46-game league campaigns during Parkinson's tenure — almost an additional Premier League season's worth of fixtures. Bradford have vanquished no fewer than five top-flight sides — Wigan, Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Sunderland — beaten 14 higher-division teams and won 21, drawn four and lost just 11 ties in total. They also have a 100-per-cent record in penalty shootouts under Parkinson, winning all seven they have contested. Bradford reached the Capital One Cup final in 2013 where they were beaten by Swansea City . And far from sidelining their progress in the league, this rich experience of knockout football helped Bradford win promotion to League One via the play-offs in 2013. Their victory over Northampton at Wembley was their second visit to the national stadium that year after Capital One Cup final defeat to Swansea, and was their 64th game in all competitions. Even if they can't secure a third trip down Wembley Way at the Madjeski Stadium, Bradford are still firmly in the hunt for promotion to the Championship — sitting just three points off sixth place with a game in hand.

"Diego Costa may be Chelsea's star striker but he has well and truly misfired in this season's Champions League. Chelsea were knocked out of the last-16 on away goals on Wednesday night after the tie against PSG finished 3-3 on aggregate. And yet again it was another barren night for Costa, who has failed to score a single goal in seven Champions League appearances - a total of eight hours and 28 minutes of action - this season. Diego Costa shows his frustrations during Chelsea's Champions League exit on Wednesday night . PSG defender David Luiz gestures towards Costa during the 2-2 Champions League draw at Stamford Bridge . Costa (centre) argues with PSG defender Thiago Silva on a frustrating night for Blues fans . It pales into comparison with the Brazilian-born Spain striker's Premier League goalscoring record of 17 goals in 21 appearances. Costa has averaged 2.4 shots per game in the Premier League, while he could only manage 1.7 in Europe's premier club competition. The 26-year-old's domestic shooting accuracy (shots on target) is 68 per cent, which beats his European figure of 50 per cent. Costa's failure to score in the competition this season is all the more remarkable when you consider how influential he was in Atletico Madrid's run to the final last year. He scored eight goals in nine Champions League appearances last season and finished as the competition's third highest scorer. Costa celebrates after Chelsea go 2-0 up against Spurs in the Capital One Cup final - but it was an own goal . Costa scores Chelsea's third goal in the 5-0 win against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium in January . In general, Costa's cup record for Chelsea has been poor, also failing to score in one FA Cup and three Capital One Cup appearances. Some, including the man himself, have argued that he deserves credit for Chelsea's second goal in their 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the Capital One Cup final but it was officially given as a Kyle Walker own goal after a deflection. It aptly sums up his woes for Chelsea in the cup competitions this year.","Diego Costa did not score once in seven Champions League appearances .

"After being knocked out of the Champions League, Chelsea have just 11 games left this campaign with all eyes geared towards the Premier League title. Although five points clear, some chinks in Jose Mourinho's side's armour were bared for the world to see on Wednesday. Here, Sportsmail lays out five things the Portuguese manager must do to end the season in style. Rediscover the attacking flow . Anyone watching the limp defensive display against Paris Saint-Germain would find it hard to remember, but for the first half of the season, Chelsea were breathtaking. The creative hub of Eden Hazard, Oscar and Cesc Fabregas, the fearsome Diego Costa in full, free-scoring behemoth mode up front, glued together with the tireless Nemanja Matic and a rock-solid back four. Chelsea need to rediscover the attacking form that saw Eden Hazard as the league's best creative force . Diego Costa nets Chelsea's third in a demolition at Swansea that showcased the side's attacking brilliance . Take the departed Andre Schurrle’s goal at Burnley in the season opener, Fabregas’s strike at Crystal Palace, any of the five netted at Swansea… it seemed the Blues had finally meshed typical Mourinho steel with the beautiful attacking craved by Roman Abramovich. Mar 15 - Southampton (H) Mar 22 - Hull (A) Apr 04 - Stoke (H) Apr 12 - QPR (A) Apr 18 - Manchester United (H) Apr 26 - Arsenal (A) Apr 29 - Leicester City (A) May 02 - Crystal Palace (H) May 16 - West Brom (A) May 24 - Sunderland (H) In recent weeks, however, Mourinho has reverted to defensive type – to the side’s downfall against 10-man PSG. With a host of winnable games left among the remaining Premier League matches, putting a few teams to the sword in style would do wonders for confidence in the home straight. Use the whole squad . Mourinho has used just 22 players in the league this season – fewer than any other team. The boss would point to being five points clear at the division’s summit as justification, but the stars of the side being tired out leads to displays like Wednesday’s. Felipe Luis and Loic Remy must have envisaged getting more playing time when moving to Stamford Bridge in the summer, while Juan Cuadrado would hope to have made more of an impact in his two months. The likes of Oscar and Fabregas, in particular, have been noticeably poorer as the season has progressed. Use of the whole squad is key at the top level, and something Mourinho has mastered at all his previous clubs. If he doesn’t trust the players below the first XI, expect changes this summer. While he has less games left than he would have liked, Mourinho must utilise everyone at his disposal to keep the side fresh in the run-in. Loic Remy may be wondering why he has had so little game-time since arriving at Stamford Bridge . Juan Cuadrado has found chances hard to come by since arriving in January from Fiorentina . Give Petr Cech a proper swansong . Thibaut Courtois can be Chelsea’s goalkeeper for the next decade. One of the most highly-rated keepers in Europe, his extended loan at Atletico Madrid prepared him for a long career in London. It would follow that we are in the final moments of Petr Cech’s sublime stewardship between the posts. However, the distinction between first and second choice has become far more blurred as the season has progressed. Thibaut Courtois has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box, leading to goals conceded . Courtois, while one of the world’s finest shot-stoppers, has had trouble claiming crosses and showing authority in the box. Against PSG, he pulled off a terrific stop only to fail to come for the resulting corner. He has time to develop into the role. For now, however, Mourinho must reinstall Cech as undisputed No 1. He has performed in every big game when called upon this season, knows what it takes to win the league, and has the experience required to guide the defence through the last 11 fixtures. Petr Cech has impressed whenever called into the No 1 role after manning the Chelsea gloves for 10 years . Cech (left) knows what it takes to win the title at Chelsea, here celebrating in 2005 with his team-mates . Reclaim the midfield… by giving Fabregas a rest . When Fabregas left Barcelona in the summer, the Catalan club’s official website bemoaned his performances tailing off in the second half of the season. While this may have been a little facetious, his maiden campaign at Stamford Bridge would appear to prove them correct. The midfielder has been poor since the turn of the year, at least. Cesc Fabregas, battling Marco Verratti, has not been firing on all cylinders since Christmas . Particularly in upcoming fixtures against Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, Mourinho could do with the frenetic presence of Ramires, a repositioned Kurt Zouma or even the young Nathan Ake to add more physical and defensive presence in midfield. Chelsea’s midfield, with the Spaniard at the helm, completely failed to make the extra man count against PSG. Unless Fabregas can prove he is as useful in central midfield against a top side as he is while carving up Swansea or Schalke, he may lose the manager’s faith when it comes to the crunch. Cut out the madness . Every back page in the country on Thursday morning showed Chelsea players surrounding the referee before being dumped out of Europe. It wasn’t the first time Blues fans woke up to see their team being discussed for the wrong reasons this season. Chelsea players surround the referee before Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off during the hot-tempered affair . Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill and Diego Costa have all sparked nationwide debates with on-pitch antics, while Mourinho’s famed siege mentality has manifested itself in fairly ugly ways as the campaign has progressed. In these remaining 11 matches, Chelsea need to do what they do best – win, with minimum fuss. On form they’re the best team in the country by some distance, so they need to remove the histrionics and resume being plastered over the papers for the right reasons. Diego Costa has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability .","Chelsea have reverted to defensive type in recent weeks .

"There was something unwholesome about the way Cesc Fabregas’ romance with Barcelona ended. Perhaps breaking such a bond required a greater explanation, hence the story on the club’s website last summer that was really quite damning and unique in its detail. The post read: ‘Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc’s contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close. ‘From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season. He only scored one, six and one goals in the last 24 games of each season. Cesc Fabregas (left) has a history of going quiet during the second half of the season in terms of goals . ‘For some reason, he was never as good in the second half of a season as in the first.’ To apply some context, such statements usually run to a confirmation that a player has left. If a club is feeling particularly venomous, it might omit the part where a player is thanked for his contribution. Maybe the close relationship with Fabregas, the prodigal son who returned and then left for again, meant they felt compelled to explain the step of letting him join Chelsea for £30million. The talented playmaker had a blistering start to the season and has racked up 15 assists despite his slump . But whatever the motive, there was a deep and intriguing point in the message. Barcelona had spotted a real trend and the rational among Chelsea’s fans are probably starting to see it. That’s not to overreact and criticise a player who has arguably had the greatest impact on Chelsea’s title push. Fabregas has been magnificent, a deep-lying playmaker (usually) who has the engine to roam, the sense to dictate tempo and the guile to create. First half v Second half of the season . 09-10: 19 v 9 . 10-11: 9 v 5 . 11-12: 13 v 4 . 13-14: 16 v 5 . 14-15: 15 v 2 . His number of assists is astonishing – 15 in the Premier League, which is seven more than his next domestic rival. Alongside Nemanja Matic, Chelsea have a legitimately world-class midfield platform. But on Wednesday night Fabregas looked flat. A subjective view, certainly, but the numbers are showing the return of a curious pattern. He has neither scored nor assisted in his past nine games in all competitions, seven of which were starts. His last assist was against Swansea on January 17. His previous longest run without a goal or assist this season was two. The former Barcelona man suffered the fate at Barcelona during his time there before he was sold to Chelsea . That is not to say he is playing badly in this spell. Far from it. He was poor when he came on against Bradford in the FA Cup and was off the pace in the league game against Burnley, but generally has been among Chelsea’s best performers. And yet the incision is not what it was. Looking at league figures alone, he managed 15 goals or assists in the first half of the season and has so far scored or created only two in the second half. It is a trend that goes back all the way to the 2009-10 season, Fabregas’s penultimate campaign at Arsenal, when his respective figures were 19 and nine. In 2010-11 they were nine and five and in 2011-12, his first back at Barcelona, he scored or created 13 in the first half of the season and four on the stretch. Fabregas clashes with Blaise Matuidi during a night of frustration in the Champions League in London . Last season, it was even more pronounced – 16 going out and five coming back in. It is a mystery, not least because it would be unfair to conclude he is in poor form. But he is less incisive, regardless of whether it is for individual or team reasons. Certainly, his role within the side has tended to change at times recently, with Jose Mourinho occasionally switching between 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3. And there has also been a more restrained manner in how the team is playing, perhaps because there is a greater emphasis on protecting what they have in the league rather chasing a bigger advantage. In any case, the numbers make interesting reading for the player. He certainly won’t thank Barcelona for flagging it up. The Spanish international is setting a trend and began to show signs of flagging during his time at Arsenal .","Cesc Fabregas has previously seen his form slump during the season .

"Eight-time grand slam champion Andre Agassi believes American men's tennis has to 'regroup at grass roots level' if it ever wants to boast a world number one again. The United States take on Great Britain in the Davis Cup in Glasgow this weekend, hoping to avenge last year's 3-1 defeat in San Diego. World number five Andy Murray will lead the charge for Britain and goes into the first-round World Group tie as the stand-out singles player, with America's John Isner and Donald Young ranked only 20th and 47th respectively. USA legend Andre Agassi (pictured in 2009) says America must 'regroup' its grass roots tennis set-up . World number five Andy Murray will lead the line for Great Britain at the Davis Cup this coming weekend . USA's Donald Young stretches to return a shot to Ivo Karlovic during the Delray Beach Open on February 22 . John Isner of the United States plays a backhand during his third-round match at the Australian Open 2015 . It is a far cry from the days of Agassi, who lifted the Davis Cup in 1990, 1992 and 1995 alongside the likes of seven-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras and four-time major winner Jim Courier. The last time America produced a male grand slam winner was 2003, when Agassi won the Australian Open and Andy Roddick triumphed in Flushing Meadows. 'Being the next Andy Roddick or the next Andre Agassi will still leave you shy of winning tournaments these days. That's the truth,' Agassi told Press Association Sport. 'Will we ever have a number one player again? That's achievable, of course it is, but the four guys at the top now - Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray - they have redefined what this sport is all about over the last 10 years.

Spain's Rafael Nadal returns a ball against Argentine Juan Monaco during the final of the ATP Buenos Aires . 'I don't know where Andy spent his childhood playing (he spent time in Spain as a teenager) but he plays the game like he wasn't just playing indoors. 'We don't have that in America. We have a lot of fast court players and the ones who do shine are the ones who bring a different equation. 'Isner, for example, is a monster, he's 6ft 10 plus with a huge game, so we have to regroup at a grass roots level.' Despite a shock defeat to 18-year-old Borna Coric in Dubai last week, Murray will be expected to win both his singles matches in Glasgow. That means the tie could depend on the doubles rubber, where Andy and Jamie Murray are set to face American twins Bob and Mike Bryan, the most successful duo of all time. American duo Bob (left) and Mike Bryan are set to come up against Great Britain's Jamie and Andy Murray . 'It's a tough ask for both teams because there's very little that separates it,' Agassi said. 'We have a big advantage in our doubles but you guys have a huge advantage with Murray. 'People think he's coming off a bad loss but I've got news for you; he's going to be ready to go in a week and he's going to be playing his best tennis in front of a home crowd. 'I hope we can get over the finishing line and I'll have my fingers crossed like the rest of us.' Agassi has previously admitted an interest in a coaching career and is even considered a potential mentor for Murray, who idolised the American as a junior. 'I enjoy the idea of coaching but I wouldn't physically, emotionally and mentally be able to do the job that I would want to do,' Agassi said. 'You can't just step in and give advice. Coaching isn't talking, it's learning. 'The things I say about Andy are not going to be a surprise to him. 'It's finding out what that switch is, it's getting them to see something a different way and you can't do that until you spend time and learn with them. 'I can't commit the time now, even if I wanted to, I have too many responsibilities. 'That doesn't mean there wouldn't be a time in the future, but I can't do it at the moment.'

"For many dads out there, they dream of their son making it as a professional footballer. But while this has its undoubted challenges, getting your child to support the same football team is surely a must. In this hilarious video, a young father perches his son on his knee, and begins a chant in honour of his favourite team - Nottingham Forest. After a reluctant start, 10-month-old Joshua soon throws himself into his father's Nottingham Forest chant . The toddler is well trained it seems, and almost as if he is on the terraces himself, he joins in with the actions football fans everywhere will recognise. The father shouts out 'Forest,' in reference to the Nottinghamshire club who play their football in Sky Bet Championship. At this point 10-month old Joshua raises his hands in the air. 'Come on you boys in red,' continues the father, which is met by the blonde-haired child clapping his hands together. The actions are met with a wide smile and attempts at copying his father's chants. With a cheeky smile, Joshua shows he is well on the way to following the Championship club . The man seated then shouts 'Nottingham's red and white' on two occasions, but the toddler's exertions appear to have tired him out, and he holds his hands behind his head.

"Calum Chambers had no qualms about dropping down to the England Under 21s squad, saying it is an honour to represent his country whatever the level. Having impressed with Southampton last season, the 20-year-old made a big-money move to Arsenal in the summer and quickly earned a first call-up from Roy Hodgson. It saw Chambers' jump from the Under 19s without make a single appearance for the Under-21s - a level he now finds himself at after winning three caps for the senior team. Calum Chambers in action during the international match between U21 Czech Republic and U21 England . The defender made his Young Lions debut as Gareth Southgate's side won 1-0 win in the Czech Republic on Friday and insists, unlike some players, he has no problem with dropping down from the senior squad. 'As I've always said, it's an honour to play for your country, no matter what the age group,' Chambers said . 'When I was asked to play for the U21s, of course I was going to come and play. 'I was really looking forward to this trip and I've enjoyed every minute of it so far. Chambers and Kieron Gibbs take part in a training session at St George's Park  ahead of Euro 2016 qualifying . 'There is a smooth pathway between the U21s and the seniors now and there was an opportunity for me to play for the U21s so I jumped at it because I love to play for my country. 'Players should want to play for their country at any level and I've played for the senior team a few times, but that would never make me want to stop playing for the U21s.

"A rugby player sidelined for his abnormally large feet can play again - thanks to a specially delivered pair of size 21 orange boots from Welsh rugby captain Sam Warburton. Carl Griffiths, 22, was forced to sit on the bench for his club side after wearing out his last pair and he could not find replacement footwear. But now, the 6ft 8in forward can return to the fold after being fitted with a pair of custom-made, orange Adidas boots. Carl Griffiths proudly holds up his size 21 Adidas boots, presented to him by Wales captain Sam Warburton . The 6ft 8in forward had been unable to play for almost half a year, but is now able to play again . Mr Griffiths gleefully laces up his new orange boots at the home of his local club, Trimsaran RFC . Mr Griffiths, who lives in Carmarthenshire, West Wales, had been playing in size 18 boots for the past three years with his toes curled up in the ends. But after keeping them together with black sticky tape, they eventually fell apart. With his height, his club Trimsaran RFC miss him on the pitch, particularly in the line-outs. Desperate to play, Mr Griffiths contacted every major sports company he could think of asking if they had 21 size boots - 11 sizes bigger than the average man - but had no joy. But finally, after almost half a year stuck on the sidelines, they can welcome him back to the side thanks to the hand-delivered parcel from Warburton, who holds the record for the most Wales caps as captain. Mr Griffiths was cheering his team on from the touchline when the Welsh no 7 arrived with the parcel. He then laced them up before running out for his first game in months. He said: 'It is amazing to be able to play the game I love again - and be able to wiggle my toes in my boots! 'I can't thank Sam and the guys at Adidas enough for making these boots especially for me. 'I had no idea they were planning this and I had almost given up hope of ever finding boots that would fit me again.' Mr Griffiths towers over Warburton, the Welsh rugby captain, in his new Adidas orange size 21 boots . The 6ft 8in forward was delighted to meet Warburton, who presented him with the boots at Trimsaran RFC . Warburton said: 'As soon as the team at Adidas told me about this story I bit their hand off to be involved. 'I’ve had my fair share of injuries and breaks from the game over the years and I know it’s one of the worst feelings you can have. 'It’s great to have been involved in getting Carl back on the rugby field and you can tell it means a lot to him and his team mates. 'I’m sure they’ll be reminding him that he has some big boots to fill now though.' He had been playing in size 18 boots with his toes curled up, but eventually his feet came through the boots . The 22-year-old has size 21 feet - 11 sizes bigger than the average man, but can now play rugby again . It is believed Mr Griffiths' enormous feet are the result of drugs he was given to combat childhood leukaemia. He was eight years old when doctors discovered he was suffering from the disease, and after a course of chemotherapy he was treated with steroids to help him regain his strength. His feet sprouted within a year of stopping steroid treatment at 13 after he was given the all-clear, which is unusual because steroids usually restrict growth.","Carl Griffiths, 22, was unable to find a pair of boots for his size 21 feet .

The 21-year-old striker has scored 19 Premier League goals for Tottenham so far this season . Chris Smalling also admitted that Kane is on his shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year vote . Delph and Smalling also said they hoped Roy Hodgson, whose long-term future has been the subject of much speculation, would continue as England boss after Euro 2016. 'Of course,' Delph said. 'He's been great for me, he's brought me into the squad and he's got a good relationship with the boys.' Smalling added: 'Ever since I've worked with Roy he's been one that's shown a lot of faith in all the players, especially the young players. We've all enjoyed our training with him.' The win over Lithuania continued England's 100 per cent start to the qualifying campaign and Smalling said the goal was to win every match in Group E. 'That would be the ultimate goal and the manager has stressed that in our meetings,' he said. 'He sets very high standards and we need to make sure we stick by them, but so far so good.' Delph and Smalling also said they hoped Roy Hodgson would continue as England boss after Euro 2016 . Smalling's club contract expires at the end of next season and the 25-year-old has been linked with a summer move away from Old Trafford. Asked about the speculation over his future, he said: 'That's one I've not even really discussed with anyone. It's a case of the manager's showing his faith in me, I'm playing, I'm happy. 'I'm enjoying it, I've always enjoyed playing for United, especially at the minute. If I can contribute as we are now then I'm happy to stay for as long as they want me.' Asked if there were any contract negotiations under way, Smalling added: 'Not that I'm aware of, I don't really take care of that.'

"Robin McBryde has predicted 'an arm-wrestle for 80 minutes' when RBS 6 Nations heavyweights Wales and Ireland slug it out at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. Wales assistant coach McBryde has stressed the winner-takes-all nature of a game that sees both teams featuring prominently at the tournament's business end.

Warburton (centre) leads the warm-up as Gatland's side complete their final preparations in Cardiff . 'It's going to be an arm-wrestle for 80 minutes, and that is what we've prepared for,' McBryde said. 'Everything that goes on off the field pales into insignificance, and it's all about what happens on the day. 'They play a big pressure game, and if we can react positively to that and stay in the fight, that will give us a good chance of winning. 'There is a lot of stake. Ireland are on course for a Grand Slam, and just to get away from Cardiff with a win, that's all they will be looking to do. With regards to playing any attractive rugby, that will come second. 'That's the nature of the game at the moment, and that's how teams are wearing each other down, and unfortunately, the spectators have got to pay a price for that.' Warburton is in high spirits during the captain's run as his side prepare for visit of Joe Schmidt's side . Ireland have conceded just one try in three Six Nations games this season and an average of only nine points per time across eight Six Nations matches Joe Schmidt has overseen during his coaching reign. Ireland are also on a 10-Test unbeaten run - England were the last team to defeat them 13 months ago - and McBryde added: 'They are on a a bit of a roll at the moment. Ten wins on the bounce speaks volumes. 'This is quite a formidable Ireland team, and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them tomorrow. Warburton and Co will be looking to avenge their 26-3 loss to Ireland in Dublin last season . 'You have got arguably two of the better teams in the Six Nations, not being disrespectful to anybody else. On our day, I think both teams are capable of beating anybody. 'With regards to motivation, we look at our own situation, and we know a win would give us an opportunity to go for the championship. 'It is a double-edged sword that one. By doing that, we beat Ireland and stop them getting a Grand Slam, but it's all about what we can achieve and gain, as opposed to anything else.'","Wales welcome unbeaten Ireland to the Millenium Stadium on Saturday .

"The shocking decline of young English players in the Premier League is revealed by new research published by The Mail on Sunday which shows that the academies of the Premier League’s current 20 clubs have produced just 57 first-team regulars over the past 10 years. In the week in which FA chairman Greg Dyke attempted to persuade Premier League clubs to increase the quota of home-grown players in their squad from eight to twelve, the new figures show that the nation’s elite clubs are producing fewer than three players per club on average over a decade with the league’s biggest clubs having some of the worst records. Chelsea have produced no home-grown first-team regulars since John Terry emerged at the start of the millennium. Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City have had less than a handful each. Regular is defined as playing half or more of league games in a season. Scroll down to see a graphic showing how many home-grown first-team regulars your favourite club has had over the past decade . Premier League leaders Chelsea have produced no home-grown first-team regulars since John Terry emerged at the start of the millennium . The issue is becoming a major battleground between FA chairman Greg Dyke, who wants to introduce measures to increase opportunities for home-grown talent, and the Premier League clubs, who don’t want quotas forced upon them. The new research on home-grown regulars produced in the past decade shows that only Southampton and Aston Villa, with seven such players each, and Newcastle, with five, had produced five or more since the start of the 2005-06 season. The Southampton players who meet the criteria are Theo Walcott, Gareth Bale, Adam Lallana, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Ward-Prowse, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw. Theo Walcott is one of an abundance of players that have made a name for themselves after coming through the ranks at Southampton . Gareth Bale came through the ranks at Southampton before becoming a star at Tottenham Hotspur and La Liga giants Real Madrid . West Ham United duo Mark Noble and Jack Collison came through the ranks at Upton Park, as did defender James Tomkins . Five of them have been capped by England, and Bale, the world’s most expensive footballer, by Wales, while James Ward-Prowse, 20 in November, has 28 England appearances below senior level. But given that Premier League clubs have spent around £600 million combined on their academies in the last decade alone, or about £3m per club per year on average, the number of players most have produced for their first teams is pitiful. The new research considers how many players the current 20 Premier League clubs have nurtured between the ages of 15-18 who have then gone on to be ‘regulars’ for that team. Southampton’s academy has produced more players in the decade than the seven mentioned but not who have yet become regulars as defined. On the same basis, Chelsea’s tally is zero, Manchester United’s is just two, in Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley. Liverpool and Arsenal have produced just three each, respectively Justin Hoyte, Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs, and Stephen Warnock, Raheem Sterling and Jon Flanagan. Jon Flanagan and Raheem Sterling did the business in the youth squads before becoming regulars in Liverpool's first team . Jack Wilshere is one of three youngsters to excel since coming through the Arsenal ranks along with Kieran Gibbs and Justin Hoyte . Michah Richards and Michael Johnson impressed in the youth set-up before moving through to the Manchester City first team . Manchester City’s four such players were Stephen Ireland, Michael Johnson, Micah Richards and Nedum Onuoha. All the relevant ‘products’ of the 20 clubs over the decade are in the accompanying panel. Dyke has started negotiations with the Premier League clubs to seek a minimum of 12 home-grown players per first-team squad of 25 by 2020, phased in from 2016 onwards. He wants the definition of ‘home-grown’ to be players registered with a club for three years before the age of 18. Dyke’s aim is to expand the talent pool of English players with good amounts of high-level competitive exposure. Chelsea in many ways exemplify the core problem: they have more age-group England players below the senior team than anyone, and some truly outstanding youngsters. But those players for now are struggling to become first-team players let alone regulars at Stamford Bridge. Managers like Jose Mourinho are charged with winning by their employers, not helping England. And many fans would probably agree that is something they support. Dyke created the an FA England Commission in 2013 to explore the reasons for the low number of English players in the Premier League and suggest solutions to address the issue - with the stated aim of helping to improve the England team. The number of English players in the Premier League has fallen as low as 32 per cent in recent years. Dyke wants that boosted to 45 per cent by 2022. A Commission report last year highlighted how there is a particular ‘bottleneck’ for English players aged 18 to 21, limiting first-team opportunities at Premier League clubs. Many clubs prefer to use tried and tested - and often foreign - players instead of their own home-growns. The alarming extent to which that is true is highlighted here. Minutes played by English players aged under 21 in the Premier League have fallen by more than half in 10 years, and Englishmen in the Champions League are a relatively rarity despite England have joint-most teams competing each season. Greg Dyke has started negotiations with Premier League clubs to seek a minimum of 12 home-grown players per first-team squad . Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has excelled in north London since bursting on to the scene and even earned an England call-up . Former England manager Glenn Hoddle, a member of Dyke’s commission, believes that clubs should back his proposals, citing Harry Kane as an example. ‘You sense there is reluctance over Greg Dyke’s suggestion we increase the number of homegrown players,’ he said. ‘We will never know if our players are good enough unless they get the chance. Talent isn’t always as obvious as Raheem Sterling or Wayne Rooney. ‘Sometimes, as with Harry Kane, it takes time to develop and that only comes with games. ‘A year ago some at Tottenham would have questioned whether he was Champions League quality. They don’t now, but only because he was lucky to have managers willing to play him.’","Premier League’s current 20 clubs have produced just 57 first-team regulars over the past 10 years .
Chelsea have produced no home-grown first-team regulars since John Terry emerged at the start of the millennium .

"Jordan Henderson has given the biggest indication yet that he will stay at Liverpool even though his contract runs out in 2016. The England midfielder, tipped to succeed Steven Gerrard as Liverpool captain, has been a revelation for club and country in the past 18 months and will face Italy on Tuesday as the mainstay of Roy Hodgson’s England midfield. But Henderson insists that the ongoing talks with the club over a renewal to his contract will not distract him and has made it clear that he wants to sign a new deal to stay at Anfield. Jordan Henderson (right) has said his contract talks with Liverpool will be sorted . Henderson appears set to replace Steven Gerrard (right) as Liverpool captain next season . Henderson is also in line to play for England against Italy in a friendly in Turin on Tuesday . ‘Everybody else will make a big deal about it, but for me, I just let my agent and the club deal with it and whenever it gets sorted, it gets sorted,’ said Henderson. ‘All I want to do is do my best for club or country. I don't want to get involved, really. Let the agents and the club deal with it, and we just focus on our football and I think that's the best way.’ Asked whether he was in the right place to win trophies and move forward with his career, Henderson said: ‘I definitely think so. I think obviously at Liverpool we've got fantastic players, real quality players and a lot of potential. 'We're a young team and I think there is great potential and a big part of that is us wanting to be winners and winning trophies. I really feel we can do that. It is the same with England, I really feel we are going in the right direction and hopefully in the next Euros we can do something special.’ And Henderson insists he is not banking on replacing Gerrard as captain next season. ‘That's up to the manager in the summer,’ he said. ‘I'm not going to be captain as of yet. It could be anybody else in the team because we've got a lot of leaders and a lot of good characters in the team.

Henderson (left) insists he will step up once Gerrard departs the club for Los Angeles Galaxy . ‘Of course it'd be an honour for me to do that, but when a big player like Stevie leaves, obviously it's disappointing, but everybody else has got to step up. 'We've got a lot of young players in the team and next season, when he isn't there, it's time for everybody to show what they're capable of and show that little bit of extra responsibility. 'And I wouldn't put that down to whoever is the next captain or one person in his position because for me there will never be another Steven Gerrard.’","Jordan Henderson has made it clear he wants to stay at Liverpool .

"Mateo Kovacic will not be joining Liverpool from Inter Milan. Liverpool scouts have watched Inter Milan this season and the Croatia international has been linked with a move to Anfield. However, Kovacic’s representative, Nikky Vuksan, insists the midfielder will remain at San Siro. Mateo Kovacic has been strongly linked with a transfer from Inter Milan to Liverpool . But Kovacic's representative insists that the Croatia midfielder will not be leaving Inter Milan . Kovacic has caught the attention of Arsenal and Everton as well as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . 'It is not going to happen. Mateo extended his contract with Inter in January. Could it be that clubs are negotiating? No, that is not possible without Mateo and me knowing about it. 'Also, I have a player at Liverpool, Dejan Lovren so I would know about it. Both the English and Italian media speculate and find new clubs that want Kovacic every week. He’ll stay at Inter.' Talking to Croatia newspaper Vecernji list, he added: 'Also, if there was something going on, believe me journalists would be the last to find out.' Kovacic, who has been watched by Arsenal and Everton in recent months also, has scored eight goals in 34 appearances in all competitions for Inter this season but is out with a knee ligament injury.","Mateo Kovacic has been strongly linked with a move to Liverpool .

"Life in the fast lane: B2C's Nick Sayer on a £17,000 Harley-Davidson . The data Del Boy . Posing on a £17,000 Harley-Davidson, Nick Sayer soaks up the winter sun outside his holiday home in Florida. It is one of several shots of motorbikes, supercars and lavish holidays he has posted online in recent years…to the delight of his friends. For while pensioners are targeted every day by cold callers, the man who sold their personal data is apparently relishing the spoils. B2C director Sayer – who is nicknamed Del Boy – is among a group of bosses at the firm who have got rich quick by selling people’s most personal information. The 45-year-old father-of-two says he carries out his business from a ‘man cave’ in the garden of his home in Kent. He began his working life as a diver on oil rigs in Azerbaijan, before, he claims, he was set up in business by a Greek shipping billionaire. They ran a commercial diving company before he decided to make money for himself by selling personal data with a series of companies, most of which have been dissolved or liquidated. ‘For years I was called “oh, you’re just a Del Boy”,’ he said. ‘I work from home, I’ve got a little log cabin thing out in me garden, that’s where I kind of base me-self. ‘I don’t like being in the house, I just go out there. It’s a bit of a man cave really.’ While his garden office may be modest, Sayer’s other tastes are much more ostentatious. His Facebook page shows off images of nine sports cars as well as pictures of him skiing in Banff, Canada. Scroll down for video . The British-built TVR Tuscan Speed Six sports car which he pictures on a drive on his profile costs up to £50,000 and boasts a top speed of 180mph. The Harley-Davidson Road King motorbike he is seen on in one image costs £17,595 new. Sayer regularly holidays with his family at his villa in Kissimmee, Florida, which they rent out for £600 a week. The home has a games room, swimming pool and spa, five bedrooms and four bathrooms, all ‘fitted with luxury furnishings’.

Luxury: Sayer's Flordia home has a games room, swimming pool and spa, five bedrooms and four bathrooms . The fake cash fraudster . Also trading in people’s personal information for B2C is convicted fraudster Gary Doran, 36, who wanted the Mail’s undercover team to pay Sayer off the books. The Mancunian, who now lives in Marbella, was jailed for six months for fraud in 2004 for trying to use two fake £10 notes to buy vodka. A 23-year-old student at Manchester Metropolitan University at the time, he tried to buy drink with the fake money at the Queen of Hearts pub in Fallowfield. The barmaid rejected the notes and the police were called, later finding him with 15 other fake bank notes. After serving time in jail, he has since run several failing businesses with his father and brother from their family home in Manchester. Most recently, as sales director of B2C Data, he asked an undercover reporter from the Mail to buy data off the books as a ‘favour to a friend’. He wanted the money to be paid directly into Sayer’s personal account, as a way of avoiding tax. Sporting life: The 180mph British-built TVR Tuscan Speed Six sports car on the Sayer's Facebook page . Jet-setting boss who said he knew nothing . B2C owner Stephen Hogg insists his firm ‘do everything completely, totally and utterly by the book’. The jet-setting golfer was, however, completely oblivious to his staff offering to sell data tax free through their own accounts. He even had no idea Doran had previously served time for fraud. The 46-year-old lives with his wife Sarah, 43, and their children in a £400,000 five-bedroom house in Rushden, Northamptonshire. Last week, there were three cars on the driveway outside the large home in a secluded cul-de-sac. Hogg appears to have spent much of the past month playing golf at clubs across Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. He and his wife also go online to boast of their holidays to Portugal and Australia. ‘Holidays, bar, golf and no diet!, he wrote during one of his travels. The couple, who have two children, started B2C Data just three months after his previous data company Unique Prospects was dissolved. He said he has also shut another firm down in the past after ‘certain allegations’, before insisting ‘that wasn’t my company by the way’. When approached by the Mail about B2C’s activities, Hogg said: ‘We are a member of the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office], and DMA [Direct Marketing Association]. We do everything correctly.’ When told his employees had offered to sell his company’s data off the books and that Doran is a convicted fraudster, he added: ‘You’ve just made me aware of two things that I need to go and talk to people about.’ He described B2C Data as ‘a legitimate business’ working within the law. Cold callers use a wide range of tricks to obtain people's personal data (picture posed by model) Will writing: Pensioners are often targeted by callers who offer will writing advice on the cheap. This is often a ploy to gain your trust and access as many personal details – including about your finances – as possible. The firms then try to sell high risk investments as ‘add-ons’. Charity surveys: A homeowner is called and asked to complete a survey for charity. They are told if they answer a certain number of questions, a pre-selected charity will be paid £10 or so – so many kind-hearted people naturally agree. However, all the answers are collated and sold on. ‘Validating’ your details: Marketing firms will call customers of a major brand and claim they need to ‘validate’ the details they hold. After asking the customer to confirm their name, address and phone number, however, many will go on to try to get you to complete a ‘lifestyle survey’. These questions are, in fact, sponsored by various other companies and details are sold on. Soft questions: Watch out for surveys starting with ‘easy’ questions. One firm admitted it starts surveys with questions anyone would answer – like do you have a television? Only later do the questions become more intrusive – about your earnings and the worth of your home. Computer updates: Scammers try to hack into PCs by pretending to be from Microsoft. Following their ‘updating’ instructions can allow them to take control of the computer remotely and capture personal data. No call lists: The telephone preference list, which should block cold callers, is a free service. Some firms will, however, try to charge you as much as £1.60 a month. Shares: With your financial details on file, some cold calling firms are able to see which companies you have shares in. As a result, scammers can pretend to be calling from the companies you have invested in and try to convince the homeowner to pass on more financial details. Prizes: Once they have your details, scammers are able to send you misleading letters saying you have won large cash prizes. There are often hidden costs in claiming this supposed prize, like making you call premium rate phone numbers.","Nick Sayer got rich quick selling people's most personal information .

"At the beginning of February 2012, a spate of injuries forced the New York Knicks to promote a little-known basketball player called Jeremy Lin to their starting roster. Lin had looked as though he was destined for a career as a journeyman. He was struggling to make it to the big time. NBA teams had turned their backs on him until the Knicks were forced to give him a chance. Lin, who was struggling financially and sleeping on a friend’s couch, played well in his first match. And his second. And his third. He outscored his more illustrious team-mates. The struggling Knicks embarked on a winning streak. Harry Kane's meteoric rise continued on Friday when he marked his first England game with a goal . Kane headed in England's fourth against Lithuania shortly after replacing Wayne Rooney . Kane's progress is reminiscient of Jeremy Lin's form when he was playing basketball for the New York Knicks . Lin propelled the Knicks to a winning streak but failed to recapture his form after sustaining an injury . By the end of the first week, celebrities were flocking to courtside at Madison Square Garden to catch the buzz. Lin became a phenomenon and the mania that developed around him was given a name: Linsanity. It seemed then that Lin could never again return to ordinariness. But in mid-March, the coach who had given him his chance was fired and Lin sustained a knee injury that ended his season. He was traded to another team in the summer. They offloaded him to the struggling Los Angeles Lakers, where he has also failed to make an impact. He is known now only for his failure to sustain Linsanity. ‘I feel like I’m back to square one,’ he said last week. You get the point? Well, you would have done if you had been at Wembley on Friday night, heard the deafening, rumbling cheer that rolled around the stadium when Harry Kane ran on to make his England debut and witnessed the scenes when, 79 seconds later, he scored with a far-post header. This is English football’s Linsanity. In the middle of what is, in many ways, a fairly unremarkable domestic football season, we have become caught up in our very own intoxicating, uplifting kind of madness. ‘It’s nice when fairytales come true,’ said the England manager Roy Hodgson afterwards, beaming into the camera. Kane beamed, too. ‘It’s the start that I dreamed of,’ he said. The Lithuania manager, Igoris Pankratjevas, described the Spurs forward as a ‘sniper’. Even Wayne Rooney, whose limelight had been stolen by the 21-year-old, seemed a little breathless. ‘It’s incredible really,’ Rooney said of Kane’s impact. ‘You can feel the excitement all around the country.’ And so a kid who looked like he might be heading for a career in the lower divisions is suddenly taking our league, and now our national team, by storm. What is unfolding in front of us seems so wonderfully unlikely that it has reached the point where it is scarcely credible. Late on Friday night, the BBC displayed a map of the world showing where social media reaction to Kane’s goal had been at its height. The yellow dots showing maximum interaction were spread from England to Indonesia to Mexico to Japan and Brazil. Wayne Rooney (right) praised Kane's impact with Tottenham and now at international level . Kane wheels away to celebrate scoring for England against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday . Kane was sent on loan to a number of football league sides before breaking through to the Tottenham side . This is a kid who was shunted around the lower leagues to Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester while Spurs tried to work out what to do with him and whether he was good enough to make the grade with them. This is a kid, an English kid, a local north London kid, whose meteoric rise has coincided with immigration leaping to the top of the political agenda and concerns about the proliferation of foreign players and owners in our leagues. When Spurs fans sing that Kane is ‘one of our own’, their boast represents not just a celebration of his talent but a lament for a time when they could identify more closely with the players they were watching. In an age where teams are being taken away from the fans, Kane represents a reconnection. The mania that has grown around him is a warning that there are those who harbour misgivings about the cosmopolitan make-up of the Premier League. Riding along on Kane’s coat-tails, FA chairman Greg Dyke has quickly and adroitly tapped into those fears and prejudices and seized the moment to propose that every Premier League club should have 12 home-grown players in its 25-man squad. Kane is at the centre of all this but as he walked triumphantly from the pitch on Friday night, the next question is how long can he maintain this trajectory? Is this his natural orbit, is he here to stay or is this, like Linsanity, some brief enchantment? The media, of course, is already being accused of building a kid up just so it can knock him down but Kane is fortunate that in his club boss, Mauricio Pochettino, and Hodgson, he has two managers who will shepherd him wisely. ‘We’re not going to hold him back,’ said Hodgson. ‘There’s no question of that. But on the other hand, I am rather hoping I have got Harry Kane for a long period to come and I don’t want to be the one who throws him in and he flies too close to the sun.’ Did the England manager give any thought to the idea that Kane might fall back into the shadows? ‘I suppose when someone has shone quite so brilliantly, that is always in the back of your mind,’ Hodgson said. ‘But I have got to say that from what I have seen of him, from what I know of the apprenticeship he has already served, when I look at the qualities he possesses as a football player, I have got no fears in that respect. I don’t believe it will happen. Roy Hodgson believes that Kane will be able to maintain his astonishing standard of form . Kane is in line to feature for England in a friendly against Italy in Turin on Tuesday . England manager Hodgson is pleased with how Kane is being handled at Tottenham by Mauricio Pochettino . ‘I still think it is prudent for Mauricio Pochettino and myself, as the England manager, not to stand here in front of you singing his praises. You are singing his praises enough, so just allow me to dampen them down a little bit.’ It probably won’t do much good. The Kane Train is setting off for Turin on Tuesday, full steam ahead. Whether this is all Linsanity or whether, as we all hope, it is something more substantial and lasting, we will soon find out.","Harry Kane scored on his England debut after 79 seconds on Friday .

"What party poopers. Wrexham were all set to celebrate their 150th birthday and had their eye on a rather nice present - the FA Trophy. Coasting at 2-0 with just a quarter-hour remaining here at Wembley, Wrexham had their celebrations well underway. Then, North Ferriby United decided to roll up, gatecrash and ruin everything. Goals from Louis Moult and Jay Harris had the Welsh side in complete control but North Ferriby, who play a division below, forced extra time through Liam King’s penalty and Ryan Kendall’s late leveller. Players of North Ferriby United celebrate after winning the The FA Carlsberg Trophy on penalties . Then, incredibly, they took the lead as Kendall pounced again, only for Moult to send this magnificent advertisement for the non-league game to penalties. The first five spot-kicks were all scored, the next four saved and the four after that all scored. And so it was Wrexham’s Steve Tomassen, under the pressure of sudden death, who had to be the fall-guy. His penalty was kept out by Adam Nicklin and so North Ferriby were the ones who ascended the 107 steps to lift the handsome silver trophy. Captain of North Ferriby United Liam King lifts the trophy during the The FA Carlsberg Trophy Final . Adam Nicklin (centre) celebrates with King (R) and teammate Nathan Jarman after saving a penalty to win . It was, it’s fair to say, the finest moment in their 81-year existence, a moment nobody associated with the Humberside club will ever forget. For Wrexham, the national stadium has become something of a second home. This was their third visit in as many years - in 2013, they beat Grimsby Town in the FA Trophy final before returning later in the same campaign for the Conference Play-offs final, losing to Newport County. North Ferriby is a village on the north bank of the Humber, not too far from Hull. It has a population of under 4,000 and most of them seemed to have decamped to Wembley for the day. The place itself must have been eerily empty. Players of both team prepare for extra time which ended up finishing 3-3 after the 30 minutes . Among those watching on was Hull City chairman Assem Allam, while Tigers manager Steve Bruce had fixed it with his pal Sam Allardyce for Ferriby to use West Ham’s training facilities on the eve of the game. The Villagers, ninth in their league, had played under the Twin Towers but not under the Arch. It was 1997 when they last came to Wembley, losing to Whitby Town in the FA Vase final. The Welsh side were backed by some 10,000 supporters and, as expected, they made the early running. It took just 11 minutes to make the breakthrough as Moult continued his marvellous run of goals in this season’s Trophy. Louis Moult of Wrexham scores the first goal of the game as they took control early on in the final . Moult (centre) celebrates with Clarke after putting his side into the lead early on in the game . He scored at Stockport County in the second round, two more in the replay, and in both legs of the semi-final with Torquay United. In all, he has 16 goals this season and this was the most significant. Joe Clarke advanced down the left and exchanged passed with Connor Jennings before crossing low for Moult to finish from about eight yards. It was an accomplished finish, though the Ferriby defence allowed him ample time and space. Ferriby’s best opening of the half came when a neat ball over the top sprung Danny Clarke who did well to hold off two defenders before forcing goalkeeper Andy Coughlin into a block at his near post. Kay Harris scores to make it 2-0 during the FA Carlsberg Trophy Final but it wasn't enough for Wrexham . Early in the second-half, there was encouragement for Ferriby when Jason St Juste, an international for Saint Kitts and Nevis, shrugged off Steve Tomassen and was only denied when Coughlin dived at his feet. A minute later and Jennings should have found the net. Set clear by a brilliant through ball, he rounded goalkeeper Andy Nicklin only for Danny Hone to clear his shot off the line. On the hour, Wrexham did claim their second. Harris, part of the team that won here two years ago, was played into acres of space on the right by Jennings, raced clear and calmly slotted the ball past Nicklin. King of North Ferriby United scores a penalty to make it 2-1 during The FA Carlsberg Trophy Final . Wrexham: Coughlin; Tomassen, Smith, Hudson, Ashton; Jennings, Harris, Keates (c) (Evans 72), Clarke (Bishop 102), Morris (York 87); Moult . Substitutes not used: Carrington, Waterfall . Scorers: Moult 11, 117; Harris 60 . Booked: Coughlin . North Ferriby United: Nicklin; Topliss, Hone, Wilson, Wilde (Peat 88); Bolder (Jarman 61), Fry (Kendall 79); King; Clarke, Denton, St Juste . Substitutes not used: Nicholson (GK); Gray . Scorers: King (penalty) 75; Kendall 86, 100 . Booked: Jarman . Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) Attendance: 14,585 . Man of the match: Jason St Juste . The goal showed how Ferriby had been stretched and Jennings nearly capitalised on a carbon copy opening minutes later, only to drag his shot wide. Wrexham seemed to be cruising but things were back in the balance when Danny Clarke broke through the heart of the defence and was fouled as he tried to get round Coughlin. Ferriby captain King assumed responsibility and hammered the spot-kick home to reinvigorate the match. After that it was all Ferriby and, with four minutes left, they drew level. St Juste did well to retrieve the ball wide on the left and, cutting in from the byline, he delivered a low cross on a plate for substitute Kendall to turn home. ‘You’re not singing anymore,’ sang those from Humberside. Kendall is the equivalent of Wrexham’s Moult. This was his sixth in the Trophy this season after earlier strikes against Mickleover Sports, Boston United (twice), Hyde and Farnborough.

Matt Wilson (North Ferriby) SCORED 4-3 . Blaine Hudson (Wrexham) SCORED 4-4 . Nathan Peat (North Ferriby) SCORED 5-4 . Steve Tomassen SAVED 5-4 . All of a sudden, Wrexham were clinging on and Clarke forced Coughlin into a fine save with a dipping shot from outside the box in stoppage time. St Juste marauded again down the left, crossed and Kendall tried to flick it in, only to be denied by Blaine Hudson’s desperate sliding block. Coasting with 15 minutes left, Wrexham were somewhat fortunate to reach extra time. Still Ferriby were the better side. St Juste again accelerated into space down the right and was denied by Coughlin. And guess who was the provider for Kendall’s second in minute 100. St Juste’s ball looped up off the boot of Tomassen and found its way to Kendall for the simplest of close-range headers. Cue delirium among those wearing green and white. Hone had saved Ferriby once and he did so again with a vital slide tackle when Andy Bishop pulled the trigger with 10 minutes left. The Villagers were clinging on for dear life and their resistance was overcome just three minutes from time. A barrage was only half-cleared and it fell perfectly for Moult to thump home sweetly on the half-volley and ensure the drama of penalties.

"The ponytail has gone, along with the modelling career and a shedload of money, but the ebullient Darragh MacAnthony is not a man to look back and dwell. There has been a book too — ‘just about the football club, it was a bit daft’ — not to mention an app ‘to keep results up to date, but it wasn’t very good’. Meanwhile, owning Peterborough has turned the League One club’s extrovert chairman into an anxious, superstitious obsessive — ‘my OCD is getting worse’. Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has been in charge at the club since 2006 . MacAnthony said he has no regrets about tweeting his disapproval of players . MacAnthony, who flirted with modelling as a 17-year-old, shows he has no concerns in front of the camera . Suited in a verging-on-baggy pinstripe, MacAnthony strides into his minimalist office at the training ground, past the empty bookshelves, and admits he has never sat at his huge, empty desk before. It turns out that the decorators have been in since he last made the trip from his Florida home. He likes it, especially the montage of family portraits which adorn the walls, even if they remind him how much he is missing wife Natalie and their children: Darcy, Callum and Cara, all under 10. There is an internal door to the manager’s office, currently occupied by interim boss Dave Robertson following the reluctant severing of an eight-year on-off relationship with Darren Ferguson. ‘So you thought I’d be in a tracksuit?’ He speaks in a soft Irish brogue but the words are delivered at rat-a-tat speed in a contradictory combination of dictatorial charm. His style is to cut to the chase. The answer to his question is yes. Based on the evidence of an 11-point Twitter demolition of his players two months ago, the assumption is that MacAnthony is an owner who likes to meddle. ‘I knew you’d get to that,’ said MacAnthony, or @DMAC102. ‘Give me 11 reasons not to talk about Twitter! MacAnthony shows he is not shy in front of the camera as he pauses to take a selfie . Darren Ferguson led Peterborough to the Championship after finishing second in League One in 2009 . ‘I have been caught saying things on Twitter which I probably shouldn’t have but my personality has always been honest and direct. I make mistakes, I am impulsive. ‘What did the players think? I didn’t need to ask. I spoke to them on Friday and joked “I’m going to give you 11 great reasons on Twitter why I’m happy” (five wins in six since Ferguson’s departure). ‘They know where I’m coming from and I don’t think any of them could argue with my points. I understand it’s not the done thing, but I didn’t buy a football club to live by the rules of the establishment. ‘Am I a frustrated football manager? No. I am an owner and a frustrated fan. If you look for a manager who says I said “you must play so and so”, you won’t find one.’ MacAnthony left Ireland for Spain with his family at 15 and by 29 had made a fortune from the property market, a large chunk of which went straight down the drain in the recession. The Peterborough chairman and director of football Barry Fry celebrate after winning the JPT Trophy in 2014 . MacAnthony described getting relegated  from the Championship in 2013 as his worst moment at the club . At 17 he flirted with modelling, influenced by his girlfriend at the time, and a fact gleaned as he comfortably poses for photographs. ‘I had a ponytail, which my Mum used to do for me. Natalie doesn’t believe it when I tell her I used to be a model, but it was good money.’ Another girlfriend tempted MacAnthony to London and college. He lasted two weeks before heading back to Spain. Buying a football club was a dream toy for the boy in 2006 and has remained a source of pain and pleasure ever since. ‘I was 28-29 and at the top of my game,’ recalled MacAnthony, now 39. ‘Then the recession came and the world nearly ended financially. It was tough, but the club kept me sane. ‘It’s hard to name one best moment as there have been so many but the worst is easy. We were relegated from the Championship on 54 points two years ago. ‘We were 2-1 up (against Crystal Palace) with seven minutes to go and needed a draw. In the most horrific seven minutes in the history of the club they scored twice. Crystal Palace players celebrate Kevin Phillips' goal as Peterborough were relegated from the Championship . Then manager Ferguson consoles Jack Payne after Peterborough threw away a late lead . ‘I was watching from home — I have every game streamed to me. I’m very tense in my chair, superstitious, and my OCD is over the top. You’re not going to make this article about my OCD are you? People will laugh. I was never like this at the start and now it’s uncontrollable. ‘Everything has to be in the same place on my desk and pointing in a certain direction. No-one can talk to me during a game. One of the guys who worked for me walked in and we lost so now no-one is allowed to. ‘When we were relegated I watched and reacted like a fan. Then the financial implications come in. Jesus, we have just lost £6million worth of revenue.’ The logistics of living in the US mean that MacAnthony’s visits to the £500,000 newly-refurbished training ground — rented at £1 a year from the school next door — are regular rather than frequent. Email and telephone have to do the rest of the time. There is a lot to cram in, including this interview. Halfway through there is a knock on the door. ‘I’m busy,’ shouts MacAnthony as the door flies open regardless. ‘I’m doing an interview.’ The beaming face of director of football Barry Fry peers round the door. ‘How you doing love? We need him (MacAnthony). Peterborough director of football Barry Fry interrupts the interview to borrow MacAnthony . During the interview MacAnthony has his picture taken after Michael Bostwick signs a new deal . ‘One minute, one photo. We’re signing a new player love, and there’s nothing more important than that.’ MacAnthony is as helpless as the rest at stopping the irrepressible Fry and a short time-out is called, our photographer in hot pursuit. Back at his desk, the chairman itemises the previous 24 hours, which involved meetings and the signing of six teenagers on pro contracts. The smile fades when the conversation turns to Sir Alex Ferguson’s son Darren, who managed Peterborough twice under MacAnthony. ‘It was tough. It was like losing a member of the family. We spoke every day and we shared the highs and lows. It’s still quite raw. ‘We have to get the next appointment right. The club has been stressing me this season, I have aged. But it’s enjoyable again. I’m in the luxury position that the guys in situ are banging down the door.’ Ferguson left the club for a second time in February - MacAnthony likened it losing a member of the family . MacAnthony and Fry pose together for a picture as the director of football gives the thumbs-up . The new manager will be expected to recruit young, cheap players, produce a winning team and be prepared to lose them as the business plan is one big departure a year — the club have generated £30m of sales under MacAnthony. Britt Assombalonga was the £5m cash cow last year, a record £1m signing from Watford sold on to Nottingham Forest, sparking another angry tweet from @DMAC102 when Forest missed a due payment. There could be new projects in the pipeline. A follow-up book to his first tome, From Hobby to Obsession, perhaps? ‘It was me and a Dictaphone,’ revealed MacAnthony. ‘And then I employed someone to write it. They wrote it badly from an English point of view. ‘The fans liked it and it sold 10,000 but there was nothing about my personal life in there. I haven’t written my autobiography yet — now that would be an interesting book!’","Darragh MacAnthony has been Peterborough chairman for nine years .

"Liverpool defender Glen Johnson has no idea where he will be next season but it appears increasingly likely he will move overseas as his representatives have already held exploratory talks with foreign clubs. The 30-year-old is out of contract in the summer and negotiations over a new deal stalled at the beginning of the season and have never got going again. In January manager Brendan Rodgers said he was hopeful a solution could be found to keep the England international but with Johnson having lost his first-team place in the 3-4-2-1 formation which has been so successful since the turn of the year that now looks less likely. Liverpool's Glen Johnson in action with  Chris Taylor during the English FA Cup quarter final match . He has long been linked with a move abroad - he has been free to talk to overseas clubs since January 1 - and the defender admits there have been discussions. Asked about his contract situation with Liverpool Johnson said: 'No talks. At this point I have no idea (where I will be next season). I haven't thought about it.' On his option to explore a move overseas he added: 'There are talks. It would be great for the kids to go abroad but I am not thinking about yet as we have two months left here and I'll think about it after that. 'We will have to wait and see.' Johnson warms up before the FA Cup Quarter Final match between Liverpool and Blackburn Rovers at Anfield . Ironically Johnson made his first start in 12 matches in Sunday's goalless FA Cup quarter-final draw at home to mid-tabled SkyBet Championship Blackburn. The team's performance was so alien to what fans have become accustomed to seeing since the turn of the year there were understandably some grumbles at Anfield but Johnson said it is inevitable players will be criticised when they fail to reach the high standards they have set themselves. Unbeaten in the Premier League since January 1 and playing football lauded as currently the best in the land has set a benchmark which is not always easy to achieve. Rovers stuck to their game plan of nullifying the threat of  Adam Lallana and it worked as they drew . Phillipe Coutinho  competes with Lee Williamson during the FA Cup Quarter Final match  at Anfield . Rovers stuck to their game plan of nullifying the threat of Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana, Liverpool's two playmakers behind the striker, and were rewarded with a replay next month at Ewood Park - where they have already beaten Swansea and Stoke in the competition. 'That's football. You aren't going to play to the best of your ability in every game,' said Johnson. 'Whether you play well or not, the most important thing is that you don't go out of the cup. We're still in the draw and we can still win the tie. Johnson has no idea where he will be next season but it appears increasingly likely he will move overseas . Johnson's representatives have already held exploratory talks with foreign clubs in regards to a move . 'It was frustrating. Everyone wanted to win the game but the most important thing is that we're in the hat for the semi-finals. 'You've got to give Blackburn a lot of credit because they worked hard. They got men behind the ball. 'Hopefully we'll play better in the replay and get the win we want. 'The fixture list isn't too crowded for us now so having a replay isn't a big problem. 'We've got plenty of time on the training ground in between matches to work on things now. 'We're still confident we can go through. Hopefully we can pick up our performance.'

"Luis Suarez scored his sixth goal in six games for Barcelona to shoot them into the Copa del Rey final. The victory came at a cost with Sergio Busquets taken off on a stretcher towards the end of the first half after a bad challenge to his right ankle from Tomas Pina.

There were 20,000 yellow balloons in Villarreal’s tiny Madrigal Stadium at kick-off with the intention of creating a atmosphere of belief among the home supporters. Between them Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar went about bursting most of them after just three minutes. Suarez found Messi with a superb cross-field pass from the left and Messi played an even better ball to find Neymar through the middle. The Brazilian beat Villarreal keeper Sergio Asenjo to the ball to put Barcelona one up. It was Neymar’s 25th goal of the season and the tenth that has come from a Messi pass but strangely it didn’t kill the tie. Barcelona were loose at the back and Villarreal had chance after chance to get back on level terms. Suarez looks to go past Villarreal's Mateo Pable Musacchio  during a semi-final .

Denis Cheryshev hit the side netting with the first opportunity and then full-back Jaume Costa beat Martin Montoya and crossed for Luciano Vietto to head at Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Pina then passed to Uche who sliced his finish into the side-netting. Cheryshev then forced another save from Ter Stegen from a similar position. Barca had their chances too with Messi producing a pass that was almost identical to the one that had brought about the opening goal this time for Iniesta who couldn’t get his shot away before Victor Ruiz made the block. But Villarreal continued to find space in behind Barcelona and six minutes before half time they got the equalizer. It was a bad 60 seconds for Barcelona. Pina followed through on a pass and went straight through Busquets’s right ankle. With the midfielder still down Villarreal raced away and Costa crossed from the right for Jonathan Dos Santos to finish past Ter Stegen. Barcelona's Sergio Busquets lies on the ground injured during the game . Busquets is carried off on a stretcher after his injury in the first half . Busquets was carried off on a stretcher and now needing just the two goals to draw level Villarreal went down the tunnel at half time believing they could pull off a shock. They could have got the first of those goals with their first chance of the second half but Vietto’s header did not trouble Ter Stegen. Gerard Pique was booked for clattering the young Argentine striker while at the other end the game’s other Argentine forward went close – only Asenjo’s acrobatics keeping out Messi’s effort. Villarreal had shot high and wide too often on the night however and on 66 minutes they shot themselves in the foot.

Neymar completed the rout, converting substitute Xavi's pass. Suarez can now look forward to his first final with Barcelona at the end of May and Barcelona can now turn their attention to the Champions League with Manchester City waiting for them in two weeks.

"Chelsea crashed out of Europe, beaten on away goals by 10-man Paris Saint-Germain and branded 'babies' by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Jose Mourinho's team led twice in this turbulent encounter but twice allowed PSG to level, with captain Thiago Silva heading the vital second, six minutes from the end of extra-time. Ibrahimovic, dismissed for a tackle on Oscar in the first-half, said: 'I don't know if I have to get angry or start to laugh. For me when I saw the red card I was like ""the guy doesn't know what he's doing"". 'That is not the worst. The worst is when I got the red card all the Chelsea players come around. It felt like I had a lot of babies around me.' Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutchman sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic (far right) on 31 minutes . Ibrahimovic heads into a challenge with Chelsea midfielder Oscar (left) in the first-half which saw him sent off . The PSG forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with Oscar . Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho said he hoped the red card could be overturned but also bemoaned a penalty not given for a trip on Diego Costa and what he thought might be an elbow on Costa by David Luiz. The Chelsea manager also blamed his own players for failing to deal with their numerical advantage, wilting under expectations and conceding twice from set-pieces. 'When a team cannot defend two corners a team doesn't deserve to win,' said Mourinho. 'We couldn't cope with the pressure. For them it was easy, two lines of four, counter-attack, waiting for the right moment. Mentally for them with 10 there is nothing to lose. Chelsea players look dejected after being dumped out of the Champions League at home to PSG . 'Our performance was not good enough. The opponent was stronger than us, they coped better with the pressure of the game. Because they had 10 men we felt more the pressure of winning and they had nothing to lose. 'We couldn't cope with that, we conceded two goals in two set pieces. That is difficult to accept. For me it was a surprise. I am disappointed, but I try always to be pragmatic and honest. The first feeling was that we deserved to lose. We didn't deserve to go through. 'It's not the moment to explain. We will analyse it. We need to react. We have a Premier League to win. I told that to the players. We lost a competition where even if we win today there are other big teams to beat. 'We have the Premier League to win and we are in a good situation. There's no time to cry. Move on, and look forward.' Former Chelsea man David Luiz gestures towards Blues striker Diego Costa during Wednesday's encounter . PSG defender  Luiz celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at Stamford Bridge . Thiago Silva's late header loops over the outstretched arm of Thibaut Courtois to knock Chelsea out . On Ibrahimovic's red card, Mourinho said: 'I spoke to him after the game and when he speaks with me he's always honest. He would tell me if it was a reason for a red card, and he was very disappointed so if that's the case, I hope they can minimise the mistake and let him play the quarter-final. If he did nothing wrong, he deserves that. 'But the other situations, it was a clear penalty on Diego Costa and, once more, I think it's a waste of time and money to have the officials on the side of the goal. If he cannot see a penalty 10 metres when it's completely clear, it's a waste of time and money. 'The David elbow I didn't see, I confess. But when UEFA give him the man of the match, I have to believe there's no elbow. Perhaps they cannot give us the penalty but maybe they can do what is fair and suspend David and take Ibra into the quarter-finals.' Ibrahimovic also suggested Oscar feigned injury. 'I pulled out (of the tackle), because I saw him come in the tackle. 'I don't know if he was acting afterwards. Doesn't matter. We won the game, we went through and let's see what happens.' Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says he hopes Ibrahimovic is able to have his red card overturned . It was ill-tempered with Sky Sports pundits Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness very critical of the behaviour by Mourinho's players, especially their attempts to get Ibrahimovic sent off. Carragher called it 'disgraceful' and Souness called it 'pathetic'. Luiz equalised for PSG in the 86th minute, to take the game into extra time after Gary Cahill had volleyed Chelsea ahead. Eden Hazard restored the lead with a penalty in extra-time, after handball by Thiago Silva, who then headed in the winner with six minutes of extra-time left. 'It is amazing for everyone, amazing for Paris the club, for Paris the city,' said Luiz, who left Stamford Bridge for the French capital last year. 'My cycle was finished at Chelsea and PSG gave me a great opportunity to continue my career. 'I was very happy at Chelsea, I respect everyone and it was good to score. I said I wouldn't celebrate but I couldn't control my emotions. Thank you to Chelsea, and sorry I celebrated because I was so emotional.' The Barclays Premier League will be without a team in the last eight of the Champions League for the second time in three years if Arsenal and Manchester City cannot overturn first-leg deficits next week against Monaco and Barcelona respectively but PSG boss Laurent Blanc was satisfied to make it into the quarter-finals after this fierce contest. ‘Both sides put pressure on the opposition and Chelsea did their fair share of that. It had happened even before the match with their manager exerting pressure on the referee. That’s part of the mind games. But if you take out these elements of unsporting behaviour, I think my team were better than Chelsea in every area of the pitch,’ he said.

"'It is Shane Warne... he represents the majority of Australians, I would have thought'. Today Show host Karl Stefanovic jumped to the defence of cricket legend Shane Warne on Monday morning following a backlash over Warne's controversial booze remarks last night. Warne  was pilloried on social media for repeatedly asking cricket stars how 'thirsty' they were for a drink in interviews following Australia's demolition of New Zealand at the Cricket World Cup final. 'What's wrong with having a drink to celebrate anything? What's wrong with that?' Stefanovic questioned during a lively panel discussion. Scroll down for video .

'We can't sit around here, and we do it all the time on Mornings, you do it here on Today, and go 'we have a drinking problem' - and then sit here and and celebrate that.

'I mean OK, we all know Warney likes to party, he's a fun guy.' Stefanovic argued that a celebratory drink was part of the country's 'culture' and 'history'. Warne fired back at his critics in a late-night tweet: 'Straya (Australia) is the best place in the world, not politically correct'. The furore began started Warne asked wicket-keeper first asked Brad Haddin: 'Are you feeling thirsty?' He then quizzed batsman Steve Smith: 'Are you going to have a bit of a drink tonight too Smitty? Are you going to get thirsty as well?' Finally, Warne asked fast bowler Josh Hazlewood: 'So what's the plan - besides lots of drink and that? 'How long is that going to last? Just one night, two nights? 'Go and enjoy yourselves guys. Hopefully we'll join you for a few.' Twitter erupted. Iohyouforever said: 'Shane Warne currently sounds thirstier than James Franco in 127 hours.' Another user suggested Warne was trying to get an invite for a night out. ABC journalist Lucy Carter said: 'I feel like Shane Warne is desperately trying to get invited to drinks but every player he's interviewing isn't having a bar of it.'

"Martin O’Neill has confirmed that a representative for Harry Kane approached him expressing his client’s interest to play for the Republic of Ireland. The Ireland manager had admitted last summer that he was chasing up a lead with a player at Tottenham Hotspur and the 21-year-old was the man in O’Neill’s sights. Despite being offered encouragement by Kane’s camp, the striker, whose father was born in Galway, insisted in August that his only aim was to break into the senior England squad. And after his breakthrough season in the Premier League, O’Neill has accepted that the chase to land him is over. Harry Kane celebrates scoring his second goal as Tottenham beat QPR 2-1 at Loftus Road last Saturday . The England Under 21 striker is also eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland because of his father . ‘Yeah, yeah, it is. I was talking to somebody about this last night and we were just saying that Harry himself always wanted to play for England. Really, it was as simple as that,’ he said. ‘The order of events – though I don’t think it’s really important any more – is that initially the agent got in touch and said that he would have a keen interest, and we wanted to go and chase it up. ‘But then I noticed in the newspaper where he said he wanted to play for England. And that has remained the same. Someone was even speaking to him recently and that was exactly the same conversation. Fine, if that’s the case.’ Before Kane propelled himself into the limelight, with 26 goals to his name already this season, O’Neill felt it was possible he would opt for Ireland. Ireland boss Martin O'Neill has revealed that Kane was interested in representing Ireland before this season . ‘Considering what the agent said to me,’ he added. ‘Sometimes what agents do is they have someone who looks after the player who is not actually licensed to buy or sell or be involved as an agent but they look after the player. And he was the one who called. But he happened to call me on a day when Harry Kane said he wanted to play for England. ‘It would have been really nice, absolutely. There’s a fairly decent chance he might have had a few caps for us before he actually makes his debut for England, considering the way he’s playing.’ One Harry who will join up with the Ireland squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier with Poland later this month is Harry Arter. The Bournemouth midfielder has impressed as his side top the Championship and O’ Neill revealed that there will be further additions to his plans in the coming months. Kane has scored 26 goals so far this season and is on the brink of Roy Hodgson's England squad . ‘I don’t want to sound like a detective here but I’m following up on a number of leads. Honestly, I think there’s one or two might come to fruition in the next couple of months, maybe even before the Scotland game, that might be pleasantly surprising. I’m saying that, maybe I’m being optimistic. ‘If I thought things were really worth chasing up and somebody’s...I think sometimes the agent is seemingly almost like an excuse preventing that. One particular lad has called me who has bypassed agents and he’d be pretty keen. And I’m putting something in motion at the moment.’ Although O’Neill was coy on revealing any names. ‘Do you know, I can’t really at this minute. Would probably end up embarrassing myself when he turns out and plays for Czechoslovakia.’","Harry Kane can represent the Republic of Ireland because of his father .

"IN HIS BEST POSITION . Earlier in the season, Emre Can was being written off but for the last two months he has been terrific at centre half and Sunday saw him actually playing in the position he actually thinks is his best. From the base of midfield, the German can pass well and drive forwards in to dangerous areas. He is a great prospect. Liverpool's versatile German Emra Can battles for the ball with Blackburn's Rudy Gestede on Sunday . MORE THAN A BIG MAN . In the absence of Josh King, much was asked of Rudy Gestede but he managed to deliver. He is certainly terrific in the air and Simon Mignolet will not look forwards to meeting him again in the replay next month. However, there is more to the France-born Benin international. His link-up play was superb all afternoon. Blackburn Rovers striker Gestede tries to win the ball against Liverpool's Ivory Coast defender Kolo Toure . HAPPY ANNIVERSARY . Barely a football match takes place these days without a round of applause mid-game.

Dalglish was here on Sunday but chose, rather understandably, not to join in. Former Liverpool player and manager Kenny Dalglish looks on from the stands during the match . NOW IT’S OUR TURN . Still on the anniversary theme, Liverpool’s match programme noted that it was an incredible 35 years to the day since a superb goal from Terry McDermott won a Cup tie at Tottenham. Odd that Liverpool’s own publication should claim the winner of the BBC’s Goal of the Season award was a half-volley. It was nothing of the sort.

"Louis van Gaal admitted on Tuesday that it may take big-money summer signing Angel di Maria one year to adapt to life at Manchester United. The former Real Madrid midfielder has suffered a severe slump in form after a bright start to life at Old Trafford and was even hooked at half-time by the United boss against Sunderland last week. Sportsmail's man in Madrid Pete Jenson, who kept a close eye on Di Maria during his four-year spell in the Spanish capital, assures United fans the £60million man will come good. Angel di Maria was substituted against Sunderland after a poor performance in the opening 45 minutes . Louis van Gaal claimed it may take record signing Di Maria a full year to adapt to English football . When it comes to putting his medals on the table Angel di Maria has the silverware to silence the critics. He also has the references to convince Manchester United supporters that his current dip in form will soon pass. Jose Mourinho signed him; Carlo Anclelotti stuck by him; Sir Alex Ferguson handed him his man of the match award after the 2014 Champions League final; and Real Madrid team-mates all knew he would be missed when he left the club last summer. Xabi Alonso tweeted when he was sold: ‘Thanks for everything. I wish you all the best, even if you are going to United. We will never forget the zig-zag in extra-time in Lisbon.’ That message refers to the run and shot that led to Gareth Bale putting Real Madrid ahead against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final. It was the perfect end to his best season at a club where he was also instrumental in winning a Spanish Cup under Ancelotti and the league and another Spanish Cup under Mourinho. Di Maria has had a difficult season after making a fast start to life at Old Trafford following his move . The midfielder had a particularly bad afternoon against Sunderland last week before being hooked . It should be remembered that his glorious last campaign also came with a mid-season glitch. He famously grabbed his crotch in a disrespectful snub to Ancelotti and the booing Bernabeu after being substituted during a game at the start of the year. There was pressure on the coach to put Gareth Bale on the right wing ahead of the Argentine and feeling he was being edged out of the side unfairly in spite of a good start to the season he reacted. Ancelotti did not ostracise him as many demanded, instead he reinvented him. Moving him from the right of Real’s front three to the left of their midfield three, there he became La Liga’s top assist provider. He played 22 passes leading to goals last season including one that helped win the Spanish Cup and one that helped secure the Champions League. Carlo Ancelotti stuck with Di Maria during a slump and he eventually helped them win Champions League . Di Maria played a starring role during the Champions League final against Atletico last season . Di Maria celebrated with the European Cup before he moved to Manchester United last summer . It is that willingness and versatility that first attracted Mourinho and he made him one of his first signings at Real Madrid for £20m from Benfica. The signing was not an outright success as Barcelona continued to dominate in Spain. Di Maria played in the first Pep Guardiola v Mourinho clasico in November 2010 and was as culpable as any of his team-mates as Madrid went down 5-0 in one of the worst humiliations of the Portuguese manager's career. But Di Maria never stopped going in that first season and the following March at Mestalla in the Spanish Cup final, also against Barcelona, it was a lung-busting run from Di Maria in minute 103 and a cross to the back post headed in by Cristiano Ronaldo that gave Mourinho his first trophy in Spain. The following year Di Maria helped his boss win the league. Di Maria made an exciting start to his career at Old Trafford, pictured here celebrating a goal against QPR . The midfiedler also scored against Everton and all three of his league goals were scored by early October . Mourinho’s judgement is rarely off and the same can be said for Ancelotti's. He knew not to discard Di Maria just because Bale had arrived, channelling his qualities for the good of the team. Real are missing him now. Last season Luka Modric and Di Maria protected Real full backs Marcelo and Dani Carvajal leaving Bale and Ronaldo to concentrate on the business of terrorising opposition defences. This year with the Argentine sold and Modric injured they are, by their own standards, struggling with Ronaldo and particularly Bale, criticised for not working back in defence. A first-season dip after a brilliant start is also nothing new for a player in his first season in the Premier League. Mesut Ozil suffered the same at Arsenal after his high-profile move from Real Madrid and Di Maria has more excuses than most to have dropped his performances levels. Di Maria played a key role for Argentina as they reached the final of the World Cup in Brazil last summer . The former Real midfielder starred for Argentina in a 4-2 win against Germany in September . He played 52 of Real Madrid’s 60 games last season and then played a big part in Argentina’s World Cup campaign. He might have foreseen a more relaxing season this time but he had to move his family to Manchester from Madrid in the summer and has the added stress of a further temporary move into a hotel after the recent attempted burglary at his Cheshire home. That and Van Gaal’s failure to find the magic formula on the pitch and his preference for a more patient passing game has not helped the 27-year-old’s cause. His anarchic road-runner raids forward are a poor fit for the tactical straight-jacket Van Gaal occasionally imposes on his players. Being hooked at half-time against Sunderland does not look good on Di Maria’s resume but alongside his Olympic Gold medal (scoring the winner in the final) his Champions League medal and the glowing references from Mourinho and Ancelotti, there is more than enough to remind everyone that while his current form is off, his class will eventually shine through.","Angel di Maria joined Manchester United from Real Madrid for £60m .

"Ndamukong Suh’s wish appears to have come true, with the Miami Dolphins set to make him the NFL’s highest-paid defensive player. After the Lions declined to use the franchise tag on Suh to save $26.5m of cap space, the Dolphins look to have beaten Oakland, Jacksonville, Indianapolis and San Diego to the most coveted signature in this year’s free agency. Suh will on Tuesday sign a $114million, six-year deal with around $60m guaranteed, ESPN report. With no state taxes in Florida, the deal dwarfs JJ Watt’s current six-year, $100m deal which the Texans’ defensive end penned last year. Ndamukong Suh will on Tuesday sign a $114million with the Miami Dolphins with $60million guaranteed . Suh, the second pick of the 2010 draft, is a four time Pro-Bowler and three-time first team All-Pro and led the Lions with 8.5 sacks last season. At 28, Suh is in his prime and is a once-in-a decade type of player whom the Dolphins can build their franchise around. A fearsome pass rusher, he was the cornerstone of NFL’s best rushing defense and helped the Lions to the play-offs last year. He will join the likes of Cameron Wake and Oliver Vernon in an aggressive front four. In his five years in Detroit, Suh played 80 out of 82 games. He was suspended for both of those for stamping on Evan Dietrich-Smith of the Green Bay Packers in 2011. Veterans such as Cortland Finnegan (right) were among those released by the Dolphins to free up cap space . Following his exit, the focus for the Lions front office will be getting fellow defensive tackle Nick Fairley to stay. After declining his fifth-year option last year due to injury concerns, the 26-year-old is considered the second-best free agent defensive tackle. Should Suh depart, which appears likely, they will need a run-stuffer alongside him. The free-spending Dolphins had a roster clear-out which paved the way for Suh’s arrival. Veterans such as Brian Hartline, Brandon Gibson, Dannell Ellerbe and Cortland Finnegan were among those released to free up cap space. Suh and the Dolphins travel to London later on this year to play the New York Jets on October 4 in the first International Series game of the 2015 season.","The Miami Dolphins have made Suh an offer of a $114m deal .

"Nigel Pearson has underlined Leicester's survival belief but admitted they need to beat Hull. The Foxes are seven points from safety in the Barclays Premier League and have lost five of their last six top-flight games. They host the Tigers on Saturday and manager Pearson insists they are out to prove the doubters wrong. Nigel Pearson (centre) watches training unfold on Thursday as Leicester prepare for their clash against Hull . Pearson insists he and his squad believe they can still avoid relegation from the Premier League this season . He said: 'We still have a strong belief in our ability to stay up this season. 'Whether other people share it is not that important at the moment. In house there is a feeling we can do it. 'Saturday is a game both sides want to win. But Hull may be happier with the draw than us. We certainly need to win the game.' The Foxes have not won in the league since beating Aston Villa 1-0 in January but Pearson thinks one victory could spark a run of results. 'That is something we keep very much in our minds because we do have that belief,' said the manager, who spent just over a year as Hull boss before returning to Leicester in 2011. 'But you have to get that first one. 'This is a game a lot of people see as being a pivotal one we have. It will be a difficult game.'

Midfielder Andy King (left) plays a pass under pressure from team-mate Paul Konchesky in training . Dean Hammond (calf) and Anthony Knockaert (personal reasons) are out but goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel could return after four months out with a broken foot. Matt Upson is expected to control the defence and the centre-back insisted he will remain calm despite their position. 'Personally I don't care about the occasion,' Upson told the club's official site. 'Whether it's a World Cup final or a Premier League game it's the same focus and the same attitude, the grass is green and the ball is round. 'I'd like to use that as extra motivation. I like to think I'm committed to do my best, whether I'm playing for the Under-21s or the first team.' Leicester have not played since their 2-0 defeat at Manchester City and with a 10-day break between games Upson hopes they have recharged. Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel could return to face Hull after recovering from a broken foot . 'I think it can be quite a difficult, 10 days' said the 34-year-old. 'You can look at it in two ways, it's just important that the players are looking at it in the right way - as an opportunity to prepare for this game. 'It's a difficult period and a lot of thought has to go into training and how much you do focusing on one game, and how much is for fitness and how much is for getting the players in the right frame of mind. 'All those things have to have the right balance and I think it's important to get into the right frame of mind.'","Leicester City are seven points from safety at the bottom of the table .

"Andy Murray revealed he sought inspiration for the biggest home tie in his Davis Cup career by visiting the home of Scottish football. Murray took time out of his preparation for the World Group encounter with the United States to take a private tour of Hampden Park. The Scot admits he will be nervous when he turns out in front of his home crowd on Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the Emirates Arena and his trip to a more established Scottish sporting venue helped him reflect on the encounter to come. Andy Murray hits a shot as part of his practice session at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow on Wednesday . Murray, wearing a t-shirt with a tweet from a fan pledging support, is part of the British team taking on the USA . The recently-announced World No 5 will have the backing of home support in Glasgow this week . Murray said: 'I just went and had a little walk around and saw the locker rooms and changing areas and went on to the pitch, which was nice. 'I had only been once to Hampden before for a cup final which Hibs lost. Surprise. 'It was nice to go down on the pitch and see what it was like.' The Emirates Arena will only hold about a seventh of Hampden's 50,000 capacity but Murray expects the crowd to play a significant role in the first-round encounter. 'For all of us as a team, getting to play in front of a crowd like this is a great feeling,' said the world number five, whose brother Jamie missed media duties as he bids to recover from a minor cold. 'I would say that's the nicest thing about the Davis Cup, when you get a home tie you get the whole crowd behind you. It's not like that at the tournaments we play throughout the rest of the year. 'To have a crowd turning up just to support you is fantastic and I'm sure the whole team will respond. 'It looks like a great arena, it's a perfect size and if it's packed I am sure they will make a lot of noise. 'It helps in all sports to play in front of a home crowd. There can sometimes be a few nerves early because of it but once you get through that it makes a big difference and can help a lot.' James Ward (seated, left) and Murray take a break and look out to the court during Wednesday's session . Murray moves towards the net to nip a shot over ahead of facing the USA, who Great Britain beat last year . Murray checks out the message emblazoned across his top, and later takes a break from the session . Murray's shirt read: 'Good luck @andy_murray. you can do it for the Brits... We believe in you! #BackTheBrits' Ward and Murray face a tough task to repeat last year's win over the US on the arena's indoor hard court . Murray joked that James Ward was 'piling the pressure on' when his fellow singles player stated that the Australian Open finalist would be a clear favourite in his games, but he later appeared relaxed over the prospect of meeting expectations. 'I have always viewed nerves as a very positive thing,' the 27-year-old said. 'When you actually learn what nerves are and why they come, it's positive to feel nervous. 'I have always felt like I have been able to concentrate better when I have had nerves in the morning or the night before. 'I feel like my body responds well to it, that I move better and see the ball better. It's just making sure you are able to make the right decisions in those moments. I think, well I hope I will deal with it well on Friday but who knows?' Murray shares a laugh with Great Britain's Davis Cup team captain Leon Smith during the training session . Murray gave short shrift to questions on the effect his support for Scottish independence in last year's referendum would have on his commitment to the Great Britain team, having explained his decision to come out in support a 'yes' vote in a recent interview. 'Well, I guess we'll see at the weekend,' he stated before coach Leon Smith moved the topic back to tennis. Murray helped Britain to a 3-1 victory over the US in San Diego at the same stage last year, before losing to Italy in the quarter-finals. But the visitors have top singles player John Isner back after an ankle injury and Murray goes into the weekend slightly out of sorts after two quarter-final defeats since his collapse against Novak Djokovic in the Melbourne final. Murray admitted he had missed the influence of coach Amelie Mauresmo, who was occupied with France Fed Cup duties when Murray lost to Gilles Simon and then Croatian teenager Borna Coric in Rotterdam and Dubai respectively. 'I feel I have practised pretty well here,' he said. 'I took a couple of days off after Dubai and got here and started trying to work on a couple of things and get myself back on the right track. 'After the Aussie Open I spent the next three or four weeks with no coach and I feel that's something I obviously need to get sorted so that when I get to the clay court season I am not in that position, because I feel like there are some things I need to work on all the time and when I don't have somewhere there it's harder to do that. That's high on my list of priorities.' A press conference followed the training session for Murray and his Great Britain team-mates in Glasgow .","Andy Murray took part in a training session ahead of Davis Cup clash .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of football including the FA Cup, Premier League and a daft red card. 1. Glen Johnson still has plenty to offer Liverpool as he waits to resolve his Anfield future. The 54 times capped England right back is out of contract in the summer, and despite talk of a new three-year offer on reduced wages seems no closer to agreeing a new deal. In his first full game since collecting a groin injury against Manchester United in December he was the team’s top passer against Blackburn, finding a team mate with 82 of 87 passes – half of them in the attacking half of the field. Johnson’s role in defence also allowed Emre Can to play his more natural position at the base of the midfield. Glen Johnson still has a lot to offer Liverpool as he tries to win a new deal at the Merseyside club . 2. Eric Dier is starting to win his battle to establish himself as a centre half for Tottenham after being forced to play at right back at the start of the season. The 20-year-old, who was born in Cheltenham but grew up in Portugal before moving to White Hart Lane from Sporting Lisbon for £4million last summer, turned down an England Under 21 call-up in the Autumn because he didn’t want to play at full back. He is improving rapidly now alongside Jan Vertonghen. At QPR he made 11 clearances, more than any other defender apart from the 14 managed by his Belgian partner. Eric Dier (right) is beginning to establish himself as a top centre half after starring for Tottenham . 3. Nedum Onuoha deserved credit for his determination to play for QPR against Tottenham despite the horrific cut to his cheek he suffered a few days earlier in the defeat to Arsenal. But the former Manchester City defender showed signs that he was still suffering from the collision with team mate Steven Caulker. In the 90 minutes he gave the ball away 30 times as Rangers, whose survival depends on their form at Loftus Road, slumped to their fourth home defeat in a row. Nedum Onuoha suffered this nasty facial injury in a clash of heads with Steven Caulker but opted to play on . 4. Jonas Olsson, key defender for West Bromwich Albion for the last few seasons, is now rapidly looking surplus to requirements. The 31-year-old Swedish international hadn’t played since September after being axed by Alan Irvine before then needing surgery on an Achilles injury. His comeback game at Aston Villa saw him dragged off after 68 minutes during which he struggled against the running of Charles N’Zogbia. Jonas Olsson's days at West Bromwich Albion appear to be numbered after falling out of favour this season . 5. Matt Lowton has been one of the big winners at Aston Villa from the arrival of new boss Tim Sherwood. The 25-year-old had been out of favour under previous boss Paul Lambert who had picked him only four times all season, after bringing Alan Hutton in from the cold to play right back. But Sherwood has trusted the former Sheffield United defender to solve a problem at left back for him, and Lowton has twice kept the involvement of West Brom’s wide midfielder Craig Gardner to a minimum. Matt Lowton has been given a fresh chance by Tim Sherwood after being dropped by Paul Lambert . 6. Pavel Pogrebnyak remains an expensive legacy for Reading from the days when former owner Anton Zingarevich persuaded his fellow Russian to sign a £65,000 a week contract. The striker was hugely unlucky not to find a winning goal for the Royals in their 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final at Bradford, twice hitting the post. But that is symptomatic of the way his season has gone, with just four goals to show for 25 appearances. The bad news for boss Steve Clarke as he tries to balance his budget is that the Pog, now aged 31, still has another season of his bumper deal to run. Pavel Pogrebnyak has not lived up to his billing since joining Reading in 2012 . 7. It’s little wonder that Watford fought so hard to keep striker Troy Deeney away from both West Brom and Swansea in the January transfer window. The 26-year-old was also the subject of a failed bid by Leicester last summer, signing a new contract and being appointed club captain. He’d already made Vicarage Road history as the first player in 50 years to get 20 goals in two consecutive seasons – and after getting his 16th of this campaign to earn a point at Wolves he’s well on course to pass that target for a third year. Troy Deeney celebrates after scoring his sides second goal away to Championship rivals Wolves . 8. Steve Morison still has the faith of Leeds manager Neil Redfearn – even though he reaches the unhappy landmark today of two years since he last scored a goal for the club. In fairness the 31-year-old former Welsh international did spend all last season on loan at Millwall where his goals and all-round team play helped the London side avoid relegation. He’s failed to find the net in 18 Championship games for Leeds so far this campaign, but Redfearn insisted his work rate up front was a key factor in the 1-0 win at Wigan which brought the club their fifth win in seven games. Steve Morison (left) hasn't scored for two years but still has the backing off his manager Neil Redfearn . 9. Daftest red card of the weekend went to Notts County’s Liam Noble who got booked for dissent at Swindon – and then moaned so much to referee Gavin Ward about that decision that he got a second yellow. The 23-year-old former Carlisle midfielder has now been sent off three times this season and even manager Shaun Derry admitted: “I can’t back him.” At least Noble issued a heartfelt apology to the club afterwards – but the Geordie born youngster clearly has some red mist issues to overcome. Liam Noble (centre right) was sent off the second time against Swindon after being booked twice for dissent . 10. Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough has long since consigned Burton Albion to his personal history book – but his links with the club he took from part-time football into the League in 11 years in charge are still strong. And that is already helping new boss Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink as he tries to mark his first spell of management in English football by achieving a promotion. Clough last week loaned Belgian Under 21 midfielder Florent Cuvelier to the Brewers – and the former Stoke youngster marked his debut by coming off the bench to get the winning goal at Hartlepool which kept Burton top of League Two. Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough still has links with former club Burton and loaned them Florent Cuvelier .","Glen Johnson still has an important role to play for Liverpool .

"Radamel Falcao's miserable career at Manchester United reached a new low on Tuesday night when he was dumped in the reserves by manager Louis van Gaal. Falcao has not played a minute of football for United's first team since being dragged off midway through the home victory over Sunderland last month and was left on the bench as Van Gaal's stuttering team were knocked out of the FA Cup by Arsenal at home on Monday night. Now the £250,000-a-week loan signing from Monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the Under 21 team in their game against Tottenham on Tuesday night. Radamel Falcao losing his footing as he tries to escape the attentions of Bongani Khumalo (left) Falcao reacts as a chance goes by (left) while Rafael (right, centre) is congratulated on his goal . Falcao's spectacular fall from favour is starkly shown by the 'U21' badge on the arm of his United shirt . Van Gaal's decision to select the 29-year-old in the Under 21s is indicative of the United manager's ongoing concerns over the Colombian international's fitness levels. However, the United boss usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury. Falcao has been injury free since recovering from a thigh injury at the end of November and is unlikely to be pleased at being asked to drop down a level at a time when he is desperately trying to prove he is worth a permanent deal. United officials say Falcao, one of the most feared strikers in world football before he suffered a cruciate ligament injury last January, was chosen to ensure he would be sharp for the first-team's clash with Spurs at the same venue on Sunday afternoon. Falcao heads the ball towards goal but his drought goes on after another unsuccessful outing . Sportsmail reported earlier this year that Falcao feels he has to work twice as hard to impress his manager as some other players and has been less than thrilled at times to hear his manager question his fitness levels. But on this evidence he will do well to win a recall from Louis van Gaal after an anonymous performance. In a poor first half Falcao dallied too long on two opportunities and his only other action of note came when he deflected fellow striker James Wilson's goal-bound effort wide from an offside position.

Falcao looks to get in between the Tottenham defence at Old Trafford as United are held by Spurs . Falcao has another effort on goal but is again frustrated as United searched for the winner . Expertly marshalled by Spurs' centre-half pairing of 17-year-old Cameron Carter-Vickers and South African Bongani Khumalo, 28, the Monaco man cut a desperately frustrated figure. In the second half he was at it again when he diverted Sean Goss's shot into the arms of Spurs keeper Luke McGee before his disappointing evening came to a merciful end. In contrast Brazilian right back Rafael, fighting for his future at United, was a standout. He calmly intercepted McGee's throw out before chipping him with his left foot from 30 yards on 33 minutes to cancel out lively Spurs midfielder Kenny McEvoy's opener. Having only scored four times during his six months at United, the chances of Falcao being retained in the summer are almost nil. United have not seen enough to suggest he will prove value for money in the long run while Falcao feels he has not always been given a fair crack of the whip by Van Gaal. After Monday's cup exit against Arsenal, Van Gaal reacted with irritation when asked about the decision to sign Falcao and release Danny Welbeck last August. Welbeck returned to Old Trafford to score the winner in Arsenal's 2-1 win. Last night Welbeck said: 'Manchester United is a club that means so much to me. I'm a fan and it's hard to knock them out. I'll always respect the fans. I had a lovely reception from them and I'm thankful for that.'

"The League Cup remains Celtic’s Achilles heel. The Scottish trophy which has eluded them most often. Since beating Saturday's opponents Dundee United in the 1997-98 final, the Parkhead club have won it a further four times. To supporters of smaller, provincial clubs, that would be a form of nirvana. A glorious period of outstanding achievement. Ronny Deila is determined to get his hands on the League Cup after Sunday's final against Dundee United . To Celtic, it’s a source of mild failure. In the same period the club has captured twice as many league titles. And six Scottish Cups The clubs previous two managers, Tony Mowbray and Neil Lennon, didn’t win the League Cup at all and Lennon’s record in cups was a source of occasional unrest. For Ronny Deila, then, the first trophy of his Celtic tenure would be hugely significant. ‘It is something we would remember for the rest of our lives,’ said the Norwegian. ‘Cup finals are big. They are big in Norway and in Scotland and England. This tradition is important.’ Bold and forthright, Deila has publicly pledged to win a Treble. Managers usually play down talk of clean sweeps and banish the very words from their vocabulary. A fatalistic, superstitious streak runs through Scottish football, but Deila isn’t having it. Far from piling pressure on himself or his players, he believes it sets a target to strive for. Celtic expect to win all three domestic trophies every season. Saying so should be no cause for palpitations. ‘I am very calm,’ said Deila with a grin. ‘Maybe too much. Hopefully it will come on Sunday - but we have so many big matches you get used to it. ‘If this had been a small club, the cup final would be totally crazy. It would be all: “Who is going to sit here and what are we going to do with the supporters?” But this club has done it so many times, so it’s very calm. ‘We just prepare for what’s ahead of us and I think we can feel in the atmosphere of the players there is a big game coming up. Again, we can reach one of our targets and that’s important.’ Deila issues instructions to his players during the recent Scottish Cup quarter-final draw with Dundee United . In one sense he is correct. Celtic have been in many cup finals, too many to mention. But he hasn’t. ‘In 2010, Stromsgodset beat a First Division team in the final,’ he recalled. ‘I played in 2001 and won, then lost one in 2002. The cup final is big in Norway, there is only one cup and, like the FA Cup, it’s the last game of the season and is always sold out. ‘I have seen crazy things at the cup final. Things like: “Who is going to sit beside the King?” That’s how it is with small clubs. Not here.’ He believes Celtic are favourites to win because they have the bigger squad. More options. Those options will be diminished if Nir Bitton, an increasingly influential midfielder, fails to overcome a swollen ankle. But Kris Commons is fit again and ready. ‘Kris trained yesterday (Thursday) and looked good,’ reported Deila. ‘Adam Matthews is a bit too early. Bitton will hopefully reach it, though he has still not trained. But he is very determined, so hopefully he will reach it. ‘We will give him until Sunday because he is a very important player. We want him to play and I think he has a good chance.’ That Celtic have the personnel is beyond doubt. There will be more focus at Hampden on the discipline of the teams. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara poses with the Celtic boss and the League Cup at Hampden . So edgy and ill-tempered – and hugely enjoyable - was the Scottish Cup tie between these two teams at Tannadice last Sunday that people are already looking for ‘afters.’ Evidence of bad blood which might lead to another day of big decisions and navel-gazing over the state of Scottish refereeing. Warning his team to keep their discipline, Deila recalled: ‘It was the same against Rangers. If you lose your discipline there and get a red card you can lose the game. ‘I think we have been disciplined. Last Sunday some things happened after a situation. ‘Again, when something happens like that you must keep discipline and focus. So I expect my players to do that in every game now. ‘We have to be disciplined. We have to think and we have to not do stupid things. Stay on your feet and nothing will happen. ‘You have to have controlled aggression. John Collins is always saying that. We have to be determined and high on motivation and aggression. ‘We have to be clear thinkers about what to do in certain situations. We want the team to be like that and we want to be the same way.’ Chief Executive Peter Lawwell and Deila pictured after Celtic announce new agreement with New Balance . He locked his players away in a form of exile at their Lennoxtown training ground before the Rangers game and has employed similar tactics this week. Nothing has been left to chance. The Scottish League Cup gets a bad press. The crowds are poor, the interest levels low. The semi-finals were played on a Hampden pitch better suited to Chinese rice farmers, but a new surface has been laid for the final and Deila gave it the all-clear after a brief walkabout on Thursday. The prospect of a new Celtic manager going for his first trophy in charge sets a new narrative for Sunday. Nothing will be left to chance in pursuit of the prize. ‘All I do is go to Lennoxtown and then go home,’ said Deila. ‘You have to prepare for whatever is coming up, the next game all the time, and it has been a usual week for us. ‘We have big goals and one of them is to win trophies. The other is to develop the club in the direction I want it to go and they want it to go. ‘We have started well. The first year is always so hard wherever you go. You have to get people to understand what you believe in and you have to get to know people. If we can start by winning a trophy on Sunday, it would be a very good start.’","Celtic play Dundee United in the Scottish League Cup final on Sunday .

"Lionel Messi has compared Barcelona's mouthwatering clash against eternal rivals Real Madrid later this month to the bitter South American rivalry between Brazil and Argentina. Barca host Real in the second El Clasico fixture of the season on March 22 - with both teams tussling for the La Liga title. The Catalan club currently hold a one-point advantage over Carlo Ancelotti's side with just 12 games of the season remaining. Lionel Messi has compared Barcelona's fierce rivalry with Real Madrid to Brazil versus Argentina . Messi (pictured, centre, playing for Argentina in 2008) has played in many tense encounters against Brazil . Messi (pictured, centre, playing for Barca in 2011) has scored more El Clasico goals than anyone in history . The diminutive No 10 (centre right) enjoyed a BBQ with his Barcelona team-mates on Wednesday afternoon . Messi spoke in an interview with FourFourTwo . And looking ahead to the Nou Camp encounter Messi, who has scored more Clasico goals than anyone else in the history of the fixture, describes the occasion as one to relish. 'The Clasico, which is coming up later in this month, is obviously a special game,' he told FourFourTwo Magazine. 'It's important for what it means to everyone involved, from the players to the fans. 'It's an event all around the world. As a player, though, you have to treat it like any other game. Like any derby, there's something extra to the game. 'They're amazing to play in and it's a fixture I've been very lucky to score a lot of goals in. 'I think on the international stage, Brazil vs Argentina is similar to Real Madrid v Barca. Both matches involve big teams who have a great rivalry, the main difference being that for the former it's all about the countries, while Barcelona isn't just about the city, but the fans from afar who have feelings for the club.' The 27-year-old is enjoying another wonderful season at Barcelona having netted an incredible 41 goals so far. Messi scored a hat-trick in Sunday's 6-1 La Liga win at home to Rayo Vallecano - his fifth treble of the campaign. Speaking about what makes him so special, the dimunitive No 10 insists his genius is all instinctive. 'Some people say my style of play is innate, but I'm not sure if that's me, or not. Honestly, I do play on instinct,' he added. 'On the pitch, I’m always looking for the best move or decision at any given time. I never want to do what the opposition would be expecting.'

"A video has emerged that claims to show Oscar Pistorius playing football in a prison yard with a notorious underworld criminal. The extraordinary footage appears to show a dramatically slimmer Pistorius enjoying a penalty shoot-out competition with Radovan Krejcir, who was last month charged with murder. The disgraced sprinter, who was jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, has struck up an unlikely friendship with the Czech fugitive since they became neighbours on the hospital wing at Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria. In the 90 second clip, South Africa's two most notorious prisoners are seen taking turns to play striker and goalkeeper in the facility's concrete yard which they seemingly have to themselves. Scroll down for video . A video emerged that claims to show Oscar Pistorius (white T-shirt) playing football in a prison yard with a notorious underworld criminal, seen here taking on the role of goalkeeper in a penalty shoot-out . The extraordinary footage appears to show a dramatically slimmer Pistorius enjoying a penalty shoot-out competition with Radovan Krejcir, who was last month charged with murder . The double-amputee was jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp  in 2013 . The disgraced sprinter has struck up an unlikely friendship with Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir (right) since they became neighbours on the hospital wing at Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria . The footage, shot from above on a mobile phone reportedly by a convicted robber, was published today by South Africa's Daily Sun newspaper. The pictures appear to support recent reports that the double-amputee has slimmed down dramatically since his incarceration four months ago amid fears of poisoning by other prisoners. According to jail sources, the shamed athlete is surviving on tins of baked beans, pilchards and an African vegetable dish called 'chakalaka' bought at the prison tuck shop after spurning his rations. Wearing trainers, grey shorts and a white, unbranded T-shirt that appears to swamp his lean frame, the 28-year-old's thin arms protrude from its sleeves. The images are in stark contrast to the muscle-bound track star who made history at the London Olympic games by competing against able-bodied athletes. During the day, Pistorius is required to dress in the regulation orange jump suit which is issued to all inmates at the jail. In the 90-second clip, South Africa's two most notorious prisoners are seen taking turns to play striker and goalkeeper in the facility's concrete yard which they seemingly have to themselves . As a prisoner on remand, heavily-built Krejcir is entitled to wear his own clothes and is dressed in a striped top and deck shoes for his knockabout game with the famous athlete . Pistorius takes part in the 400m heats at the London Olympics in 2012, six months prior to his arrest . But according to a spokesman for the jail, he is entitled to dress in sports gear for his hour of daily exercise. As a prisoner on remand, heavily-built Krejcir is entitled to wear his own clothes and is dressed in a striped top and deck shoes for his knockabout game with the famous athlete. Although in the video Pistorius appears to move easily on his prostheses despite his obvious drop in weight, during his long murder trial, his doctor told the court of the pain the fallen sprinter suffers a result of wearing artificial limbs that fit poorly as a result of weight loss. The bleak yard where the men are having a kickabout shows two narrow doors, one yellow and one red, apparently used to control the exit and entry of the prison's notoriously violent large population. For the purposes of their football game, the doors provide make-shift goal posts and Pistorius shows himself to be useful in goal, deflecting the older man's attempt to score by blocking one shot with a prosthetic leg. At one point, the one-time sporting idol has to delve behind some wheelie bins to retrieve the white ball after knocking away Krejcir's strike with his hand. In apparent deference to his opponent, the Paralympic gold medalist is seen moving a concrete-weighted pole and plastic bag out of the way in order for Krejcir to have more room to take aim at the goal. The bleak yard where the men are having a kickabout shows two narrow doors, one yellow and one red, apparently used to control the exit and entry of the prison's notoriously violent large population . At one point, the one-time sporting idol has to delve behind some wheelie bins to retrieve the white ball after knocking away Krejcir's strike with his hand . Pistorius spreads his arms wide in celebration after winning the Men's 400m T44 final at the 2012 Paralympics . When it is his own turn to take penalties, Pistorius strikes hard, but hits one of the door 'goal posts', before sprinting off to reclaim the ball – clearly relishing the short burst of speed. Prison chiefs are mindful of the threat to Pistorius's safety at the massive jail, where gangs dominate prison life and sexual and physical violence is the only means to progress up the gangs' chain of command. He spends much of his day isolated from other prisoners, but Krejcir – despite his links with violent crime – is obviously perceived to pose no danger. Last month, MailOnline exclusively revealed how Pistorius had been re-classified to a low-risk A category prisoner, entitling him to greater freedoms and privileges behind bars, including 'contact' visits, a radio and the freedom to wear jewelry. The Daily Sun newspaper, which received the footage from a prisoner inside the jail, quoted an unnamed inmate who complained that Krejcir and Pistorius were getting preferential treatment because they are both white. Prisoners are lined up inside the Kgosi Mumpuru 11 Management Centre during a surprise raid by prison officials checking for drugs and other contraband. Pistorius is being held in the hospital wing of jail . Prison officials search an inmate's cell. Pistorius is said to be quiet and calm in prison after an initial meltdown during his first few days when other inmates heard him sobbing himself to sleep (file picture) The paper reports that Pistorius is given mineral water, fresh fruit and tea for breakfast - treats that are not afforded to other prisoners and prepared only for him. 'We are all in prison and we must be treated the same. The colour of your skin should not be a passport to get on the sweet side of the law,' the prisoner told the paper. The noise of the prison, which houses 7,000 inmates, can be heard on the video soundtrack, drowning any exchanges between the two men. Krejcir, currently on trial for kidnapping, attempted murder and drug dealing, appears to enjoy the yard knockabout. Model Reeva Steenkamp died after Pistorius fired four shots at her through a locked toilet door at his home on Valentine's Day two years ago . Pistorius competes in the Men's 100m T44 heats on day 7 of the London 2012 Paralympic Games in London . The Czech fugitive is facing a long incarceration as a prisoner on remand, with a number of outstanding cases against him. Detectives said it would take years to wrap up investigations into the Czech's links with the criminal underworld including murder, drug trafficking, robbery and fraud. Krejcir currently has three court cases running against him, but as an unconvicted prisoner is entitled to greater privileges than his neighbour on the hospital wing. Krecjir's latest charge involves the murder of a Lebanese national who was shot more than 30 times when he stopped at a traffic light in Johannesburg 18 months ago. News of the unlikely friendship between the two was revealed when Krejcir wrote a letter to prison authorities complaining that a treadmill and exercise bike – that he trained on alongside Pistorius –had been removed from the corridor outside his cell. Pistorius (right) and his girlfriend Steenkamp pose for a picture in Johannesburg, February 7, 2013 . Krejcir used a false passport to move to South Africa seven years ago and has been linked to the unsolved murders of, among others, a luxury car exporter, the owner of a string of strip joints and a known drug dealer. In 2013 he survived an attempt on his own life which involved remotely-operated guns which had been hidden - 007-style - behind the number plate of a parked car. In December, the double-amputee's brother told South Africa's YOU magazine how the athlete had hoped to begin a basketball training programme for inmates, many of whom suffer from ill health due to HIV, Aids and TB. According to Carl, Pistorius had requested a donation of basketballs from his family in order to set up the project after applying for permission from prison bosses. In October, Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide over the death of 29 year-old Mrs Steenkamp at his home on St Valentine's Day 2013. The double-amputee shot the model four times through a locked toilet door after mistaking her for an intruder. He could be released from jail in August and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. However, the state has appealed Pistorius' acquittal on a charge of murder. The athlete's own lawyers have challenged the ruling to allow the appeal. The next hearing in the case is due to take place on Friday.

"Tim Sherwood insists Aston Villa are ready for the home straight and wants to avoid a photo finish in the relegation battle.

The Black Cats are a point and a place ahead of fourth bottom Villa, who themselves are just three points above the drop zone. Tim Sherwood wants to ensure Premier League survival for Aston Villa with games to spare . Former Tottenham boss faced the media on Thursday ahead of the crunch clash with Sunderland on Saturday . And with the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday, Sherwood is hoping Villa, who have never been relegated from the Premier League, can avoid being unseated. He said: 'I think it'll be a photo finish and I hope we're not in it. 'We're probably just coming around the corner but it's probably the longest run-in in racing history. 'All we're looking at is the next fence and that's Sunderland. After that we hope we can stay in the running, there might be a few who fall along the way and we're hoping that's not us.' Villa have won their last two under Sherwood, beating West Brom twice in the league and the FA Cup to reach the semi-finals. Gabby Agbonlahor, who has been rejuvenated under Sherwood, trains on Thursday morning . Christian Benteke was out through his paces at the training ground on Thursday . They were the new manager's first wins since replacing Paul Lambert in February and Sherwood has been impressed with the squad's attitude. 'They've been good and a win makes an awful lot of difference. They have been focused and up for the fight,' he said. 'They haven't dwelt on the position. It's about looking forward now, what we have done previously counts for nothing.'

He said: 'If they are going to survive it's going to be Jermain Defoe who keeps them in the Premier League, that's why they forked out that sort of money for him. 'He didn't have to go, he went for a lifestyle change to Canada but he still has that appetite to come back and play for Sunderland, in a relegation battle. 'Jermain can score goals on his own but he prefers people to slide the ball across the six-yard box for him to be in the right place at the right time, that's what he's done all of his career.'","Aston Villa play Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday .

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has encouraged Wilfried Zaha to aim for a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the European Under 21 Championship this summer. The tricky winger scored and set up another in Palace’s win which left Queens Park Rangers deep in the relegation quagmire. When the debate rages about who should play in the Under 21 tournaments, Barclays Premier League managers often prefer their stars to skip them. Wilfried Zaha celebrates with Crystal Palace team-mates after his opener at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Shaun Wright-Phillips made his first Premier League start for 770 days. But Pardew has taken the unusual step of backing Zaha for the tournament and will speak to Southgate about including him. ‘I would love Wilf to be on that trip because that is a big tournament for England,’ Pardew said. ‘Particularly after the Champions League results this year and England didn’t do well in the World Cup so I think Gareth should have the best players available and I’m hoping Wilf is one of them. But Gareth’s choice won’t be determined by a phone call from me, he is his own man. ‘Wilf has definitely found himself a little bit more and I think Gareth would like somebody in the squad who has the kind of quality that he does. But he’s got to do it between now and the end of the year and push for a place in that squad — that should be a goal for him.’ Zaha’s counterpart on the opposite flank Yannick Bolasie also starred in the victory, twice beating QPR’s teenage right-back Darnell Furlong to get to the byline and send in low crosses — one for Zaha’s goal and the other for James McArthur to score. Zaha slides in to open the scoring during the 3-1 win over relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers . Furlong was run ragged and eventually hooked at the break. Bolasie admitted he targeted the 19-year-old as a weak link in the team. ‘My aim was to go at him straight away,’ he said. ‘He ain’t going to come here and I’m not going to let him settle, so that was my aim to be honest. I know it’ s cruel, that’s football. ‘A couple of the players spoke to me and I wasn’t aware [of him], because I don’ t really look at the opposition like that. But that was the aim.’ Furlong was at least not at fault for the third goal, which came from the other flank when Zaha tricked his way through a couple of players before passing to Joel Ward to net for Palace for the very first time. Yannick Bolasie (left) was in great form to provide two assists for Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon . QPR’s Matt Phillips scored a goal-of-the-season contender with a 40-yard drive in the final 10 minutes, but it was too late and defeat left them four points adrift of safety. Manager Chris Ramsey laid part of the blame on his players, saying: ‘They have realised there are only a certain amount of things you can do in preparation but you have to transfer it in the game. ‘Sometimes I go and watch games and don’t get in until 2am. Sometimes I wake up early and watch a DVD of the other teams. Me doing extra hours is not going to make any difference to them.’","England Under 21 side play European Championships this summer .

"Sunderland owner Ellis Short will decide this week if he needs to sack Gus Poyet to keep the club in the Barclays Premier League. The Black Cats are one place and one point above the relegation zone following Saturday’s humiliating 4-0 home defeat against Aston Villa, in which fans attempted to storm the dugout and thousands more left before half-time. Poyet has vowed to fight on despite one win in 12 and no home goal in more than five hours. Gus Poyet cuts a lonely figure on Saturday as Sunderland are humiliated 4-0 by Aston Villa . Fans show their outrage at the Stadium of Light as the Black Cats slumped to a record of one win in 12 games . Striker Steven Fletcher (right) had his head in his hands as Sunderland crumbled against Aston Villa . However, Sportsmail understands that senior figures at the club, including sporting director Lee Congerton, have told Short that Poyet is the wrong man to take them forward. There is also concern at Poyet’s touchline behaviour - he was sent off against Hull and faces an FA charge for kicking the drinks bucket. Yet only last year he was hailed a hero after masterminding a dramatic relegation survival. Sportsmail looks at the reasons behind the disintegrating relationship. Senior club figures, including sporting director Lee Congerton, say Poyet is the wrong man to keep Sunderland in the Premier League . DUEL AT THE TOP . When Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton set up a deal to bring in Atletico Madrid’s Toby Alderweireld in the summer, Poyet intervened and let the player’s agent know the defender would not figure if he signed. Poyet also blocked a move for Manchester City’s Micah Richards, another Congerton target. A source close to the club said: ‘The relationship between Poyet and Congerton is as bad as it can possibly be. Congerton is doing a good job and is respected within the game but fears his own reputation will be damaged if players he signs are then left on the bench by Poyet.’ Poyet blocked a move set up by Congerton for Atletico Madrid’s Toby Alderweireld, now at Southampton . Micah Richards was also a move that Poyet blocked- now he's at Fiorentina on loan from Manchester City . SLIM PICKINGS . Poyet insists he only chooses the team and that transfers are left to Congerton. The club hierarchy disagree and point to the arrival of Brighton pair Will Buckley and Liam Bridcutt, Uruguayan Sebastian Coates and Argentine Ricky Alvarez as players recruited on the say-so of the head coach. All four have failed to impress and have each started fewer than 10 league games this season. Then there is the £3million signing of Poyet addition Ignacio Scocco. The Argentine was one of the highest earners at the club but left after just six substitute appearances at a £1m loss. Liam Bridcutt (right), along with Will Buckley, Sebastian Coates and Ricky Alvarez, are players signed on the say-so of Poyet but who have disappointed... Not to mention the flop signing of Ignacio Scocco. MIXED MESSAGES . Poyet does not know his best team or formation. He started with four central midfielders in the 1-1 draw at Hull and strikers Connor Wickham and Steven Fletcher are regularly on the left wing. Players were miffed when he suggested publicly they were not good enough to carry out his instructions. He also upset supporters by claiming they were pining for the ‘kick and rush’ days of Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn. Sunderland have drawn 14 matches and the football has been dire, one-paced and unimaginative — they have failed to score in 13 of 29 matches. SPLIT DRESSING ROOM . Poyet believes he retains the support of the players and the likes of Lee Cattermole speak highly of him, both in public and private. Players such as Lee Cattermole (left) speak highly of Poyet, but the dressing room is decidedly split . But several players and members of the backroom team were shocked when, during the FA Cup goalless draw at home to Fulham, first-team coach Charlie Oatway took the team talk. 2 Sunderland have won just two of their past 16 Premier League games at the Stadium of Light — Stoke (3-1) in October and Burnley (2-0) in January. Otherwise it’s seven draws and seven defeats. 4 Gus Poyet’s side have failed to score in four of their past five Premier League home matches. 22 Goals conceded at home this season — more than any other Premier League side. 12 The Black Cats have found the net just 12 times at the Stadium of Light this season — only Aston Villa (11) have scored fewer goals at home. 4 Against Villa, Sunderland conceded four first-half goals at home for the first time in the PL. 204 Shots this season - the fewest in the Premier League. They have also had the most shots (467) against them. Meanwhile, the arrest of star player Adam Johnson on suspicion of sexual relations with an underage girl has been an untimely distraction. WHERE ARE THE KIDS? Academy staff are frustrated that their graduates have played a total of eight first-team minutes this season. On Saturday morning the under 21s were told to stop training and put on standby for a senior call-up. No one was added to the squad and they were annoyed that their session was finished early. BLAME GAME . During last month’s 2-0 defeat at League One Bradford in the FA Cup, 4,000 fans sang: ‘Gustavo Poyet, it’s always our fault.’ After that game, Poyet claimed that building a ‘China Wall’ to keep out journalists would improve his relations with the fans. On the evidence of Saturday’s sorry showing, the majority of fans will be trying to scale the wall themselves if Poyet remains in charge. Fans sang, 'Gustavo Poyet, it’s always our fault,’ during the 2-0 FA Cup defeat at League One Bradford . SUMMER DECISIONS . Poyet will be lucky to see out the season and the chances of him being at the helm at the start of next year are close to zero. Sportsmail understands a management team of Kevin Ball - currently exiled under Poyet’s regime - and Paul Bracewell could take temporary charge. Former player Sam Allardyce is their top target and he would be willing to come in the summer with his contract up at West Ham. Next up for Sunderland? A trip to Upton Park on Saturday before the small matter of a Wear-Tyne derby.

"Lewis Hamilton appreciates fans may get bored of Formula One this season if he and Mercedes are again totally dominant. Ahead of this weekend's season-opening grand prix in Australia there is a feeling Mercedes will start the campaign as they finished 2014 - as the superior team. Last term Mercedes set a new record for number of wins in a year with 16, with current champion Hamilton claiming 11 of those, as well as equalling Red Bull's 2011 haul of 18 poles in a season. Lewis Hamilton poses on St Kilda beach on Thursday ahead of the season opener in Melbourne . The reigning world champion stands with a fan as she takes a selfie ahead of this week's Australian GP . Hamilton was speaking at the first pre-race press conference of the season in Melbourne on Thursday . While there was some relief Mercedes stopped Red Bull's four-year run of title-winning success, should they again blitz the field in 2015 then the already-declining global television audience figures may dip further. Assessing the situation, Hamilton said: 'A year of dominance is a great thing for a team as a whole, but as a racing driver I'm sure the fans will want to see close competition.' Asked if it would be bad for the sport should he win the title by August and whether the fans would get bored, Hamilton replied: 'Personally, I would get bored, but I can only speak for myself. Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg pose in front of the world's media ahead of the first race . Last term Mercedes set a new record for number of wins in a year with 16, with Hamilton claiming 11 . Hamilton speaks to the media next to St Kilda beach in Melbourne on Wednesday . 'If I was a fan watching and the championship was won by then it wouldn't look so good, would it? 'But then it's almost impossible to win it by then, and if you look at most of the recent seasons they've gone down to the last race.' Mercedes, however, were eye-catching over the three pre-season tests as they not only racked up the most laps, but also the quickest, and not even on the best type of rubber available. 'It's a work in progress, but of course it feels great,' said 30-year-old Hamilton, who starts the season favourite to win a third title. 'You know it's great to see all the work that's been put in by the team, and throughout testing it felt really good. Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Hamilton will go head-to-head again for the title . 'Testing is not always the greatest when you're in cooler conditions like in Jerez and Barcelona, but generally it was pretty awesome.' With the second title to his name and a car beneath him that is again going to be the one to beat, you would expect Hamilton to be relaxed heading into the new season, but far from it. Hamilton appreciates, as at the start of the any campaign, the hard work is only just beginning all over again. 'I definitely don't feel I have less pressure,' said Hamilton. Rosberg won the opening race in Australia last season after Hamilton suffered an engine problem . 'The pressure is the same it is every year, but honestly, I didn't arrive at the tests or here thinking, 'Okay, I'm world champion'. 'I'm thinking, 'Jesus, I've got to do everything again, and I've got to actually do it better than I did before'. 'I know everyone else will have taken a step as well, so how do I do that? It's not easy to better a season like last year. 'In terms of performance it was the best year I think I've ever had, but it doesn't mean I can't beat it so that's what I'm trying to do.'","Lewis Hamilton starts the season favourite to win a third title .

"Former Chelsea assistant manager Henk ten Cate has backed Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal to become a success at Old Trafford but insists his fellow countryman needs time. The Dutchman has been criticised throughout his first season in England for constantly tinkering with his side's set up and for failing to get the best out of high-profile players such as Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie. Manchester United, who crashed out of the FA Cup at home to Arsenal on Monday, face a tough battle to qualify for next season's Champions League as just two points now separate the Red Devils in fourth from fifth-placed Liverpool.

Ten Cate concedes Van Gaal's side have been below-par but is confident Van Gaal will be able to turn the club's fortunes around. 'I know him well and he is the kind of guy who doesn't just go for results, he wants his teams to play good football. He has proved that in the past,' Ten Cate told talkSPORT. 'Right now at Manchester United it is not that good. The way they are playing is absolutely not good. But it is not the style of Van Gaal. 'You have to give him time because, for me, he is one of the best coaches there is. I worked closely with him for one year when I was going through the stages to get my coaching licence. I saw what he was doing and the only thing he has to do is get used to the way of playing in England. 'If the owners of the club gave him that much confidence and that much money to spend, it is not a good thing to say goodbye after one season because it is starting to become his team. 'He needs a little more time but I am almost positive that he is going to surprise Britain with his [style of] football.'

"Philadelphia police this morning identified the two brothers who have been charged with the murder of a police officer who was gunned down while trying to stop a video game store robbery. During a press conference held at 11.15am Friday, Philadelphia Police Capt. Darrell Clark named the suspects in the fatal shooting of Officer Robert Wilson III as Ramone Williams, 26, and Carlton Hipps, 30, . Williams had two prior arrests, while Hipps had six arrests and had been out on parole since 2009 following a robbery conviction. The pair of suspects have been charged with murder and attempted murder. Partners in crime: Carlton Hipps (left), 30, and Ramone Williams (right), 26, have been charged with the murder of a police officer inside a Philadelphia video game store . Officer: Philadelphia Police Officer Robert Wilson III, 30 (photographed), died Thursday after being shot in the head during an attempted robbery at a video-game store on the city's north side . Wilson, 30, was in a north Philadelphia GameStop in full uniform buying a video game for his 8-year-old son for getting good grades when the two suspects entered and announced a robbery. Wilson immediately confronted the suspects, and the three exchanged gunfire, with the assailants firing rounds at close range on either side of the officer, Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters. Wilson was struck multiple times in his body but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head, Ramsey said. 'The officer was an out-and-out hero and a warrior,' Captain Clark told reporters Friday. 'He fought to the end.' Wilson's partner, Officer Stevenson, was outside of the store and exchanged fire with one of the assailants. The second assailant fled and attempted to blend in with the crowd but was caught at the scene. One was shot in the leg, Ramsey said, but it is unclear if the assailant was shot by Wilson or his partner. According to police, Williams confessed to the fatal robbery, telling investigators during questioning that he and his brother had thought the GameStop was going to be an easy target. Wilson was rushed to Temple University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6.25pm, NBC reports. Wilson was an eight-year veteran of the department, a husband, and a father of two boys, ages 1 and eight. His older son will celebrate his 9th birthday Monday. GameStop: Wilson was in full uniform inside a North Philadelphia GameStop (photographed) as part of his patrol duties when two armed men entered the store and announced a robbery . Struck: Wilson was struck multiple times but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head (here, Wilson's body is transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office) Procession: A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office . Never Forgotten: Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten' 'Take a moment and say a prayer for this family,' Ramsey said. 'And this 9-year-old boy who will now grow up without a father. A 1-year-old is going to grow up without a dad because of what happened today.' Authorities later found the suspect's weapons in the store: a .40-caliber and a 9mm. Another weapon, an AK-47, was recovered during a search warrant at one of the suspects' home, Ramsey said. In all, over 50 shots were fired during the gun battle inside the video game store. Police say both the suspects were repeat offenders and one was on parole at the time of the shooting. The suspect who was shot was taken to a local hospital but his condition has not been released, NBC reports. Wilson was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting, Ramsey said. However, a surveillance camera in the store captured the incident. The video has been reviewed by homicide investigators. A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office. At the news conference, Ramsey said he met Wilson and his partner when they took part in a recent pilot program in which officers wore body cameras. He described the father of two as a 'very, very brave, heroic individual.' 'People tend to lose sight of the dangers inherent in being a police officer,' Ramsey said. 'Sometimes they're seriously injured or even murdered as a result of trying to protect every single person in this city...He put his life on the line to make Philadelphia a better city and a safer city.' Volunteer: Wilson (left) was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting .

"While Liverpool players are determined to give Steven Gerrard a perfect send off to his Anfield career by winning the FA Cup, there is a growing confidence within the camp there will be life after the iconic captain. Liverpool have won all six of the games that Gerrard has missed with a hamstring injury and the 3-4-3 formation used by Brendan Rodgers has made them look more like the vibrant side that chased Manchester City for the Premier League title last season. They have gone from mid-table to genuine Champions League hopefuls as a result. Steven Gerrard has been back in training ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final against Blackburn . Liverpool have won all six of the games that captain Gerrard has missed with a hamstring injury . Liverpool full back Alberto Moreno (right) believes the team can win the FA Cup for departing skipper Gerrard . Gerrard is in contention to return for Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final against Blackburn Rovers but may find it hard to force his way back into the starting line-up. This season's FA Cup final takes place on his 35th birthday and would be his final match for the club before he joins LA Galaxy. 'It's always sad when someone is injured, you don't wish that on anybody. But I think it is good that we have proved we can succeed without Steven,' said Alberto Moreno, a £12million summer signing from Sevilla and a key member of the new-look side Rodgers is trying to assemble. 'We've moved up the table and been winning matches. It shows that within this squad there are some top, top players to replace even the likes of Steven Gerrard,' said Moreno, a left-back who has been pushed further forward into midfield in recent weeks. 'Whoever is injured, the player who comes into replace them puts themself on the line for the Liverpool cause. The morale and dynamic of the group has been very good. We're playing well and we've proved we can carry on without him. 'I think the new system we are playing has helped us intensify our play even more. It allows us to get lots of bodies forward when we are attacking, but we are safe in the knowledge of having three centre-backs covering as well as the two deep-lying midfielders. 'If we need to lend a hand as well, the wing-backs you can call them, we can drop back and support as well as get forward and support the attack. 'You have to point to the fact we have picked up a lot of victories and points since the system changed, and I guess it does allow us to be a little bit more intense. But it wasn't as if we weren't trying to play with intensity before, we were just inconsistent and dropped points we shouldn't have done.' Of course, Moreno is not dismissing the contribution of Gerrard to Liverpool over the years, and is using the captain's impending departure as an extra incentive to lift a trophy. Fresh from Sevilla, where he won the Europa League last season, the energetic 22-year-old is almost in awe of Gerrard. Moreno (centre) believes FA Cup glory would be a perfect way for Gerrard to finish his time at Liverpool . Gerrard (left) sustained his hamstring injury in Liverpool's 3-2 victory over Tottenham at Anfield last month . Gerrard (left) has lifted the FA Cup twice before as a Liverpool player and is eager to win it one more time . 'It will stick in my memory that I've had a chance to play and train with one of the best players in the world,' he says. 'The Spanish have a word 'crack' to describe a big star, 'Supercrack' means megastar and that is Steven. I have watched him play since I was a boy and now I've had the fortune to not just share a dressing room with him, but to train and play alongside him. He was one of my idols growing up. 'To win the FA Cup would be the perfect present for him, wouldn't it? To be able to leave the club with a trophy under his belt, that would be fantastic for Steven. But not just for him, it would be a great thing for the team and for the fans as well.'","Alberto Moreno wants to win the FA Cup for departing Steven Gerrard .

"Wales coach Robin McBryde has warned fans that attractive and entertaining rugby is low on the agenda ahead of Saturday's RBS 6 Nations Test against Ireland. Recent comments from All Blacks boss Steve Hansen about the game being 'geared towards defences that inhibit attack' have sparked debate around the sport's marketability, with McBryde predicting another war of attrition at the Millennium Stadium. Asked if he expects a feast of running rugby, the 44-year-old said: 'I'm not too sure about that. There is a lot at stake. Ireland are on course for a Grand Slam and just to get away from Cardiff with a win, that's all they will be looking to do. Wales coach Robin McBryde insists that winning rather than attractive rugby will be their main priority . Jamie Roberts (right) in action for Wales during the Six Nations match with France at the Stade de France . New Zealand's Steve Hansen recently suggested that rugby is being geared towards a more defensive style . 'With regards to playing any attractive rugby, that will come second. That's the nature of the game at the moment and that's how teams are wearing each other down and, unfortunately, the spectators have got to pay a price for that.' Wales have beaten Ireland just twice in Cardiff over the last 32 years and McBryde is expecting one of the toughest challenges to date against the championship favourites. 'They are on a bit of a roll at the moment — 10 wins on the bounce,' said McBryde. 'Certainly from the outside it looks a very happy camp. This is quite a formidable Ireland team and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them.' All eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end the visitors' Grand Slam push and keep alive their own championship hopes. They have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from Jonathan Sexton and Conor Murray, with scrum-half Rhys Webb promising not to repeat the mistakes that England made in Dublin two weeks ago. 'I don't know if England did much analysis on them,' said Webb. 'They didn't seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever. We need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error.'

France's Sofiane Guitoune (left) is tackled as he makes a break during Les Bleus' defeat in their last game . It promises to be an intense tactical battle between Warren Gatland and counterpart Joe Schmidt, with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired Ireland lock Neil Francis during the week. Gatland was said to have 'the intellectual properties of a tub of Flora', although Ireland captain Paul O'Connell holds the Kiwi in much higher regard. 'For as long as I can remember we've being trying to poach ideas from Warren Gatland,' said O'Connell. 'We played Wasps with Munster in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an S&C (strength and conditioning) and nutritional point of view. It was a rude awakening. He makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking. 'At the start of the championship, Joe said the Wales- England game was going to be the standard-bearer. Two years ago Ireland beat (Wales) in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against England. 'They'll feel the same thing is happening now.' Wales boss Warren Gatland watches his players in training ahead of the showdown with Ireland . Ireland coach Joe Schmidt talks with fly-half Jonny Sexton during ahead of Saturday's game with Wales . A lot has changed since Paul O'Connell played the first of his 100 Tests more than 13 years ago. Professionalism has been the key to the former shelf-stacker's longevity, although he has not always been surrounded by such healthy company. On the week of his debut in 2002 — against Wales in Dublin — the young and enthusiastic second-row had to share a room with former Munster team-mate Peter Clohessy. 'I was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning,' recalled a laughing O'Connell. 'The Claw' used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up. I was well aware this was not the way forward. 'Obviously it's changed a lot since then. Now in Irish camp I take a lot of advice from (strength and conditioning coach) Jason Cowman. Jonny Sexton is obviously (another) great guy to copy and follow.' As the ball emerges from the ruck, Ireland's Conor Murray kicks it upfield during the match with England .

Ireland's Iain Henderson (centre) braves the challenges of Billy Vunipola (right) and Richard Wigglesworth . Murray brings the ball forward once more against England at the Aviva Stadium on March 1 . Kicking game . In Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton, Ireland have the world's in-form kicking half-back combination. Their aerial game-plan was predictable against England yet Stuart Lancaster did not have the players at his disposable to stop it. Wales, however, have one of the best defensive back-threes in the world and Leigh Halfpenny is a master at limiting the space to kick into. How well Ireland anticipate that — perhaps using Sexton as a looping runner, if the wingers drop back — will be highly significant. Set-piece . At 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in, Luke Charteris of Wales and Devin Toner of Ireland are two of the tallest players in the competition. They are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line-out throw, while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents'. Their long limbs are used to try and steal ball, although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul, where both Wales and Ireland are particularly effective. Picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of Alun-Wyn Jones and Paul O'Connell. Breakdown . Welsh defence coach Shaun Edwards claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area. However, they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against Ireland, who won 23 turnovers to nine against England in round three. Warren Gatland's game-plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and Ireland will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of Jamie Roberts and George North. Getting on the right side of referee Wayne Barnes will be key, because Halfpenny and Sexton are two of the world's leading goal-kickers.","Wales take on Ireland in the Six Nations at the Millennium Stadium .

"England’s experiment of having two coaches fell apart when tension arose between Andy Flower and Ashley Giles over the need to rest the best players from one-day matches. Now, things could be different. There is a strong case for Paul Farbrace, an impressive assistant coach amid the rubble of this World Cup, to be given extra responsibility for limited-overs cricket if England are bold and pick a largely different one-day team when they move on from this disaster. The primacy of Test cricket remains an important principle but there is no doubt it has contributed to the worst World Cup showing of them all. There is a strong case for England assistant coach Paul Farbrace to be given extra responsibility . Farbrace remains a firm believer that England coach Peter Moores (left) will get it right . If England are serious about closing a gap which has become a gaping chasm between them and the best one-day nations, they need to have completely different personnel to the Test team. And Farbrace, who guided Sri Lanka to the Asia Cup and World Twenty20 titles last year, has been a calm and sensible presence here. He remains a firm believer that England coach Peter Moores will get it right - another reason the pair should be able to share coaching responsibilities. ‘It’s unfair that Peter is the one in the limelight,’ said Farbrace ahead of this morning’s dead rubber against Afghanistan. Farbrace talks with Ravi Bopara  as the disastrous World Cup campaign comes to a close . Farbrace guided Sri Lanka to the Asia Cup and World Twenty20 titles last year and is calm and sensible . ‘At the last ICC tournament, I left having been head coach of the team that won it and you take the adulation then. But you also receive the stick when things go badly. We’re all responsible, not just Pete.’ Farbrace also addressed the controversial subject of statistics, adding: ‘When I was with Sri Lanka we had a lot more meetings and looked at stats a lot more than England do.’ England assistant coach Farbrace conducts fielding practice during an England nets session in Sydney . Glenn McGrath has predicted England will suffer another whitewash in this summer’s Ashes.

"Glenn McGrath has repeated a familiar rallying call by predicting Australia will inflict a 5-0 Ashes whitewash on England this summer. The former pace attack leader of Australia's all-conquering Test team in the early 2000s has habitually forecast thrashings for England in the past, and has been embarrassed when Australia have not performed as he expected, notably in the 2005 series. He played a part in Australia triumphing 5-0 Down Under in 2006-07, and again envisaged the same result in England in 2009, only for Andrew Strauss to lead the home side to their triumph. Glenn McGrath has predicted a 5-0 whitewash for Australia when they travel to England this summer . McGrath was a constant tormentor of England in Ashes series during his playing days . Peter Moores' side have suffered a terrible World Cup but will hope to bounce back in Test cricket . McGrath had more recently refrained from trumpeting Australia as unbeatable by England, even prior to their 5-0 demolition job in 2013-14, but that is how he again positions Michael Clarke's Test team. With England toiling to sorry effect at the World Cup, McGrath is looking to the summer and sees more misery on the cards when ousted limited-overs skipper Alastair Cook returns to take the helm of the five-day team. He told BBC Sport: 'If the Australian team keeps playing as they are, they're going to go to England full of confidence. England were knocked out of the World Cup by Bangladesh last week, and McGrath can't see them improving . During his playing days McGrath made a habit of predicting whitewashes, and was not always proved right . 'I can't see England beating them and I'm more than happy to predict 5-0.' McGrath, 45, expects the World Cup debacle to be followed by change in the England camp. He said: 'I thought they struggled to take wickets or build up any pressure and they didn't look potent at all. 'There are going to be changes, whether it's coaching or the players. A lot of responsibility lies with the players.'","Glenn McGrath thinks England will lose 5-0 to Australia .

"West Indies virtually secured their place in the World Cup quarter-finals with a six-wicket triumph over the United Arab Emirates in Napier. The UAE were six wickets down early on, after being put in to bat, but Amjad Javed (56) and Nasir Aziz (60) dug deep to help them post 175 from 47.4 overs. The Windies - even without the injured Chris Gayle - never looked in danger of failing to chase down their modest target, though, Johnson Charles (55) and Jonathan Carter (50 not out) leading the way as they romped to victory from 30.3 overs for the loss of four wickets. West Indies batsman Jonathan Carter waves his bat after reaching 50 runs during the World Cup match . Johnson Charles was also in impressive form for the Windies during the Pool B match . The result left West Indies guaranteed a last-eight berth courtesy of their net run-rate - unless Sunday's other Pool B encounter between Ireland and Pakistan ends in a tie or a no-result in Adelaide. UAE were on the ropes at 46 for six at McLean Park, with none of the top six batsmen managing double figures, but Javed and Aziz helped give the scoreline some respectability. Jason Holder (four for 27) and Jerome Taylor (three for 36) accounted for the UAE top order, as Amjad Ali (five), Andri Berenger (seven), Krishna Chandran (nought), Khurram Khan (five), Shaiman Anwar (two) and Swapnil Patil (six) all fell cheaply. Javed and Aziz shared a 107-run seventh-wicket stand to get UAE back on track, as the Windies failed to fully capitalise on their early superiority.

Their spirited partnership finally ended in the 41st over, when Javed bottom-edged an Andre Russell delivery onto his stumps.

Manjula Guruge accounted for Dwayne Smith (15) and Samuels (nine) within the first eight overs of the response, but Charles and Carter made sure West Indies were always in control. Charles' departure, having scored 55 from 40 balls, left the Windies 109 for three in the 16th over.

"Liverpool face the bizarre scenario of having to wait a month for their FA Cup quarter-final replay with Blackburn Rovers following Sunday's goalless draw at Anfield. UEFA regulations preventing domestic games from clashing with Champions League or Europa League fixtures have ruled out any chance of staging it in the next fortnight, and that is followed by an international break. Cup replays no longer take priority over league fixtures so Liverpool’s game at Swansea next Monday – which is being televised live on Sky – will go ahead as planned, and the FA have agreed with the Premier League and Football League for Brendan Rodgers’ side to meet Blackburn at Ewood Park on April 7 or 8.

Kolo Toure replaced Skrtel and could have won the game but for his header being denied by the post . Liverpool suffered an injury scare on Sunday when Martin Skrtel was knocked out after landing awkwardly in the second minute and was carried off following lengthy treatment on the pitch. Rodgers said: ‘Martin Skrtel is fine but he will go to the local hospital to make sure. If he had his choice, he wouldn’t but we have to follow procedure. ‘He could have played on but you have to listen to the medical team and the experts and he is fine in the changing room. He was walking and talking after the game but as a precaution we need to make sure he is okay.’ Liverpool had a goal ruled out by Skrtel’s replacement Kolo Toure, who also hit a post in the second half, as they struggled to break down stubborn opponents who went close through Craig Conway and Alex Baptiste.

"Tour de France winner Chris Froome has welcomed 24-hour drug testing in cycling. Froome's comments come in the wake of a damning report by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission to address doping in the sport and criticism from Olympic champion Nicole Cooke that the 2013 Tour de France winner was allowed a therapeutic use exemption to compete at the Tour de Romandie last year. 'I for one welcome 24hr testing. It may be an inconvenience but if it can help clean up the sport that I love lets do it,' Froome said on his official Twitter account. Champion cyclist Chris Froome says he would welcome 24hour drug testing in the sport he loves . Froome trains for Team SKY in the mountains of Alcudia, Spain in January . Cooke has called on cycling's governing body, the UCI, to do more to police the 'disturbing grey area' of TUEs and believes Team Sky rider Froome should not have been granted a TUE for a powerful corticosteroid to compete at the 2014 Tour de Romandie after complaining of chest pains. The former Olympic and world road-race champion who retired from cycling two years ago, wrote in The Guardian that UCI president Brian Cookson should apologise to the rest of the riders in the race for failing them. 'I don't think it is at all right that Chris should have the race and prize money taken off him retrospectively, but Cookson needs to issue a very clear message: he should be apologising to the rest of the riders for failing them,' Cooke said. 'That TUE application should not have been approved; Froome and Sky should have had a clear choice of either riding without steroids or pulling out. 'I never found I could be anywhere near the front of a long race when I was ill.' Froome has been criticised for winning the 2014 Tour de Romandie while taking therapeutic drugs . The Sky cyclist's greatest achievement thus far has been winning the 2013 Tour de France . The CIRC report, published on Monday, showed how the culture and previous practices of the UCI allowed Lance Armstrong to cheat, including the retrospective issuing of a TUE to cover up a positive test at the 1999 Tour de France. When the granting of Froome's TUE came to light last June, the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency said procedures had been properly followed. But Cooke feels Cookson should not leave himself open to a situation where he could be accused of favouring a Sky rider - 'the Sky team of which Cookson was a founding board member,' she said. However, Cookson said the rules had subsequently been tightened to ensure all TUE applications went through an independent committee. 'Ms Cooke's accusation is simply wrong,' said Cookson, who since ousting Pat McQuaid as UCI president has overseen the CIRC report that sought to shed light on cycling's darkest days and introduced new anti-doping measures. Former Olympic gold medalist Nicole Cooke has criticised Froome for racing while taking therapeutic drugs . 'I made it a firm pledge that I would separate myself from all anti-doping processes, specifically to avoid any potential conflict of interest, both for me personally and for the UCI in its role as governing body for the sport. 'And I have lived up to that pledge. 'When it came to our attention that we were following an outdated procedure, we looked again at our processes and in order to ensure absolute integrity. 'The UCI confirmed in June 2014 that all TUE decisions must pass through the TUE Committee and be approved by three members unanimously, which is a stronger commitment than what is required by the international standard for therapeutic use exemptions. 'This has added an extra layer of accountability to the decision-making process.'","The 2013 Tour de France winner would welcome 24hr drug testing .

"James Milner's future at Manchester City may not be resolved until the end of the season. The in-demand England international is out of contract at the end of the year and talks have taken place about extending his stay at the Etihad Stadium. However, no deal has been agreed for Milner, who has attracted interest from the likes of City's Premier League rivals Liverpool and Arsenal. James Milner has still not resolved his future at Manchester City with a number of big clubs interested . Milner celebrates scoring for City against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup third round . Sportsmail understands preliminary talks have also taken place with Inter Milan, AC Milan and Roma while two clubs in Spain are monitoring the situation. Milner's first choice remains a contract extension at City. But the 29-year-old midfielder remains unconvinced Manuel Pellegrini can give him the playing time he craves at this stage of his career. Milner is now expected to use the remainder of the season to gauge how much he is needed at the club. The England midfielder would prefer to remain at Man City but is attracting plenty of interest . Milner runs away in celebration after scoring against Leicester City last month . City face a fight to retain their Premier League title from leaders Chelsea and will head to the Nou Camp next week seeking to overturn a 2-1 Champions League deficit to Barcelona. Regular playing time in his preferred position in central midfield at the business end of the campaign may well persuade him to stay in Manchester.

"Pep Guardiola, never satisfied. Despite averaging six goals a game in their last three matches, the Bayern Munich manager has insisted his team must improve their attacking threat. The Bundesliga leaders have overcome their previous opposition 4-1, 6-0 and 8-0 in their last three league games, but after a 2-0 cup win against Eintracht Braunschweig, Guardiola implored his side to improve.

"A Florida man has captured astonishing video that shows an intelligent manatee drinking from a garden hose like a straw. The hose was hanging over the edge of a dock in Miami Beach when the 'sea cow' approached and 'grabbed' onto it with its flippers. It then shoves the end of the hose into its mouth to get its refreshing fill of fresh water, which it requires to survive. Even though manatees are found in salt water, they do not consume it. The large 'sea cow' swims over to the long blue hose in order to get its much-needed fresh water intake . Filmed from the end of the dock, the manatee can be seen in the water below holding onto a long blue hose with its flippers. It takes a drink from it as the video maker, Lawrence Schiffman, tells the people with him: ‘I like how he uses his arm to put it into his mouth.’ The video shows the marine mammal dropping the hose and swimming after it. Debating whether the manatee is a he or she, and deciding to go with the latter, Mr Schiffman continues to give a play-by-play of the animal’s actions. The video concludes with the obviously thirsty marine mammal still clutching onto the hose, guzzling water running from an unidentified source. The manatee can be seen using its flipper to grab the hose before it puts it into its mouth like a straw . Manatees are very large, fully aquatic and mostly herbivorous marine mammals. Studies suggest that they must have some access to fresh water for proper regulation of the salt within their bodies. This means that on average they must return to fresh water every one to two weeks to get their fill. Manatees ingest water through actively drinking as well as eating aquatic plants, and are able to move freely between marine environments.","The 'sea cow' uses its flippers to hold onto the long hose at Miami Beach .

"Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal believes the outcome of the FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal will not just affect the destiny of the venerable old trophy but also the contest for Champions League positions. The Gunners travel to Old Trafford on Monday to defend the trophy they won against Hull City last season with two sides also competing for a spot in the Premier League's top-four.

It is very important game, not only for the FA Cup but also for the [Premier League] rat race.' Van Gaal also paid tribute to the longevity of Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, who has been in charge of Arsenal since 1996. He added: 'In my opinion what he has done is amazing. It can only be in England, I believe, where managers are so long committed with one club. 'It shows how much he can mean for a club as a manager.

"Jordon Ibe is hoping to make a timely return to Liverpool's squad before the end of the season after stepping up his rehabilitation from a knee ligament injury. Ibe was ruled out for six weeks after limping out of the Europa League defeat at Besiktas last month with knee ligament damage. The 19-year-old, who has made a big impression on the first team squad, has only this week resumed running at Melwood. Jordon Ibe takes on Ryan Mason  during the Barclays Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur . Liverpool are already without the suspended Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel while Daniel Sturridge is also expected to be out for three weeks with a torn hip flexor muscle. Asked if he expects to play again this season, Ibe said: 'Yes, hopefully. It was the ligament on the side of my knee and they said I could be out for six to eight weeks, but everything has gone smoothly from here and hopefully I can crack on now and get back in action. 'They (Liverpool) have not said anything to me yet but if I can just keep doing my rehab in the gym and in the swimming pool I can get back to training quickly.'

'Hopefully we can get top four or even higher. Although they have lost a game they are still on a high. We need to keep building from there and picking up points.

"An imposter posing as a former Pakistan cricketer repeatedly conned the BBC into paying him to appear on air as a pundit.

"Aditya Mehta was a surprise home finalist at the inaugural Indian Open but his hopes of repeating the feat were killed off by Ricky Walden on Thursday. The 29-year-old surpassed all expectations in October 2013, when Peter Ebdon, Mark Williams and Stephen Maguire were among his victims, before Ding Junhui inflicted a 5-0 defeat on the Indian cueman in the title match. Nudged back in the calendar to March this season, 50th-ranked Mehta would have longed to put together another decent run in his home tournament, but the figure of world number eight Walden loomed large in the draw. Ricky Walden saw off Aditya Mehta to deny the Indian a repeat success at his home tournament . And International Championship winner Walden came through a 4-2 winner to reach the last 16, where China's Tian Pengfei awaits him. Former world champions John Higgins and Williams advanced, Scotsman Higgins winning 4-2 against Jamie Cope and Welshman Williams with a final-frame break of 127 to fend off one-time Crucible king Ebdon 4-3. Next up for Williams is world number six Judd Trump, who was given a scare by amateur Adam Duffy and was far from persuasive as he edged through 4-3. Trump has been struggling with a shoulder injury and even considered withdrawing from the tournament. Trump said after beating Duffy: 'The shoulder is better than it was in my first match, though it is still not perfect. 'I don't expect much tomorrow, I will just battle like I did today and see what happens. I'm not going to play my best here. I just need to try to be patient because I know I'm going to miss balls that I don't usually miss.' Williams is hoping to hang around in Mumbai - because he is smitten by the local cuisine. Williams said, according to World Snooker's website: 'I've had two curries a day since I've been here. They are the best curries I've ever had, better than anything back home. If my wife asks me next week if want to go for a curry, I'll definitely have to say no.' Graeme Dott, the 2006 world champion, breezed to a 4-0 win over David Morris, with others through to the last 16 including Jamie Jones, Mark Davis, Kyren Wilson, Michael White, Nigel Bond and Chris Wakelin - the 22-year-old Warwickshire potter reaching the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time after a 4-1 victory over Andrew Pagett.","Aditya Mehta made the final at inaugural Indian Open .

"Six weeks after New Zealand and Australia kicked off the 2015 Cricket World Cup on Valentine's Day with explosive wins, the two co-hosts will go head to head in what promises to be a spectacular finale at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The two sides met during the group stage, and it was New Zealand who prevailed that day with a thrilling one-wicket victory in Auckland when Kane Williamson swatted Pat Cummins for a six to the delight of the Eden Park crowd. Ahead of Sunday's trans-Tasman final in Melbourne, Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about both teams. Australia and New Zealand will go head to head in the World Cup final in Melbourne on Sunday . Australia captain Michael Clarke and New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum with the World Cup trophy . The 100,000-seat Melbourne Cricket Ground will host its second Cricket World Cup final on Sunday . Australia advanced to the final with a 95-run win over India at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday . New Zealand beat South Africa by four wickets in a thrilling first semi-final at Eden Park in Auckland . AUSTRALIA . Captain – Michael Clarke . The 33-year-old has not hit top form with the bat during the tournament but showed his versatility against India, shuffling with the batting line-up to bring in the big hitters with his side in a commanding position. Clarke missed the opening match of the tournament against England as he recovered from a hamstring injury, but is hungry to add World Cup glory to his CV as Australian captain. Australian captain Clarke has yet to hit top form after returning from a hamstring injury . Clarke, who will retire from ODIs after the final, practices a training drill on Saturday in Melbourne . Star man – Steve Smith . Having become just the second Australian batsman to make four consecutive World Cup half-centuries after David Boon, Smith finally went on to make a century against India in the semi-final and heads to Melbourne in sparkling form. Smith has spent pretty much all summer raising his bat to the crowd, scoring centuries in all four Test matches against India as well as ODI tons against South Africa in November and England in January. Steve Smith has been in stunning form all summer long, racking up the centuries in both Tests and ODIs . Group A - beat England by 111 runs . Group A - no result vs Bangladesh . Group A - lost to New Zealand by one wicket . Group A - beat Afghanistan by 275 runs . Group A - beat Sri Lanka by 64 runs . Group A - beat Scotland by seven wickets . QF- beat Pakistan by six wickets . SF - beat India by 95 runs . Biggest disappointment  – David Warner . Aside from hitting a remarkable 178 against Afghanistan, Australia’s ‘bad boy’ has failed to fire at the top of the order with his next highest score during the World Cup a paltry 34 (v New Zealand). Fortunately for Warner, Australia's formidable middle and lower order have been imperious, in particular Smith. Reason to be cheerful . Australia are the most successful side in World Cup history having been crowned champions in 1987, 2003, 2007 and 2011. Victory on Sunday would be a fifth title and a third in the last four editions of the tournament. Reason to be fearful . Australia have looked mighty impressive on their route to the final, but there was one blemish on their record - a defeat by Sunday's opponents New Zealand in the group stages. Though the four-time world champions boast a fearsome batting line-up they are susceptible to the swinging ball, as Tim Southee and Trent Boult proved on that day in Auckland. Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist (right) talks to in form batsman Smith . Australia were beaten by one wicket by New Zealand when the teams met at Eden Park in the group stage . Omens . Australia have won eight of their last nine matches at the MCG since January 2011 with at least one of their top-five have scored a century in the winning causes, apart from when Aaron Finch fell for 96 against India this January. NEW ZEALAND . Captain – Brendon McCullum . McCullum’s attacking brand of captaincy on the field and aggressive batting when opening the innings have led many to label the 33-year-old as the best one-day captain currently playing. Brendon McCullum has led New Zealand from the front with his attacking, aggressive brand of cricket . New Zealand practiced at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Friday in preparation for the final . Daniel Vettori (second left) will play his final one-day international for New Zealand on Sunday . Group A - beat Sri Lanka by 98 runs . Group A - beat Scotland by three wickets .

QF - beat West Indies by 143 runs . SF - beat South Africa by four wickets . Star man – Daniel Vettori . While  Boult has swung himself to the leading wicket-taker of the tournament thus far, 36-year-old Vettori has taken 15 vital scalps and is set to play his final one-day international on Sunday in Melbourne. Biggest disappointment – Ross Taylor . The right-handed batsman came into the tournament under pressure and, apart from a half-century against Bangladesh, Taylor has failed to make any substantial impact on the World Cup. Reason to be cheerful . New Zealand have advanced to the final with a perfect record having already beaten Australia in the group stages. Sunday's match marks their first World Cup final having previously reached the semis on six separate occasions and will collect the ICC's £2.68million winning prize if they win in Melbourne. Kane Williamson hits the winning six in New Zealand's one-wicket win over Australia in the group stage . Williamson shows off his football skill during New Zealand's practice session in Melbourne on Friday . Reason to be fearful . The co-hosts have yet to play a match outside of their country in this World Cup and haven’t beaten their opponents in Australia since February 2009 – when they claimed a six-wicket victory at the MCG. Will Boult and Southee be able to swing the ball in Melbourne as they have done in home conditions? And how will McCullum fare with the considerably larger boundaries at the MCG than the ones in New Zealand? Omens . The MCG is not a happy hunting ground for the Black Caps. They have lost 11 of the 16 matches at 100,000-capacity stadium, with one no-result. Kiwi opening bowlers Trent Boult (left) and Tim Southee (right) have been lethal in their run to the final . New Zealand have lost 11 of 16 games at the MCG and haven't played outside of their country this tournament . MELBOURNE CRICKET GROUND . The MCG is one of the finest sporting venues in the world and boasts a capacity of almost 100,000 spectators. The iconic ground was opened in 1854 and is located in Yarra Park, just a short walk from Melbourne's vibrant city centre. Often affectionately referred to by locals simply as 'The G', the stadium hosted the 1992 World Cup final when Pakistan beat England and also hosts the annual Boxing Day Test match, which can attract huge crowds in excess of 90,000. The Melbourne Cricket Ground in Yarra Park will provide a fitting venue for Sunday's showpiece final . Away from cricket, the MCG was the lynchpin of the 1956 Olympic Games and 2006 Commonwealth Games. Nowadays, the venue is home to a number of Aussie Rules teams in the city with multiple matches being played at the stadium every match weekend and also hosts the annual AFL Grand Final. With the annual Australian Grand Prix and the Australian Open tennis in town as well, it's no wonder that Melbourne is the sporting capital of down under. Over 91,000 fans at the MCG for the fourth Ashes Test between Australia and England on Boxing Day in 2013 .

"Part of Real Madrid's abject performance in the midweek 4-3 Champions League defeat by Schalke may have been a consequence of their two most attacking players occupying the same space. Despite securing passage into the quarter-finals with a 5-4 aggregate win, the reigning champions were heavily criticised for their performance at the Bernabeu on Tuesday.

"South Africa skipper AB de Villiers' accomplished showing with bat and ball helped the Proteas to a 146-run World Cup victory over the United Arab Emirates in Wellington. De Villiers underpinned South Africa's innings with a sparkling 82-ball 99 as they reached 341 for six, before taking two for 15 from three overs as the UAE were bowled out for 195 in response with 15 balls remaining. De Villiers surprisingly fell one run short of his century, but will take consolation from having smashed four sixes to take his total to 20 at this showpiece - the most at the tournament - and a record 36 in 21 World Cup matches overall. South Africa captain AB de Villiers (right) inspired his country to a comfortable win against the UAE . The explosive batsman hit 99 for the Proteas as they continued they impressive form in the World Cup . De Villers also took two wickets with the ball at the Wellington Regional Stadium on Thursday . The victory was as comfortable as the margin suggests for South Africa as the UAE slumped to a fifth defeat in as many World Cup games. The Proteas, already through to the knockout phase, set the formidable target after being asked to bat first at Westpac Stadium. De Villiers shared a 108-run fourth-wicket stand with David Miller, after Hashim Amla (12), Quinton de Kock (26) and Rilee Rossouw (43) had departed, and added a further 53 in partnership with JP Duminy. Miller was dismissed one run short of his half-century at the start of the 37th over, bowled by Mohammad Naveed, who claimed figures of three for 63. De Villiers had been let off the hook on 63 when he offered a caught-and-bowled chance trying to go down the ground to Amjad Javed, and looked set to notch his hundred only to slice a wide length ball from Kamran Shazad straight to Javed at short third man. His departure signalled the arrival of Farhaan Behardien, though, and his quick-fire 64 not out from just 31 deliveries kept the South African score racing along. Farhaan Bahardien also shone for South Africa with the bat in Wellington . UAE have lost all five of their World Cup games so far this year and were 45-3 after 12.3 overs . Duminy (23) became Naveed's third victim when he was trapped lbw, but Behardien and Vernon Philander (10 not out) took the total past 300 in an unbroken 49-run seventh-wicket stand. The UAE's long-shot chances of chasing down that total were dealt a heavy blow as they slumped to 45 for three after just 12.3 overs. Morne Morkel led the early charge for the Proteas, dismissing Andri Berenger (five) and Khurram Khan (12) as he took two for four from his first four overs, while Duminy claimed Amjad Ali's (21) wicket in between. Shaiman Anwar and Swapnil Patil put on 63 in a fourth-wicket stand that provided a brief respite, but when Anwar (39) sent Imran Tahir's delivery straight to mid-wicket they began to tumble again. Saqlain Haider (seven) replaced Anwar at the crease, but he only lasted three overs to become De Villiers' first victim of the day, before Javed (five) followed suit soon after to leave the UAE on 125 for six with 15.4 overs left. De Villiers rounded off his display with a simple catch as Naveed (17) top-edged Philander tamely to mid-wicket and the subsequent departures of Mohammad Tauqir (three) and Shazad (nought) meant the UAE fell short of completing their 50 overs. Swapnil Patil wsa the only plus point in the batting display as he passed 50 .","South Africa reach 341 for six off their 50 overs in Wellington .

"Bas Dost must have rung in the New Year in some style. The Wolfsburg striker has been a transformed player since 2014 ticked over into 2015 and just can't stop scoring. Hardly prolific in the first-half of the season, with just one goal to his credit, the Dutchman is now Europe's hottest striker following a sensational run of form. Dost's double in Wolfsburg's thrilling 5-3 comeback win over Werder Bremen on Sunday took his 2015 tally to 13 goals in eight outings. Bas Dost celebrates yet another goal - this time in Wolfsburg's 5-3 win at Werder Bremen on Sunday . The tall Dutch striker jumps for joy after scoring for Wolfsburg against Hertha Berlin last weekend . January 30 - Two goals . Wolfsburg 4 Bayern Munich 1 . February 7 - One goal . Wolfsburg 3 Hoffenheim 0 . February 14 - Four goals . Bayer Leverkusen 4 Wolfsburg 5 . February 19 - Two goals . Wolfsburg 2 Sporting Lisbon 0 . February 22 - Two goals . Wolfsburg 2 Hertha Berlin 1 . March 1 - Two goals . Werder Bremen 3 Wolfsburg 5 . His total is second only to Barcelona's Argentine star Lionel Messi, who has 15 goals in 14 matches since the beginning of January. But arguably Dost's current form is more impressive, given that the Bundesliga only resumed on January 30 following its winter break. Having scored against Cologne in Wolfsburg's last fixture before the winter pause, Dost picked up where he'd left off with two against league leaders Bayern Munich on January 30. He then found the net in the home win over Hoffenheim on February 7, before scoring four in a remarkable 5-4 win at Bayer Leverkusen a week later. The run has continued, with Dost scoring two goals in each of Wolfsburg's matches with Sporting Lisbon, Hertha Berlin and Werder Bremen in the last fortnight. The 25-year-old's prolific form has pretty much sealed Wolfsburg a place in next season's Champions League - though they are eight points behind runaway leaders Bayern, they have a 10-point cushion from third-placed Borussia Monchengladbach. They are also through to a last 16 Europa League tie with Italian giants Inter Milan. Dost's form has also stolen the thunder of Andre Schurrle, who arrived at the Volkswagen Arena from Chelsea on deadline day for a fee of £22m. 'Things keep going, and they're going well,' said Dost after his brace in Bremen. 'Every week I'm here saying that [the goals] will stop again, but I just keep going and we'll see where I am in the end.' Dost's form has ensured Wolfsburg are on course for a Champions League place . Dost celebrates after scoring in Wolfsburg's dramatic 5-3 win at Werder Bremen on Sunday . It hasn't always been so good for Dost. This is his third season in the Bundesliga and by some way his best - he scored 12 in 33 matches in his first season at Wolfsburg, then five in 15 last year. The 6ft 5in target man has prospered from an effective link up with the former Chelsea man Kevin de Bruyne, who has contributed six assists since the Bundesliga resumed in January. Born in the Dutch city of Deventer, Dost's first professional clubs were Emmen and Heracles Almelo, where 15 goals during the 2009-10 season led to rumours of a move to Ajax. In the end, the 20-year-old moved elsewhere in the Eredivisie to Heerenveen and realised his potential with two prolific seasons. In 2011-12, he scored a remarkable 38 goals in 39 matches in Dutch league and cup, finishing as the country's top goalscorer. Dost salutes the crowd at the Volkswagen Arena after scoring in the win over Hertha Berlin . Applying a cool finish to score against Hertha Berlin during the recent Bundesliga encounter . Inevitably, there was interest from the Premier League, with Dost turning down a £7m move to Aston Villa at the time. Instead he moved to the Bundesliga and Wolfsburg, making an immediate impact with a stoppage time winner away to Stuttgart on his debut. Aside from that, his winner at defending champions Borussia Dortmund last season was also memorable. But it is this season that has seen Dost elevate his game to another level. Having started the campaign as Wolfsburg's third-choice striker, he is now indispensible. With his eye for goal, clinical finishing, aerial prowess and ability to hold the ball up, Dost has matured into the complete package, raising plenty of eyebrows throughout the football world.","Dost has 13 goals in eight matches since the start of 2015 .

"England take on Afghanistan on Friday morning looking to finish a dismal World Cup campgain on a rare positive note. Defeats to New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka and, most embarrassingly, Bangladesh, have seen Peter Moores' side crash out of the competition at the first side. But the England coach will hope his team can at least show some spirit against minnows Afghanistan, to avoid going home having only beaten Scotland all tournament. Like England, their opponents have only picked up one win in the tournament and will be going home after this match, but for Afghanistan a win against Scotland was all they could have reasonably hoped to achieve. Beating England would be a major scalp, and raise even more questions about captain Eoin Morgan's side. Realistically, England should be hoping for a dominant win, which might help salvage some confidence even if it comes too late to enable progress in the tournament. But with confidence levels as low as they can be, there is a chance of a defeat which would be even more shocking than Monday's failure against Bangladesh.","England are already out of the World Cup going into final Pool match .

"Ashley Giles is concerned England could end their dismal World Cup campaign with an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Afghanistan unless they give the game their full attention. Giles was England's limited-overs coach when they were knocked out of last year's World Twenty20 in the group stage, ending their campaign with a shambolic loss to associate outfit Holland. The side that day were careless and distracted in defeat having already been ousted and Giles believes a similar story could unfold if England are not focused. Ashley Giles believes England could fall to an embarrassing defeat against Afghanistan . England head coach Peter Moores is under extreme pressure after his side's early World Cup exit . 'Unfortunately we've got a bit of a habit in these games of being a bit dozy and lazy,' said Giles. 'We have to win and we have to be ruthless to do that. 'We wanted to finish well in the World T20 against Holland but we played dozy cricket. 'It's a real banana skin.' Most pundits still make England favourites to see off Afghanistan, but Giles has warned the unfamiliarity of their attack could pose problems for a struggling top order. 'Afghanistan have some good bowlers, with a bit of pace, and they play the game a little differently,' added the Lancashire coach. 'While our players have come up against the big nations a lot - which means they know how it comes out of the hand, the actions, the run-ups - some of these guys are pretty new. 'You can watch videos but it's not quite the same so you can get surprised.'","England face Afghanistan in their final 2015 Cricket World Cup match .

"Captain Eoin Morgan insisted that he would leave the World Cup with 'no regrets' despite England's failure to qualify out of their group. England won just two of their six games at the tournament and only avoided their worst-ever World Cup with a rain-affected nine-wicket success over Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday. 'There are no regrets,' Morgan said. Eoin Morgan speaks to the press following England's victory against Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday . 'Absolutely not. We've given it everything and certainly I have.' England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton has already confirmed a 'major review' will be launched into the failings at the tournament. That had led to speculation some senior players could have played their last one-day international, but Morgan does not think there should be a clear-out as preparations begin for the 2019 World Cup, which will be held in England. 'No absolutely not,' he added. 'We haven't got guys coming towards the end of their careers. I don't see a reason to. 'I think we have the right calibre of squad, guys on the outside need to be banging down the door. 'It's an easy thing to sit here while we are not doing well and say somebody outside the squad is better. Morgan (right) congratulates James Tredwell after he caught out Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi . 'We considered everybody when selecting the squad. I still believe we had the right group of players here.' Coach Peter Moores' position has come under increasing scrutiny after England were blown away by the bigger nations before their tournament was ended by ninth-ranked Bangladesh in Adelaide on Monday. Their only successes came against associate nations Scotland and Afghanistan, with the latter playing at their first-ever World Cup. Morgan nonetheless wants to remain as captain, although admitted that decision is now out of his hands with the ECB to rake over the performances. 'I think there is going to be a review over the next couple of weeks,' he said. 'I can't determine whether I'll still be captain. The hunger is still there to do it. 'I've learned a lot throughout this tournament particularly when things haven't gone so well. You learn a lot about yourself and about the team. Ian Bell acknowledges the crowd after reaching his half-century in England's final Cricket World Cup match . 'Things like that moving forward are crucial.' England will fly home next week where the recriminations have already begun and Morgan feels any finger pointing should be directed at the players rather than the coach. 'I certainly think it's not fair (to blame Moores),' he said. 'All the responsibility should fall on the players. It's our responsibility to perform, particularly when we've performed so badly. 'If there were little things where we couldn't get over the line and games where we competed and little parts of our game weren't right you could look elsewhere. 'It's important that we realise where the responsibility lies.' Australia and New Zealand most significantly exposed the gulf in class between them and England's squad, which contained nine World Cup debutants, and Morgan conceded his team's inability to fight back in adversity was an area of concern. Captain Morgan speaks to Sky Sports after England sealed a comfortable win at the Sydney Cricket Ground . 'When we've performed well we've done reasonably well and when we've been poor we've been really poor,' he said. 'When you have a bad day you have to find some way of scrapping or fighting in order to stay in the game but when we've had bad games we've been out of the game. 'To build on that we need to get our basics right - things like building an innings, creating partnerships and building pressure with the ball. 'When we've been poor we haven't done both of those things.' While England's players might be bracing themselves for their reception back home, Afghanistan coach Andy Moles expects his team to receive a 'warm welcome' to their war-torn country. Morgan (second left) walks off the field with Bell (third left) as rain delays play on Friday . A maiden World Cup win over Scotland stood out as an obvious highlight and they almost pulled of a shock against Sri Lanka. They were just 22 minutes away from sharing the points with England at the SCG, after play resumed following a long rain break just in time to allow the reply to a Duckworth-Lewis revised target of 101 in 25 overs. Ian Bell's half-century ensured the chase was reeled in without too much alarm, but Afghanistan will head home to their cricket-loving fans knowing they came close to finishing the tournament level on points with England. 'I'm sure that they'll be received with huge warmth,' Moles, a former Warwickshire opener, said. England coach Peter Moores is pictured walking off the field after Friday's match in Sydney . 'We all saw the celebrations that happened all around Afghanistan with the win against Scotland. But I think the captain would be the first to admit, as well, we'd liked to have done a little bit better with some of the other games, but that's something we'll work on. 'One thing I can say is that the Afghan players are a very proud bunch of young men that want to do well, not for themselves but for the unification and the message it sends around the world from Afghanistan. 'So I know, I'm sure that when they do get home in two, three days' time that they will be warmly received, and I'm sure they'll enjoy it.'","England failed to qualify from their group after just two victories .

"Nathan Dyer has been told his future lies at Swansea even though manager Garry Monk has left him out of his last three match-day squads. Dyer started the season on fire with three goals in as many Barclays Premier League games and was reported to be in international contention when England manager Roy Hodgson paid a visit to the Liberty Stadium in September. But Dyer's form has tailed off since that blistering start and he is now behind fellow widemen Wayne Routledge and Jefferson Montero in the Liberty Stadium pecking order. Nathan Dyer (left) should stay at Swansea City despite his recent absence from the side, says Garry Monk . The 27-year-old winger has even failed to make the bench for Swansea's last three games against Manchester United, Burnley and Tottenham but Monk explained that was down to him changing his customary 4-3-3 formation to one featuring a midfield diamond. 'These are very difficult decisions for me,' Monk explained. 'Nathan had a fantastic start to the season, he had a little dip and then he came back a bit. 'He has probably been a bit more inconsistent but he has still contributed fantastically to the team. There are no problems whatsoever with Nathan. 'He is one who does deserve to be in match-day squads but unfortunately with the way things are sometimes that isn't always possible. 'The formation we've been playing dictates the bench, you have to look what you need and there are normally three or four players who miss out.' Monk has said it has been difficult to leave Dyer out and feels he deserves to be in be in the match-day squads . Dyer has made over 200 league appearances for Swansea since signing from Monk's former club Southampton in a £400,000 deal in 2009. The Wiltshire-born winger helped the club win promotion to the Premier League in 2011 and has been a consistent performer in the top flight - and Monk insists he still has a big part to play at Swansea. 'I have known him since he was 14 and watched his career, I know him better than probably anyone else in the squad,' Monk said. 'Nathan has contributed a lot this season, he is a fantastic player to work with and someone who is at a very good level. Monk has known Dyer since he was 14 and says he knows him better than any other member of his squad . 'He is a big part of what I am doing here but there are moments within seasons where you miss out. 'We have four good wide players in Jeff, Wayne and Nathan and Mo Barrow coming through, they are all different types who can contribute different things and selection depends on who we are playing and how the players have trained. 'These decisions are never easy - it's probably the hardest part of the job - but I am always honest with the players and I think they respect that.'","Nathan Dyer has been left out of Swansea City's match-day squads of late .

Kyle Lafferty praised his team-mates 'attitude, heart and performance' excellent after their win over Finland . Lafferty told Sky Sports 5: 'It was obviously nervous but we deserved to win the game. 'It was excellent today, the attitude, the heart and the team performance.' The Turkish-based frontman's first goal was an excellent volley on the turn before he nodded in the second, taking him second among his country's all-time leading scorers ahead of Colin Clarke and Billy Gillespie. The Northern Irish front man scores the opening goal during the first half of the Euro 2016 qualifier . And he said: 'Obviously it's all going right for me at the minute and I'm enjoying it. 'The first goal, I decided to hit it first time and luckily it went in. 'But it's down to the team, everyone was excellent today. Although I'm getting the goals and the rewards you have to look at the team performance.' Defender Jonny Evans, currently serving a six-match ban for Manchester United for spitting, was delighted to be able to contribute for his team. Lafferty of Northern Ireland scores with a header to make the score 2-0 at Windsor Park . 'It was great to be out there and especially to get the win,' he said. 'We ground out the result and Kyle scored two great goals. 'It puts us in a really good position going into June, we play Romania here and it'll be a top-of-the-group clash.' O'Neill saluted Lafferty, who now has five goals in five games in this qualifying campaign. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill praised his striker after his two goals in the crucial clash . He said: ""Confidence is obviously a big issue, he had a bit of a difficult year but he's put that behind him, he's playing with a smile on his face and he recognises how important he is to this team. ""He scored two fantastic goals, we emphasise getting the ball in the box with quality and we saw the benefits of that."" Four wins from five games give Northern Ireland an excellent chance of at least finishing in the top three in the group if not the two automatic qualifying places. O'Neill said: ""We're eight (points) ahead of Finland, eight at least ahead of Greece (who play Hungary later on Sunday), we've still got a cushion over Hungary and we have a game in June where a win will take us top of the group. ""We're looking forward to a good week or 10 days with the players and hopefully a similar performance. (Romania) are an excellent team and they top the group so we know we'll have to be at our very, very best to beat them.""","Kyle Lafferty praised his Northern Ireland team-mates after the win .

"Father-of-two Michael Beard, 31, was killed when his bicycle was struck by a school bus just yards from the front gates . A teacher and 'inspirational' rugby coach was killed when his bicycle was struck by a school bus just yards from the front gates. Father-of-two Michael Beard, 31, was cycling to a youngster's rugby tournament when he was struck by a coach carrying pupils he had taught just minutes earlier on Wednesday. Horrified children on the bus were left in tears when they  realised the cyclist lying in the road outside Lincoln Christ's Hospital School was Mr Beard. The popular teacher, who was also a coach with the RFU English Touch Association, had led a Touch Rugby class at the school just minutes before the fatal collision. Parent Jan Thomas, 34, whose two sons attend the 1,400-pupil school, said: 'It was a horrible thing to happen to someone so wonderfully popular with the children. 'Apparently when the accident happened some children on the bus rushed to the back and one boy who had just been taught by Mr Beard knew straight away it was him. 'It was a terrible thing for the children to witness.' The bus, operated by P.C.Coaches, collided with Mr Beard at a junction outside the Lincolnshire school, but the bus driver and passengers were not injured. Headteacher Martin Mckeown said: 'Understandably, the whole school is shocked and devastated. 'Mr Beard was a popular and dedicated member of staff who was committed to helping and motivating children to play rugby. 'He was on his way to a school rugby tournament when this tragedy happened. 'We are still coming to terms with this tragic loss and we are working in partnership with the police, Lincolnshire County Council and the Red Cross to support both students and staff. 'Our heart-felt thoughts and condolences are with Mr Beard's family.' Friends and colleagues have now paid tribute to the married father-of-two who was nominated in the Coach of the Year category in 2014. The 'inspirational' rugby coach had led a Touch class at the school just minutes before the fatal collision . Tributes have flooded in from pupils, colleagues and friends and flowers have been laid at the site of the collision in Lincolnshire . Marc Rhodes, marketing and events officer for Lincolnshire Sport and a friend of Mr Beard, said: 'We are devastated to learn of Michael's tragic passing. 'Mike was a true gentleman who always had a smile on his face and his enthusiasm and dedication to sport and the community was as infectious as it was inspirational. 'Mike worked tirelessly to support the development of Touch Rugby in the county and played a huge role in bringing the finals of the England Touch Series to Lincoln this coming summer. 'Our condolences go to Mike's friends and family and all those who were inspired by his personality and his passion for sport. He will be sorely missed by the whole sporting community.' His aim was to form a competitive team to play at a national level and aid the regional development of touch rugby. Horrified children on the bus were left in tears when they realised the cyclist lying in the road  was Mr Beard . He was  a coach with the RFU English Touch Association and had been nominated in the Coach of the Year category in 2014 . A Facebook tribute page was also flooded with messages from parents and pupils. Tee Cook, whose daughter had been taught by the coach, wrote: 'RIP Mr Beard, from what my daughter said you were a one in a million teacher and she will miss you, thoughts are with your wife and beautiful children god bless you xxxx' Student Mark Wilkinson, said: 'R.I.P.so sad just wont be the same without him there, thoughts are with his family xx' Mr Beard, who lived in Lincoln with wife Nicky, 32, and their children Ella, six, and two-year-old Jack, also worked as a nightclub doorman in the city. Operations manager Chris Shore said: 'He was a really nice guy, a gentleman, family man and would do anything for anybody. 'Michael had been at the club since it opened three-and-a-half years ago, usually working four nights a week. The bus collided with a cyclist at a junction yeards from the front gates of Lincoln Christ's Hospital School . A fund set up to help support Mr Beard's family has reached more than £5,000 and hundreds of tributes have been left at the scene of the crash . 'He was really genuine, very popular with both customers and staff. 'You really couldn't wish to meet a nicer bloke - he always had a smile on his face.' Sergeant Jason Baxter, of Lincolnshire Police, said: 'There were passengers on the bus and the coach driver were not injured.' A fund set up to help support Mr Beard's family has reached more than £5,000. Sergeant Jason Baxter, of Lincolnshire Police, said: 'Tragically, the cyclist has lost his life as a result of the collision. 'He is a local man and his next of kin have been informed.'

"Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen has urged Harry Kane NOT to play for England Under 21s this summer. Kane is set for his first senior call-up later this month for the games against Lithuania and Italy. But the plan then is for Kane to drop down back into the Under 21s for this summer’s European Championships in the Czech Republic. Harry Kane is likely to be included in England Under 21s European Championship squad in the summer . Jan Vertonghen (right) believes the striker should stay at home and instead prepare for next season . Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has already warned the FA he wants talks with the FA before giving them his blessing to call-up Kane this summer. And Vertonghen, who played in the tournament in 2007, says the 21-year-old, who has played 41 games already this season, should skip the tournament in preparation for next season. The Belgian said: ‘It’s difficult for me to judge. Of course England want him. He is a brilliant striker and he can be the main man, but I think he needs his rest for next season. Kane rounds Rob Green in the Queens Park Rangers goal to double Tottenham's lead on Saturday . The striker has been in terrific form and continued his goalscoring run with two goals at Loftus Road . ‘It’s his call and I know a player always wants to play but sometimes you have to be careful. It’s a difficult one because last season I played with injuries, but sometimes you just can’t. You have to think about what’s going to come. 'It’s his decision and it’s a totally different situation from when I played in 2007. Did that benefit my development as a player? It’s hard to tell. ‘I enjoyed playing for my country because I never played international football at youth level. ‘So that was my first tournament as a Belgium player and I enjoyed it. It was in Holland and I played in Holland for Ajax at the time, so for me it was brilliant.’ Ross Barkley is another player whose club are considering asking if the young player can be left out . Barkley has not played for the Under-21s since winning his solitary cap in a 6-0 win against Scotland in 2013 . In another blow for Under 21 head coach Gareth Southgate, Everton want Ross Barkley to be given a summer of rest and hope he will not be included in the squad. Barkley has not played for the Under 21s since winning his solitary cap in a 6-0 win against Scotland in August 2013, as he has been a regular in Roy Hodgson’s senior squads since then. However, Barkley is a player Southgate would want to consider. Everton, however, are anxious about how Barkley’s form has fluctuated this season and would prefer the 21-year-old to spend the close season recharging. Everton are anxious about how Barkley’s form has fluctuated this season and his injury record . Barkley suffered a significant setback at the start of this campaign by damaging his knee ligaments . Barkley went to the World Cup last year and suffered a significant setback at the start of this campaign, when damaging his knee ligaments that led to him spending eight weeks on the sidelines. The explosive nature of Barkley’s game has been missing in recent months and the statistics he has been producing in games have not matched the levels of 12 months ago. That is why Everton believe Barkley’s development would be best served by him being given the opportunity to completely rest in June and July before returning refreshed for pre-season. Everton manager Roberto Martinez and Southgate have an excellent work relationship and it is expected they will speak in the coming weeks.","Harry Kane is to lead England Under 21s in the European Championships .

"Brendan Rodgers was left to bemoan a series of penalty decisions which went against Liverpool as they were held to a 0-0 FA Cup quarter-final draw by Blackburn. The Reds boss felt his side could have been awarded two spot-kicks in a keenly-contested tie at Anfield in which the Championship side defended tigerishly to secure a replay at Ewood Park. Rodgers told BT Sport after the game: 'They defended very, very well and when you have that many bodies behind the ball - and they were very brave, got blocks in - and I thought we should have had a penalty. Brendan Rodgers looks on frustrated during Liverpool's goalless clash with Blackburn on Sunday . Rodgers (middle) and counterpart Gary Bowyer greet the crowd ahead of the FA Cup clash at Anfield . The Reds boss had cause for concern after defender Martin Skrtel was taken off on a stretcher early on . Kolo Toure (left) hit the back of the net for the Reds in the first half but his strike was ruled out for offside . 'In games like this sometimes in that opening 20 minutes, if you can get the first goal, it opens the game up. 'Adam Lallana's one looked a clear penalty. The defender is recovering back in, but he's on the wrong side and he can't get to the ball, so for me, that was a penalty. 'You could argue when [Rudy] Gestede handballs it off the header from the free-kick, we could have had another penalty, and sometimes you need that little bit of luck. 'They have got some good players - Gestede gives you a problem up front - but I thought in the main, we dealt with that really, really well. 'I thought maybe the sharpness was just missing from our game and that wee bit of incision. But credit to the players, they kept a clean sheet and the objective was to be in the hat for the next round by the end of the evening, and that's what we are in.' Simon Mignolet (centre) made a superb save to tip an Alex Baptiste header away in the second half . Blackburn defender Matthew Kilgallon (left) insists Liverpool did not deserve a penalty for this challenge on Reds striker Daniel Sturridge during the second half . Liverpool attacker Adam Lallana (right) was also denied a penalty after tumbling from a challenge by Kilgallon . Gerrard did not play due to injury, but fans are desperate to get to Wembley in his final season at the club . Rovers skipper Matthew Kilgallon was quick to insist the home side did not deserve a penalty for his challenge on dangerman Daniel Sturridge. He said: 'No, no, no, no. You have got to be tight to him. You give him a yard and he's got that shot with no back-lift. Maybe when I did give him that yard, he has got the shot off. 'You have got to be tight to these players and that's what I was.' Things might have been worse for Liverpool had it not been for a fine 49th-minute save by keeper Simon Mignolet to claw Alex Baptiste's header out of the top corner.

"John Terry has admitted he is fighting for his family’s financial future as he waits for Chelsea to activate a one-year contract extension.

Hopefully I have a few years left but if this is my last year then I hope I will go out on a bang.’ Terry also revealed he will retire at the top and will not play at a lower level, or for another team, when he leaves Stamford Bridge. Terry said: ‘The manager came in, sat me down, and made it clear that if you work hard you will get extra years and you will play, but if not there are other players who are younger who can play and will fight for their place. This is a year roll-on. I am fighting for myself and my family, and to prove people wrong.

I have my little target to play next year but beyond that, two or three years.’ The defender also ruled out a return to the England team despite calls for him to come out of international retirement. ‘No (I won’t return),’ he said. ‘It’s the simple answer.

"Lewis Hamilton has been busy during the off-season, parading on red carpets and awards ceremonies in suits and hats of an extravagant flavour. But for all he has enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the glitzy set, tweeting trysts with his ‘brothers’ from the worlds of music, film and fashion, the Formula One season will open in Melbourne’s Albert Park a week today and Hamilton’s attention is turning to emulating the man he counted as a hero before he had ever heard of a rapper. For last year’s championship victory, his second, put Hamilton one behind the late Ayrton Senna. Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes GP poses at the unveiling of the new W06 at the Formula One winter tests . Brazil's racing driver Ayrton Senna gives a thumbs up after he won the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix . Mercedes’ pre-season dominance indicates that the 2015 season will be another straight title fight between Hamilton — of Stevenage, Tewin Wood, Monaco and LA — and his team-mate Nico Rosberg. ‘The only landmark as a kid was watching Ayrton,’ said Hamilton, who, as a nine-year-old karter hid behind his father’s car so his dad would not see him cry when he learned Senna had died at Imola. ‘He had three titles and, even though I don’t really look at numbers and records, I always said that I wanted three; to match Ayrton. So if I have a third world championship, I would feel closer to him, although it was another era. I don’t think anyone is as good as him, but it would still be a nice feeling.’ There are echoes now of Senna’s era: the Brazilian’s rivalry with his McLaren team-mate Alain Prost, the cerebral Frenchman, went into a second season, just as Hamilton’s is with Rosberg. Senna won the title in 1988, but lost to Prost in 1989. So could Hamilton succumb to Rosberg, a steelier competitor than his blond, Euro-chic image once suggested? The answer would seem to lie in Hamilton’s own performance. If he drives to his potential, his natural talent will surely win him the title. But, as ever, he could be buffeted by emotional vulnerabilities. We remember 2011 when, pained by his split from singer-songwriter girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, his form suffered badly. This winter he again split from Scherzinger. Will that have an impact on his psyche? Hamilton has again split with former Pussycat Dolls singer-songwriter girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger . Hamilton and singer  Scherzinger attend the GQ Men of the Year awards at The Royal Opera House in London . Is he spending too much time flying from the States to Europe, a question given impetus when he missed a day’s practice with a fever? Or are such questions an insult to a focused sportsman who, anyway, should not be begrudged the lifestyle his success has bought him? ‘Last year I adapted,’ said Hamilton, 30. ‘I had a mental attitude that was impenetrable. I feel that I still carry that mentality and, while it has not been easy (splitting from Scherzinger), I don’t think it’s going to be a problem. I feel as if I’ve got enough in place to do what I need to do and be the best I can be.’ Hamilton drives his new car on F1 testing day in Barcelona in late February for the season preview . More potential turbulence lies in his contract situation at Mercedes. His three-year deal expires at the end of the season and he is negotiating his own terms, having dropped Simon Fuller as his manager. He wants parity with the highest earners on the grid, led by Ferrari new boy Sebastian Vettel, whose deal is worth 50million euros (£36m). Hamilton, who is careful with his money, as even his father has joked, has surprised Mercedes bosses Niki Lauda and Toto Wolff by how painstakingly detailed he has been in negotiations. ‘We’re in the final stages,’ revealed Hamilton last week. ‘I don’t know what the timelines are and we’re not rushing. Getting it done before or after Melbourne does not matter. I’m not sure I’ve enjoyed it, but it’s been an experience. If I’d gone through my whole career and not done something like this I’d have always wondered if I could or couldn’t do it. The reigning world champion poses for a picture with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg . ‘I’ve tried to do my due diligence and understand where we are and where it can grow to benefit the team and myself. We’re not in a discussion where I’m saying after winning the championship “I want this”. You can ask Toto. Naturally, the target for every driver is to try to work towards being the benchmark.’ While Hamilton has noticed the presence of a few more photographers in his life, Rosberg has kept a low profile since missing out on the title in Abu Dhabi. He is said by a close associate to be ‘mega-relaxed’, and declared in the German press that he knows he can win the title. He has devised a new breathing technique for high G-force corners, in which he previously stopped inhaling. His new method will help keep his concentration high for a longer distance, or so the theory goes. Former McLaren driver Hamilton poses for a picture in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris donning shades . What about the rest of the field? Williams, Ferrari and Red Bull are expected to fight closely for the other podium places. As for McLaren-Honda, they have endured a pre-season horribilis: unreliability and lack of pace compounded by an unexplained injury to perhaps the best pound-for-pound driver in the world, Fernando Alonso, who will miss the Australian Grand Prix after hitting his head in an innocuous-looking testing accident in Barcelona a fortnight ago. He can sit back and watch the race in the early morning of his Spanish Sunday. Just like everyone else, it seems, he will be helpless to stop the Mercedes machines.

"Enner Valencia is out of West Ham’s trip to Arsenal after treading on a broken cup at home. And the bizarre injury to Sam Allardyce’s £12million summer signing leaves the Hammers boss with just one recognised striker fit to face Arsene Wenger’s side. When asked how his frontline was shaping up, Hammers boss Allardyce admitted: 'Well there is one but it's not really an injury in terms of an accident, which is Enner Valencia. Enner Valencia (centre) will miss the Barclays Premier League clash against Arsenal on Saturday . Valencia, pictured in action against Chelsea, has been ruled out after treading on a broken cup . 'He had an accident at home and has cut his big toe quite severely on a broken cup and that's been stitched. 'We're not exactly sure [how long he is out for] but we think it will be too soon to be considered for this game. 'So a freak accident at home is something that we didn't expect and these are the things that seem to happen.' Valencia has struggled to make an impact with just five goals in 30 appearances since his move to east London. Valencia, challenging Gary Cahill for the ball in West Ham's defeat against Chelsea, has struggled this term . Sam Allardycwe has come under growing pressure at West Ham after a disappointing run for the Hammers . But he could still have anticipated featuring heavily in the Hammers' run-in with Andy Carroll expected to be out until the end of the season after undergoing surgery to repair torn knee ligaments. Carlton Cole is also out of Saturday’s London derby as he steps up his training schedule in a bid to return from a hamstring strain. So it means Diafra Sakho is the only frontman available to Allardyce at The Emirates as his side try to get back to winning ways after going through their five games in February without a victory. 'Of course [Valencia] being one of our few strikers that were available, it's a big blow for us,' Allardyce added. Here Sportsmail looks at other unusual injuries which have kept footballers out of action over the years. RICHARD WRIGHT: Wright was ruled out of Everton's FA Cup fourth-round replay at Chelsea after suffering a freak injury during the warm-up. Wright ignored a notice warning him not to practice in the goalmouth and promptly fell over the sign, suffering a twisted ankle. The same player also damaged his shoulder falling through a loft as he was trying to pack away his suitcases. RIO FERDINAND: During his spell at Leeds the England defender managed to pick up a tendon strain in his knee watching television. Ferdinand had his foot up on a coffee table for a number of hours and ended up injuring a tendon behind his knee. SEAN FLYNN: The then Kidderminster captain suffered a broken nose, busted lip and bruised toes after tripping over his son's toy cars. DAVE BEASANT: The veteran goalkeeper managed to rule himself out for eight weeks in 1993 when he dropped a bottle of salad cream on his foot, severing the tendon in his big toe. DAVID JAMES: The England goalkeeper once pulled a muscle in his back when reaching for the television remote control and the keen angler also tweaked his shoulder when trying to land a monster carp. ALEX STEPNEY: In 1975 the Manchester United goalkeeper Alex Stepney dislocated his jaw while shouting at his defenders during a match against Birmingham. CHIC BRODIE: The Brentford goalkeeper's career came to an abrupt end in October 1970 when he collided with a sheepdog which had run on to the pitch. Brodie shattered his kneecap while the dog got the ball. ""The dog might have been a small one, but it just happened to be a solid one,"" he reflected. SANTIAGO CANIZARES: The Spain goalkeeper missed the 2002 World Cup after accidentally shattering a bottle of aftershave in his hotel sink. A piece of glass fell on his foot, severing a tendon in his big toe. ALAN WRIGHT: The diminutive former Aston Villa full-back strained his knee by stretching to reach the accelerator in his new Ferrari. He subsequently swapped the sports car for a Rover 416. SVEIN GRONDALEN: The Norway defender had to withdraw from an international during the 1970s after colliding with a moose while out jogging. KEVIN KYLE: The Scotland and Sunderland striker missed a game having scalded his testicles and thigh whilst attempting to feed his eight-month-old son, who kicked a jug of hot water over his father whilst sat on his lap. ALAN MULLERY: The England star missed the 1964 tour of South America after injuring his back while brushing his teeth. DARREN BARNARD: The former Barnsley midfielder was sidelined for five months with a torn knee ligament after he slipped in a puddle of his puppy's urine on the kitchen floor. LEE HODGES: The then Barnet player slipped on a bar of soap in the shower and wrenched his groin. KIRK BROADFOOT: The Rangers defender scalded a cheek when an egg he had poached in the microwave blew up and squirted hot water into his face. The Scotland international was treated in hospital but managed to not let his egg error rule him out of any games. CHARLIE GEORGE: Arsenal's 1971 FA Cup hero managed to cut off his toe with a lawnmower. DARIUS VASSELL: The then Aston Villa striker missed several games after he drilled through his toe nail with a home power drill thinking it would relieve the pressure on a swollen toe. The attempt at DIY surgery succeeded only in giving the toe an infection which required medical attention.","Enner Valencia will miss  Emirates trip after suffering bizarre injury .

"Winston Bogarde has claimed that Chelsea never asked him to take a pay cut on his £40,000-a-week salary and the club also wouldn't send him out on loan for anything less than 100 per cent of his wages being paid during his ill-fated spell at Stamford Bridge. The Dutch defender joined Chelsea in 2000 but rarely featured for the first team during his four-year spell in west London. Bogarde was signed when Gianluca Vialli was Chelsea boss, but the Italian was sacked within a week to be replaced by Claudio Ranieri. Winston Bogarde spent four years at Stamford Bridge but hardly featured in Chelsea's first team . Despite his lack of playing opportunities, Bogarde honoured the contract and continued to collect his £40k salary from the club. But, in an interview with the Guardian, the 44-year-old said he was never asked to take a pay cut and Chelsea wouldn't loan him to another club unless they paid all of his wages. 'No, they didn’t try that,' Bogarde replied when asked whether Chelsea considered cutting his wages. He added: 'Vialli bought me and when I had been there a week he got sacked. You have to look who the new manager’s going to be and if you’re still going to get a chance. Bogarde was signed under Gianluca Vialli, who was replaced by Claudio Ranieri (right) within a week . 'They had to cut costs. My situation was not very good and we tried to solve it many ways. Like to maybe go on loan or sell me, or whatever. But in the end it didn’t work out. 'A club could not pay my whole salary (for a loan deal), they could maybe pay 70 per cent. And they asked Chelsea to pay the other 30 per cent and Chelsea said: ""No. If you want to take him it’s going to be 100% or nothing. He is going nowhere"".' 'Of course. For a player, for me, it’s terrible not to play. Yet I had to return for training.

"Steven Fletcher thanked Scotland manager Gordon Strachan for standing by him after he ended his goal drought with a hat-trick against Gibraltar. Fletcher had only scored one goal in 19 internationals before hitting a treble in Scotland's 6-1 European Championship qualifying win at Hampden.

Steven Fletcher celebrates after having scored just one goal in 19 internationals before hitting this treble . There was speculation that Strachan might start with Jordan Rhodes against the Group D minnows but the Scotland boss maintained confidence in Fletcher. 'It meant a lot that he stuck with me, but that's the way he is,' Fletcher told www.uefa.com. 'The gaffer's made a point of standing by the guys who've got us to this position and saying that, whatever anyone else says, he knows we're good players. I'm delighted to have repaid a bit of that faith.' Fletcher's only previous international goal came in a 2-1 World Cup qualifying victory over Iceland six years ago but he is now the first Scotland player to score a hat-trick since Colin Stein hit four against Cyprus in 1969. Fletcher headed Scotland back in front in the 29th minute after Lee Casciaro had stunned the hosts by nodding home a 19th-minute equaliser after finding space round the outside of the home side's three-man defence.

'I feel my game's about more than goals but you know as a striker that people don't judge you on how many times you link up play, but on how many you score,' the 28-year-old said. 'So I was conscious of the fact it had been so long. That said, my confidence genuinely hasn't been dented. You just enjoy these days when they come along, and they don't come much better than scoring a hat-trick for your country. 'I only realised after the match that I'm the first Scottish player to do that in so long. That was a shock. I wondered if Shaun might get there first, but a few of the lads came up after my second and said: 'Go on, make sure you get the match ball'. 'You'd have seen from my celebrations how much the goals meant to me, especially the first. That seemed to take an age to go in.'

"Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill praised the self-belief of his players after seeing them fight back to snatch a vital Euro 2016 qualifier draw against Poland. Ireland looked to be heading for a damaging defeat as the Group D encounter ticked into injury time with the Poles within touching distance of three more points to add to the 10 they had reaped from their opening four games. However, O'Neill's men summoned up a final push to rescue a point when substitute Shane Long prodded home a 91st-minute equaliser to make it 1-1 and ensure that the spoils were shared at the Aviva Stadium. Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill praised the self-belief of his players after their draw with Poland . Ireland nicked a point after they looked to be heading for a damaging defeat in the Group D encounter . Asked what the message had been at half-time after a distinctly ordinary 45 minutes by his team, O'Neill said: 'Just keep self-belief, that's really important, really important. 'We felt we had not done ourselves justice in the first half. But you have got to keep self-belief, that's really important for the side. 'That was the message, 'Know that you are still in this game, that we can do better, much better, we can improve'. We'd given away a really soft goal from our viewpoint, it put us on the back foot for a while, but we definitely could do it. 'The players rose to the occasion, which was great. That self-belief was really important. Poland, it's a great point away from home as far as they're concerned, but we are still well in it.' Ireland created little of note before the break and found themselves trailing to Slawomir Peszko's 26th-minute opener after he capitalised on an error by makeshift full-back Robbie Brady. But the home side rallied after the restart and after Brady and Robbie Keane had both hit the post, Long struck at the death to level it. Shane Long runs away in celebration after scoring the equaliser for his team in the Group D qualifer . Long is congratulated by John O'Shea (right) as Republic of Ireland snatched a hard-earned point . It may not have been the victory the Republic craved to propel themselves back into the hunt for automatic qualification, but it was not the defeat O'Neill had admitted in advance would cause a 'big dent' in their hopes. Nevertheless, they will entertain Scotland in June sitting in fourth place in the group, still three points behind the Poles and two adrift of Germany and the Scots. Poland boss Adam Nawalka was disappointed to have seen two points wrenched from his grasp, but happy enough with a scoreline he believed was fair. He said: 'Overall, I believe the result was a fair scoreline. We played a very good first half and maybe lacked a bit of quality, but overall, we are content with a draw. 'Three points were really close, but one point is also a good result. It's no surprise that Ireland came back to score an equaliser because the other results show that they know how to play to the end and get a result in their favour at the end of the game.' O'Neill's men summoned a final push to rescue a point when substitute Long scored a 91st-minute equaliser .","Republic of Ireland drew 1-1 with Poland in their Group D encounter .

"As the scorer of Gibraltar’s first-ever competitive goal, it was little wonder that history-maker Lee Casciaro felt like a Rock star when he left Hampden Park on Sunday night. However, as the 33-year-old Ministry of Defence policeman would later reveal, he was not the first man from the tiny British overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the National Stadium. If the outstanding memory of the 2002 Champions League Final for most people remains Zinedine Zidane’s exquisite volleyed goal, in Gibraltar it was the sight of local businessman Joe Beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a Real Madrid strip. Gibraltar's players celebrate after Lee Casciaro scored their first ever competitive goal on Sunday . Beriro would later appear on Gibraltar’s version of Strictly Come Dancing, before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye. His place as the most famous man in Gibraltar now passes to Casciaro after criminal defending by Scotland allowed the cop to race clear, fire low past David Marshall and utterly stun Hampden. For the striker, all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of Zidane by scoring a goal to remember in Mount Florida. Casciaro (centre) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in Gibraltar . ‘It was a Gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his Madrid shirt in that Champions League Final in 2002. I remember that well,’ he beamed. ‘It was just a dream come true for me to score that goal. It’s unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for Gibraltar. ‘I don’t think I will get a hero’s reception when I get home. We still lost the game – but it is still an achievement to get the goal. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba celebrates the goal at Hampden Park, which levelled the score at 1-1 . ‘We have only just joined UEFA and started to train on a football pitch. All my life, we’ve been training wherever we can, running on the road, or for 90 minutes a week on a seven-a-side pitch. ‘Even two or three years ago I didn’t think I would be playing for Gibraltar because I didn’t think we would get into UEFA. Everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day. ‘This goal is something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I knew it was going in as soon as I hit it. It was a great feeling. ‘I swapped my second shirt with Ikechi Anya but I kept my shirt from the first half. I am going to put it up in my house! But I’m hoping there are more goals to come for me in future.’ Casciaro (right) vies for the ball with Scotland's Ikechi Anya, who he later swapped shirts with . Despite ultimately losing 6-1 to Gordon Strachan’s side, Casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions of those who have labelled the minnows little more than a pub team. ‘I would think we have shown that we are not,’ he said. ‘We are improving and we do try to play football, which is not bad considering we have only just started and were drawn in the most difficult group. We try to create a good game for the spectators to watch.’ Last June, the first-ever winning goal scored by the British overseas territory - with a 30,000-population comparable with Wishaw - was slotted home in a 1-0 friendly win over Malta in Portugal. That night the history-maker was Kyle Casciaro, Lee’s brother, who was an unused substitute on Sunday. A third brother, Ryan, played in defence for Gibraltar at Hampden in front of proud parents Henry and Helen. Lee Casciaro's brother Ryan, who also plays for the national team, shares a joke with Steven Fletcher . ‘I’m keeping it in the family,’ smiled Lee. ‘My mum and dad watch us home and away and they were here today. We have to go to Faro in Portugal to play our home games, but they have always been there for us. It is thanks to them that we are here. It is a dream for them to have three sons playing at a high level. I don’t think that happens very often in the world of football to have three brothers in an international squad.’ With the benefit of having played all the Group D teams now, Casciaro feels that Scotland and Ireland – who meet in Dublin in June - will be in a battle for third place behind Poland and Germany. ‘Germany are the world champions and Poland are a very strong and physical team,’ said Casciaro, who jetted off to Paris on holiday after Sunday's game. ‘I think it is between Scotland and Ireland to finish in third spot. The Sunderland man was Scotland's hat-trick hero as he netted the country's first hat-trick since 1969 . ‘I thought we showed a good reaction after falling behind. And I thought the Scottish fans were a bit apprehensive when we equalised. ‘But Scotland’s second and third goals killed us. We aren’t professionals and to try and maintain that sort of level was very hard for us. ‘But our manager Davie Wilson was very proud of us afterwards. And I think the whole of Gibraltar will be proud as well.’","Scotland beat Gibraltar 6-1 at Hampden Park on Sunday afternoon .

"Fernando Torres' last return to Anfield was met with boos from the Liverpool crowd when he was in a Chelsea shirt but the Atletico Madrid striker will be hoping for a different reaction on Sunday. Picked by Steven Gerrard to play up front in the All-Star charity game against Jamie Carragher's side, the Spaniard will partner Luis Suarez. Torres struck up a close relationship with the Liverpool captain during his days at the club and he's excited to be returning for this special occasion. Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres (centre) is excited to be returning to Anfield for the All-Star game . Speaking to Liverpool's club website he said: 'I'm really looking forward to meeting some of my old team-mates, especially Stevie. I'm sure it's going to be a great day and night for him. And also to meet Liverpool fans again; many times I have been back to Anfield as an opponent, but this time I'm going like part of the home team. It's going to be a really emotional day for me.' The Atletico player says he's fully behind the cause and is looking forward to helping Gerrard out. 'My first reaction was: 'Of course I will be there. I will do anything I can, anything in my hands, to be there with Stevie on that day.' The Spaniard had an incredible few seasons at Liverpool and became one of the best forwards in the world . Liverpool fans will be drooling over the prospect that two of their best forwards in recent years will be partnering up and Torres admits he can't wait to play alongside Luis Suarez. He said: 'I saw what Luis did in his time at Liverpool and it was amazing, just amazing. Luis is a good friend - we have a good relationship and good friendship. We were sitting together for two days at Melwood when I was leaving and he was coming. 'We made good friends and we are still in touch now. I also know what it means to him to go back to Anfield and play there again. It will be great to play up front with him, especially with Stevie G behind us.' The 31-year-old's move to Chelsea didn't work out and he was booed on his last return to the club . In his previous returns to Anfield, Torres was greeted with a chorus of boos - with some fans still upset after he moved to Premier League rivals Chelsea. But the 31-year-old was quick to play down the boos and praised Liverpool's fans. He revealed: 'I will say to everybody that what the media says about the relationship between Liverpool fans and me after I left was not the reality. Everybody knows the kind of reaction Liverpool fans had when we met on the street in London or when I went back to Liverpool - everybody gave me thanks for everything I did in Liverpool. Torres could feature up top alongside his friend Luis Suarez who left the club for Barcelona in the summer . 'That is what I feel for them. For me, Liverpool fans are always going to be different; I had probably the best period of my career wearing the red shirt and all my memories are great. I have nothing bad to say about them and I never will - they treated me like one of them and I felt at home in my time there. 'It is going to be amazing going back; hopefully the reception will be better than the one I had when I went with Chelsea. But it doesn't matter what happens really. Liverpool fans are part of my heart and my feelings - everything I felt when I was a Liverpool player is inside me and no-one is going to take that away from me.' Steven Gerrard (right) and Torres struck up a friendship during his time and are still in contact with eachother . He soon became a Kop hero after his move to Merseyside and Torres would love to score in front of the fans once again - and admits he wouldn't hold back. 'If I could do that, I would celebrate like if I was scoring in a Liverpool shirt,' he said. 'There are many memories, nice memories - great nights, great games, many goals scored in front of the Kop - and they made me feel like I could fly. I'm sure if I could score a goal, I can remember that kind of situation and try to enjoy it and celebrate like it's an official game.' Torres and Gerrard formed a formdiable partnership and relationship on the pitch, which Torres hasn't forgotten - labelling the captain as the best player he played with. The Liverpool captain was described as the best player Torres has played with during his football career . 'I can't wait to play with Stevie again. I just wanted to have the chance to play with him, even if it is just one last time. No-one knows if it is going to be the last time, but be sure that I am going to enjoy it. 'I have said many times that Stevie is the best player that I have played with - by far. He was a big influence for me as a player; I had one career before I started playing with him and one career after I played with him. He changed my game and changed my motivation and ambition. 'He made me feel that I could really do whatever I wanted. For me, he is going to be the best forever, so to have the chance to play with him on a special day like it is going to be on Sunday, is a privilege. I want to be there on Sunday and be on the pitch with him.'","Fernando Torres returns to Anfield for the All-Star Charity game against Jamie Carragher's side .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was the only person who thought Steven Gerrard should not start against Manchester United, says Paul Scholes. Gerrard was on the substitutes' bench until half-time at Anfield on Sunday, and was sent off after just 38 seconds of coming on for stamping on Ander Herrera. Scholes feels it could have been a different game had Gerrard started, and that being a substitute only added to his frustration leading up to his red card.

Gerrard is shown a red card by referee Martin Atkinson on a frustrating afternoon for the club captain . Paul Scholes feels Gerrard should have started and that being a substitute only added to his frustration . 'Should he have started the game? Of course he should,' Scholes wrote in his column for the Independent. 'There was only one person who can have thought that Gerrard was not right to start against Manchester United at Anfield in a must-win game for Liverpool, and that was Brendan Rodgers. 'United were brilliant in the first half, but if they had been up against Gerrard then it might have been different. 'He had the frustration of not playing in the game, and then he had to watch a first half in which none of his team-mates even made a tackle. It is not nice to stand on the sideline and see your own team getting destroyed at home to a big rival. 'I can see what he was trying to do when he came on: put a few tackles in and get the crowd going. But even when you can feel the emotions rising in you, the most important thing is control. I got sent off a few times in my life but I never lost my head. I mistimed tackles and I made mistakes.'

"Nicola Adams' hopes of making a successful defence of her Olympic title in Rio next year could rest on a potential showdown with domestic rival Lisa Whiteside in Liverpool next month. Adams and Whiteside have both confirmed entries in the flyweight division at the English national championships from April 24 to 26.

Nadal has reached the final of the Miami Open four times without lifting the trophy . Nadal, who has reached four Miami finals but never held the trophy, initially thought the ankle injury might keep him from playing. 'In the beginning, I thought that was going to be the end of the tournament,' Nadal said. 'I am confident I'm going to be ready.' Nadal spent more than an hour practicing on Tuesday, even with his ankle bothering him. He consulted with his personal trainer as well as ATP trainers, who agreed the injury wasn't severe and didn't require an MRI or X-ray.

"Winston Reid has expressed his delight at signing a new contract with West Ham and said their imminent move to the Olympic Stadium was a big factor in his decision. The New Zealand defender put pen to paper on a six-and-a-half-year contract worth £60,000-a-week. And the 26-year-old, who had been linked with moves to Arsenal and Tottenham with his contract expiring in the summer, is pleased to have his future tied down. Winston Reid has agreed a new six-and-a-half-year contract with West Ham . Reid had been linked with a move at the end of the season to either Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal . He told fanbookz.com: 'Obviously I'm absolutely delighted to have signed a new contract with West Ham. I've enjoyed my time here, and I just needed to make sure that the decision was a right one for me and my family. 'There were a lot of factors that I took into account when I was making my decision, but most importantly I felt that I was valued at the club - we will be improving in future seasons and I really feel at home here. 'With regards the decision that I've had to make, I had to be sure that it was going to be a place that I was going to be for the next few years of my life, so I have to feel at home and I feel welcome here. I enjoy living in London and my family is settled so that was the most important thing I had to think about.' Reid took his time in making a decision but clearly feels his future lies with the club having made 27 appearances across all competitions this season. He added: 'It might have been frustrating for the fans to have it drag out for so long, but whenever I've been asked this question over the past few months it's just been when we've been negotiating. 'You don't sort something out in the course of one day, there's always got to be some sort of give or take when doing these things. 'There was no big drama towards it, and there was a lot of stuff in the press that was misleading with regards to my situation, but the main thing is that now we've got it sorted. 'Both the club and I were keen to do something, and I'm happy to be staying here. Speaking to the chairman it was clear that the club is on the up, we've been getting better this year but we were realistic about the club and where it's at currently - there's a lot that we can still improve on, and that was the main thing.' Reid went off after just eight minutes of West Ham's defeat by Chelsea on Wednesday with an injury . Reid has been at West Ham since 2010 after joining from Danish club FC Midtjylland . West Ham currently sit tenth in the Premier League standings following a vastly-improved campaign in contrast to the travails of Sam Allardyce's side last year. Reid said: 'As long as we all work hard to improve ourselves each day we will get better, and that was the main objective - we want to get the club further up the league and I'm sure that we will in the coming years.' Reid joins James Tomkins and Mark Noble in signing new deals at West Ham. 'For James Tomkins and Mark Noble they've been here all their lives. I've not been here quite as long as them, but come the end of this contract I will have been here for a fair bit. 'It's nice for them to be here and I'm looking forward to the next six years of my life. With the club, I’m looking forward to exciting times ahead and hoping to be a big part of it. 'I came here in a sticky period – the first year we got relegated, but since then it’s gradually got better. The team has improved, the organisation as a Club has improved as well and we need to do that if we want to go places. “I’ve grown massively over that time too. Coming here five years ago I was only a young kid, but now I’m kind of a Londoner I guess! It’s a second home for me and I’m delighted.' The New Zealand international had his time on the pitch against Chelsea on Wednesday curtailed after eight minutes with a hamstring issue but with 10 days off before the Hammers' next game, he does not expect to miss too much action. 'It's just one of those things with the injury. I had it a little after Crystal Palace and unfortunately it flared up again. It's just part of the game I guess,' Reid said. 'We've got some time to recover now, which is much needed.' Reid also spoke of his excitement in playing at the Olympic Stadium. Reid fights for the ball with Tottenham striker Harry Kane during the recent match at White Hart Lane . 'Moving to the Olympic Stadium was a big factor for me in staying at the club, but it wasn't the deciding part of the deal - it was just one of many positive points. I'm looking forward to playing there, and it's going to be a massive opportunity for us as players and fans of the club to move to such a great facility. 'The deciding factor for me really was where I felt at home and how settled I felt with my family - I am happy here at the club and I wasn't going to stay here if I wasn't happy - it took a bit of time but I'm glad we got there in the end.' Reid joined West Ham from Danish club FC Midtjylland in 2010 and has made 121 appearances for the club.","Winston Reid has signed a new six-and-a-half-year contract at West Ham .

"John Terry has revealed he is still haunted by the memory of his penalty miss that cost Chelsea a first Champions League title against Manchester United in Moscow almost seven years ago. The Chelsea captain took what could have been the decisive penalty at the end of a 1-1 draw in the first ever final between two English clubs, but slipped on the run-up and hit the post to send the shoot-out into sudden death. Nicolas Anelka went on to miss Chelsea's seventh spot-kick to hand United a domestic and European double, but Terry's miss is still seen as the decisive and iconic moment at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. John Terry says he is still haunted during the night by his penalty miss in the 2008 Champions League final . The Chelsea captain slipped on what could have been the decisive penalty against Manchester United . United goalkeeper Edwin van der Saar celebrates in the Moscow rain as Terry crumples to the ground . And having cried on the pitch during the post-match ceremonies, Terry says he still wakes up at night thinking of what could have been with regular flashbacks to his slip. ‘I’ll definitely never be over it,' he said. 'I still wake up in the night now and it’s like “s***”, it’s there and then you go back to sleep. 'It’s eased over the years for sure. But I still have a few times a year when I wake up and, bang, it’s on my mind. It’ll never go. It’s one of those things, it’s disappointing, and I was gutted at the time.' Terry admits that while he has begun to get over the pain of the memory, it still comes back to him at night . Terry stands back on the half-way line with his team-mates to watch the rest of the penalties in Moscow . There was little time for Terry to get over his horror moment in May 2008, with the Chelsea centre back called up to the England squad for a friendly against the USA almost immediately after the final. Terry scored in a 2-0 win at Wembley against the Americans but still ranks the build up to the game, spent with United players Wes Brown, Owen Hargreaves, Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney, as one of the worst times of his career. ‘The worst thing was, we had England the following week, we played USA at Wembley and I had to go and sit at a table with all the Man United players,' Terry told a Chelsea Pitch Owners dinner this week. Terry had to endure a week on England duty with United players including Rio Ferdinand (second left), West Brown (centre) and Owen Hargreaves (second right) who he had played against on that night in Moscow . The Chelsea and England captain scored in a 2-0 win against the USA a week on from his penalty miss . 'I was just sitting there fuming. I didn’t want to be there. It was a horrible time for me.’ Chelsea did eventually go on to be crowned European champions after beating Bayern Munich on penalties in the 2012 final, but Terry was suspended after being sent off the semi-final second leg against Barcelona. Terry lifted his knee into the back of then-Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez and was shown the red card that ruled him out of the showpiece at the Allianz Arena - but he still ranks the final as one of his best footballing moments. Despite not playing in the final, Terry was lucky enough to win the Champions League four years later . Having been sent off in the semi-final second leg, Terry had to watch on from the stands at the Allianz Arena . 'It was probably the worst 120 minutes I've sat through,' Terry said of the final. 'It is horrible because you want to do something, you want to make something happen, but for me, it's still the best night of my life with Chelsea. 'It goes back to Moscow, with that I wasn't meant to be part of that. I feel part of it, I played a lot of games before that but I think for me, not playing, it was meant to be. I wasn't meant to play, we were meant to win. That was it, as simple as that. 'And for me that was the most pleasing thing, to see Chelsea win the Champions League after what happened in Moscow ticked a box for me and definitely made those sleepless nights easier.'

"Phil Jagielka has warned Everton team-mate Ross Barkley that he will have to wait patiently for a place in England’s midfield. Barkley was still only 19 years old when he made his England debut in September 2013 and set pulses racing with some of his performances for Everton last season which earned him a place at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil. But this campaign the 21-year-old has struggled for the same kind of form and, despite winning 10 England caps already, does not currently appear to be in Roy Hodgson’s first-team plans. Barkley has been played in multiple positions for club and country and Everton manager Roberto Martinez has experimented the most with him out on the wing, as an attacking central midfielder or further back in the middle. Ross Barkley may have to wait for his chance to impress with England, according to team-mate Phil Jagielka . Jagielka spoke on Wednesday about his club team-mate's progress in what has been a difficult season . The Everton skipper said he believed Barkley would have to bide his time and wait for an opportunity . ‘I think Ross will have to bide his time,’ Jagielka, who is his club captain, said. ‘And when he does get the opportunities for England, keep playing the way he has, keep playing well, keep being positive and hopefully when he gets that chance to play in two or three games on the spin, that is his chance keep the shirt and make it much harder for someone to take it off him. ‘It is difficult with the position he would try to get in the team in. We have got a fantastic amount of midfielders that come away with England and quite a lot who want to play in a similar position.’ One player almost certain of a starting place in the crunch games is goalkeeper Joe Hart. After being dropped by Manchester City earlier in the season, he has worked his way back into guaranteed first pick. Barkley has had a difficult season with Everton after a brilliant breakthrough campaign last year . That season resulted in a World Cup call-up, and Barkley looked a bright spark against Costa Rica . Earlier in England's group, Barkley congratulates Wayne Rooney after coming on against Uruguay . That culminated in his stand-out performance against Barcelona, in which Lionel Messi described him as ‘phenomenal’ even though he could not prevent City going out of the Champions League. Jagielka, Barkley and the rest of their Everton team-mates watched the match in Kiev ahead of their Europa League tie. ‘We were pretty much laughing at the performance from Joe,’ Jagielka revealed. ‘It was just one of those nights. ’It is sometimes difficult to get the accolades when you're at a big team. It is normally the people scoring the goals and things like that, but when Joe is needed he normally comes up trumps with some fantastic saves or some fantastic decisions in games.' Jagielka said he was 'laughing' at Joe Hart's performance against Barcelona in the Champions League . Hart was in brilliant form to repeatedly deny Lionel Messi and co at the Nou Camp in last week's second leg .","Ross Barkley was part of the England squad for last summer's World Cup .

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has had his players training at Selhurst Park in the hope of exploiting a set-piece advantage over Queens Park Rangers in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off. Palace’s home form this season is the second worst in the Barclays Premier League, with bottom-side Leicester City the only club worse than them on home turf. The Selhurst Park pitch has been re-laid twice this season, and with Pardew admitting the surface ‘isn’t perfect’, he has called his players into the stadium that they face QPR in on Saturday to practice their dead-ball routines. Alan Pardew admits Crystal Palace have been training at Selhurst Park ahead of their match against QPR . Since taking over at Palace, Pardew has helped take the south London club up the Premier League . ‘Our home form is something that we’re focusing on,’ Pardew said. ‘Really, we’ve done enough to stay in the division away from home already but our home form doesn’t reflect what it should be. ‘Our stadium needs to be rocking tomorrow and if we want to keep it where it is in terms of that support, you’ve got to give them wins. ‘We’re a good set-play team so we’ve been getting used to the co-ordinates here and the environment to make sure our set-plays are on the money tomorrow. QPR will be desperate for points at Selhurst Park on Saturday lunchtime, after seven defeats in their last eight . Chris Ramsey has endured a difficult start to life in the managerial hot-seat at Loftus Road . ‘This new pitch is good, but it’s not perfect. The Premier League pitches don’t really get relaid during the season, they’re perfect, so it’s very unusual for us to have to do that. I can’t say it’s as good as Arsenal’s, Swansea’s or Newcastle’s, because it isn’t.’ And Pardew sees Palace’s game against QPR as being more important for the visitors than his side, even though he admits both are still in a relegation scrap. ‘It’s an important game,’ he said. ‘Probably more important for QPR than us, with where they are, those three teams down the bottom (QPR, Burnley and Leicester) really need a quick win to get them in touch again so it’s a huge game for them – probably must-win. Palace's away form has been impressive, but Pardew admits they need to improve their fortunes at home . The Selhurst Park pitch has been relaid twice this season, and is not as impressive as other top flight clubs . ‘For us, we just need to make sure we pick up points or pick up wins when we can and we’ll be ok. We have a cushion at the moment but it can be easily eroded with a defeat tomorrow so we need to make sure that we’re on our metal.’ Palace, with 30 points, are currently eight points clear of third-bottom QPR but Pardew still believes it will require a further 10 before his side are sure of staying up.","Crystal Palace face Queens Park Rangers at Selhurst Park on Saturday .

"Newcastle United legend, former England captain and national treasure Alan Shearer spent his illustrious football career terrorising the best defences in the Premier League - and it all started just earning a weekly wage of £25. With a record-high 260 goals in the Premier League, the talismanic forward has left a lasting legacy in the north east and one that is unlikely to be bettered.

All the girls wanted to go out with me!' MY FIRST … Pay packet . Alan says: 'It was when I was an apprentice at Southampton, I was on a YTS scheme and it was £25 a week, straight into my bank account!' Shearer started his career at Southampton before moving to Blackburn and winning the Premier League . MY FIRST… Car . Alan says: 'It was an Escort 1300 L, registration number B993 XHT. It cost me £3,395. I thought I was rich. I thought I was a multimillionaire 'cos I could go out and buy it when I was just 17! I cleaned it every day. If I ever got mud on it I was devastated.' Shearer's first ever car was the Ford Escort 1300 L which was similar to the car pictured above . MY FIRST … pre-match meal . Alan says: 'My first pre-match meal was fillet steak. I'd never had it before in my life and everyone else was having it, so I thought I'm going to have it too!' The former Blackburn star revealed that a fillet steak was his first ever pre-match meal as a footballer . MY FIRST… hat-trick . Alan says: '1988. It was my debut for Southampton at 17 against Arsenal. And then I was in the next day cleaning the kit because I was still an apprentice. I didn't think that was a great idea at the time but looking back it made sure I didn't get carried away.'

"Newcastle United hotshot Adam Armstrong scored the winner as England's under 18s beat Switzerland in a behind-closed-doors friendly at St George's Park. Armstrong popped up three minutes after half-time, firing home at the second attempt after Swiss goalkeeper Gregord Kobel blocked an initial one-on-one attempt. But Neil Dewsnip's team missed several good chances and the coach will hope they are more clinical when the two sides reconvene at Walsall's Banks's Stadium on Saturday. Newcastle United striker Adam Armstrong scored the winner as England's under 18s beat Switzerland . England coach Neil Dewsnip would be disappointed that England wasted a number of chances . It was a strong side that lined up at the England headquarters in Staffordshire, with Chelsea's Dominic Solanke, Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo and Everton's Ryan Ledson among the players on show. Dewsnip also handed international debuts to Sheffield United midfielder Louis Reed and Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman. And Norman was almost involved inside the first minute when Swiss forward Neftali Manzambi burst through, only to be denied by a last-ditch challenge by Manchester City's Tosin Adarabioyo. Gradually, England asserted themselves and Solanke, who trained with the first team the other day, was inches away from turning home a low Ojo cross. Ojo, the Liverpool prodigy currently out on loan at Wigan Athletic, was denied by Kobel shortly afterwards having been slipped clear by Solanke. The pressure was relentless and Reed, keen to make a positive impression, curled an effort just wide of the post after Southampton man Josh Sims and Armstrong combined to tee him up. Chelsea forward Dominic Solanke featured for England in their win at St George's Park . The busy Kobel was again tested in the dying seconds of the half, tipping Ojo's header over the crossbar following more good build-up work from Armstrong and Everton defender Jonjoe Kenny. After Armstrong finally made the breakthrough, England were able to relax a little but they continued to create chances at regular intervals. Ojo fired over the bar after more good work from the lively Armstrong and Kobel was called upon to deny Solanke, who made his Chelsea first-team debut earlier this season. Armstrong could have added a second after finding himself in an identical situation to his goal but on this occasion the goalkeeper saved. Tammy Abraham, who has featured in Chelsea's run to the FA Youth Cup final, came on for Solanke and nearly claimed his first England goal late on, only to fire inches wide. England play Switzerland at Walsall on Saturday (5.30pm). The Liverpool starlet Sheyi Ojo also featured in the friendly match at England's Staffordshire headquarters .

"Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland has signed a contract extension at the Britannia Stadium, the Barclays Premier League club have announced. The 22-year-old - who will be England's third-choice keeper for this month's games against Lithuania and Italy - has committed until the summer of 2019. Asmir Begovic remains Stoke number one but Butland, who joined the Potters from Birmingham for £4million two years ago, is a key part of manager Mark Hughes' plans. England Under 21 goalkeeper Jack Butland has extended his contract with Stoke until 2019 . Chief executive Tony Scholes told the club's website, stokecityfc.com: 'I'm delighted that Jack has decided to extend his contract with us. He's a player that Mark Hughes holds in very high regard and (England manager) Roy Hodgson's decision underlines his standing in the English game. 'Jack is a very ambitious young man and wants to play first-team football on a regular basis for Stoke City. 'There's genuine competition for the goalkeeping spot at the club with Asmir Begovic, Jack and Thomas Sorensen, and Jack has made no secret of his desire to be our number one.' Butland, pictured in action against Rochdale in the FA Cup, has struggled for playing time this season . Butland will link up with England Under-21s during the forthcoming international break but will be elevated to the senior squad if Joe Hart or Fraser Forster suffer injury. Butland has made just seven senior first-team appearances for Stoke, with five this season in domestic cups. He also had a loan spell at Derby earlier in the campaign while he spent time at Barnsley and Leeds last season.","Jack Butland is England's third-choice keeper in Roy Hodgson's squad .

'Obviously the boys like the beach, like the heat, but as soon as the decision was made we embraced it and it has been a very pleasant experience for everyone. We've tried many different things. 'We already have a great team spirit and this trip came to emphasise that and take the stress and mind away from the pressure we have every week so I think that was achieved, now we come back fresh for the 10 next finals. 'The coach's idea was the air's good, it helps recovery. Lying on a sunbed maybe isn't the best thing at this time.'

"Rangers shareholders are working on plans for a new £10million rights issue before the start of next season. Sportsmail understands leading investors, including the Three Bears consortium of Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor, are prepared to put more cash into the club in return for new shares. And Dave King and other existing investors are expected to follow suit. The Three Bears loaned the club £1.5m on an interest and security-free basis this week to end any prospect of drawing down a second £5m advance from Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct. Dave King (right) and other Rangers investors are planning a £10m rights issue before start of next season . Rangers promised to utilise the cash until a ‘medium to long term’ funding package could be formalised. And discussions have already begun on a rights issue in July which would see existing shareholders pledge a sum of between £10m and £14m in return for new shares in the club. Sources insist chairman-elect Dave King will participate in a rights issue, which will also be open to the fans’ groups, after interim chairman Paul Murray confirmed the South Africa-based businessman had opted out of this week’s short-term loan while he seeks to convince the SFA and financial regulators he is a fit and proper person. Rangers are seeking a new Nominated Advisor willing to approve King’s appointment as a director following 41 convictions under South African tax laws. Failure could lead to the club being delisted from the AIM stock market. Interim chairman Paul Murray confirmed chairman-elect King had opted out of this week’s short-term loan while he seeks to convince the SFA and financial regulators he is a fit and proper person . It’s understood the Three Bears and other influential shareholders would prefer the club to remain listed but will invest more money in any case, calculating that a sum of between £10m and £14m could meet the club’s needs over the next two seasons and meet the doomsday scenario of Stuart McCall’s side spending another year in the Championship. Scotland striker Steven Naismith, meanwhile, has refused to rule out a future return to Ibrox if the club return to the Premiership. The circumstances of his departure in 2012 caused ill feeling, but Naismith – a first pick at English Premiership Everton – insisted: ‘I don’t know what will happen in the coming year never mind the future. Everton forward Steven Naismith refused to rule out a move back to Rangers in the future . Naismith trains ahead of Scotland's friendly with Northern Ireland at Hampden Park on Wednesday . ‘At the moment I love playing for Everton. Since I’ve been there it’s been a great adventure, from being a substitute and not having an impact to playing in most of the big games and having an impact. ‘I love it at the moment but, you never know, things can change so quickly in football. I’d never rule anything out to be honest.’ Backing the decision of the new Rangers regime to appoint Scotland assistant coach Stuart McCall as manager, Naismith said: ‘It was one of the best decisions the new board could have made. ‘I worked with him here with Scotland. He’s great around the squad, he’s straightforward even in this environment when he’s not the manager. He’ll still tell you: “It’s not good enough.” ‘I think it’s a great decision and hopefully from now until the end of the season he can reap the rewards of going in there and getting Rangers back to the Premier League.’","Investors prepared to put more cash into Rangers in return for new shares .

"Linford Christie has revealed his torment at perceived police racism when he was at the height of his athletics career. Christie, 54, is the subject of an ITV4 documentary on Tuesday, which offers a rare insight into the psyche of one of Britain’s greatest but most controversial sportsmen. He recalls two alleged racist incidents, the first shortly after he won a gold medal at the European Indoor Championships in 1986. Linford Christie, now an athletics coach, has spoken of allegedly racist treatment at the hands of policeman . ‘I remember when I got my Great Britain tracksuit, I was so proud,’ he said. ‘I walked along Shepherd’s Bush, this policeman started saying, “What’s a n***** like you doing in a British tracksuit?” 'I went into a chip shop and came out of the shop, and he jumped me, twisted my arm behind my back, and arrested me. The next day they dropped all charges. It was just so stupid.’ Another time, he said, police refused to believe he was the owner of a sponsored car and arrested him. Christie claims to have been arrested by a 'racist' policeman after winning the European Indoors in 1986 . ‘A couple of days later the police dropped a letter which said, “You don’t need to come back any more, we’ve made our enquiries”. ‘I said, “I still want an apology”, and they totally refused.’ Christie threatened court proceedings and the police eventually apologised.

"There will come a point on Sunday when those on The Kop will look out and see a dream from bygone days has become reality. Steven Gerrard will take possession from Xabi Alonso and look up to see Fernando Torres, Luis Suarez and Thierry Henry spinning off defenders, desperate for his pass. How potent would Liverpool have been had those five men lined up in their prime? Unique circumstances will allow fantasy to become reality for 90 minutes but it will be Liverpool the city, rather than the team, that feels the benefit as Anfield stages an All-Star match that has created enormous interest, for many reasons.

Torres could feature up top alongside his friend Luis Suarez who left the club for Barcelona in the summer . How will Torres be received four years after his £50million move to Stamford Bridge? What kind of reception will Chelsea captain John Terry be afforded? How much will Suarez’s return stir the locals’ senses of what they have been missing? Gerrard will captain his side against a team selected by his friend and former vice-captain Jamie Carragher and the proceeds from the match, which sold out in hours, will go to a number of charities in Liverpool, as well as Alder Hey Children’s Hospital. The idea came about after Gerrard approached Liverpool and raised the prospect of staging a match to say “thank you” to the club and the city before he embarks on a new challenge with LA Galaxy.

Xabi Alonso has also confirmed that he will be a part of the novelty all-star game for friend Gerrard . ‘It's going to be a great occasion,’ Gerrard said. ‘When I made the calls and told the players they would play in front of a full house at Anfield, they loved the idea. Jamie and I shouldn’t get any credit: it's credit to everyone who wants to come and help out. ‘I know all those who are involved. They are winners and it will be a great game. John Terry could easily have said “no” but it shows the type of guy he is.’ Carragher added: ‘When I spoke to Thierry Henry, he was more excited than I was!

"Sometimes I think the Premier League clubs have to remember in which country their fantastic product is played. You can already sense there is reluctance to FA chairman Greg Dyke’s suggestion that we increase the number of home-grown players in a squad from eight to 12. We will never know if our players our good enough unless they get the chance and there are still people at Premier League clubs reluctant to take that risk.

And Bale said: ‘I don’t need to answer the critics. I know, and everyone around me knows, what I can do. ‘There are ups and downs in football, you have to take it with a pinch of salt and all you can do is respond with your performances on the pitch, like that. ‘I don’t feel I need to prove anyone wrong or right, I just need to play my football.

The Baggies were unbeaten in their four league matches and kept clean sheets in three of them as they beat Swansea and Southampton and drew at Sunderland and at home to Burnley.

"Out of Europe, out of the FA Cup and on the verge of being out of the Premier League title race, this was the first of nine games Manchester City simply could not afford not to win. Operation siege mentality kicked in shortly after the final whistle of Wednesday's Champions League exit at the hands of Barcelona when Joe Hart faced the cameras in the Nou Camp tunnel. 'I will never give up, ever, and I could safely say that nobody in our dressing room will ever give up either,' said the defiant goalkeeper. Wilfried Bony celebrates after scoring Manchester City's first goal after 25 minutes at the Etihad Stadium . The Ivorian opened his account for the club when he spun inside the box before firing into the net . Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes his side are capable of catching league leaders Chelsea . 'West Brom is a huge game and we turn our focus to that. We have no excuse not to throw everything at the Premier League now and give our all - to the fans, the owner, to everyone.' His under-fire manager sang from the same hymn sheet in his programme notes. 'It's not impossible for Chelsea to drop six points,' Manuel Pellegrini wrote. 'We have to continue to believe. 'It is nonsense to suggest there is nothing to play for.' The message spread to the home support. They like being the underdogs here (remember last season?) and from the off the masses were behind their team. After 90 seconds they got a boost they could not have dreamed of when referee Neil Swarbrick wrongly sent off Gareth McAuley after last-man Craig Dawson brought down Wilfried Bony on the edge of the area. Neil Swarbrick brandishes a straight red card to a bemused McAuley after just 89 seconds of the match . West Brom players Darren Fletcher and Jonas Olsson protest as Swarbrick shows McAuley the red card . BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . Apparently the joke flying around the Albion training ground is that the lookalike pair are never seen in the same place at the same time. Nobody from the visiting contingent was laughing here. This was time for City to prove themselves and prove to the nation that there is still life left in the title race. Wilfried Bony, with no goals in six outings since his £28million switch from Swansea City, had his own point to make and he did so to break the deadlock, calmly capitalising on a lucky deflection to neatly turn, set himself up and fire the home side into the lead. After help from the referee, City then got some from Albion. For long periods, with a game of attack vs defence taking place, the Etihad resembled a school playground. The woeful defensive mix-up that handed Fernando the second goal on a plate would have caused red faces in the classroom, let alone a Premier League dressing room. The procession continued throughout the second half. In the absence of Yaya Toure, out with an Achilles problem, Frank Lampard probed and created. With West Brom reluctant to leave their own half there were few occasions when Hart, so busy on Wednesday night, had to contemplate taking off his slippers and putting down his pipe. Manchester City midfielder Fernando doubled his side's lead in the 40th minute with a close-range finish . City playmaker David Silva added a third in the 77th minute to complete the rout at the Etihad Stadium . Saido Berahino inexplicably headed onto the bar from close range but other than that there was little to lift the mood of those who had travelled from the Black Country which will have darkened further when David Silva deflected sub Stevan Jovetic's shot home for the third. At times this was City back to their fluent best. Quick short passes and chance after chance against overwhelmed opponents. Too much, however, should not be read into this cakewalk. Tougher challenges will lie ahead and Pellegrini, who believes a lack of goals is what is hurting his team the most, will have been upset by the number of missed chances. But on a sunny, spring afternoon at the Etihad we saw the first shoots of a City recovery which might just see a title challenge blossom.","Man City bounced back from their Champions League defeat by Barcelona .

"Wayne Rooney told Harry Kane to go out and get a goal for himself when the Tottenham striker replaced him as a late substitute against Lithuania on Friday night – but admits that he was stunned when Kane did so within 79 seconds. And Rooney, who says the excitement generated by Kane in the 4-0 win over Lithuania reminds him of his early games for England at the age of 17, insists that the 21-year-old will be better prepared to handle the adulation coming his way. Rooney said: 'When I came off, I said to him, 'Go and get yourself a goal'. But I didn't think he would score so quick! It's fantastic. Wayne Rooney (right) praised Harry Kane's immediate impact for England against Lithuania . Kane (left) headed in England's fourth against Lithuania shortly after replacing England captain Rooney .

When you speak to him you can see he is a level headed guy and I am sure he has good people around him so will be able to cope with it.’ Rooney was a teenage sensation for England twelve years ago and caused even more of a stir when he starred in England’s 2-0 win over Turkey in 2003 as a 17-year old. And the England captain says there were elements of Kane’s substitute performance which reminded him of that game at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland. ‘There was one stage in the game, after his goal, where he ran down the left and took a few players on which reminded me of that,’ said Rooney. ‘But he will tell you himself he still has a lot to learn but at the minute he is scoring goals left right and centre and it is great for us as a nation to have that excitement around us.

'He is obviously a little bit older than I was and a bit wiser as I was 16 or 17 when I came in. But he is level headed and can cope. ‘I think people try to help you but it is best to learn on your own.

'In the end, it comes down to who can put the best season together overall, and I have to make sure it's the other way around this time.

'It's a huge motivation for me and gives me even more determination for 2015.' Hamilton is equally fired up to write his name into F1 folklore and join a rare breed of three-times champions. 'There are many good drivers out there and all of them want to win - you just have to want it more than they do,' said Hamilton. 'I feel fresh, I feel fit, I feel relaxed, I feel positive...I feel ready.

"John Swift and Kwame Thomas were on target as England's under 20s beat the United States at Plymouth to record their second win of the week. Having overcome a talented Mexico side on penalties on Wednesday night, Aidy Boothroyd's Young Lions defied horrendous conditions and stubborn opposition to earn another morale-boosting victory ahead of the summer's Toulon Tournament.

Kwame Thomas, the Derby County forward, celebrates scoring England's second goal . Thomas celebrates with his team-mates after scoring what proved to be England's winner at Plymouth . Chelsea midfielder John Swift fires home England's opening goal from just outside the penalty box . He made extensive changes from the side that beat Mexico, with Brentford right-back Moses Odubajo the only surviving player of the team. With gale-force winds and torrential rain greeting England on their first visit to the Devon city in 26 years, it took both sides some time to get into their stride. Gradually Swift, the Chelsea midfielder currently on loan at Swindon Town in League One, began to take control of the midfield and he forced a fingertip save from American goalkeeper Jeff Caldwell. The States were happy to play on the counter-attack and Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had to be alert to deny Maki Tall. Most of the crowd thought England had taken the lead when Leeds United's Alex Mowatt sent a left-footed shot towards goal, but it had actually found the side-netting.

Obubajo advanced down the right and looked up to see Swift lurking on the edge of the area. Taking one touch to control, he fired past Caldwell to split the teams at half-time. The Young Lions continued to boss the game after the break and Mowatt went close again, firing over when Norwich City defender Harry Toffolo found him well-placed inside the box. A second goal duly arrived on 68 minutes - Swift sprung up on the left-wing, beat his man and crossed from the byline to Thomas. The Derby County forward fired home to score what proved to be the winning goal. But the States ensured a nervy finale when Tall pulled one back with 11 minutes to play, and they appeared to be level when Boxi Yomba scored late on.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has experienced the harsh realities of his philosophies being called into question but unlike some critics he has no doubt about the credentials of Louis van Gaal to get things right at Manchester United. When the pair last met back in December at Old Trafford United won 3-0, a result which bizarrely actually had more of an effect on the beaten visitors. They have not lost in the Premier League since and, ahead of the clash at Anfield on Sunday, the perception of Liverpool - and Rodgers - has changed completely. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has lavished praise on opposite number Louis van Gaal (pictured) Rodgers has lauded Van Gaal ahead of Liverpool's home match against Manchester United . United are currently two points ahead of Liverpool . That loss against United was the last in a run of eight matches which brought just eight points and left Liverpool in 10th place, seven points off fourth. However, after taking 33 points from a possible 39 they are just two points behind United, who occupy the final Champions League spot. United, by contrast, are still failing to impress in Van Gaal's first season in charge despite their league position with many questioning whether he actually knows what his best side is and whether he is getting the best out of the talent he has at his disposal. But Rodgers believes that should not reflect badly on the Dutchman. 'I don't think there is any convincing (required). He has shown over his career that he is a top-class manager,' he said. 'He will have seen, coming into this country for the first time, the challenges of this football - it is why it is the most competitive league in the world. 'The Premier League is different from the leagues he will have worked in before but I don't think you can argue with his credentials. Van Gaal's Manchester United go into the Barclays Premier League match at Anfield in fourth position . 'There is no question about the philosophies he has put in place at Ajax or Barcelona or his achievements and when he leaves Manchester United he will still be one of the great managers.' Rodgers found himself under similar scrutiny after Liverpool's poor first half of the season but things have turned around and he is flavour of the month once again. He admits August to December was a tough period for him, when his methods were being called into question, but believes he has come out the other side stronger for it. 'I've said to coaches and players that when the criticism comes, deserved or undeserved, you won't like it but you have to accept it as it is part of the game,' he added. 'As a manager you have to take the circumstance of where you are at. That won't fit with results but it is quite easy, you have to stay focused. 'You have to have an inherent belief of how you work and when it is scrutinised and ridiculed you go back to that platform of why and how you work. 'You know you are going to get it at some stage and in your career it is important you come out the other side. Rodgers, pictured during Liverpool's slender win over Swansea, insists his side will not be taking United lightly . 'I am early in my career as a manager but that period benefited me. 'It is the challenges of being a manager at any level, you are scrutinised but you have to stay calm and believe in your qualities as a coach and manager.' Liverpool are the top-flight's form team at the moment but Rodgers will not be taking United for granted, whatever the critics say about their performances this season. 'They have a lot of talent and made a lot of investment in world-class players in the summer and they have an outstanding manager,' he said. 'They have been up there all season and will want to stay there so we have to stay on the chase but I don't worry about them clicking. 'It is an important game. These games in particular are always great spectacles and the rivalry is historic. 'It is at Anfield against a big rival and we want to win the game. I don't think the result will have an overriding factor (on the race for the top four) because there are a number of games to go but psychologically it can give you a great boost.'","Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has heaped praise on Louis van Gaal .
