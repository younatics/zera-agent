He jumped off sixth and finished sixth. He was beaten with a circuit to go. ‘The winner (Coneygree) is a very good horse. Like other trainers are saying about their runners, maybe he got us out of our comfort zone.’ Meanwhile, amateur rider Tom Weston, who was airlifted to Bristol’s Southmead hospital after puncturing both lungs in a heavy fall from Benbane Head in last Thursday’s Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup was expected to be released from hospital on Tuesday afternoon.

"Former Wales and British Lions flanker Martyn Williams has called on the RBS 6 Nations organisers to change the way they draw up the Player of the Championship shortlist after Sam Warburton was left out of 12-man nominations. Warburton, 26, was one of his country's best players throughout the competition but the Wales skipper is not up for the top gong, which is based upon performance statistics rather than balanced expert opinions. Dan Biggar and Alun-Wyn Jones are the only Welsh nominations while Scotland, who lost every game, also have two players in the running in Jonny Gray and Stuart Hogg. Wales skipper Sam Warburton races away for a try during his side's 60-21 trouncing of Italy in Rome . 'Sam is the standout name not on that list,' Williams told Sportsmail. 'It was a big surprise. It's always very contentious, but it's picked using statistics and I don't think that's the way to do it. I prefer the way they do it for World Player of the Year where they use a panel of experts to get a general consensus. Sam can feel very hard done by for not making it. You could make a case for Leigh Halfpenny and Liam Williams as well. 'Sam's stats are always very high but penalties can count against you if you play on the edge. His influence on the team can't be measured through stats because they don't capture those big moments in a game where the big players stand up. 'Sam will be the player to win a big turnover to win a big game; but that just counts as one turnover on a stat sheet. He's a fantastic role model and a leader by actions.' Wales fly half Dan Biggar has made the Six Nations shortlist for Player of the Championship . Wales lock Alun-Wyn Jones is the only other Welsh player to make the 12-man shortlist . After losing their opening Test against England, Wales went on to win all of their remaining fixtures and eventually finished third on points difference. Warren Gatland expects his side to be serious challengers at the World Cup and, if they can continue to build on their momentum, Williams believes they have the talent to make the final at Twickenham. 'This squad has more or less been together for four years, so they're in a really good place,' said Williams. 'They will obviously be disappointed not to win the tournament but, in terms of the bigger picture, they're looking good for the World Cup. Can they be challengers? Yes, why not? The group stages are just as difficult as the quarter and semi finals. That's how finely balanced it is. If they win the group, then they could go all the way. Then again, they might not get out of their group at all.'

"Alan Pardew wants wingers Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie to become the 21st century version of Ian Wright and Mark Bright at Crystal Palace. The pair terrorised QPR last week in the 3-1 win with Zaha scoring from a Bolasie cross and Pardew is excited by the potential his two wingers have attacking both flanks. But the Palace boss has warned the pair are not the finished article and still have plenty of room for improvement. Wilfried Zaha celebrates with Crystal Palace team-mates after his opener at Selhurst Park last weekend . Yannick Bolasie was in magnificent form last Saturday as Crystal Palace beat QPR 3-1 at Selhurst Park . He said: ‘I think any team knows that any full backs coming up against these two know they are in for a test because these two can move the ball. ‘They have to do the other parts of the game that don’t come as easy to them such as, discipline, work rate, commitment, aggression, but they are adding those aspects to their games and at the moment they have got the flare in them to create something. ‘It is exciting to watch them and it is exciting to have them in the team - but frightening for the opposing manager.’ Ian Wright congratulates Mark Bright (centre) during their spell together playing for the Eagles . The Crystal Palace squad of 1990-91, including Wright and Bright, celebrate winning the Full Members Cup . Pardew was a player at Palace in the late 1980s and early 90s when Wright and Bright formed one of the most lethal strike partnerships in English football. They scored a total of 209 goals between them and guided Palace to promotion to the top flight in 1989 and then to a third place finish in the old Division One under Steve Coppell in 1991. And Pardew says the game has changed so much with more focus being put on the midfield that the sort of partnership that Wright and Bright had is unlikely ever to be seen again – but Zaha and Bolasie can provide a new type of threat. He added: ‘Mark Bright and Ian Wright had a very tight bond and that helped them with each others games. Zaha slides in to open the scoring during the 3-1 win over relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers . ‘They were very unselfish, although Brighty will probably argue that Ian was more selfish than him. ‘What they had was the chemistry of the old front pair. Those days are sadly diminishing because of the power of the midfield of the top teams and if you don't match that up it is very difficult to win games so that kind of combination is not a popular in the Premier League as it used to be. ‘The style you have with Zaha and Bolasie out wide it can provide a nice force for us and we have a very experienced striker in Glenn Murray who is looking to profit and that is their job, to put balls in the box.’ Palace travel to Stoke on Saturday and have put on free coach travel for fans making the trip. The Eagles have sold out their allocation of 2,900 tickets and Pardew hopes the traveling fans will be able to make themselves heard at a traditionally noisy Britannia Stadium. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew salutes the Selhurst Park home fans after the win over QPR . Despite being eight points clear of the bottom three, Pardew does not want anyone at the club to become complacent. He added: ‘We just hope they make a lot of noise, we'll need them, we cannot afford to relax, the second year in the top flight is always more difficult after you have survived a promotion year. ‘We know it is going to be tight to stay up again, but there is an extra air of confidence in the club after our recent wins, but seven days is a long time in football and we still have work to do.’ Pardew will check on the fitness of Zaha and Jason Puncheon ahead of Saturday's trip to Stoke after both picked up knocks against QPR last weekend.","Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie have impressed this season .

"Paul Murray has lambasted the Ibrox regimes of recent years and insisted they should be ‘ashamed’ of the damage inflicted on the club. The interim chairman spoke out as Rangers announced they had accepted a £1.5million loan from the Three Bears consortium — cutting off any prospect of drawing down a second £5m advance from Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct firm. Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor are lending the money without any security, interest or fees. Paul Murray is angry at decisions made by previous board at Rangers . The new Ibrox board say they will use the cash to keep the club functioning while they finalise a ‘medium to long-term’ funding package for their rebuilding plans. Dave King is expected to play a significant financial role at that point, having temporarily stepped back as he seeks to prove to the SFA that he should be deemed ‘fit and proper’ to become chairman. Murray is filling the role for now and — in conjunction with fellow directors Park, John Gilligan and John Bennett — has been analysing the various contracts inherited after taking control on March 6. He has now castigated decisions taken by the former board — which comprised David Somers, Derek Llambias, Barry Leach and James Easdale — and those who preceded them in the wake of Craig Whyte’s ruinous reign. ‘Many of the people who have occupied the Ibrox boardroom during that period should be ashamed of themselves for the parts they played in dragging this great institution towards near financial ruin,’ said Murray. Dave King (right) is expected to play a significant financial role at Rangers . ‘It is actually difficult to look closely at the club’s finances and understand the rationale behind some of the decisions taken. ‘Let me give just two examples of the recklessness displayed by those who were removed from office just more than two weeks ago. ‘One is the amount — in the region of £300,000 — spent on a needless General Meeting and the other is the signing of five Newcastle loan players without medicals. This is simply appalling.’ Manager Stuart McCall confirmed last week that at least two of the five imports from Tyneside were unlikely ever to play for Rangers. Murray thanked the ‘commitment’ shown by the Three Bears and said the board hoped to unveil their next financial step ‘in the coming weeks’. King has previously estimated he would put forward approximately 50 per cent of the funds required to restore Rangers. Stuart McCall claimed his first win as Rangers boss at the weekend . Addressing investment by the South Africa-based businessman, Murray added: ‘He is not doing so at the moment because, as we have said, we respect the processes of the SFA and must wait until they have completed their review of Dave’s status before he can fully participate in the future of the club. ‘After that, we will be inviting him to invest alongside the gentlemen who have just provided today’s facility and others who are also willing to invest. ‘We can and we will rebuild the club and this £1.5m investment is stage one of the process.’ The previous board agreed a two-stage £10m loan from Sports Direct, which gained 75 per cent of the club’s retail operation and various securities in return. ‘We have already made it clear we are happy to engage with Sports Direct but the board has decided against drawing down the second £5m tranche of Sports Direct’s £10m loan,’ said Murray. ‘We are still in the process of reviewing all of the contractual relationships that Sports Direct has with the club.’ Meanwhile, Scotland assistant boss Mark McGhee has told the Rangers board that McCall is the right man to be their long-term manager. ‘I suspect they will find they have a fantastic character in Stuart and will make him the permanent manager,’ he said.","Rangers have accepted a £1.5m loan from the Three Bears consortium .

"England's opponents in next week's friendly, Italy, have the best defence in Europe and the statistics prove it. Having shipped four goals in 14 games, Italy, who face Bulgaria in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday before hosting Roy Hodgson's side on Tuesday, have the meanest rearguard in Europe in terms of goals conceded in this qualifying competition and its predecessor. With next best England having let in six goals in 12 games, Azzurri defender Leonardo Bonucci said on Thursday that is clear that when it comes to shutting out the opposition, Italy are the best in the business. Leonardo Bonucci trains with the Italy squad ahead of their games against Bulgaria and England . Bonucci says his Italian defence, with Gianluigi Buffon and Giorgio Chiellini, is the best in the world . 'I believe so,' Juventus and Italy defender Bonucci told a news conference. 'I don't want to sound boastful but (Gianluigi) Buffon (Giorgio) Chiellini, (Andrea) Barzagli and myself are the best when you're talking about international competition. 'The numbers don't lie.' With Barzagli recently returning to fitness, Italy coach Antonio Conte can field the same defenders that helped him win three league titles in his previous role as Juventus manager. 'I'm very happy that Andrea (Barzagli) is back. We've been playing together forever and this helps,' Bonucci said. 'Especially, when we are a back three, I can lead them in pressuring opponents and they know that I'll be a few steps behind and help out, if they need me.' Italy visit Bulgaria on Saturday, where they have not won in five previous attempts. England managed to score once against the Italians at the World Cup, but still ended up losing in Manaus . Bonucci says having his Juventus team-mates together in international football is an advantage . Buffon and Chiellini have been two key players for Juventus and Italy for many years . 'Our attitude is to try to dictate play and put pressure on them starting in their own end but we'll have to be careful as their counterattack is dangerous,' Bonucci said. Italy are second to Croatia on goal difference in Group H on 10 points and have conceded two goals in four games. Conte, who replaced Cesare Prandelli after last year's disappointing World Cup campaign in which Italy failed to make it out of the group stage, is, according to Bonucci, meticulous in his attention to detail. Andrea Barzagli (right) returns for Italy after an injury layoff, and will offer even more stability . Antonio Conte worked with the Juventus back three, and Buffon, for several years, and is now Italy boss . The coach has his players sit through two hours of video every morning, where he goes over past games and talks about upcoming matches. 'The boss is a very charismatic person,' Bonucci said. 'He prepares each game in minute detail. 'As soon as we got here he showed us our last two matches (against Croatia and Albania) and not a day went by, when he was at Juve, in which he did not have us watching recorded games. 'I believe it's very helpful to look at what you did in the past and learn from it.'","Italy have conceded just four times in last 14 games .

"Former Rangers bad boy Kyle Lafferty has admitted he wants a second spell at the club in order to restore his battered reputation. The Northern Ireland international left Ibrox fans incensed in the summer of 2012 when he walked out post-liquidation to join Swiss side Sion on a free transfer. But, as he prepares to play in Glasgow for the first time in almost three years in Wednesday night’s international friendly at Hampden, the 27-year-old revealed he has unfinished business at Rangers. Kyle Lafferty said he is disappointed with how his time at Rangers ended in the summer of 2012 . Lafferty admitted that he would like to return to Rangers to improve fans perceptions of him . Lafferty is set to play in Glasgow for the first time since his exit for Northern Ireland on Wednesday . ‘Some Rangers fans have asked me if I’d go back there - and I’d jump at the chance,’ admitted Lafferty, who is under contract at Norwich until the summer of 2017 but currently on loan at Turkish side Rizespor. ‘But whether that’s an option or not is another thing.’ Lafferty won three SPL titles and both League and Scottish Cups during his controversial spell at the Govan club between 2008 and 2012. However, he saw his attitude and commitment regularly questioned amid a series of on and off-field mishaps, including high-profile bust-ups with both Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist. Lafferty was one of a number of leading players – including Steven Naismith and captain Steve Davis – who were branded mercenaries by then-chief executive Charles Green after exercising their right to refuse to transfer their registrations over to newco Rangers. Lafferty is part of the Northern Ireland side who will face Scotland in a friendly on Wednesday at Hampden . Lafferty hopes that he will one day have an opportunity to return to Glasgow to play club football . ‘What happened for me at Rangers was disappointing,’ he continued. ‘The way it happened (leaving on a free after liquidation) wasn’t how I wanted to end my career there - but it had to be done. ‘But I’ve supported Rangers since I was a young boy and I still support them now. And it would be good to go back to change people’s perceptions of me. ‘If I went back now I’d definitely let my football do the talking. And hopefully that would change people’s minds about me because I’m much more mature now.’","Striker Kyle Lafferty left financially troubled Rangers on a free in 2012 .

"Olivier Giroud scored two first-half goals to ensure Arsenal came away from their game against Newcastle with all three points. French striker Giroud struck twice inside four minutes to grab the Gunners a cushion going in to the break at St James' Park. The hosts managed just one shot in the opening 45, but grabbed a route back into the game when Moussa Sissoko netted just after the break. However, it was a case of too little too late for Newcastle as they failed to break through a stubborn Arsenal defence. Sportsmail's Rob Draper was at the game to give the lowdown... Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring Arsenal's first goal against Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday . NEWCASTLE (4-1-4-1) TIM KRUL 6 – Dutchman had little chance with either of the Arsenal goals but otherwise looked solid behind a makeshift defence. RYAN TAYLOR 6.5 – Sound defensively, getting in a good early block on Sanchez, and launched the attack for Newcastle’s goal with a lovely nutmeg . Danny Welbeck and Ryan Taylor do battles as both vie for the ball during the battle at St James' Park . DARYL JANMAAT 6.5 – Pressed into action as an emergency centre-back in the absence of Fabricio Coloccini, and the full-back coped well on the whole. MIKE WILLIAMSON 5.5 - Can’t claim to have come off best in his duel with Giroud and was too busy trying to wrestle the Frenchman when he headed in the second. JACK COLBACK 5.5 – First touch let him down on a couple of occasions, not least when he ended up conceding the freekick that led to Arsenal’s first goal . Newcastle United's Spanish striker Ayoze Perez vies for the ball with Arsenal defender Gabriel Paulista . VURNON ANITA 5 – Guilty of playing Colback into trouble on the first goal, and looked vulnerable at times. Replaced by Gutierrez with 20 minutes left . MOUSSA SISSOKO 7 – Stylish finish to get Newcastle back in the game and went close to an equaliser with a flick header. A real threat. SAMMY AMEOBI 5.5 – Had his moments but tended to drift in and out of the game. A little better in the second half. YOAN GOUFFRAN 6 – Another one who struggled to make an impact. Should have done better than poke an effort straight at Ospina from eight yards out in the 60th minute. Yoan Gouffran gets to grips with Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla during the match at St James' Park . REMY CABELLA 7 – Really came alive in the second half and did well to pick out Sissoko for the Newcastle goal. AYOZE PEREZ 7 – An isolated figure in the first half but had more support after the interval and went close with a wonderful curling effort. Subs: Gutierrez (Anita 72), Elliot, Obertan, Riviere, Armstrong (for Ameobi 89), Satka, Kemen. Scorer: Sissoko 48 . Booked: none . Moussa Sissoko of Newcastle United scores to halve the deficit against Arsenal in the Premier League match . ARSENAL (4-2-3-1) DAVID OSPINA 7 – Kicked the ball more than he handled it in the first half such was the lack of threat from Newcastle, but called upon to make some important saves after half-time. CALUM CHAMBERS 6 – Like the rest of Arsenal’s defence, coasted through the first half but ended up hanging on towards the end. Rarely put a foot wrong though. GABRIEL PAULISTA 6 – One of three changes from the Monaco game in midweek and looked solid enough on his return to the line-up. Laurent Koscielny of Arsenal is tackled by Sissoko of Newcastle United during the Premier League match . LAURENT KOSCIELNY 6.5 – Dealt comfortably with Perez in the first half but more of a battle after that, and got a punch in the back of the head from Ospina for his troubles. NACHO MONREAL 5.5 – Strolled through the first half but had his hands full after that as Cabella and Perez stepped up their game. FRANCIS COQUELIN 7 – Did well snuffing out any trouble in midfield and spilt blood for the cause after a bang in the face, ending the game in a blank shirt. Arsenal's Chilean striker Alexis Sanchez vies for the ball with Newcastle United's  Gouffran . AARON RAMSEY 7 – Wasted an early chance when he was guilty of a heavy first touch but kept things over nicely and orchestrated many of Arsenal’s best moves. ALEXIS SANCHEZ 6 – Couple of sublime touches but subdued by his standards and replaced by Tomas Rosicky towards the end. SANTI CAZORLA 6.5 – Picked up two more assists as he delivered the set-pieces for both Giroud’s goals. Otherwise, the Spaniard was effective without ever setting the game alight. DANNY WELBECK 6.5 – Got the flick-on for Giroud’s first goal but had few opportunities himself. Never stopped driving at the Newcastle defence. Welbeck hitches a ride on the back of Newcastle's French ace Sissoko at St James' Park . OLIVIER GIROUD 8 – Scored both Arsenal’s goals, making it eight in six against Newcastle. They will be glad to see the back of the Frenchman for another season. Subs: Szczesny, Gibbs, Mertesacker, Rosicky (for Sanchez 71), Walcott, Flamini (for Cazorla 71), Bellerin (for Welbeck 89) Scorer: Giroud 24, 28 . Referee: Mike Jones 7 . Star man: Olivier Giroud .

"Christian Eriksen insists Tottenham Hotspur have the characters in their dressing room to put the club's reputation as perennial bottlers to bed and qualify for the Champions League. Spurs face Leicester City at White Hart Lane on Saturday, six points behind fourth-placed Manchester United but with two of their top four rivals in Liverpool and United set to face each other at Anfield on Sunday. And Eriksen says he is desperate to change the perception of Tottenham as the sort of team that fail to live up to their expectations after defeat by Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final this month. Christian Eriksen is sick of Tottenham being known as bottlers and wants to help change their reputation . Spurs lost 3-0 at Old Trafford against Manchester United last weekend to dent their top-four hopes . 'We can change the reputation, I really think so,' Eriksen said. 'We have a really young team and people can still develop into something better. Hopefully, it will go in the right direction and, definitely, we have to show we can be a team to cross the line. 'It helped that we played the final, with the pressure. Everybody got in the mood and I don’t think anybody wants that feeling of losing again – exhausted and still just moaning because we could have done better. That helped everyone to take a look at what is needed at the top level and in important games.' While many are almost counting Spurs out of the race for the Champions League after a run of form that has seen them take just seven points from a possible 15 in a crucial period in the Barclays Premier League, Eriksen still believes Mauricio Pochettino's young side can find themselves at Europe's top table next season. Tottenham have already lost the Capital One Cup final to Chelsea this season earlier this month at Wembley . Eriksen, Danny Rose and Erik Lamela (L-R) look dejected, knowing they had beaten Chelsea earlier this year . 'We’ve still got nine games to go,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You lose one game and you are supposedly out of it. You win one and you are in again. So, hopefully, we will keep winning and we will see where we are. 'Everybody who has played in the Champions League knows that the feeling is different. Right now you sit at home and you watch it on the TV, and then you speak about it the next day. It’s just about the Champions League, ""did you see this? Did you see that?"" It gives you such a boost to play in the Champions League.'

"Germany boss Joachim Low believes his side will be more focused when they take on Georgia for their Euro 2016 qualifier after a lacklustre 2-2 friendly draw against Australia on Wednesday. Low rested half a dozen key players, including Bastian Schweinsteiger, Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng against Australia and the lack of quality on the pitch showed at times as the bold Asian champions narrowly missed out on a shock win. 'This was a good test from which we can draw some conclusions,' said Low, who recently extended his contract to 2018. 'But the team's tension will increase ahead of the Georgia game. We will be much more concentrated against them.' Joachim Low is looking for a response from Germany following a poor performance against Australia . Germany's Marco Reus gives the World Cup winners a 17th minute lead at the Fritz-Walter-Stadion . Low fielded an experimental three-man backline that not surprisingly failed to shine given Shkodran Mustafi, Benedikt Hoewedes and Holger Badstuber, back after a two-and-a-half year absence, had never played together. 'We never really had our defence under control,' Low admitted but said he would continue experimenting as he looks to make his team more flexible, with his players shifting positions more often. Better news for Low was the return of Badstuber and Ilkay Guendogan, back for the first time since August 2013, after their long injury absences. Germany's celebration is low key as they take the lead over Australia, the Asian Cup champions . James Troisi (left) pulled Australia level with a fine header during the 2-2 draw in Germany . The Australians celebrate as the underdogs peg one back against the World Cup champions . 'You can't expect everything to work after such long absences. We did not apply things that we wanted to,' said Low. 'But we know that we need to win on Sunday.' Lukas Podolski's 81st minute equaliser was a further positive point for the head coach with the out-of-form winger again delivering for Germany with his 48th goal to climb to third on the all-time scorer list. 'You can always count on Lukas to inject life into a game,' Low said of the player, who has struggled for form at Inter Milan. Germany needed an 81st minute goal from Lukas Podolski to earn a draw against the Socceroos . Germany have been also been erratic in the qualifiers. They have managed seven points from four games, as many as Ireland and Scotland, with Poland three clear at the top of Group D. With Germany in full force against Georgia few will bet against the World Cup winners leaving with three points to heave their qualification back on track. With Toni Kroos, Thomas Mueller and the other players rested on Wednesday ready to take over, Germany remain the favourites to win as they chase after top spot in the group. 'It was certainly not the performance we were looking for against Australia,' midfielder Sami Khedira said. 'We are aware of how serious the situation is for the Euro qualifiers.

"Premier League clubs are back in the black overall for the first time in 15 years thanks to a rise in TV income and a show of restraint in raising player wages. Figures released by analysts Deloitte show that the 20 clubs' annual figures combined show a pre-tax profit for the first time since 1998/99 - to the tune of £190m in 2013/14. Premier League revenues have risen 29 per cent from £2.5billion to £3.3billion due to the increase in the value of the TV deals, but wages have grown by just six per cent in the same period - £1.8billion to £1.9billion overall. Juan Mata scores an audacious goal against Liverpool at Old Trafford in the Premier League on Sunday . Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: 'Last season was the first in the Premier League's current three-year broadcast deal, which was a record-breaker when it was struck. 'Combined with strong commercial growth at the highest revenue generating clubs, this has boosted Premier League revenue 29 per cent to a record £3.3bn. However, despite this extra income clubs showed relative restraint in wage costs, which grew by 6 per cent to £1.9bn. 'In the first year of the preceding two broadcast deals, 56 per cent and 81 cent of respective revenue growth was absorbed by wage costs. This time it is less than 20 per cent.' The figures will provide good news for the 20 club chairmen who meet in London on Thursday - where they will also face a protest organised by the Football Supporters' Federation calling on the top flight to use the increase in TV income to cut ticket prices and funnel more money to the lower leagues and grass-roots. FA chairman Greg Dyke's wants to increase home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 . The protestors are expected to be allowed to send in a letter to the chairmen, who are also expected to take a significant decision on the administration of the Premier League. Richard Scudamore, the current chief executive, may be appointed as executive chairman with a possible re-organisation of the board. FA chairman Greg Dyke's plans to increase home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 are not on the agenda but may be discussed. It is understood there is little appetite at the Premier League to change the quotas - not least because it would mean the English clubs being put at a disadvantage compared to the rest of Europe.","The 20 Premier League clubs have reported a pre-tax profit .

"Andy Murray led a chorus of tennis players giving drugs cheat Wayne Odesnik a send-off after the American player was effectively banned for life for committing another doping offence. The American journeyman was handed a 15-year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances, including steroids, in out-of-competition tests carried out in December and January. The severity of the ban for the 29-year-old world No 267 owes itself to Odesnik already having been given a two-year ban when he was found in 2010 by Australian customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at Melbourne Airport. American tennis player Wayne Odesnik has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation . ‘Goodbye Wayne … good riddance,’ tweeted Murray, who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis. Andy Roddick joined in the condemnation of Odesnik who, even before 2010, was deeply unpopular in the locker room. He tweeted: ‘My feelings are that he’s a d*****bag and I hate that he has a US flag to his name when he’s cheating, good riddance.’ Veteran British doubles player Jamie Delgado chimed in: ‘Wayne Odesnik cheats again, what a joke. Get out of the sport mate.’ Murray later beat Adrian Mannarino 6-3, 6-3 at the BNP Paribas Open and will face Spain’s Feliciano Lopez in the quarter-finals. It was Murray’s 496th win, equalling Tim Henman’s record for a British man in the Open Era. After his victory, Murray spoke further on Odesnik's ban. He told the BBC: 'I think it's a good thing for tennis that he's off the tour. Andy Murray tweeted 'bye bye Wayne... good riddance' before his win over Adrian Mannarino in Indian Wells . 'He was given a second chance in a way. He was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he's been dealt with in the right way. 'I think any doping in any sport is very bad. I think it's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way. 'I think [testing] is going in the right direction but I don't think it will ever be perfect.' Odesnik issued a statement maintaining his innocence, claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the-counter supplement, but he has little credit in the bank, especially after being linked to the notorious Biogenesis clinic in Florida two years ago. Tennis has stepped up its drug-testing regime and introduced a biological passport, but many still feel that a wealthy game should allocate more resources. The fact that Odesnik was initially caught this time in December shows the value of more expensive out-of-competition testing compared to the cheaper option of doing it at major tournaments, where it is most expected.","American tennis player Wayne Odesnik handed a 15-year ban .

"Tal Ben Haim and Simon Church may drive to Charlton training sessions together but come Saturday they will be on opposing sides in a clash that could define their teams’ Euro 2016 qualifying hopes.

The atmosphere will be like you have never seen in England. ‘Our fans are really passionate. They guaranteed their places three months ago — you can’t get tickets. Everyone is talking about the game. It’s huge for us.’ Around 30,000 supporters will be waiting for Gareth Bale and Co, the vast majority cheering on Israel, who have begun their campaign with three wins from three. Wales are a point behind after two wins and two draws. Israel captain Ben Haim will have to deal with the threat posed by Belgium winger Eden Hazard on March 31 . Israel’s match against Belgium, scheduled for last September, was postponed because of the conflict in Gaza. Wales’s visit, according to Ben Haim, gives cause for positivity. ‘We have all the country behind us,’ he said. ‘We want to put smiles on people’s faces because they have been through a difficult period, and football is the best way for us, as players, to represent the country. It is the best way to help the people.’ After Bale, Ben Haim is likely to face Eden Hazard when Belgium visit three days later. ‘They are players in prime form and will be very tough opponents,’ said the 32-year-old. ‘But we need to play them as a team, not as individuals.’ Church is also keen to get the better of his club-mate. He said: ‘I’d love to score against Ben Haim, that’ll be an extra incentive!’","Tal Ben Haim will go up against close friend Simon Church on Saturday .

"Joe Hart is not getting carried away with his current form and admits he could be the ‘worst goalkeeper in the world again’ by the next game. The 27-year-old put in a world class performance when Manchester City played Barcelona in the Champions League and pulled off a string of saves to keep his side in the game. Even though he was unable to prevent them being knocked out, the Barca players queued up to praise Hart afterwards. Joe Hart is refusing to get caught up in his own hype despite showing excellent form with his club of late . Manchester City goalkeeper Hart makes a save during training at St George's Park with the England squad . Hart drew praise from Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Luis Enrique despite City's European exit . Lionel Messi said: ’He was phenomenal, he stopped everything. We have to congratulate him on a great game because he's a fantastic goalkeeper.’ Andres Iniesta added: ‘Hart was key to keeping them in it and was great in one-on-one situations. He was outstanding.’ Barca head coach Luis Enrique also said: ‘The score could have been a rout but Hart was incredible.’ It is in stark contrast to the beginning of the season when Hart was dropped by City manager Manuel Pellegrini and replaced by Willy Caballero, but he has fought his way back. ‘I have always been aware that for all the good stuff, I could be the worst keeper in the world again in one game’s time,’ Hart said. ‘I don’t get too wrapped up in good stuff or bad stuff. I just focus on my game and keep working hard.’ The English keeper says that 'for all the good stuff' that he showed in Barcelona, his form could easily dip . Messi tries to find a way past Hart but despite a dominant performance Barca were restricted to a single goal . Neymar attempts to nip the ball away from Hart's clutches at the Nou Camp but again is denied . Hart will reach a half-century of caps if he plays against Lithuania and Italy in England’s next two games. To put that into context, Peter Shilton, England’s record cap holder with 125, was 31 years old by the time he reached that landmark. Hart added: ’I am honoured to play every single game I have done for England and for it to be 48 so far is fantastic but I just want to keep playing. There are plenty of other English goalkeepers who want to do the same and I am fully aware of that. I have got a lot of hard work to do to keep my place and I am willing to do that.’ Will Caballero took over the City No 1 spot from Hart briefly for a spell earlier this season at the Etihad .

"Harlequins' former England wing Ugo Monye will retire from rugby at the end of this season. Monye's decision, announced on the official Harlequins website, will end a 13-year playing career at the Twickenham Stoop.

Harlequins wing Ugo Monye has confirmed he will retire from rugby at the end of the season . Monye won 14 England caps between 2008 and 2012 (pictured celebrating against Fiji at Twickenham) 'It is a decision that I have been thinking about for a long time, and one that I haven't taken lightly,' Monye said. 'I have had an unbelievable 13 years at Quins, and look back on my career with no regrets. 'I can honestly say that the one thing I am most proud of is that I have been a one-club man in a game that is ever-changing, and I am excited to be staying on at the club after my retirement in a different capacity.' London-born Monye has made more than 230 appearances for Quins, and the club's rugby director Conor O'Shea paid him a glowing tribute. Monye also played in two Tests for the British & Irish Lions, and scored a try against South Africa . 'In my time here, two things stick out to show his unwavering commitment and professionalism to the only club he has ever played for,' O'Shea said. 'The first was when he was offered twice the money we were offering to join a top French club, but he turned it down to be with the club he always dreamt of playing for. 'My second memory will be how he got back on the field for our Aviva Premiership title win in 2012. 'He tore his hamstring, but within four weeks - and against all medical expectation - he got himself back on the pitch and played the full 80 minutes (in the final against Leicester). 'He will be missed, but he will always be one of the true greats of this club, and also one of the great ambassadors of the game.'","Ugo Monye will end a 13-year playing career at the Twickenham Stoop .

The Wales international prop forward is a fortnight away from completing the second longest suspension in the history of Super League, imposed last October for twice punching St Helens half-back Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of the Grand Final at Old Trafford. After missing two pre-season trials, Wigan's World Club Series clash with Brisbane Broncos and the first 10 games of the league campaign, Flower will be free to make his return in the Super League derby with Warrington at the DW Stadium on Thursday April 11. Wigan Warriors player Ben Flower was banned after attacking St Helens half-back Lance Hohaia . Flower is given his marching orders by the referee after the clash in the Super League Grand Final in October . Wigan coach Shaun Wane says Flower will return for his struggling team once his ban comes to an end . Wane has a policy of re-introducing players through partner club Workington following lengthy lay-offs, but says his hand has been forced by his team's disappointing start to the season and the shortage of front-row options. Dom Crosby and Ryan Sutton are currently injured, leaving Lee Mossop as the Warriors' only specialist prop, and Wane has been forced to use utility forwards Tony Clubb, Larne Patrick and Taulima Tautai as front-row options. 'It would have been hard to drop one of our middles if we had won every game but, as it stands now, it's not that hard,' Wane said. 'I've looked at him in training and he's ready to go. I wouldn't have thrown him in straight away had things panned out differently. It's definitely dictated the way we've approached things with him over the last couple of months.' Flower walks off the pitch after his sending off at Old Trafford last year . Flower, who missed out on the club's pre-season trip to the United States, underwent knee surgery during his enforced absence and has stepped up his training under head conditioner Mark Bitcon. 'He's fit,' Wane said. 'Mark Bitcon has done a great job with him. His knee is good so everything he had done is spot on. 'I'm confident I can put him back in. I just need to put three middles on the bench and that will cover him.'","Ben Flower was banned for six months after attack on Lance Hohaia .

"Martin O'Neill has demanded that his players put aside their club woes and don’ t allow themselves be distracted as they prepare for Sunday’s vital Euro 2016 qualifier with Poland. The Republic of Ireland manager said it would be understandable for some of his squad to be lacking in confidence but stressed the importance of being fully focused when the Group D leaders arrive in Dublin. O’Neill has had to contend with a couple of injuries to personnel already this week — Darron Gibson sat out training again with a groin complaint while James McClean will go for a scan on an ankle problem — while also attempting to boost the morale of players currently feeling the heat at their clubs.

John O'Shea has suffered a dismal season and is involved in a relegation fight with Sunderland . James McClean (right) is an injury doubt and will have a scan on his ankle before making a decision . ‘That’s the nature of it, I wouldn’t get too concerned,’ said O’Neill. ‘Someone asked me quite rightly about whether I’d be concerned about three or four players going into the side and of course you would, it would stand to reason. It is what it is. ‘I wouldn’t be too concerned, though. The players are up, ready to go, there’s a good enthusiasm around them. ‘A month or six weeks ago you start to formulate a few plans but you know those disappear when you pick up a few injuries along the way or maybe some people have a bit of club form. ‘Some players are coming in absolutely fine form, others have had trials and tribulations at club level which is a bit of a concern but I think put that to the side, just think of us. ‘Just think of the game ahead. If you are coming in great form, then fantastic. If it’s not, then don’t worry.’ Sunderland’s John O’Shea and Aston Villa’s Ciaran Clark are in a Premier League relegation fight and even though Everton trio Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy and Gibson won last week, the Toffees remain close to the drop zone.

So we’ll try and do a wee bit of that in the course of the week. ‘We’re training at the Aviva [today] and that should be good. It will give us a feeling about it again.’ On the injury front, O’Neill also revealed that Gibson is ‘concerned’ by his groin problem and that Stephen Ward did not have an operation on his ankle and will have a second scan before determining his plan of action.

"Gordon Strachan insisted his Scotland players will deal with their tag as huge favourites to over-run Euro minnows Gibraltar. Christophe Berra's 85th minute header edged an uninspiring warm-up against Michael O'Neill's makeshift Northern Ireland at Hampden. The Scots have suffered repeated embarrassment on the big occasions against unfancied nations like Costa Rica and Peru through the years. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is confident his side can handle being favourites vs Gibraltar on Sunday . Against a Gibraltar side which has shipped 21 goals in four games in their first ever UEFA qualifying campaign, however, Strachan expects last night's 1-0 win to prove valuable. 'I got what I expected from the players,' said the Scotland boss. 'Some played better than others, that happens. I have a system in mind for Sunday. We'll have a look at it now. 'It does bring a pressure when people expect us to win easily - but we go into it feeling good about ourselves. Every game you play, you go into it thinking the other team is going to score, no matter who they are. 'It is a different challenge from Germany - but it's still a challenge.' The Scots threatened to blow Michael O'Neill's inexperienced, makeshift side away in the opening half hour, with Ikechi Anya a threat.

Berra (centre) wheels away in celebration after netting the decisive goal of the match at Hampden Park . Content just to win the game after debutant Matt Ritchie marked the occasion with a corner assist for Berra's third Scotland goal Strachan added: 'Matt got better as the game went on, got more of the ball and was more comfortable, He's tidy in everything he does. That's a big thing in international football, not to give ball away. 'He can be pleased with his debut - it was far better than mine… . 'The first half hour was good for a friendly. We had a good attitude. I was pleased with the number of chances we made and the way we made them. 'Then it kind of lulled in last 15 minutes of the first half into a friendly atmosphere. We kicked on for the first 10 minutes of the second half, then it died again, then we came good in the last 15. 'I'm delighted with the number of chances we made and the number that Northern Ireland didn't make. Strachan was full of praise for Matt Ritchie on his Scotland debut - after his assist for Berra's winning goal . 'They made it hard for us. It's different in this game if you can score early, but we kept plugging away and trying to do the right things. 'There are one or two things I'd like us to do better but I was delighted to win the game and get a clean sheet.' With Celtic's Scott Brown a second half substitute, Strachan handed the captain' s armband to Darren Fletcher, the West Brom midfielder marking the night with a man of the match award. 'I was really pleased for Darren Fletcher. It was a big decision for him to move but it's been a good decision for him and for West Brom. I've got decisions to make for Sunday now, good ones.'

"Heather Watson scored the best win of her career on Sunday night when she defeated world No 8 Agnieskza Radwanska to make the last sixteen of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. On the day that Laura Robson was again forced to postpone her comeback, Watson defeated a top ten player for the first time by overcoming the former Wimbledon finalist 6-4, 6-4 in 93 minutes. Watson, benefiting from her groundstrokes and serve being boosted by the dry air and altitude in the Californian desert, played with the confidence derived from already having beaten two formidable opponents, Germany’s Julia Goerges and Italy’s Camila Giorgi. British No 1 Heather Watson celebrates after completing her impressive 6-4 , 6-4 victory on Sunday . Against the crafty Pole, who reached the final last year and had beaten her easily in her three previous meetings, she struck out bravely and was helped by hitting seven aces, often at crucial times. Radwanska seemed to have got back into it when she recovered to 3-2 in the second set, but Watson stopped her revival and held her nerve after breaking for 5-4 at the end . She was awaiting the winner of Carla Suarez Navarro and Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

And to win the game and keep a clean sheet is good.' Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill insisted there more positives than negatives following the narrow defeat. He said: 'When you make so many substitutions, you are continually changing markers from set-pieces. Under normal circumstances, I don't think we'd have lost that goal - and it's disappointing for Michael McGovern who had a good game. 'We can take an awful lot (from the performance).

"Sunderland winger Adam Johnson was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl after she reportedly boasted about the affair and her father found out. Johnson, 27, was arrested at his home in County Durham on Monday after police received a complaint from the girl's father but has since been released on bail. It is understood the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, bragged about the alleged encounter to friends and on social media, the Daily Telegraph reports. Adam Johnson (pictured left and right with girlfriend Stacey Flounders) was arrested on suspicion of having underage sex with a girl, 15, after she reportedly boasted about the alleged encounter on social media . Johnson, who was signed for £10million in 2012, was then arrested and questioned for several hours. He has since been released on bail and suspended by Sunderland, pending the outcome of the police investigation. The Premier League footballer's arrest has come just weeks after his long-term girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to the couple's first child Ayla Sofia. It was unclear if Miss Flounders and her daughter, who was born on January 8, were at home at the time of the player's arrest. But Miss Flounders's mother has defended the former Middlesbrough and Manchester City player, insisting he is '100 per cent innocent'. Talking about the couple's relationship, she told the Daily Mirror: 'They are still very close and are absolutely still together. He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him. 'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situation.' The 27-year-old millionaire was arrested at his six-bedroom mansion in County Durham (above) after the alleged victim's father reportedly complained to police, it has emerged . The £50,000-a-week player had been due to travel with the rest of the Sunderland squad to East Yorkshire for Tuesday's league game against Hull City before being suspended. A statement from Sunderland said: 'Sunderland AFC has confirmed that Adam Johnson has been suspended from the club, pending the outcome of a police investigation. No further comment will be made at the present time.' The FA refused to comment on Johnson's arrest. Johnson, who has represented his country 12 times, gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago. Johnson, who was signed for £10million in 2012, was arrested on Monday morning and questioned for several hours. He has since been suspended by Sunderland . The FA refused to comment on the arrest of the winger. Pictured: Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last December . At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo's former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Miss Flounders. Friends say Johnson opted to live near a quiet hamlet to get away from the 'bright lights' of city life. On Monday, three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station. Johnson has been released on bail and will return to Peterlee police station (pictured) at a later date . It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details. Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough's youth academy as a 12-year-old. After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City. He was signed by Sunderland three years ago. He failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year, .

"A food company has been forced to call its meatballs simply 'balls' - because they don't contain enough 'proper' meat. Finnish food giant Kesko changed the name on its website after authorities insisted its meatballs did not meet regulations because they are made from mechanically separated meat (MSM). MSM is taken from the bone after the desired meat cuts are removed. It can be referred to as 'white slime'. Finnish food company Kesko has been forced to call its meatballs (above) simply 'balls' - because they don't contain enough 'proper' meat . A spokesman for Kesko said: 'The balls have the equivalent of 52 per cent meat. 'However, according to current legislation, they aren't from parts of the animal that can be described as meat.' The company added that it was not misleading customers because the type of meat it uses is 'well-suited' to ground meat products, YLE reported. The other 48 per cent of Kesko's 'balls' are made from wheat flour, potato flour and soya protein, as well as rapeseed oil, salt and other additives. A spokesman for Kesko said the meat it uses is mechanically separated from the bone after the desired meat cuts are removed. Scrap pork is also used. Above, a stock photo of cooked meatballs . Matti Kalervo, vice-president of corporate relations for Kesko, told The Times the company sells meatballs with more meat in, but they are more expensive. He said: 'This is a price-factor product. It was meant to be a very reasonable price.' The use of MSM was banned in the UK in 2012. It was used widely in beef burgers and ready meals. At the time the British Meat Processors Association described it as a 'criminal waste of a valuable product'.","Kesko changed description as product did not contain enough proper meat .

"Millionaire England footballer Adam Johnson was arrested on suspicion of having underage sex with a 15-year-old girl after she reportedly boasted about their relationship and her father found  out, it has emerged. The  Sunderland winger was detained at his six-bedroom £1.85m home in County Durham on Monday morning after the schoolgirl's father reportedly complained to police about the alleged liaison. It is understood the girl bragged about having a 'relationship' with the player, both to friends and on social media, the Daily Telegraph's Martin Evans reports. Adam Johnson (pictured left and right with girlfriend Stacey Flounders) was arrested on suspicion of having underage sex with a girl, 15, after she reportedly boasted about the alleged liaison on social media . The Premier League footballer also reportedly posed for photos with the girl on a number of occasions. The news emerged as the schoolgirl at the centre of the claims - who has the right to lifelong anonymity - was named online. The publication of her name prompted Durham Police to issue a reminder that anyone who names the girl will face prosecution. It comes after the young woman who was raped by footballer Ched Evans was widely named online, forcing her to change her name and move addresses. After the rumours was reported to police, Johnson was arrested at his mansion and questioned for several hours. The player, who was signed for £10million in 2012, has since been released on bail. He has also been suspended by Sunderland AFC, pending the outcome of the police investigation. The Premier League footballer's arrest has come just weeks after his long-term girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to the couple's first child Ayla Sofia. It was unclear if Miss Flounders and her daughter, who was born on January 8, were at home at the time of the player's arrest. The 27-year-old millionaire was arrested at his six-bedroom mansion in County Durham (above) after the alleged victim's father reportedly complained to police, it has emerged . But Miss Flounders's mother today defended the former Middlesbrough and Manchester City player, insisting he is '100 per cent innocent'. Talking about the couple's relationship, she told the Daily Mirror: 'They are still very close and are absolutely still together. He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him. 'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situation.' The £50,000-a-week player had been due to travel with the rest of the Sunderland squad to East Yorkshire for tonight's league game against Hull City before being suspended. A statement from Sunderland said: 'Sunderland AFC has confirmed that Adam Johnson has been suspended from the club, pending the outcome of a police investigation. No further comment will be made at the present time.' Johnson, who was signed for £10million in 2012, was arrested on Monday morning and questioned for several hours. He has since been suspended by Sunderland AFC . The FA refused to comment on the arrest of the winger. Pictured: Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last December . The FA refused to comment on Johnson's arrest. Johnson, who has represented his country 12 times, gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago. At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo's former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Miss Flounders. Friends say Johnson opted to live near a quiet hamlet to get away from the 'bright lights' of city life. Yesterday, three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station. It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details. He has been bailed until March 18. Johnson has been released on bail and will return to Peterlee police station (pictured) at a later date . Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough's youth academy as a 12-year-old. After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City. He was signed by Sunderland three years ago. He failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year, . In a statement last night, a Durham Police spokesman said: 'A 27-year-old man was arrested earlier today on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16. He has been released on police bail pending on-going investigations. 'A blank firing pistol, which replicates the sound of real gunshots but does not require a licence to own, was also recovered during a search of the property.' The spokesman also reminded the public that identifying someone who may or may not be a victim of a sexual offence is against the law. 'Victims of sexual assault are guaranteed the legal right to lifetime anonymity and publishing any details, including on social media, which may lead to their identification, is contrary to the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992,' they said. 'Durham Constabulary wishes to remind social media users, and anyone else, who breaks the law that they will be dealt with robustly.'

"Former England captain Jamie Peacock will swap his rugby kit for a suit at the end of the year when he joins Hull KR in the newly-created role of football manager. The 37-year-old Leeds prop forward is currently completing a masters degree in sports management and will start his new job when he brings his illustrious career to a close at the end of the season. Peacock's new role will see him responsible for, amongst other things, contract negotiations, club strategy, recruitment and pre-season training camps. Jamie Peacock (centre right) has been named the new football manager of Super League club Hull KR . Friday's announcement ends any lingering speculation about the former Bradford skipper playing on beyond his 38th birthday in December. Hull KR chairman Neil Hudgell said: 'We are delighted to have secured Jamie to the full-time position of football manager for the next two years. 'He is a proven champion at the highest level in our sport and we look forward to working with him, drawing on his experiences and contacts and generally raising the profile and performance of the club in key areas. 'I'm sure he will have a big role to play in helping to attract young English talent to Hull Kingston Rovers and in helping to develop a winning culture on and off the field.' Peacock has won a record eight Super League Grand Finals as well as making over 500 appearances for Leeds, Bradford, Yorkshire, England and Great Britain. The Leeds prop will retire from playing at the end of the season and take up his new role at the club . He was named Man of Steel in 2003 and stepped down as England captain in 2012 to concentrate on his club career and will complete a 10th and final campaign with his home-town club. He was awarded the MBE three years ago for services to the sport. Leeds say Peacock was offered an off-field role at Headingley but wanted a fresh challenge. Peacock said: 'I have had a great time at Leeds and learnt so much about how the club is run from top to bottom. 'The Rhinos are a blueprint for a successful sporting business and the challenge for me now is to take those lessons and try and implement my own thoughts in a new environment. 'Hull KR are a club with huge potential within a city that is rugby league mad and having invested wisely in their facilities in recent years. I know a number of people over there already and I am looking forward to working with Chris Chester, Willie Poching, Mike Smith and Neil Hudgell in my new role. Peacock was England captain a few years ago but is excited about his new off-field role . 'Whenever we have gone over there to play, it is clear Rovers have a fanatical supporter base. I think it is vital that you have a hard core of good people who want the club to succeed to be able to build and plan for development in the future. 'Now that I have the next chapter of my career finalised, I am fully focused on finishing my time with Leeds as strongly as possible and leaving my home-town club in the best possible position.' Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington said: 'I think this is an inspired appointment by Hull KR and I know Jamie will be very good at what will be a very different challenge. 'He has been at the heart of all our success over the past decade and his performances and influence at the club cannot be overestimated. He will leave a lasting legacy and all our best wishes will be with him when he swaps his training kit for a new suit at the end of the season.'","Jamie Peacock to begin the role at Hull KR at the end of the season .

"A benefits cheat who pocketed £15,000 claiming he could barely walk was caught out after being secretly filmed playing in midfield for his pub football team. Raymond Billam, of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire said he was severely disabled because of problems with his knees and back as he claimed incapacity benefits. But unknown to him, fraud investigators had been tipped off and secretly filmed the 38-year-old playing football for his Sunday league side. Raymond Billam (left) pocketed £15,000 claiming he could barely walk - but was caught out after being secretly filmed playing in midfield for his pub football team . The 38-year-old (centre after passing the ball during a Sunday league game) said he was severely disabled because of problems with his knees and back - but was still able to play as a midfielder in his pub side . Caught out: Fraud investigators had been tipped off and secretly filmed Billam (left) playing football for his Sunday league side . Billam claimed he needed crutches to get around and was virtually unable to walk more than a few metres unaided, a court heard. But for nearly five years between 2008 and 2013 he pulled on the green shirt of Ingsfield Lane in the Mexborough and District Sunday League, South Yorkshire, putting in crunching tackles and running several miles in a match. Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing £15,000 in benefits to which he was not entitled. Barnsley Magistrates Court was told by prosecutor Julie Grant that he played 87 games mainly for pub sides over several seasons. She added: 'Mr Billam said he could only walk 20 metres before he felt discomfort. Investigators saw him playing football. He was running and jumping. Billam had claimed he needed crutches to get around - but a court heard that he had been playing football regularly for five years .

The 38-year-old (right) admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing £15,000 in benefits to which he was not entitled . 'Mr Billam said when he was quizzed that he had good days and bad days. 'He said other people may have played football using his name. He became coy when he was asked further questions.' District Judge John Foster warned Billam he could be sent to prison. He said: 'The nature of the deception and the amount of money falsely claimed means I do not rule out jail or sending you to the crown court for a stiffer sentence than can be imposed here.' Billam's solicitor Chris Peace reserved his right to put his defence later. He will be sentenced next month and was granted unconditional bail. A spokesman for the DWP fraud team said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing. 'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance. 'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'","Raymond Billam claimed he had severe problems with his knees and back .

"The first video of Mohammed Emwazi - identified last week as ISIS executioner Jihadi John - has emerged . The first footage of ISIS executioner Jihadi John as a shy teenage schoolboy has emerged. The video shows Mohammed Emwazi, identified last week as the Islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in Syria, being chosen by a classmate to join in with a game of lunchtime football. The previously-unseen footage was filmed 11 years ago at Qunitin Kynaston Academy, the secondary school in St John's Wood, north London, where Emwazi was educated. The friendly kickabout is the first moving image to have been obtained of Emwazi before he became the ISIS's depraved executioner-in-chief. In the film, obtained by Channel 4 News, the 'football mad' teenager, thought to be around 15 at the time, is  the second person to be chosen for the team. One of his fellow pupils can be clearly heard shouting 'Emwazi', beckoning over the future jihadi. But he also appears to be painfully shy, instantly raising his arm to cover his face when he knew the camera was focusing on him. Channel 4 News said Emwazi had been identified in the video by two different people that he knew at the time. The footage, filmed in May 2004, was broadcast this evening, after it emerged that the executioner had dumped two schoolboys on the M1 motorway at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother. According to a former friend of his brother Omar, Emwazi and two bearded associates abducted two gang members in 2008, while he was living on the notorious Mozart estate in west London. After viewing the footage, Diane Foley, the mother of American journalist James Foley, told Jon Snow it was 'frightening' that a 'promising young person who had many gifts' could use his talents for 'such evil'. She said: 'It's very frightening he would end up filled with such hate. That's very disturbing to me that young people would be attracted to such hate?' She added that the fact Jihadi John had been identified did not help to bring her closure. She said: 'If it had not been that young man, then I'm afraid it would have been someone else. I think it's tragic for that young man and his family - it's just so sad and we must do more to protect our young people from the lies that have instilled so much hate and brutality.' Since being identified, Emwazi has emerged as a fun-loving young boy, who adored The Simpsons, Playstation games and eating chips. He was also said to have wanted to become a Premier League star, scoring goals for Manchester United by the age of 30. Scroll down for video . The video shows Emwazi, aged around 15, being chosen by a captain to join the team for a game of football . The footage, which is the first time any moving image has been obtained of Emwazi, was shot in the playground of Qunitin Kynaston Academy, the secondary school in Queen's Park . In a handwritten entry in his primary school yearbook, the Kuwaiti-born British citizen, who moved to the UK aged six, wrote: 'What I want to be when I grow up is a footballer'. The entries showed no sign he would go on to become the world's most wanted man, who is believed to have beheaded a string of hostages in the name of Islam. But, a decade later, Emwazi had shunned British life and was a 'known wolf' to MI5, having already taken the path towards becoming ISIS' most notorious murderer. In a chilling twist, in a school yearbook from when he was 10, Emwazi lists his favourite computer game as shooting game 'Duke Nukem: Time To Kill' and his favourite book as 'How To Kill A Monster' from the popular children's Goosebumps series. He also lists his favourite band as pop group S Club 7, and when asked what he wants to be when he is 30, writes: 'I will be in a football team and scoring a goal.' Emwazi also listed his favourite colour as blue, his favourite animal as a monkey, his favourite cartoon as The Simpsons and chips as his favourite food. Earlier this week, it emerged Emwazi was bullied as a schoolboy at the school in which the film was made. Emwazi, pictured as a schoolboy, was said to have wanted to become a Premier League star, scoring goals for Manchester United by the age of 30 . The terrorist has been on the radar of MI5 since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab . Former headteacher Jo Shuter told Radio 4's Today programme: 'He had adolescent issues. Particularly at that age, for the boys, it is a time when the hormones start raging, and he had some issues with being bullied which we dealt with. 'By the time he got into the sixth-form he was, to all intents and purposes, a hard-working aspirational young man who went on to the university that he wanted to go to.' After arriving in Britain when he was six years old, the  extremist appeared to embrace British life, playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United. He had moved to Britain in 1993, settling in the north-west London suburbs of Maida Vale and Queens Park. Neighbours recalled a polite, quietly spoken boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class. He went to mosque with his family, who spoke Arabic to each other, but wore Western clothing and became popular with his British classmates at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London. The footage was filmed at Quintin Kynaston Academy School in St John's Wood, north London, where Emwazi attended secondary school and was said to have been bullied . He was also described as 'calm and decent' and 'the best employee we ever had' by  an IT firm for whom he worked in Kuwait. But, at some point during his lifetime, Emwazi was radicalised and was soon on the radar of MI5. It emerged today that the Home Office could face fresh questions over border controls after it is thought that Emwazi used a well-worn route to leave the UK. The 26-year-old a university graduate from Queen's Park, London, was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 watchlist and being monitored by Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command. He had been watched by the services since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab. Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain. En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab. Emwazi claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by security services - and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He alleged an agent from MI5 knew 'everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with' and claimed the organisation attempted to 'turn' him to work for them. By Arthur Martin for The Daily Mail . The family, who have milked the benefits system for 20 years, went into hiding when their son was identified as Mohammed Emwazi . Jihadi John’s family are being guarded by armed police at a secret location in a security operation costing taxpayers more than £5,000 a day. Officers from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command provide round-the-clock protection for the Islamic State killer’s mother, brother and three of his sisters. The family, who have milked the benefits system for 20 years, went into hiding when their son was identified as Mohammed Emwazi. They initially left their £600,000 London flat, where their rent was paid by Westminster Council, and moved into a property nearby. But when Emwazi’s brother, Omar, 21, was spotted by a television crew the family were moved to a hotel where they are living under assumed names. They have been receiving an estimated £40,000 a year in benefits since they sought asylum in Britain in 1993. The family fled Kuwait after the first Gulf War, claiming persecution as they were seen to favour the Iraqi invasion in 1990. But after they were made British citizens Emwazi’s father Jasem, 51, returned to Kuwait – the country he claimed he fled fearing for his life. His daughter Asma, 25, is also there. Meanwhile Emwazi’s mother Ghaneya, brother and three of his sisters continue to drain the public purse of thousands more in protection costs. None are suspected of wrongdoing but police are thought to be questioning them about their contact with Emwazi since he moved to Syria. Tory MP Philip Davies said the public will be angry that the family are receiving such expensive protection, but added that the police are in an ‘impossible position’. They initially left their £600,000 London flat (pictured) where their rent was paid by Westminster Council, and moved into a property nearby . Scotland Yard refused to comment on the family’s whereabouts or security arrangements. Friends of the family said Emwazi’s father moved close relatives into a safe house in Kuwait after his son’s identity was revealed. Last night a former friend of the terrorist said he once kidnapped two boys at gunpoint in retaliation for a gang attack on his brother. Emwazi forced the teenagers into a car and ordered them to strip to their underwear before dumping them on the M1 motorway. The kidnapping was said to be retribution for a vicious attack the previous day when Emwazi and his younger brother Omar were attacked with bricks. Then, when Emwazi’s brother, Omar, 21 (pictured) was spotted by a television crew the family were moved to a hotel where they are living under assumed names . It occurred in 2008 when Emwazi was studying at the University of Westminster – a year before he was quizzed by the security services on suspicion of trying to reach militant training camps in Somalia. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said the attack was sparked by gang rivalries involving two West London estates. ‘There was a big fight,’ he said. ‘[Gang members] threw a brick at my head and broke my arm. Omar was punched in the face a few times and beaten up. ‘The next day Mohammed turned up with two religious guys with beards. They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. They dumped them on the M1.’","First time  Mohammed Emwazi seen on camera since he was unmasked .

"Lance Bombardier Aydn Walster, 22, impersonated a police officer by pulling motorists over using flashing lights he bought on eBay . A soldier impersonated a police officer by using flashing lights he bought on eBay to pull motorists over and tell them their driving 'was not up to standard'. Lance Bombardier Aydn Walster, 22, pulled over unsuspecting drivers he thought were driving poorly before taking down their personal details in a notebook. The soldier even asked drivers to get back into the back of his Saab 9-3 saloon car to give them a telling off. Walster appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court yesterday where his defence solicitor admitted the serviceman had been a 'bloody fool'. He pleaded guilty to three counts of impersonating a police officer and two charges of using a car fitted with a blue flashing warning light. Walster, from Lincoln, was fined £835, ordered to pay costs of £85, and a victim surcharge of £84. The soldier, who has served in Afghanistan, now faces being kicked out of the Army as a result of his criminal conviction. The court heard Walster bought the blue flashing lights on eBay before putting them on the dashboard of his car and pulling over fellow soldiers at his barracks as a prank. But he then took the joke 'too far' by going on to public roads in Lincoln and stopping three members of the public between November last year and January. The soldier pulled over motorists who he thought were driving poorly before telling them they had been breaking the speed limit. Walster was caught when on January 22 he pulled over a car at Lindis Retail Park before taking their personal details. But a friend driving behind became suspicious and reported the incident to the police. Prosecutor Iola Harris said: 'On each occasion, it seems to be that he believed the manner of driving was not up to standard.' Walster pulled a motorist over using the flashing blue light as they passed by Lindis Retail Park (pictured) in Lincoln . Ms Harris added: 'A motorist was followed on Tritton Road by a car with a flashing blue light. The defendant asked him to sit in the back of his car and he was asked questions. 'As a result of the investigation, the defendant was arrested and in his vehicle was a notebook containing personal details. 'He accepted that book belonged to him and he did take names and addresses of members of the public.' While being interviewed by police, Walster admitted he had impersonated a police officer on another occasion. His defence lawyer told the court that being arrested had been more terrifying for Walster than his tour of Afghanistan. Dave Clapham, defending, said: 'In essence, what he says is that the lights were bought off eBay and used to stop his mates on the barracks as a joke. 'For whatever reason this continued into the public arena. He does not know why. He just says he has been a bloody fool and completely stupid. The soldier even asked drivers to get back into the back of his car to give them a telling off, Lincoln Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard . 'He tells me the process of being arrested was more terrifying than his tour of Afghanistan. 'The consequences of your sentence have ramifications that could go far higher. Not only could he be overlooked for promotions bonuses, he could face a reduction in rank - ultimately it could lead to his discharge. He is a good soldier.' After the case, PC Robert McGhee, from Lincolnshire Police, said: 'Offences of this type are really very serious. 'Police officers are trained to the highest of standards and the job they carry out every day requires not only application of that training but a thorough knowledge of the law, as well as practice and procedure. Impersonating an officer carries hefty penalties for good reason. 'We are pleased with the outcome of the court case as it is a fitting sentence. We hope this serves as a stark warning to not only the gentleman involved but also to others that police and the courts take a very dim view of anyone acting in this fashion.' An Army spokesperson said: 'All those who are found to fall short of the Army's high standards are dealt with as appropriate through the discipline process, up to and including discharge.'","Lance Bombardier Aydn Walster admitted impersonating a police officer .

Up in flames: A Chinese woman accidentally set fire to £20,000 meant for her husband's construction workers . Hao Bin stashed the money inside her stove, but forgot it was there and set fire to it while making tea . Mrs Bin, 35, was inconsolable after the blaze, but her husband Wang, 39, said he had forgiven her . She only realised her grave error when she went to add some more wood and saw the plastic bag filled with Chinese bank notes was almost entirely incinerated. Mrs Bin, from Shaoshan in central China's Hunan province, threw water onto what was left of the cash, but it was too late. The devastated woman took the charred remains to the Bank of China, but officials told her that, as less than half of each note was left, they could not exchange them for new money. Mr Bin, 39, who owns a small construction company and needed to pay his workers a total of £20,000, said he had forgiven his wife. Bank of China officials refused to replace the burned money as less than half of each note was still intact . Mrs Bin only realised her grave error when she went to through more wood on the fire and saw the money ablaze . Mr Bin said the fire was a 'hard blow' but that he would be able to cope, despite losing £20,000 cash . He said: 'We had not been paid ourselves yet for our work, but I needed to pay the workers so we borrowed the money from friends and family, and we wanted somewhere to keep it safe for a day before paying it out. 'It was a hard blow, and my wife is devastated. But I have forgiven her, and we will survive.' Many Chinese people choose to hide money at home because of a lack of trust in banks, with some hiding them in pillowcases and socks to keep them safe from thieves.","Chinese woman accidentally set light to £20,000 cash while making tea .

"Prosecutors are considering taking action over footage which shows a hunt follower's horse 'mowing down a anti-hunt protestor', in an incident which left the alleged victim with seven broken ribs. Nid Warren was trampled by the galloping horse while she attended the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale meet in Somerset last August. The 43-year-old suffered a collapsed lung and shattered ribs and was left unconscious on the ground following the dramatic incident. Scroll down for video . Prosecutors are considering taking action over footage which shows a hunt follower's horse 'mowing down a anti-hunt protestor' (pictured) , in an incident which left the alleged victim with seven broken ribs . Nid Warren was trampled by the galloping horse while she attended the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale meet in Somerset last August . The 43-year-old suffered a collapsed lung and seven broken ribs (pictured) and was also left unconscious on the ground following the dramatic incident . But five months after the event, Avon and Somerset police said no charges would be brought against Mark Doggrell, who had been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The CPS said there was 'insufficient evidence that the incident could have been foreseen'. Mr Doggrell had initially rode away from the scene but later voluntarily handed himself in at a police station. But the organisation is now reviewing the footage, after 12,000 people signed a petition urging the organisation to reconsider charging the rider. The review is taking place under the Victims' Right to Review Scheme, a process brought into force in 2013. It allows victims to appeal against a decision not to bring charges or to discontinue a case once a prosecution has begun. The CPS said: 'We are in communication with the alleged victim and will be in contact with her when we have made a decision.' The hunt insists the rider is innocent. The injured woman, who has asked to use a pseudonym because she fears being targeted by pro-hunting groups, said she was left 'devastated' by the CPS's original decision. She said: 'I'm a victim of crime and feel absolutely abandoned by a system that's supposed to protect me. 'As I lay in hospital the only thing on my mind was ""have they got this on video?"" because I wanted to ensure it was looked at properly. I thought it was irrefutable evidence, the fact it was caught on video.' The organisation is now reviewing the footage (above), after 12,000 people signed a petition urging the organisation to reconsider charging the rider . The woman is seen being trampled as she stands with two fellow protestors at the meet in August . Ms Warren, who works full-time as an NHS health worker, had been at the meet at Charlton Horethorne near Wincanton, close to the Dorset-Somerset border, with colleagues from the Dorset Hunt Saboteur group when the incident occurred. She said she started 'sabbing' – a term used to describe hunt saboteurs protesting at fox hunts – in the aftermath of the badger cull. Saboteurs attended the planned hunt in a bid to raise awareness of animal cruelty and used two main tactics to throw the hunt off course. She said: 'We sounded a horn, hollered, and some hounds looked up and started to come our way. The CPS said no charges were brought because there was 'insufficient evidence that the incident could have been foreseen' The man did not stop after the collision but later handed himself in to police, who charged him with GBH . 'I think he [the hunt member] got angry at this. He came along a public road behind us at speed, he didn't issue a warning, he was completely silent, then he hit me and rode off. 'As I was lay there, struggling to breathe, I could hear the horns going and I was worried that if the horses came back that I would be trampled to death. I was left lying there with potential life-threatening injuries.' Ms Warren, from Hampshire, was taken to Yeovil District Hospital where she stayed for two weeks. She added: 'He rode his horse at us at full speed and rode off. I had my back to him and he hit me and the horse's chest contacted with my rib cage, breaking seven ribs, injuring my shoulder and I was unconscious. 'When ribs are broken you can't splint them - they have to move. They have healed in a grossly displaced position.' The master of the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale Hunt, Rupert Nuttall, said: 'We apologise that an awful accident happened but the due process of the law has been gone through. 'Mark is innocent, as found by the Crown Prosecution Service.' A fox hunter who took a tumble from his horse was given first aid by a hunt saboteur. The anti-hunt campaigner put his differences to one side to come to the aid of the injured huntsmember, who lost consciousness after a nasty fall from his horse. Ian Hamson, a hunt master of the Old Surrey, Burstow and west Kent Fox Hunt, is believed to have been injured after his horse fell and rolled on top of him during a meet on Saturday near Cowden, Kent. A fox hunter who took a tumble from his horse was given first aid by a hunt saboteur at a meet in Kent . A member of Croydon Hunt saboteurs, also a trained paramedic, stepped in and helped the injured man until other paramedics arrived. Lee Moon, spokesperson for the Hunt Saboteurs Association, said: 'Well done to the sab who put his differences aside to act so compassionately, even in the face of hostility from the injured huntsmember. 'His actions prove once again that saboteurs are compassionate not only towards animals but humans as well. 'This is another nail in the coffin of the Countryside Alliance's campaign to portray us in a negative light and it would be interesting to see what would have happened if the roles had been reversed.' A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'Officers attended Cowden Pound to ensure public safety on Saturday morning after receiving a report of a hunt demonstration. The anti-hunt campaigner put his differences to one side to come to the aid of the injured huntsmember, who lost consciousness after a nasty fall from his horse in Cowden . 'However, no offences were reported so no further action was necessary. 'While in attendance, a man required medical attention after falling from a horse and was treated at the scene by a first-aider.' Charlotte Cooper, spokesman for the Countryside Alliance said: 'Just as hunting attracts a wide variety of people it is only common sense that not every person who sabs hunts is the same. The relationship between hunts and sabs varies from hunt to hunt and is not always acrimonious. I have heard stories of unsuitable attired antis being helped across muddy fields by gallant hunt supporters and broken down sab vehicles being towed out by helpful farmers. 'However just because those opposed to hunting can boast that on this occasion one of their number showed human compassion it does not diminish the appalling behaviour of others, for example the cowardly gang of masked thugs who beat Tedworth huntsmember Brian Lane with metal bars in January. 'The number of people involved in saboteur activities is far fewer than in the past, however we are concerned that those extremists who remain are increasingly resorting to violence.'","Nid Warren, 43, left with punctured lung after incident at Somerset hunt .

"A farmer shocked police after they stopped his Fiat Punto and found a baby cow in the back. Zbigniew Grabowski was taking the calf back to his farm after visiting a vet when he was spotted in Mogilno, Poland. The 53-year-old was pulled over by officers who discovered that his boot had been converted into a farmyard, complete with a straw floor and wooden barriers. Amoosing: A farmer shocked police after they stopped his Fiat Punto and found a calf cramped in the back . Far from being amused the police told Grabowski he could not continue his journey and would have to walk the calf back to the farm. Tomek Mroczkowski was driving in the area when he came across the farmer in a queue. The 34-year-old said: 'We had come to some traffic lights and I pulled up beside the car next to me. 'I looked over and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the face of a cow staring back at me. I almost didn't believe it at first. 'The lights then changed and the car drove off with the cow still looking out of the window. It was such a small car, the poor thing must have been a bit squashed.' A police spokesman said: 'The driver said he was taking his cow back to his farm and that he had specially adapted the car to carry livestock. Milking it: The Fiat Punto is relatively small but the 53-year-old put the back seats down and covered the floor in straw to try and make the cow comfortable . 'We explained that he should get a proper truck and that putting a cow in the back of the car was dangerous.' The farmer was also fined £100 and had his driving licence confiscated. It comes three weeks after a driver spotted a sheep being driven in the back of a black Volvo. John Bowden, 44, was on his way home near Tulse Hill station, south London, when he saw the animal staring through the back window of the car in front.","Zbigniew Grabowski was driving the baby cow back from a vet in Poland .

"Luke Gale scored twice in a man-of-the-match performance as Castleford made it back-to-back wins for the first time this season with a 20-14 success over Hull FC at the Mend-A-Hose Jungle. The Tigers lost their first three matches but have found form in recent weeks and recorded their third successive home victory on Friday night. Defences came out on top in a first half which saw Castleford prop Andy Lynch take the field for his 450th career appearance against his former club. Castleford prop Andy Lynch took to the field for his 450th career appearance against his former club. Gale's converted effort gave the Tigers a deserved lead but Hull responded positively and went into the break with just a two-point deficit after Tom Lineham marked his 50th outing for the club with his fifth try of 2015. Lynch took centre stage at the start of the second period as his break laid the platform for Gale to cross for his second and stretch Castleford's lead. But Hull, whose coach Lee Radford missed the trip through illness, refused to lie down and hit the front as Lineham scored twice to complete his hat-trick. Opposite number Justin Carney gained some revenge when he grounded Lineham with a fierce hand-off on his way to the line for his ninth try of the campaign. James Clare eased Castleford's nerves after benefiting from Fetuli Talanoa's shocking error and they were celebrating their fourth successive win over Hull at full-time. The Tigers went close twice in the opening 10 minutes, with Jake Webster hauled down inches short of the tryline by Jordan Rankin and Clare dropping the ball attempting a spectacular finish in the corner. Castleford continued to do most of the running and finally broke Hull's resistance in the 24th minute as Gale showed a good turn of pace to score to the right of the posts after taking Grant Millington's brilliant offload 40 metres out. Hull came storming back and, just after former Tigers half-back Marc Sneyd had been denied by a last-ditch tackle by Carney, crossed for their first try of the evening through Lineham. The ball moved through the hands from left to right before Steve Michaels fed the winger to score in the corner. Sneyd missed the conversion from the right touchline so Castleford went into half-time 6-4 to the good. The hosts extended that lead within 60 seconds of the restart after Millington kept his composure to find Gale close to the line following a storming run by fellow prop Lynch. Castleford were again unable to build momentum as Lineham crossed to cut the home side's advantage to four points. Talanoa was denied by a good tackle by Clare but Lineham made no mistake in the other corner after collecting Danny Houghton's cut-out pass from dummy half. Sneyd was off target once more from out wide but he had been at the heart of all things good for the Black and Whites and his long pass allowed Lineham to complete his hat-trick. Sneyd made it third time lucky from the right to give Hull the lead for the first time on the night. Carney had been found wanting in defence for Castleford but the Australian showed why he is Super League's top try-scorer by flattening Lineham before diving over. Hull's hopes of mounting another comeback were hit when Sneyd limped off with a leg injury. Clare touched down after Talanoa made a meal of Gale's kick and the Tigers held on despite a late Hull onslaught.","Luke Gale scored twice in a man-of-the-match performance .

"The families of hostages David Haines and Alan Henning who were murdered by the Islamic extremist Jihadi John have been blessed by the Pope. Aid worker David Haines, of Yorkshire, was beheaded last September after being captured by Islamic state. Alan Henning, 47, a father-of-two, was killed in the same way a month later. Both murders appeared on video and apparently showed Jihadi John, who has recently been unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi, from London, carrying out the killings. Pope Francis met Barbara Henning right), the wife of murdered British hostage Alan Henning, and Michael Haines (centre), the brother of David Haines, at St Peter's Basilica today . Today Pope Francis met the families of the two men at a service aimed at uniting religions and ending extremism. Widow Barbara Henning was brought up to meet the Pope on the steps of St Peter's Basilica in Rome after his rain-soaked general audience. Usually such access is reserved for visiting prelates. Michael Haines, brother of David Haines, was also able to meet the Pope at the ceremony. Since the death of his brother he has dedicated himself to promoting tolerance between religions and unity against extremism. He said the moment 'took my breath away.' Alan Henning (left) was kidnapped on Boxing Day 2013 and murdered in October last year, David Haines (right), who had dedicated his life to helping others across the world was killed in September 2014 . In a telephone interview he said the pope told him he was going to pray for him to 'continue the work that we're doing on unity and tolerance and bringing our communities together.' In October 2014, Mr Haines signed a joint letter with Mrs Henning calling for all religions to accept each other and for mosques, churches and synagogues to open their doors to all faiths.

"Terry Gibson is sitting in a restaurant in Wimbledon, recalling the 12 absurd and wonderful chapters of his life that were spent in this part of town. ‘It was nuts,’ he says. ‘You didn’t need Fash and Jonesy to lie about what went on — the reality was mad enough.’ In time, Gibson will come back to the sore point of how the Wimbledon side of the Eighties was represented in a recent documentary. Terry Gibson laughs whilst recalling his eventful spell playing for Wimbledon's Crazy Gang . He will address the myth that the Crazy Gang was ruled by the bullying of John Fashanu and Vinnie Jones, even if there is a memory of the former stripped to his underpants and covered in baby oil ahead of a dressing-room fight. But, for now, Gibson wants to laugh rather than seethe. The little striker, who won the Cup, once told Alex Ferguson where to go and pocketed £200 for scouting Pablo Zabaleta, wants to present a fuller picture of life at Plough Lane. ‘I remember Dennis Wise,’ he says. ‘Just after we won the FA Cup in 1988 players were getting sold and he was desperate for Bobby Gould to give him a big move. We went on a trip to Sweden and he’s bought a load of fireworks. Back at the hotel, Wisey is letting them off from the fifth floor into a crowded street. The locals are running for cover. Unbelievable. Bobby knew he was trying to force a move and wouldn’t budge. Just another day at Wimbledon.’ The Wimbledon players celebrate having won the 1988 FA Cup at Wembley against favourites Liverpool . Gibson poses for the camera when speaking to Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai about his career . Gibson laughs. ‘There was a time when Fash was telling the newspapers he was getting threatening letters at the training ground,’ he says. ‘We all knew it was rubbish so one day I cut out letters from a newspaper, like in the films, and spelled, “Meester Fash, we are watching your every move”. I slipped it in his pocket and when he found it he starts panicking. He disappears with his big mobile phone and the next day’s papers say Fash has had another threat. He always was a drama queen.’ Gibson adds: ‘My first day at the club, I saw Wisey pinching the Volkswagen badge off Vinnie Jones’s dad’s truck. Vinnie was panicking that his dad was going to kill him. ‘There were a lot more laughs than people might have thought based only on the documentary.’ John Fashanu, in action during his Wimbledon playing days, was certainly a character in the Crazy Gang . Gibson, like most associated with the programme, The Crazy Gang, has taken exception to claims from Fashanu that he was ‘the leader’ and ruled by fear. ‘The truth is we tolerated Fash,’ says Gibson, who spent six years at the club. ‘He was a bit of a clown. He was the perfect player for us but he always tried to present himself as something he wasn’t, even then. ‘Yes, you had to be very tough to survive at the club. Grown men would cry. But there was so much more to how Wimbledon achieved what we did. For Fash to imply he controlled our dressing room with intimidation is just false. ‘Of course there were fights but Fash exaggerated. Jonesy told the story about Fash locking the dressing room and throwing an unnamed player against a bench and splitting his leg open. Stitches, etc. Gibson was former team-mate Lawrie Sanchez's assistant at Wycombe, Northern Ireland and Fulham . ‘The lad was Robbie Turner and, as I remember it, Fash strips to his pants and covers himself in baby oil. They slipped around a bit and no punches were thrown. Yes, Robbie badly injured his calf on the bench but it was not split open with blood everywhere. ‘The stories were all embellished. It was no Mafia, it was more a boarding school of very naughty boys.’ A deeper perspective is found in Gibson’s new book, Giant Killer. It’s a wonderful autobiography, self-written across three years. The book charts his rise from Tottenham, to Coventry, to Manchester United and on to the high points at Wimbledon, before Gibson became Lawrie Sanchez’s assistant at Northern Ireland, Fulham and Wycombe. The 52-year-old, in action for Wimbledon (right) works for Sky Sports, commenting on Spanish football . ‘The game changed a bit in those three decades,’ he says. ‘When Spurs signed me as a kid they offered my parents a holiday and I was hoping they would choose somewhere abroad — they asked for this camp in Dovercourt! At least the club sent a limo.’ It was at Coventry that Gibson played alongside Sam Allardyce and Stuart Pearce. ‘We went to Bisham Abbey once,’ Gibson says. ‘Pearce and Micky Adams were sharing and Ashley Grimes was in with Sam. We’d all had a drink one night. ‘Somehow Micky and Pearcie got into the others’ room at something like 3am and tossed all their gear in the courtyard. Sam and Grimes go to fetch it but get locked out in the rain. God, they were out there for maybe an hour. Sam was getting all this abuse, Pearcie and Micky calling him a northern so-and-so and laughing at him, saying, “No wonder Millwall got rid of you”. Wimbledon players in training during the Crazy Gang era with Fashanu (centre) and Vinnie Jones . ‘Next thing there is a huge crash. Sam has found a fire extinguisher and thrown it through their window. I can still hear Sam saying, “Oh s***. I didn’t mean it. It slipped”. Priceless.’ After three good years at Coventry, Gibson joined Manchester United for a difficult 18 months, in which he repeatedly felt ‘belittled’ by Ron Atkinson. ‘You could see the glow of his sunbed from the training pitch,’ Gibson says. ‘He just picked on me for reasons I never understood.’ At one point, Gibson pulled out of a move to Watford because he correctly anticipated Atkinson would be sacked and a fresh start might await. Atkinson’s exit meant Alex Ferguson’s arrival. ‘Alex was always honest with me — a good man,’ Gibson says. ‘I got the hairdryer once after a reserve game and told him to shove it all up his a***. Gibson endured a difficult 18 months at Manchester United (left) and was brought to Wimbledon in 1987 . ‘The next morning I went to apologise and he said he admired my spirit. I liked him but it never worked out for me at United.’ Gould brought Gibson to Wimbledon in 1987 — the manager allegedly ate 12 sheep testicles to get Sam Hammam to sanction the move — and his playing career re-started. ‘I could have done a book on Wimbledon alone,’ he says. In retirement Gibson went on to form a fine coaching partnership with Sanchez at Northern Ireland, which included capping Jonny Evans from United after ‘my son realised from playing Championship Manager on the computer that he was eligible for us’. Gibson has detailed his eclectic career in a book called Giant Killer, which is available at terrygibson.london . In a career of surreal moments, it seems about right. There was also a £200-a-week scouting position for Manchester City in Spain that saw him recommend Zabaleta. ‘The club did OK out of it,’ he says. These days the 52-year-old commentates on Spanish football for Sky and is happy to be out of the thick of it. ‘I think I’ve had probably enough of that craziness in my life,’ he says. He’s probably right. Terry Gibson’s book Giant Killer is available at www.terrygibson.london .","Former Wimbledon striker Terry Gibson talks about the Crazy Gang .

"This is the moment a father tried to help his police officer son escape after he shot a man during an off-duty bar fight. Salome Rodriguez, 23, died from multiple gunshot wounds after Henry Solis turned on him outside a nightclub in Pomona, California,  on March 13. The 27-year-old probationary LAPD officer fled the scene to go to his father's house, an affidavit from an FBI agent claims. Victor Solis (left in both pictures) was charged with making false statements yesterday after CCTV footage (above) showed him helping his son cross the border into Mexico. Henry Solis (right in both pictures) shot a man outside a nightclub in Pomona, California, on March 13 . Victor Solis alleged his son was at his house because he needed to be dropped at a bus shelter to undertake five days of vacation in El Paso, Texas. The FBI said the pair walked to Juarez, Mexico, from El Paso just one day after the murder.

"Former Liverpool winger John Barnes has warned Raheem Sterling about setting his ambitions too high, too soon. The 20-year-old is currently locked in contract negotiations with the Reds after rejecting what manager Brendan Rodgers described as an 'incredible' offer, reportedly £100,000-a-week. His current deal is not due to expire until 2017 but the current impasse in talks - which will not resume until the end of the season - has led the youngster to be linked with a number of Europe's top clubs. There has been much speculation over the future of Liverpool youngster Raheem Sterling (centre) Sterling, who is currently on international duty with England, is in the process of negotiating a new contract . Barnes believes it would be a mistake, however, for Sterling to go looking for a multi-million pound move before he has properly proved himself. 'I would advise any young player who has been in the game for one or one and half years to stay and learn his trade,' he told talkSPORT. 'Show consistency over a four or five-year period before you make a big move, because then he will be judged as a £50million player. 'I don't think he is ready for a move to Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester City. Talks have finished until the end of the season, but there has been speculation over a big-money move abroad . Former Liverpool winger John Barnes believes that Sterling should stay and learn his trade at Anfield . 'As a Liverpool fan I want him to stay but I think himself he needs to be very careful. 'Unfortunately the bad advice often sounds the most lucrative and therefore the best advice. 'Has he been playing consistently well over a long time? No he hasn't, and maybe his form has suffered because of the whole situation about that (contract).' Barnes said recent history is littered with examples of poor decisions and failures by young players and he did not want Sterling to make the same mistake. 'We saw it with Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell, who both went to Man City. Where are they now?' he added. 'I think any young player should show a level of consistency where you are happy and people accept you and then if you want to put yourself under pressure by making a big money move do that - because it can all go wrong. Sterling needs to show consistency over a four or five-year period to warrant a big move, according to Barnes . Barnes noted that Sterling should not make the same mistake as Scott Sinclair, who moved prematurely . 'I think [he needs] another two or three years at Liverpool and if he then decides he wants to move on then fine.' While Sterling is still trying to establish himself as one of Liverpool's top players, one of their very best - Steven Gerrard - will be leaving in the summer to join Los Angeles Galaxy. There have been suggestions the Reds captain's legacy has been tarnished somewhat by his senseless sending-off against Manchester United last Sunday, coming a year after his slip against Chelsea played a huge part in the club missing out on the title. Barnes, however, dismissed such talk. 'Steven Gerrard and Kenny Dalglish are the two greatest players for Liverpool,' he said. 'Nothing has changed because he got sent off against Manchester United and nothing will change in the rest for the season.'","Raheem Sterling has been linked with a move away from Liverpool .

"The fight to get to this point only makes the prize on offer more precious. For David Marshall, retaining his place against Gibraltar would matter every bit as much as facing Germany. The Cardiff City goalkeeper has been Gordon Strachan’s pick for each of the four Euro 2016 qualifiers to date. He has not let his manager down, yet is keenly aware that competition for the jersey continues to intensify. Craig Gordon and Allan McGregor each played 45 minutes of Wednesday night’s 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland. If one were reading the runes, it might suggest that Marshall will get the run-out when Gibraltar visit Hampden tomorrow. Scotland's David Marshall admits retaining place against Gibraltar is as important as facing Germany . The 30-year-old will assume nothing, however, until he has heard Strachan read out the 11 names in the morning. If that leads to a 17th cap, there will be no hint of complacency. Marshall went through years of travelling away with the national squad without much hope of playing. On the rare occasions he was selected, he had an unfortunate tendency to end up on the wrong end of a hefty scoreline through no error of his own. It almost seemed the fates were conspiring against him, but Marshall transformed the situation through his outstanding form for Cardiff in the Premier League last season. Having finally leap to the front of the queue, he is determined to stay there. ‘Everyone knows my history with Scotland,’ Marshall reflected. ‘I had to wait years and years to get caps, so it makes each one more valuable now as I get older. ‘I don’t want to give it up, so I’ll just continue to do what I can. It doesn’t matter to me if it is Germany or Gibraltar. There is a lot of pressure on us to win the game and it puts us in a great position if we manage to do it. Gordon Strachan has picked David Marshall for all four Euro 2016 qualifiers to date . ‘Years ago, I never thought I should be playing. Craig was brilliant. Then Allan came in at a stage when I wasn’t playing. So there was never a time when I expected to play. ‘It’s just in the last couple of years when I have got myself to a level where I can believe in myself to go and play. Injuries put Allan and Craig out and I managed to get a chance and play well, so that’s why I was probably in the team. ‘With the standard of the keepers here, it’s difficult to consider yourself the No 1. I’ve waited a long time to get a chance, but the boys are all fit. Craig has done great to get playing at Celtic and Allan is playing in the Premier League. ‘I don’t think it would be a massive decision whoever played, but the gaffer has stuck with me since the beginning of the campaign and I hope to keep playing well and stay in the side.’ Clearly, there is a professional rivalry within the goalkeeping trio, described by no less a judge than Andy Goram as Scotland’s best-ever crop. But it is distinctly cordial in nature. Marshall has not yet let his manager down, but is aware that competition is rising in the ranks . ‘We’ve been together for a long time now,’ said Marshall. ‘I’ve been here for over 10 years and Craig has been the same, obviously minus a couple of years through injury. ‘We know each other so well and we are used to the standard. When we are together, it hopefully lifts us to make each other better. ‘When I was younger, Andy Goram and Jim Leighton were great. That was a great group of goalkeepers, so to hear what Andy – a legend for Rangers and Scotland – said is a great honour. ‘But we can’t read too much into that. We just have to keep performing as that is what you are judged on. We need to concentrate and do our best for the rest for the rest of the campaign. ‘I would definitely consider the other guys friends. I shared a room with Craig for five or six years at the start with Scotland. ‘It might be a bit different at club level when there is that one place. But being here is about the country. We have not been at a championship for so long, so there is no room for sticking the knife in each other’s back. We are all together.’ Allan McGregor kept a clean sheet during 45 minutes of action in a friendly against Northern Ireland . Whoever is selected tomorrow, they will face a most curious assignment. Gibraltar have lost their four Group D fixtures by an aggregate score of 21-0. Unless something very odd happens, the Scotland penalty area should verge on a no-go zone. ‘It’s a difficult game to talk about,’ admitted Marshall. ‘Concentration levels have got to be high and football is weird. There could be a deflection, a set-piece, anything. ‘We need to start the game well as the earlier we can score the better. Craig Gordon kept a clean sheet in 45 minutes of action in a friendly against Northern Ireland . ‘This is probably the only time with Scotland that you are expected not to have too much to do. ‘But concentration is a massive thing in goalkeeping. I had it with Celtic when I was younger, when you would play a lot of games where there was not a lot to do. You just have to deal with it and train as normal. ‘Would I prefer to be busy? No, I prefer doing nothing! But you just don’t know how it is going to play out. You can’t go into a game relaxed. You treat it like any normal game and hope the boys up front can help you out.’","Gordon Strachan has picked David Marshall for all four Euro 2016 qualifiers .

"What is the biggest concern for a Navy veteran, with no formal managerial experience, preparing to lead another country's team out in front of 30,000 of his baying compatriots? 'Suit or tracksuit?' jokes Gibraltar's interim head coach Davie Wilson, who will attempt to guide UEFA's newest member to an historic result at Hampden Park on Sunday. He adds: 'Growing up in Scotland, it's a boyhood dream to step out at Hampden for your country. But to step out for another country against your own country… I'm totally mixed with emotions. Davie Wilson (centre) was born in Scotland but is the current Gibraltar interim head coach . 'I'm massively humbled, yet there's a little devil on my other shoulder saying, 'What are you doing? People might never speak to you again'.' But the 41-year-old freely admits it would take a very poor performance from Gordon Strachan's men for his charges to leave Glasgow with anything more than pride. Wilson, part-time head coach, part-time exercise rehabilitation officer, was on the books at Kilmarnock during his teens, but decided the Navy offered a more realistic opportunity. After two decades at sea, Gibraltar was to be his final port of call, and he has an obvious fondness for the British territory. 'I miss the Scottish scenery but where I am now ticks the boxes,' he says. 'After 21 years travelling the world, I've found somewhere I feel is home.' The former assistant head coach, who was handed the reins just three weeks ago, is enjoying every minute of his adventure but the national anthems will throw up an unusual dilemma. 'How do you stop a Scotsman singing Flower of Scotland? You can't,' he admits. 'If it was New Year's Eve I'd be on the table singing it like I meant it! At Hampden I'll be singing it, but I don't have to show that passion. Scotland are heavy favourites for the clash and will be expecting to vastly improve their goal difference . 'I'll be passionate during the Gibraltar national anthem. I've sung it every game for the last two and a half years and I've felt the hairs rise on my arm. On Sunday I'll feel the hairs rise for both anthems. 'Gibraltarians are close to the Scots in terms of being passionate about who they are. As a nation, Scotland feel they're not given the freedom they deserve, Gibraltar is the same.' The debutant manager must prepare his squad with only three professional footballers. Their occupations range from policemen and firemen to solicitors and customs officers. How must Wilson have felt when his team lined up against the Germans in Nuremberg last November? He says: 'As world champions, they were expected to trounce us. I listened to Alan McInally's commentary and, when Thomas Muller scored the first goal, he said, 'I'm fully expecting the Germans to put on a cricket score tonight'. But they didn't. (They won 4-0). You could see it in their manager's face when we had a shot at goal, and a second shot at goal and a corner. He was angry. Scotland duo Christophe Berra (right) and Craig Forsyth train ahead of their side's forthcoming clash . 'We've got to build for the next 10 or 20 years. We won't find a Lionel Messi in a country of 30,000 — there will be more people in the crowd on Sunday than in our entire country.' Wilson would clearly relish the chance to oversee Gibraltar's development on a permanent basis. 'It's starting to sit better on my shoulders,' he says. 'I feel confident in my ability and now I'm thinking, 'why not me?'. If I was offered the job I'd bite their hand off.' But whatever happens, Wilson will always have his place in history. 'Not even you journalists could have written this story,' he says. 'If nothing happens after Sunday's game I'll always have this memory. 'I'll tell my grandkids, 'You know, your grandad managed a football team once'. They'd laugh — 'Of course you did grandad. Now tell us another Navy story.'","Davie Wilson is the interim head coach at minnows Gibraltar .

"The entire field is separated by just six shots heading into the final round of the Madeira Islands Open after the tournament was reduced to 36 holes for the second year in succession. The tournament had been cut to three rounds after winds gusting up to 47mph meant no play was possible on Thursday, while further strong winds on Friday caused a delay of almost two hours before rain ended play early. Half of the field had yet to complete their rounds when play was abandoned for the day at 6pm and more rain which flooded the course caused further disruption on Saturday. Heavy rain has forced organisers to reduce the Madeira Islands Open to 36 holes . The European Tour event was reduced for the second year in a row after strong winds and heavy rain .

Denmark's JB Hansen held the clubhouse lead on four under par, one shot ahead of a group of eight players including England's Andrew Marshall and Scotland's Peter Whiteford. 'I'm quite happy, played nicely and left a few out there to be honest, which is nice to say considering I was probably the worst golfer on the European Tour last year!' Whiteford said. 'It's been blowing a hurricane back home so it's kind of what I've been practising in anyway. It's the first time I've been on a golf course and enjoyed it for maybe a year so I'm looking forward to tomorrow. 'I feel very refreshed after taking a little break from the game. The driver is a lot better and that was the thing that was killing me last year, but you work twice as hard when you're playing badly and I was doing more than I should have been doing, working on the wrong things. 'It feels better, the time away helped to refresh the brain a little bit and if I enjoy it I'll play all right. I don't care how I do at the moment as long as I enjoy it. 'It's a major for us on the Challenge Tour, the biggest one of the year so with me certainly, being selfish, I definitely want to get the second round in so I can get a pay cheque and some money onto the rankings. 'After just one round it's going to be an absolute rat race with a huge number of people on the same scores. It'll be a shotgun start so it's not like you'll be under the cosh coming down the stretch because you'll never know where the scores will come from.'

"Jenson Button is convinced ailing McLaren will one day challenge the might of Mercedes despite the two teams currently at opposite ends of the pace spectrum at present. McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda suffered abject humiliation in the season-opening grand prix in Australia earlier this month. The team were already without the services of big-name acquisition Fernando Alonso after the Spaniard sustained concussion in a testing accident in Barcelona. Come the race, reserve Kevin Magnussen failed to even make it to the start line due to a power-unit issue that forced the young Dane to pull over on the formation lap. Jenson Button waves to the crowd before the first race of the season in Australia . McLaren were well of the pace in Melbourne... Button finished 11th, two laps behind winner Lewis Hamilton . At least Button saw the chequered flag, describing it at the time as 'a small victory', albeit finishing two laps down on race-winner Lewis Hamilton in 11th and last place. Despite McLaren's seemingly hopeless position heading into Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix, a positive Button can see hope on the horizon. 'We're a hell of a long way behind, but I feel we have something we can mould into something very special in the future, which is very exciting,' said Button. 'Being 1.5 seconds off the pace and knowing you've peaked with your package, that's got to hurt. 'Whereas at least we have a glimmer of hope we can possibly challenge Mercedes one day.' Asked as to the reasoning behind his belief, Button replied: 'The direction with the car in terms of aerodynamics, but also with how aggressive this engine is, which is why we're having so many issues. 'In many ways - it's probably wrong for me to say - it's probably more like a Mercedes than it is the other two manufacturers (Ferrari and Renault) in terms of design, aggressiveness and packaging. Lewis Hamilton sprays champagne from the podium after winning the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton led team-mate Nico Rosberg home in Melbourne as Mercedes dominated the opening race of 2015 .

'They're not heading to races because they're paid to, they're doing so because they're passionate about racing. They're looking forward to the future as much as I am.' The one bonus for McLaren this weekend is Alonso is poised to return, pending a final medical check by the FIA at the Sepang International Circuit on Thursday. Racing director Eric Boullier, for one, is happy to have the Spaniard back on board as he said: 'I'm pleased to see Fernando back in the car.

Speaking exclusively to The Sun, Henry said: 'People keep telling me that this Manchester United team is about to click, . 'After 28 Premier League games, I'm still waiting. And time is now running out for everything to fall into place for Louis van Gaal. 'This United side looks as though it is still some way off from gelling as the players seem to struggle with the tactics and system of playing. 'The problem is the Dutchman, although an excellent manager with a proven track record, does not seem to know his best team. 'At the start of this season, I had no doubt that United would finish in the top four and return to the Champions League. 'It now looks as though the four will be Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool.' Manchester United will be hoping to bounce back from Monday's FA Cup defeat by Arsenal and open up a five-point lead over Liverpool.","Thierry Henry has tipped Arsenal and Liverpool to finish ahead of United .

"Steven Naismith has refused to rule out a return to Rangers in the future. The 28-year-old Scotland forward signed for Everton in July 2012 after the troubled Ibrox club were on their way to liquidation and before they re-emerged at the bottom tier of Scottish football. Another player who joined the exodus out of Govan that summer was striker Kyle Lafferty. Everton forward Steven Naismith (right) has refused to rule out returning to Rangers in the future . Naismith promotes cheap ticket prices for Scotland's friendly against Northern Ireland at Hampden Park . Naismith joined Everton from Rangers in 2012 with the Ibrox club on their way to liquidation . He moved to Sion in Switzerland and the two players will be united at Hampden Park on Wednesday night when Scotland take on Northern Ireland in a friendly match, which is acting as a warm-up for the Scots' 2016 Euro qualifier against Gibraltar on Sunday. While Rangers can only hope to return to the Scottish Premiership next season through the play-offs, Lafferty was quoted as saying: 'Some Rangers fans have asked me if I'd go back there and I'd jump at the chance.' Naismith understands the sentiment. He said: 'Our times at Rangers are probably the best in our careers. We were a successful team and had some great memories and being a Rangers fan he would have enjoyed it and want to relive them.' When asked if he could see himself ever going back to Ibrox, Naismith replied: 'I don't know what will happen in the coming year never mind the future. Premier League stars Steven Naismith (left) and Darren Fletcher are included in the Scotland squad . Scotland face Northern Ireland in a friendly before a Euro 2016 qualifier with Gibraltar .

Since I've been there it's been a great adventure, from being a substitute and not having an impact to playing in most of the big games and having an impact. 'I love it at the moment but you never know things can change so quickly in football. I'd never rule anything out to be honest.' There has been no end to the turmoil at Rangers since Naismith left and following a recent boardroom coup, former Gers midfielder Stuart McCall was put in charge of the team for the rest of the season which meant he had to step down from his post as Scotland coach. Speaking of that, ex-Kilmarnock player Naismith said: 'It was one of the best decisions the new board could have made. Andrew Reynolds (left) and Stevie May (right) limber up with some stretching excercises . Celtic captain Scott Brown (centre) leads the group in some light training during the session . 'I worked with him here with Scotland. He's great around the squad, he's straight forward even in this environment when he's not the manager. He'll still tell you 'it's not good enough.' 'I think it's a great decision and hopefully from now until the end of the season he can reap the rewards of going in there and getting Rangers back to the Premier League.' Naismith believes the Northern Ireland match will be a more than a typical friendly as Scotland look to then add to seven Euro qualifying points from four games against Group D's bottom side at the weekend. The Toffees forward said: 'The Ireland game is a great game because it will be more than just a friendly, with it being against a country so close to home and with a lot of the players knowing each other and playing against each other. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan oversees a training session at Mar Hall near Glasgow . The former Scotland midfielder gave some advice to up and coming Scottish managers . 'So there will be more of an edge to it. 'It also gets us familiar with the way that we play. It has been a long time away from Scotland and the boys have missed it. 'It is very good to be around the squad at the moment. We have two good games that hopefully we can push on again. 'I never like to put a number on what points you should have where and when, especially in this group. 'But winning the home games in the qualifiers and taking points in the away games will put you in a right good position.'","Scotland forward Steven Naismith joined Everton from Rangers in 2012 .

"Serious injuries to Ben Foster and Fraser Forster have rocked the England squad and Roy Hodgson made no attempt to pretend otherwise. ‘We thought we had three top-class goalkeepers and now we only have one,’ said the England boss. It probably wasn’t what Rob Green and Jack Butland wanted to hear, but at least he was honest. ‘We were devastated,’ said Hodgson, when asked about Forster, who could be out for the rest of the year after surgery to mend a broken knee-cap. Joe Hart is England's only remaining 'world class' keeper after the injuries to Ben Foster and Fraser Forster .

It’s the same with Ben Foster, who will be out for the rest of the season and a good way into next. 'It is a good opportunity for every goalkeeper in the country to show me what they can do. In the past we thought people were hard to replace but others came along.’ Forster, 27, was hurt when he collided with Burnley's Sam Vokes while clearing the ball in Southampton's 2-0 win on Saturday.

"Wales striker Robert Earnshaw has announced his retirement from international football as he moves to the MLS. Earnshaw, who won 58 caps, made the announcement after signing a one-year deal for Major League Soccer side Vancouver Whitecaps. The 33-year-old scored 16 goals for Wales - ranking him joint sixth on the country's all-time list of scorers with Cliff Jones and Mark Hughes - and won his last cap in a 2-0 friendly home defeat to Bosnia-Herzegovina in August 2012. Robert Earnshaw has retired from international football after scoring 16 goals in 58 caps for Wales . Earnshaw has represented his country for over a decade, but hasn't been picked for the side since 2012 . 'It has been a dream come true to have the opportunity to walk out in front of the whole nation and represent Wales in so many important games,' Earnshaw told the official Whitecaps website. 'I am honoured and proud to play for my country for over a decade. I am also extremely thankful for the support I've received over the years from all my Welsh team-mates,coaches, and staff and will be forever grateful because I know I've been in a position that millions dream of.

"David Forde is set to continue as first-choice goalkeeper for the Republic of Ireland in Sunday’s Euro Championship qualifier against Poland in Dublin. Despite Shay Given’s eagerness to return to the frontline again, Ireland manager Martin O’Neill is reluctant to jettison Forde at this critical stage of the qualifiers. The Millwall shotstopper has been rock solid since O’Neill took charge and has also kept two clean sheets against Poland in previous games. David Forde (second right) is set to keep his place in goal for Ireland against Poland on Sunday . Aston Villa No 2 keeper Shay Given trains earlier this week as Forde watches on behind him . The squad worked on set-piece shape behind closed doors at Aviva Stadium on Wednesday where the indications pointed to Forde as the last line of defence against the Poles, ahead of Given. Forde, who is set to win his 24th cap, was watched by O’Neill on club duty last weekend. He was given a vote of confidence by the manager before the Euro 2016 qualifiers kicked off against Georgia last September, even though Given had been recalled. O’Neill faces another massive call regarding Robbie Keane, Ireland’s record goalscorer and most capped player. Keane, who was stationed by the manager’s side in Wednesday’s squad photo shoot, is pushing for a recall after his shock omission against the Scots last November. O’Neill feels Keane is a lot fresher than he was four months ago and will be aware of the need for Ireland to score on Sunday at the Aviva.

McClean (ankle) hasn’t trained since shipping a knock in training on Monday while Ward (ankle) has been on the easy list all week — both players have been first choice on the left flank for O’Neill. Whelan, sorely missed against the Scots in . Glasgow, had a tight hamstring but is expected to be fine. Meanwhile, O’Neill and assistant Roy Keane were on hand last night as the Irish U21s edged out Andorra 1-0 at the RSC in Waterford last night.

"Dave Bassett and Wally Downes are to set the record straight about the glory days at Wimbledon after agreeing to write a book about the club’s incredible rise through the Football League. Bassett claimed that the Crazy Gang had been misrepresented in a 90 minute BT Sport documentary - which won an award at the Sports Journalists’ Association dinner on Monday - screened late last year. Bassett, who was manager of the Dons between 1981 and 1987 and his former player Downes are working in collaboration on the new book.

They started work on the project on Wednesday and the book is expected to be released towards the end of the year. Bassett, who won four promotions with the Dons and took them into the old First Division, is wounded by the portrayal of the Crazy Gang as a team of thugs who would go to any lengths to beat the opposition. On Monday night, the documentary maker’s acceptance speech included a reference to Bassett’s trenchant views on the content of the film. In the documentary Vinnie Jones claimed he was the leader of the dressing room and John Fashanu had his own colourful version of events on the club’s rise through the divisions.

"18-year-old Edryd James has apologised to rugby referee Nigel Owens for sending him a homophobic tweet following England's Six Nations victory against France, Dyfed Powys Police have revealed. The pair met as part of an Agreed Community Resolution during which James apologised for the offence he had caused. An official statement from the Dyfed Powys Police read: 'Rugby referee Nigel Owens has met face to face with the 18-year-old from Cynwyl Elfed who sent him a homophobic tweet after the recent England v France Six Nations match. Nigel Owens (pictured speaking to England's fly-half George Ford) took charge of Saturday's Six Nations match between England and France . Welsh rugby fan Edryd James has apologised to Owens following a police investigation after homophobic abuse was posted from his Twitter account . 'As part of an agreed Adult Community Resolution, the male apologised to Mr Owens for the offence he had caused at a meeting held at Carmarthen Police Station on Wednesday, March 25. 'An Adult Community Resolution is an alternative way of resolving crimes allowing victims to be involved in deciding how the offender can be dealt with by choosing from a list of out-of-court options. 'The victim must agree to deal with the offence that way and the offender must admit the offence and agree to participate in the process.' Inspecter Stuart Bell added: 'I am satisfied that this matter has been effectively resolved by Dyfed Powys Police with an outcome that was satisfactory for both parties. The person responsible realises his mistake and I’m sure he will have learned from this experience. 'Dyfed Powys Police will not tolerate discrimination of any kind and the public need to realise that if offensive comments are made on social media, they are not above the law and we will investigate the matter as we would any other.' James was in the eye of a storm of controversy after the short message appeared on his account on Saturday evening. The Swansea University student is suspected of posting: ‘Your a gay c*** awful performance against france tonight, how did england top Wales?’ The comment sparked hundreds of replies in which rugby fans of all colours said it was disgraceful and voiced their support for Owens. But James, who lives with his family in Cynwyl Elfed, near Carmarthen, West Wales, claimed his phone had been stolen and he was not responsible. The teenager, who describes himself online in Welsh as a ‘Welshman who enjoys life’, has posted many other comments about his love of rugby and heavy drinking sessions. His mother Meiner James, 58, told the Daily Mail she was ‘aware something has happened’ and said she was ‘trying to get to the bottom of it’. Owens, once named as gay sports personality of the year, was encouraged by many other internet users to report the abuse while others said he should ignore it. The veteran referee – who came out seven years ago – was generally praised for his control of England’s 55-35 victory over France. James, 18, was in the eye of a storm of controversy after the short message appeared on his account on Saturday evening . Owens, who came out as gay seven years ago, replied to the tweet and it was later reported to the police . Among those who spoke out for him were former Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies, Will Carling and Wasps fly-half Andy Goode. Owens later tweeted: ‘An absolute pleasure & privilege to ref one of the best games of rugby ever. Huge credit to England & France for making it a great game.’ It was the first time Owens had taken charge at Twickenham since he received homophobic abuse from the stands during England’s 24-21 defeat to New Zealand in the autumn. On that occasion two people were banned from Rugby HQ for two years and ordered to pay £1,000 to a charity of Owens’ choice.

Trolls who post racist, homophobic and threatening abuse have been dealt with extremely harshly in other high profile cases. Police forces are keen to show that comments made online are as damaging as those made to someone’s face in the street. Last year a Twitter troll was jailed for 18 weeks for bombarding a Labour MP with abusive messages after she supported a successful campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note. Peter Nunn, 33, from Bristol, retweeted ‘menacing' posts threatening to rape Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, and branded her a 'witch'. Last month Twitter’s chief executive admitted that the company ‘sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls’ in a leaked memo.

"The international break is usually a time for Premier League managers to clear their thoughts, regroup and kick on for the rest of the season. But with the summer transfer window fast approaching, scouting has gone into overdrive and several top clubs have players lined up for bids in June. So, with most nations in action over in the next week, Sportsmail takes a look at where you can find your next potential star. Borussia Dortmund is one of several possible Premier League signings in action over the next week . Nicolas Otamendi (Valencia) ARGENTINA vs El Salvador, Ecuador . The Valencia defender has been linked with a switch to Manchester United, though it will cost Louis van Gaal £37million to meet his buy-out clause. Argentina play two international friendlies before the Copa America starts this summer, and should be expected to turn on the style. Nicolas Otamendi is a Manchester United transfer target but Valencia won't let the defender go on the cheap . Memphis Depay (PSV), Stefan De Vrij (Lazio) HOLLAND vs Turkey, Spain . Manchester United and Tottenham are both watching PSV winger Depay, while De Vrij was watched by a Red Devils scout when Lazio beat Hellas Verona at the weekend. Holland are looking to recover in their qualification for Euro 2016, before a high-profile friendly against Vicente Del Bosque's Spain side. Can they repeat their World Cup win? Memphis Depay is enjoying a fine season with club and country and Tottenham Hotspur retain an interest . Man United scouts watched Lazio defender Stefan de Vrij in action against Hellas Verona on Saturday . Andriy Yarmolenko (Dynamo Kiev), Yevhen Konoplyanka (Dnipro) UKRAINE vs Spain, Latvia . Liverpool have been tracking this duo, who are still both plying their trade in their native country. The Reds came within whiskers from signing Konoplyanka at the end of the January transfer window last season. With his contract expiring this summer, the qualifier with Spain and friendly against Latvia will be a good chance to impress. Yevhen Konoplyanka (right) was minutes away from joining Liverpool during last January's transfer window . Andriy Yarmolenko will also be in action for Ukraine this week and is another Premier League target . Danilo (Porto) BRAZIL vs France, Chile . Real Madrid are thought to be the favourites to the sign the Porto right back, who has shunted Dani Alves out of the side and been compared to Cafu. But Manchester United still hold a firm interest in him, and he is expected to start in the glamour friendly in Paris on Thursday night. Danilo has been compared to Cafu with the Brazilian national team and has ousted Dani Alves from the squad . Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) GERMANY vs Australia, Georgia . Mats Hummels is set to leave Dortmund. Could Louis van Gaal finally prise away the captain he has been after? United will be one of many clubs holding a firm eye on Germany's friendly with Australia on Wednesday evening, as well as the qualifier against Georgia. Mats Hummels is set to leave Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United could pay the £36million fee . Yacine Brahimi (Porto) ALGERIA vs Qatar, Oman . Yacini Brahimi has been a driving force for Porto this season, and was a star at the World Cup with unfancied African nation Algeria last summer. Mancehester City are thought to be admirers, and Brahimi will be in action in the two friendlies in the Middle East. Yacine Brahimi is enjoying a fine season with Porto and is the Algeria national team's star man . Kevin de Bruyne (Wolfsburg) BELGIUM vs Cyprus, Israel . Bayern Munich are thought to be the frontrunners for the former Chelsea midfielder now shining at Wolfsburg, but could Jose Mourinho be tempted to go back in for De Bruyne? The Belgians host Cyprus in a Euro qualifier on Saturday, before a friendly away at Israel three days later. Kevin de Bruyne (second right) has most recently been linked with a move to  Bayern Munich . Aleksandar Dragovic (Dynamo Kiev) AUSTRIA vs Liechtenstein, Bosnia-Herzegovina . A highly-rated centre back, Dynamo Kiev are resigned to losing Dragovic to one of the top European clubs. Arsenal are interested, but Liverpool and Everton could also place a bid this summer. Fancy watching him in action? Aleksander Dravovic is a promising defender and will be in action for Austria over the international break . William Carvalho (Sporting Lisbon) PORTUGAL vs Serbia, Cape Verde Islands . The Carvalho saga continues. The holding midfielder is an ever-present in an impressive Sporting Lisbon side, but Premier League clubs are yet to take a risk with the youngster. Now shining for his national side too, he'll be in action against Serbia and the Cape Verde Islands. William Carvalho continues to be linked with several of the Premier League's top clubs . Jackson Martinez (Porto) COLOMBIA vs Bahrain, Kuwait . Another man impressing in Portugal, club side Porto say the poacher can leave if a suitable offer comes in. The Colombia star has lavished praise on Arsenal in the past, and there may be scouts watching as the South American nation play two friendlies in the far-east. Jackson Martinez has admitted in the past that a move to Arsenal from Porto would interest him .","Premier League on hold while international games take place this week .

Hodgson said that the current problem was 'not endemic' but simply 'these things happen sometimes' 'The Premier League won't want to lose their fourth spot in the competition and the clubs won't want that because the Champions League is a major target for them when they start the season. 'Unfortunately, its a fact of life that if you want your four places, you need to get the points to keep your status high. 'I don't think it's endemic that we've had teams going out. 'Manchester City came up against Barcelona. Arsenal were fantastic in their second game against Monaco but weren't able to turn it around. Chelsea and PSG were unbelievably close in the two games - nobody would have complained should Chelsea have gone through instead of PSG. Manchester City became the last Premier League side out of Europe, losing to Lionel Messi's Barcelona . Hodsgon said that no one would have questioned if Chelsea had come through instead of PSG . Arsenal fought bravely in return leg against Monaco but paid the price for a poor home tie . 'Its a fact of live, these things happen sometimes. There will be other times when all four teams get through and we'l be saying we were a bit lucky because the opponents were just as good. 'Its a very high standard of football. I feel sorry for the mangers going into these games because we can underestimate the quality of teams in these other leagues and there's no God given  right to get through.

"The mouth-watering prospect of the Clasico at the Nou Camp does put the Premier League into perspective in a week of European failure. On Sunday night we have Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema against Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi. Meanwhile our own version of a clasico wil be taking place at Anfield — but no club in the Premier League has a forward line like those in Spain. Increasingly we’re a stepping stone to better things, having lost Bale and Suarez to Spain. What is obvious, however, is that the failure in the Champions League was not a failure of English clubs. It was a failure of clubs with owners from Abu Dhabi, the USA and Russia. In those Champions League games there were five English players in the three starting XIs. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar Jnr will be in action for Barcelona on Sunday night . Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema will be hoping to fire Real Madrid to victory in the Clasico . Fernandinho was signed by Manchester City for £35million from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013 . Manchester City became the last English team to be knocked out of the Champions League last week . Manchester City's players leave the Nou Camp looking glum after being eliminated by Barcelona . Tottenham's Ryan Mason has enjoyed an impressive season after breaking into the first team . And the managers were from Chile, France and Portugal. The Premier League may be failing but it’s not its Englishness letting it down. So now that even a huge influx of global thinking and talent at both executive and playing level at football clubs has failed, perhaps we can rethink the premise that we need to keep bringing in players and directors from abroad. Of course, there will always be room for the best imports. But you can’t tell me Fernandinho is a better player and better prospect than Ryan Mason. They do a similar job, the only difference being he is a £35million transfer and therefore deemed worthy of a place at a top-four club. It’s time to ensure that some of the proposals from the FA commission, which I sat on, come into place, not least the tightening up of work permits on foreign imports so that only the best from outside the European Union can play here. We’re failing in Europe anyway so the Premier League need to ensure we’re not forever looking overseas for solutions.","Premier League clubs not failing in Europe because of their Englishness .

"On an evening when cross-city rivals Manchester City were sent crashing out of Europe, United record signing Angel di Maria resisted revelling in their exit to take a stroll with wife Jorgelina Cardoso. The reigning Premier League champions failed to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the fourth consecutive season - losing 1-0 to a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona at the Nou Camp, although without City keeper Joe Hart the scoreline would have been more damaging. Di Maria and his wife have endured a difficult introduction to Manchester after a failed attempt to burgle their home while the family, including young daughter Mia, were inside saw them leave in search of safer accommodation.

City failed to reach the Champions League last eight after being beaten by Lionel Messi and Barcelona . Things on the pitch have been equally challenging for the 27-year-old who has struggled for form in recent months and was suspended for United's 3-0 victory over Tottenham on Sunday, where Louis van Gaal's side arguably delivered their best performance of the season. Di Maria will be available for United's eagerly anticipated clash with Liverpool on Sunday as both teams compete for a top-four finish that will bring Champions League football next season. However, former Old Trafford captain Bryan Robson believes the manager faces a decision over whether to bring his £60million record signing straight back into the team. Di Maria had been struggling with a loss of form before being sent off in United's FA Cup defeat by Arsenal . Di Maria missed United's impressive win over Spurs, which included Wayne Rooney's classic goal celebration . Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: 'It is a big call for Louis van Gaal. 'You have to look at the situation. Certain away games are a lot tougher than your home matches. You go for more attacking flair in a home game whilst away you do try and get more of a balance where you have defensive security and then you counter attack. 'Angel has had ups and downs. Like everybody else he has had some periods when he's played really well and then some poor performances. He is no different to anybody else. 'It has taken him time to settle into the English game, getting used to the manager and his formations. Foreign players do need time.

"Islamic State miltiants threatened to give anyone caught watching last Sunday's Real Madrid versus Barcelona  match 80 lashes. The militant group has imposed a strict ban against any entertainment including music and football which it considers a 'product of the decadent West.' Clerics issued the edict across all the Isis-held territories in Syria and Northern Iraq, including the city of Mosul which has been governed as per the strict dictates of Sharia since it was taken under Isis control in June. Islamic State banned anyone watching the Real Madrid versus Barcelona football match last Sunday (pictured is Luis Suarez celebrating his goal at the game) It is not yet known if anyone was caught watching El Clasico in which Barcelona secured a 2-1 win over Real Madrid with Luis Suarez's second-half winner. A Kudistan Democratic Party source told The Sun: 'IS prohibits watching and playing any sport, particularly football as it seen as a product of the decadent West.' In January, Isis militants  executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week. The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State. The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns, anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently reports. Horrifying: ISIS militants rounded up the 13 teenage boys, whose only crime was watching football on television, and executed then by firing squad in Mosul, and Iraqi city under ISIS control (stock image) Crime: The teenagers had been watching this game between Jordan and Iraq in the Asian Cup, which took place  in Brisbane, Australia on January 12 . It noted that 'the bodies of the dead boys were left in the open', as ISIS had warned anyone from touching their bodies. Last month the militant group imposed a curfew in the city of Tel Abiad North of Raqqa province, according to Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently - a small activist collective which secretly documents the shocking violence and oppression ISIS has brought to their home city. The curfew, from eleven at night until six in the morning, prevented civilians from exiting their houses under any circumstances.","ISIS imposed a strict ban on Real Madrid versus Barcelona match .

"The damning thing for Leicester in this match they really needed to win was that there was no cavalry charge, no guns blazing crescendo. Tom Huddlestone was dismissed for second bookable offence with 18 minutes to go but Allan McGregor in the Hull goal had not one meaningful save to make as the clock ticked down. In fact, it was Mark Schwarzer who had to be alert. In the final minute he reacted expertly to stop an Abel Hernandez shot following a quickly-taken free-kick by Dame N’Doye. Had that gone in, the obituaries on Leicester’s Premier League life could have been signed off.

Leicester are seven points from safety, even if Sunderland are dropping like a stone having played a game more. Leicester’s match in hand is against Chelsea. Martin O’Neill was at the King Power Stadium as a guest of the club he served so well in two League Cup triumphs. This season is heading for a more sombre conclusion to those heady days. Nigel Pearson is realistic, knowing uncommon improvement is needed immediately. ‘We’ve got ten games left, six at home, we probably need to win five,’ he said having seen his side win only four times all campaign. ‘When the pressure was on us to go and create I don’t think we did. We were laboured.’ Steve Bruce was disappointed at a different aspect, the clamour for a card from Leicester players when Alex Bruce tackled Riyad Mahrez in the second half. The ball was won but referee Jon Moss produced a yellow, soon after erring similarly in booking Craig Dawson. Leicester City keeper Mark Schwarzer punches clear as Dame N'Doye of Hull and Ritchie De Laet of the Foxes vie for the ball . ‘There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I’ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make,’ said Bruce. ‘If we’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it’s not right.’ When a game begins with six centre-halves on the pitch there is a reasonable assumption goals will be in short supply. Jake Livermore of Hull attempts to keep possession at the King Power Stadium under pressure from Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso . Leicester matched Hull in a 3-5-2 formation, with half a dozen genuine defenders concentrating solely on keeping the ball away from danger. They did their jobs well, in a contest that began so short on opportunities or entertainment mass narcolepsy was an entirely possible outcome. It took Leicester until 62 minutes to register a shot on target, and even that was a mishit cross by Jamie Vardy, requiring a palm over from McGregor. Hull were only marginally better, but should have gone ahead in the 20th minute only for Nikica Jelavic to get himself in a terrible tangle. In a contender for miss of the season, he failed to put boot to ball from six yards with the net open. Huddlestone chipped the ball over the backline of blue shirts to find Ahmed Elmohamady sprinting clear, having timed his run perfectly to stay onside. The Egyptian squared the ball to take out Schwarzer but Jelavic failed badly. Six minutes later he did have the ball in the back of the net. But Moss had already blown for a foul on Schwarzer by N’Doye. Leicester’s best opening of the first-half came in the 34th minute when Mahrez delivered a wicked cross that bent into the area in front of Andrej Kramaric. But the £9million striker was either caught on his heels or disinclined to make the leap required to meet the ball and it drifted wide. Tom Huddlestone puts in a robust challenge on Leicester City striker Andrej Kramaric during the Premier League clash on Saturday . Referee Jonathan Moss hands out the yellow card to Hull City defender Alex Bruce (left) as tempers threatened to boil over . This was a bad game for Kramaric, unable to affect it in any way and he was hooked for Leonardo Ulloa after an hour. Soon after Jelavic headed over from a corner by Gaston Ramirez. That is when Leicester began to make a more concerted effort to win three points rather than one. Vardy was a nuisance all match for the Hull defenders, his pace and energy unsettling. It was he who stretched his legs down the left before cutting in and forcing Huddlestone into a foul he wished not to make. He tried to back out of it but the contact sent Vardy to the floor. Abel Hernandez of Hull City has his head in his hands after a missed chance to fire the Tigers into the lead at the King Power Stadium . Moss, soon after dishing out two wholy incorrect bookings for ‘fouls’ by Dawson and Bruce, got this yellow right. From the free-kick Jeff Schlupp struck a shot that was heading in until Ulloa inadvertently blocked. With the man advantage Leicester pressed but without cultivating anything to truly worry Bruce. The crowd willed the ball in for the final few minutes but boos greeted the final whistle. This felt like a fatal opportunity missed.","Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone sent off in the second-half for two bookable offences .

"The Spanish press has laid into Real Madrid, and in particular the world's two most expensive players, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, after their defeat to Barcelona on Sunday. AS showed a picture of Ronaldo missing from four yards, with the headline 'they missed and they paid for it', while Marca went with Bale's reaction and the line 'so many misses'. Both Madrid-based papers emphasise Real's superiority during the game, with AS claiming they 'dominated while Modric lasted', and attacking Bale for 'failing again'. AS say Real 'missed and they paid for it' while Marca highlight Madrid's dominance and their misses . Marca (left) refused to give Gareth Bale a rating, while AS said his performance was worth only 4.5 out of 10 . Marca went even further, refusing to give the Welshman a mark in their player ratings. He scored 4.5, the lowest of all the players, from AS. Marc were more kind to the rest of the Real players, claiming Madrid 'overwhelmed Barca for 45 minutes, don’t finish them off and end up against the ropes'. Both papers also feature Spaniards playing in England on their front pages, with Juan Mata's spectacular volley at Anfield, and Diego Costa's withdrawal from the Spain squad, making the headlines. However, elsewhere in Spain, in the Barcelona-based papers in particular, the focus was on the gap Luis Enrique's team have opened up at the top of La Liga.

"Leeds will attempt to plunder the points from another smash-and-grab act when they take on Catalans Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday. While the rest of the English Super League clubs spend two or even three nights on their annual trips to the south of France, the Rhinos charter their own plane to get them in and out of the city on the day of the game. It is a move that has paid off so far, with Brian McDermott's men winning on each of their last three trips to the Stade Gilbert Brutus, and the coach believes it could be even more important this time with the hectic Easter programme coming up. Leeds Rhinos boss Brian McDermott set for clash with Catalan Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday . 'There's a lot of meticulous planning involved but it's something we prefer to do and it's a more efficient way of doing it,' McDermott said. 'Sometimes we don't treat our players as robustly as they should be treated, certainly in terms of travel. 'It's worked well for us. I don't think travelling on the day of the game is as detrimental as you would imagine, although I wouldn't do it every single weekend. 'What it does do is help you recover for the following game. The players get to spend the night before they travel in their own bed and on the night of the game they're back in their own bed again, albeit later than normal.' The Dragons have also chartered their own plane for trips to England but they spent last week in Manchester to take in back-to-back away games against the two Hull clubs. Brad Singleton of Leeds Rhinos scores his teams third try of the game against Wigan last week . That exercise can only be described as a failure after Laurent Frayssinous' men lost both games, conceding 83 points in the process, but McDermott expects them to be back to their formidable best back on French soil, where they are unbeaten so far this year. 'I am sure they will be good,' McDermott said. 'They'll be determined to turn things around. Every team has a tussle with them when they go out there.' Saturday's meeting between the clubs will be the first since the Catalans ended Leeds' play-off hopes with a dramatic 24-20 triumph at Headingley last September. Leeds are still without skipper Kevin Sinfield, as well as prop Kylie Leuluai and winger Tom Briscoe, so Liam Sutcliffe, Ash Handley and Andy Yates keep their places following the win over Wigan. Frayssinous recalls half-back Scott Dureau and threequarters Ben Pomeroy - who has completed a one-match ban - and Mathias Pala to take the places of Todd Carney, Vincent Duport and Michael Oldfield, who were all injured in the defeat at Hull FC.","Leeds Rhinos face Catalan Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday .

"Leeds' England international Tom Briscoe will be sidelined for around three months with a shoulder injury, coach Brian McDermott has confirmed. The 25-year-old former Hull winger, who missed just two matches in his first season with the Rhinos in 2014, will undergo surgery on Saturday after scans revealed the full extent of an injury he has been carrying for a few weeks. 'There's a fair bit of damage in there,' McDermott said. 'He's been good for us so we'll miss him but it gives an opportunity for Ash Handley to get some more game time. Leeds' England international Tom Briscoe will be sidelined for around three months with a shoulder injury . 'He did okay against Wigan. The acid test for Ash will come in the coming weeks to maintain that level.' Handley, 19, made only his second Super League appearance and scored his first try in Leeds' 26-14 win over Wigan last Friday and keeps his spot for the trip to Perpignan to face Catalans Dragons on Saturday, while Liam Sutcliffe will continue to deputise for skipper Kevin Sinfield, who is still recovering from a hamstring injury. Another England international, Zak Hardaker, keeps his place pending the outcome of an investigation into an assault he committed on a student in Leeds in February. 'At some stage the club will make an announcement,' McDermott said. 'I think it's coming to its conclusion but we're still on with it.' Leeds Rhino coach Brian McDermott admits Briscoe's injury lay-off is a blow for the team . Hardaker was dropped when the incident came to light earlier this month but recalled for the Wigan game and McDermott insists he is right to select the player, who was released by police without charge after paying compensation and issuing an apology to his victim. 'Zak gets paid to do a job,' McDermott added. 'I know there is a sentiment from people out there who say 'why is he still playing?' but to stand Zak down doesn't do him any good. 'If a bricklayer makes an error at work, you don't give him time off. Why would we give Zak Hardaker the time off to live a decent lifestyle where he can do what he wants? 'He has to do a job for us. He is paid to do that job and he will go out and do it. I don't feel that's covering anything up.'","Tom Briscoe will miss three months of action, confirms Brian McDermott .

"Nigel Pearson has been caught on camera appearing to swear at a journalist after taking issue with a line of questioning. The Leicester City manager was picked up on microphone seeming to call the reporter a ‘p****’ under his breath as his press conference following the 0-0 draw with Hull City ended. Pearson was annoyed about a question over Steve Bruce’s claim Leicester’s players crowded referee Jon Moss in an attempt to get Alex Bruce sent off for a tackle on Riyad Mahrez. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Nigel Pearson's outburst . Nigel Pearson fixes a reporter with a stare during a tetchy exchange after the draw with Hull . After concluding the press conference, Pearson muttered 'waxing away, my a***' under his breath . He was then further angered by the suggestion his team’s season was ‘waxing or waning’ with ten games left and seven points separating Leicester from safety. ‘Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***,’ Pearson is heard saying as he finishes his press conference at the King Power Stadium. As he gets up he appears to utter the word: ‘P****.’ Pearson was irked at his players being accused of intimidating the officials given his stance on such matters. Pearson does not countenance such dark arts. In a December interview he said: 'People who are more cynical-minded might say I’m naive. 'There is a concern at the Premier League about the number of times that is happening. I hope my players don’t start doing it. 'There’s a difference between being streetwise and using intimidation of officials as a vehicle to win. I’d never cheat to win.' He is fiercely protective of his squad and, in any case, replays showed only a couple put their arms up in appeal with the same number of Hull players arguing the opposite. The Leicester manager then seemed to call the journalist a 'p****' for the line of questioning . Pearson looks frustrated during another game where his Leicester side failed to win . It is a third controversial incident for Pearson this season. In December he was banned from the dugout for one game and fined £10,000 for telling a supporter to ‘f*** off and die’ after receiving sustained abuse. In February he was involved in a touchline exchange with James McArthur as the pair fell together. Pearson jokingly throtted the Crystal Palace midfielder then held onto his shirt as he attempted to rejoin play. The next day brought Pearson’s phantom sacking, when Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha is believed to have wanted to bring the axe before his son Aiyawatt counselled against. Bruce’s comments ultimately triggered the exchange on Saturday evening. The Hull manager said: ‘There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I’ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. ‘For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make. The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it’s not right.’ Pearson was asked if he thought it was a fair criticism. ‘No,’ he said, before entering into a tetchy exchange with the journalist which ended with him finishing the press conference in angry fashion, and swearing under his breath. Steve Bruce cited Chelsea in terms of the Leicester players behaved to try and get Alex Bruce sent off… . Did they? Oh very nice. Do you think that’s a fair criticism? No. What’s your take on that situation? I’ve just said no. But what’s your take on a situation where all the players surround a referee? How many times have you seen us play this year? Three times. Well there you are then. You’re not in a position to judge my players on that. I’m not judging anyone. I’m just asking you… . You’ve asked me and I’ve told you. No was the answer. I don’t think it’s a fair assessment. Full stop. Do you consider that Leicester’s season is waxing or waning? I don’t have to use that sort of analogy. We are in the same position. We’ve got ten games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance. That’s it. You got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not. Yep good thank you. Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***. P****. Pearson seems to be feeling the pressure as his side remain rooted to the bottom of the table .

"Israel have promised not to kick Gareth Bale off the pitch during their vital Euro 2016 qualifier against Wales. Manager Eli Guttman said his team would instead work as a unit to limit space for the Real Madrid star. Cyprus took chunks out of Bale during October’s Group B game, and he is in the top 10 of most fouled players in qualification with 12. Wales and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale (centre) gets through some speed work on Wednesday . Bale and his Welsh team-mates are gearing up for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel . But Gutman said: ‘We don’t have enough strong players to kick him out. We are going to play as a team, one unit, not to give space. We have to put the players close together on the pitch.’ Bale’s Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score against Israel in two games during qualification for last year’s World Cup, with Maccabi Tel Aviv midfielder Sheran Yeini shackling the Portugal star. But Guttman responded with sarcasm when asked if the trick could be repeated. ‘We called Cristiano to ask how to do the same against Bale but he did not answer, unfortunately,’ he laughed. Israel coach Eli Guttman speaks to the media ahead of Saturday's meeting with Wales . Wales manager Chris Coleman said Bale would cope even if Israel resorted to the rough stuff. ‘He has played most of his football in the Premier League, the most physically demanding in the world,’ said Coleman. ‘He has come through Madrid derbies and Clasicos in Spain. All the focus will be on him but we have a good squad and our strength is our togetherness.’ Bale is set to be handed a free role tonight, after fierce criticism of his form by media and supporters in Madrid. Coleman insisted there had been no mention from Bale of Madrid during the week’s training, however, and his best player was unaffected by the furore. ‘I cannot see any difference in him,’ said Coleman. ‘If I thought it was bothering him, we would have talked about it. We have not mentioned Real Madrid, we have only talked about Wales and this game. He is happy, relaxed and, most importantly, fit.’","Israel face Wales in Group B on Saturday in the Euro 2016 qualifiers .

"The notorious underarm delivery that created one of the most controversial moments in world cricket history is still hard to revisit after more than three decades. But as Australia and New Zealand go head-to-head in the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, the underarm bowling incident from 1981 will inevitably come back to haunt. The  controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day  on February 1 when New Zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match. But Aussie skipper Greg Chappell instructed the bowler, who was his younger brother Trevor, to deliver the ball underarm in a bid to prevent batsman Brian McKechnie any chance of hitting a six. Scroll down for video . It was a single bowl that triggered a massive uproar at the time when Aussie bowler delivered an underarm . As the ball gently rolled down the pitch, McKechnie blocked the ball before he tossed his bat to the ground out of anger and disgust. Australia went on to win the match but the hell that followed left the Chappell brothers struggling to cope under the pressure from the backlash. Despite the underarm bowling was not ruled as illegal at the time, it was deemed 'an act of cowardice' and against the true spirit of cricket that cost New Zealand the tournament. Aussie bowler Trevor Chappell, right, bowls underarm to New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie on the last ball of a one-day international from which New Zealand needed to hit six runs to force a tie . Trevor Chappell bowls under-arm, as ordered by brother Greg at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1981 . But Black Caps fast bowler Tim Southee, who was two-years-old at the time of the underarm incident, said the infamous bowl is rarely mentioned. 'I guess a few of us were too young to remember seeing it but we know it happened,' Southee said at a conference on Friday. 'I haven’t heard too much about the underarm.' While New Zealand prepares ahead of their first ever World Cup final on Sunday, Aussie skipper Michael Clarke has announced his retirement from one-day cricket on the eve of the match. The 33-year-old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he'd still be leading the side in four years.","The notorious underarm incident triggered a massive uproar in 1981 .

Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink  called the Chelsea supporters  'a few idiots' who do not represent the club . Hasselbaink earned a hero's reputation at Chelsea for scoring 87 goals in 177 games during his time there . Last month a group of Chelsea fans were filmed refusing to allow a black man from getting on a carriage on the Paris Metro before the Champions League game against Paris Saint-Germain. 'We're racist, and that's the way we like it,' the group could be heard singing. Hasselbaink, the manager of Burton Albion, flying high in League Two, does not recognise these incidents as an aspect of the club he loves. 'I know lots of Chelsea supporters and I've never experienced that,' he said. 'I don't think Chelsea is about that. 'I think the boys that have done it are a few idiots. And that's it. They are not even a percentage of Chelsea fans. They do not represent Chelsea.' Hasselbaink scores for Chelsea past former Fulham goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar (left) back in 2001 .

"The League Two clash between play-off rivals Bury and Southend at the JD Stadium had to be abandoned after just seven minutes as torrential rain rendered the pitch unplayable. The game went ahead despite a heavy downpour prior to the 3pm kick-off but after a short discussion with the managers the referee decided to postpone the match. The officials planned to bring the players back out after 20 minutes to re-assess the state of the pitch and the weather but, despite the use of rollers during the break, the match was abandoned. Players were taken off the pitch just seven minutes into the League Two clash between Bury and Southend . Torrential rain before and during the game cause the pitch to become waterlogged . Bury groundsman tries in vain to rid the pitch of some of the surface water before the game was abandoned . Players battle for the ball in the very wet conditions before the game was postponed . The visiting Southend fans had to make the 500-mile, eight hour round trip from Essex to Lancashire to witness just a few minutes of football and the fixture is now likely to be replayed on a midweek evening. Bury manager David Flicroft said: 'Absolutely right decision by the ref, he had every right to start the game. Well done to the ref for making the right decision. 'I am gutted for the fans, as it looked like a great turn out by them today. It's tough for the Southend fans now who'll have to make the long trip up on a Tuesday night now.' Southend fans had to make the 500-mile round trip that would have taken longer than eight hours . Southend manager Phil Brown leaves the pitch in the heavy rain . Both manager agreed that it was the right decision to call the game off . Southend manager Phil Brown shared Flicroft's sentiments regarding the supporters but was able to take comfort in the fact he didn't have a full-strength side for the crucial fixture. 'I’m disappointed for the fans but it’s a good call for us because we had four players out today,' Brown said. 'Twenty minutes before the game the pitch was playable and both managers agreed with that. But it was monsoon-like and the rain is still coming down so it was the right decision (to abandon the game).' Supporters have been offered a half price ticket for the re-arranged fixture.","Bury took on Southend at the JD Stadium in League Two on Saturday .

"Whisper it, but Salford are starting to resemble genuine play-off contenders after cruising to a resounding 36-8 win over Widnes that lifted them to fourth place in Super League. Booed from the field after their previous Thursday night television appearance resulted in a 52-6 thrashing by St Helens, the Red Devils received a standing ovation this time after running in seven tries against the team that beat them three times in 2014. Close-season signings Cory Paterson, Scott Taylor, Liam Hood and Carl Forster all made a big impact as Marwan Koukash's hefty investment finally showed signs of starting to pay off. Salford Red Devils' Lama Tasi (right) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring a try against Widnes . Weller Hauraki goes over for a try as Salford record a comfortable Super League victory on Thursday night . The Vikings, who were without seven first-team regulars through injury, were simply no match for their classy hosts and they quickly found themselves 16-0 down. Rangi Chase's clever kick produced a fourth-minute try for winger Ben Jones-Bishop - his fifth in as many games for the Red Devils - and second-rower Weller Hauraki touched down Michael Dobson's punt four minutes later. Josh Griffin converted both to make it 12-0 inside 12 minutes and it got even better for the home side when a break from inside his own half by substitute hooker Hood got Dobson haring for the line. Widnes centre Stefan Marsh got back to haul Dobson down just short of the line but he was sin-binned for holding on and Salford immediately made use of the extra man, with winger Greg Johnson collecting Chase's cut-out pass to score his side's third try.

Close-season signing Scott Taylor (right) celebrates after scoring his first try for Salford Red Devils . The Vikings were not as bad as the 16-0 score suggested, however, and they struck back seven minutes before the break when winger Paddy Flynn accepted Rhys Hanbury's pass and wrong-footed full-back Kevin Locke to touch down. Jack Owens kicked the conversion and added a penalty on the stroke of half-time to cut the Red Devils' lead to eight points. Salford thought they had scored again four minutes into the second half when centre Mason Caton-Brown got on the end of Chase's kick but his try was disallowed following closer inspection by the video referee. However, it was all Salford in the third quarter and, producing some of their best rugby of the season, they seized control of the game with two further tries in an ultimately decisive five-minute spell. Greg Johnson scores Salford's third try of the night after collecting a pass from Rangi Chase . Prop Lama Tasi powered his way over from Chase's inside pass before second-rower Paterson jumped into dummy half to get Griffin over at the corner as the Red Devils stretched their lead to 26-8. Widnes' injury problems worsened when Flynn hobbled off after appearing to pull a hamstring in full flight and they conceded two more tries in the final quarter. Paterson collected Dobson's high kick to touch down and former Wigan prop Taylor proved unstoppable from 10 metres out as he registered his first try for the club.","Salford continued their bid for a play-off spot with a comfortable victory .

"He's better known for his fancy footwork on the pitch but Liverpool and England striker Daniel Sturridge took time out of scoring goals to get some kitchen action. The 25-year-old Birmingham lad was taken through his culinary paces by his mother Grace, who taught him how to make her favourite dish ahead of Mother's Day. And like her Reds son, mum Grace is a fan of healthy eating and requested the Kop ace to create a high protein meal of spicy grilled chicken with seasoned quinoa and vegetables. Scroll down for video. Daniel Sturridge and kisses his mother Grace after he successfully cooks spicy chicken with quinoa and vegetables as part of his Mother's Day Challenge . The 25-year-old Birmingham lad in action on the pitch, competing with Alex Baptise of Blackburn Rovers during the FA Cup Quarter Final match on Sunday 8 March . The duo joined forces in the kitchen as part of a Sainsbury's Active Kids event at a school in St Paul's RC Junior School, Liverpool. Daniel, who cooks his own meals every day, told FEMAIL: My mum is amazing, she has provided me with so much support and continues to do so always. 'To spoil my mum I would probably cook her something healthy with a bit of spice to it, fish based maybe. 'Mum loves nice salads and especially avocado, so would definitely include that.' For the challenge the Sainsbury's Active Kids ambassador had to prepare quinoa -  which is a superfood favourite of the family - and marinate the chicken with Grace's home-made spicy 'Sturrcrazy' sauce, made to a secret family recipe. The pair cook together when they can although these days it's becoming rarer. Grace said to FEMAIL: 'When we can we like to cook together, but it doesn't happen so often these days, as Daniel lives away from home. Mother and son work together and start off by seasoning the chicken with a mixture of spices . As the chicken marinades the pair chop the vegetables and prepare the rest of the meal . What was Daniel like as a child? Daniel has always been really active, he played football in and out of school. At home he would play out whatever the weather! Because of his naturally active lifestyle, he always loved meal times and eating Afro-Caribbean food. As our family were all sporty and active, it was natural for us to promote healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle. Does he still have the same tastes? Yes still loves it, amongst other things! But Daniel loves anything with spice to it. What is his favourite food? I would say he has two favourite dishes, fish and chicken. The white meat is full of protein so is really good for him and he loves to be able to make both chicken and fish in to spicy dishes, which is why he loves our family's Sturr Crazy sauce. If he was cooking for you, what would he cook? Probably salmon with sweet potatoes and garlic thyme chopped up and cooked in the oven. It's quite an easy dish to make and it's really tasty. He would probably make a side salad with rocket, tomatoes and lots of avocado, he knows I love avocado! What does Daniel mean to you? All of the family are so proud of what Daniel has achieved so far, he gave up so much as a child and we are just so happy that he is achieving his dream, as parents you couldn't wish for more than that for your children! But she still tries to get her family together at weekends. 'Every Sunday we still try and get together as a family and have a typical Afro-Caribbean lunch of spicy meat, rice and peas. 'We love getting together and think it's important to spend that time together,' she continued. Famous for being a proponent of superfoods after his 2014 calf injury saw him miss 13 matches, Daniel now incorporates as much nutrient-packed foods into his diet as he can. 'It's important for me to make sure that I eat a healthy balanced diet as obviously I'm training every day,'he said. 'I do enjoy cooking and I look forward to my dinner each night.' His favourite meal to cook is 'salmon, kale, sweet potato, broccoli and quinoa' which he covers in Sturr Crazy sauce. 'I have it on everything,'he said. 'It adds that perfect amount of spice to a dish; I even took some out to the World Cup with me.' A typical day will see him pack away three scrambled eggs with berries for breakfast whilst lunch and dinner are heavy on protein-rich foods . 'Lunch and dinner could be quite similar to each other with something like quinoa, with perhaps chicken or fish [as] they are both great for recovery and full of protein,' he said. 'On the side I would have broccoli, spinach, lots of steamed veg. I also drink a lot of white tea and moringa tea throughout the day,' he continued. So far so healthy, but doesn't he have any guilty food secrets? 'I'm pretty good with my diet to be honest, I love healthy food which helps and it is something I have worked on for years. But every now and then you need something sweet, which is fine, but all in moderation,' he said. And does he dance in the kitchen when he's successfully cooked a meal? 'Haha I leave the dancing for on the pitch,' he laughed. Tara Hewitt, Head of Sponsorship for Sainsbury's said: 'It was great to see Daniel and Grace cooking together at the event; they clearly have a passion for great tasting, healthy food.' Result! Daniel and Grace with the finished meal, spicy chicken served with quinoa and steamed veg . Ingredients: Four chicken thighs (skin and boneless); 220g quinoa; four spring onions; one sweet red pepper; two cloves fresh garlic; four medium carrots; one broccoli floret; four spears of asparagus; black pepper, all spice, paprika; dark soy sauce; olive oil . Mehod: Season the chicken with all spice, black pepper, paprika and dark soy sauce and leave to marinate overnight. Pre-heat the oven to 400*F and back chicken for approx 30 mins until golden and cooked through. Splash on some SturrCrazy sauce (or other spicy condiment) and return to the oven for five minutes. Rinse the quinoa thoroughly and place on a high heat with a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil then turn down to simmer for 20 mins until steamed and fluffy then set aside. Whilst the quinoa is steaming, finely chop the onions a quarter of the sweet pepper, two cloves of garlic and pan fry with a splash of olive oil, pepper and season all. Empty and toss the cooked quinoa in with the onions and mix together, adding more seasoning if needed. Peel and chop the carrots, chop the broccoli, trim the asparagus and steam in a pan for five minutes until tender before plating up.","The 25-year-old England striker challenged to cook dish for Mother's Day .

"A $300,000 McLaren sports car was wrecked after a man's tractor trailer stalled and was plowed into by a train as it sat on the tracks. The driver of the truck heard a train coming and made out before his vehicle was hit. No one was injured in the Orange Park, Florida, crash on Friday. A McLaren MP4-12C, however, was heavily damaged. Ryan Fung was taking Jorg Bober's McLaren to a dealership near Orange Park, Florida, for warranty work when we got stuck on the railroad tracks . Though Fung escaped his truck when he heard the train coming, he couldn't save the car which was in a trailer in tow . Bober received a call from Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater, a McLaren dealership, who said his car had been totaled . Truck driver Ryan Fung frantically called 911 when we got stuck at the crossing. 'Yeah I'm stuck right across. The bars are coming down, and he's about to hit the truck,' he told the dispatcher. The dispatcher told Fung to get out of the truck as a train horn sounded in the background. Fung escaped the crash with about three minutes to spare but he was unable to save the car in tow, according to First Coast News. The car's owner, Dr Jorg Bober told Palm Beach Post that his car had been picked up by the company for warranty work when it got stuck on the tracks. 'My nurse called me up, she says ""Listen, take doctors Lake Drive the opposite way to college because there's a huge train accident"". I didn't think anything of it. Five minutes later I get a call from the company saying, ""Your car is totaled"". I was like ""Really? That's my car?"" the pediatrician said. Bober only found out about the accident from a nurse who told him to take an alternative route to work to miss the traffic . Bober's hoping that Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater will cover losses since it was being taken to their dealership . When asked about the accident Bober was in good spirts, saying he'd 'get another one' once the accident was sorted out . But Bober's resolution to the issue of having a totaled exotic car was simple. 'Eh, we'll get another one,' he told Palm Beach Post. Bober hopes Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater, the McLaren dealership where he bought the car, will cover the loss, according to WFLA. 'They've apologized, ya know. And as far as I'm concerned, that's what they can do right now. I mean, I'm actually pretty happy that no one got hurt,' he told WFLA. The area where the accident occurred has signs that read 'No Thru Trucks', meaning the truck driver should not have driven across the tracks. Florida Highway Patrol said the driver will be cited. Clay County Sheriff's Office, Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Department of Transportation were at the scene on Friday. Four trains transporting vehicles from Orlando to Louisville and two passenger Amtrak trains were affected or delayed from the crash. The area where the driver crossed the tracks has a large sign reading, 'No Thru Trucks'. Fung will be cited for driving through the area, Florida Highway Patrol said .","The train plowed into the tractor trailer in Orange Park, Florida on Friday .

"Creative subjects are being squeezed out of schools due to the government's new league table measure. Headteachers are pushing pupils to take more GCSEs in English Baccalaureate subjects, according to experts. From next year, the government's Progress 8 league table measure will replace the five A* to C benchmark. Failure to meet the target could leave schools at risk of takeover or even closure. Experts say pupils are being pushed into more GCSEs in the so-called English Baccalaureate subjects (file picture) Students' performance will be tracked in eight subjects split into three groups: English and maths, which will be given double weighting; three EBac subjects (sciences, computer science, geography, history and languages) and three optional subjects. But the Design and Technology Association (DATA) has warned that schools are urging students to take further EBac subjects as 'optional subjects', leaving them less time to pursue creative interests. DATA chief executive, Richard Green, told the Times Educational Supplement: 'If a student is doing history then (schools) are advising them to take geography as well, and the same with sciences and languages. 'That then uses up the option categories, so you have all the other subjects competing for just one slot.' The National Society for Education in Art and Design said it was also aware of creative subjects being affected.

John Galsworthy decided to make the poignant video, in which he sings Somewhere, from the musical West Side Story, following the 16-year-old's death in February. So far, more than 7,000 people have watched the video, which is interspersed with pictures of Becky. Scroll down for video .

Police launched a huge search for the popular girl, which also prompted a social media campaign using the hashtag #FindBecky. But the search ended in tragedy, when police discovered Becky's body parts at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol, on March 2, and charged her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, with murder. Her death sparked an outpouring of grief in the community: bouquets, teddies and cards have been left at her family home, as well at Barton Court, while two online fundraising pages have also raised more than £11,000. And today, hundreds marched through Bristol in the rain to raise even more. The money is going to be put towards her funeral, and then towards a foundation which her family is hopes to set up in her memory, aiming to help other families in similar situations. The walkers were joined by members of Becky's family, who wore t-shirts and badges featuring a picture of the teenager and released colourful balloons.

'Global': The Galsworthys have received messages of support from across the world after Becky (pictured) died in February . 'If she could see this happening now... On a horrible day like this, hundreds and hundreds of people have turned out. 'This young, shy, reserved child who lost her life so tragically and it has hurt us all but it's touched everyone's hearts around the world. 'I've been getting messages from Australia and New Zealand, Africa, China - it's gone absolutely global. 'People recognise us, they come up to us and hug us. I've had 7 foot tall men come up to me crying, hugging me and wishing us the best.' Grandfather John added: 'I really think she would have loved it. 'I'm sure that if she's looking down on us now that she's saying 'I am pleased, thank you'.' Mr Galsworthy said he hoped the money would help 'keep Rebecca's name going for ever'. Mr Galsworthy said the last month had been 'absolute hell', but he hoped to 'get our life back on track at some point'. The family home has been the subject of forensic searches since Becky was reported missing on February 20. Mr Galsworthy said: 'If we get a good vibe when we go in then we'll probably stay living there but if its too much for us to bear then we'll just sell up and move on somewhere else.' He added: 'It's been hell for us, I'm not going to lie. It is very difficult to keep the emotions under control. 'I have to thank the whole Bristol community for their support, it really does help us. 'I hope this ends sooner rather than later because every day has been hell for us. Every day has been an absolute nightmare.'

"The grand Spanish port of Vigo, with its high-rise apartments overlooking the north Atlantic, is no match for Brentford on a winter’s night. But that was when Jose Ignacio Peleteiro Ramallo — or Jota for short — announced himself to English football and gave Brentford fans a first inkling that they could end a 68-year wait to return to the top flight of English football. Now, after a mid-season stumble following the bizarre news that their manager Mark Warburton was going to be replaced at the end of the season regardless of whether the club earn promotion, they are entertaining realistic hopes of becoming one of the smallest clubs to have graced the Premier League. Brentford playmaker Jota has been one of the club's standout players this season as they fight for promotion . The Spaniard joined Brentford from Celta Vigo last summer and has impressed in England's second tier . Jota dribbles with the ball ahead of  Watford's Ikechi Anya (right) during the match at Griffin Park in February . Brentford manager Mark Warburton will leave the club at the end of this season regardless of how they finish . The winter’s night was last November when Jota left fly a stoppage-time winner over arch rivals Fulham. It was their first League meeting for 18 years and made sure Brentford’s neighbours knew there was a change of the guard in west London. Quite something for a 23-year-old who struggled at Celta Vigo and then with Real Madrid’s reserves. ‘That derby was intense, a special moment for me. It felt I’d really arrived at Brentford that night,’ said Jota, who will face Fulham again at Craven Cottage on Friday. ‘As soon as I came here everybody was telling me about Fulham. After the goal everybody was stopping me in the street saying, “You’re a hero, thank you, thank you!” People work all week and we want to put a smile on their faces.’ Jota is relishing the competition in the Championship and hopes to help Brentford return to the top-flight . Jota strikes the ball at Brentford's training complex during his interview with MailSport . Speaking in Spanish, Jota sits inside a hut at their modest training complex with seven games — or possibly more in the play-offs — to achieve what appeared unobtainable. He was relaxed, at ease with the club’s situation despite the upheaval in their management structure and laughed in agreement at the notion that no team appear to want to take charge of the promotion race, such is the absurdly close top eight. Just one point separated the top five a fortnight ago. Jota was open on the serious problems they encountered after February’s shocking developments regarding Warburton’s future. The popular boss will leave at the end of the season to be replaced by a foreign coach who buys into owner Matthew Benham’s continental philosophy and Jota admitted the news seriously affected the squad. ‘For a week or so we dropped our levels,’ he said. ‘You hear rumours… you don’t know what’s going to happen. It was a short period of confusion but we’re now focused. ‘We’re all still united but it’s never the best thing for something like that to happen in the middle of the season.’ Jota celebrates scoring the winning goal for Brentford against rivals Fulham at at Griffin Park in November . They have levelled just in time and are one point off the play-offs. Brentford have an ace up their sleeve, too. It was Jota’s winner against Alaves to seal tiny Eibar’s rise to La Liga this time last year. He wants to do it again but in front of 90,000 at Wembley. ‘Everyone has told me about this final at Wembley,’ he added. ‘Achieve that in front of these supporters who have been so good to me? It’d be amazing. This would be truly historic, just as it was for Eibar. But we won the league there so this would be more dramatic.’ The similarities between Brentford and Eibar are stark. Both have populations of 27,000 and while Brentford have not seen the top flight since 1947, Eibar embarked on their first premier campaign in August. Using his best English, Jota is trying to draw on last year’s experience and explain it to others in the squad. Learning the language has not come naturally but assimilating to our game has. ‘There’s probably more space here than in Spain,’ he said. ‘There’s plenty of opportunity to construct attacks here, create chances.

I’ve watched all this from afar and knew what I was getting myself into. ‘This has great clubs with top facilities — everyone has one goal.

"Italy coach Antonio Conte has received death threats from angry fans who blame his training methods for the injury which was initially believed to have ruled midfielder Claudio Marchisio out for the rest of the season. Italy's medical staff announced that Serie A leaders Juventus's Marchisio suffered ruptured knee ligaments during the warm-up for Friday's training session ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria on Saturday. 'I saw him (Conte) shaken this morning,' Italian football federation (FIGC) president Carlo Tavecchio told Radio Rai on Saturday. 'After yesterday's controversy, he received death threats on the internet. Italy boss Antonio Conte is 'shaken' after receiving online death threats from Juventus fans . The Italy national team manager has been criticised for pushing his players too hard in training . 'I met with Conte for a long time and he is not calm. All these things have been said on social networks and he feels vilified for something that is not his fault. The FIGC stands by him.' Conte was criticised by John Elkann, the president of the holding company which controls FIAT and Juventus, who said the Italy coach worked the players too hard during the national team's training camps. 'Perhaps he'd like to be remembered as the cherry-picker with the highest number of injuries,' Elkan told Italian media. Former Juventus coach Conte defended his methods. 'I wonder why Elkann didn't ask me that when I was at Juventus? We don't work hard, we work well,' the 45-year-old told a news conference in Sofia ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. Italian media reported that Conte was reconsidering his position as Italy coach after the death threats. The Italian FA was not immediately available to comment. Juve midfielder Claudio Marchisio injured ankle ligaments, but will return sooner than first expected . Juventus, however, said Marchisio could be back in action within days. 'After returning from international duty on Friday afternoon, Claudio Marchisio underwent medical examinations conducted by Juventus club doctors and Dr Flavio Quaglia,' the club said in a statement. 'The 29-year-old then underwent an MRI scan on his right knee this evening. The tests ruled positive, excluding the possibility of a tear to the anterior cruciate ligament. Marchisio will now rest, and his condition is to be monitored on a day-to-day basis.' Conte returned Juventus to their former glory before leaving to take charge of the Azzurri . Marchisio underwent his first examination at the Istituto Fanfani in Florence, close to Italy's training ground. 'I spoke to my colleagues in Turin, explained what happened and organised to send the lad straight to the club for further tests,' Italy doctor Enrico Castellaci said. 'Juve gave me the all-clear to make the diagnosis public. That night, I contacted the Juve medics again. Now there are two contrasting test results. Naturally, I'd be very happy if the later test was confirmed. These are the facts.' Castellaci's explanation prompted jokes on social media with Italian media and fans labelling the national team's medical staff as a 'laughing stock'. Italy have won three matches and drawn one to sit second on 10 points in Group H, behind Croatia on goal difference. Bulgaria are fourth with four points.","Italy are set to play Bulgaria in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday .

"New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum hopes Sunday's Cricket World Cup final in Melbourne will be a 'big fairytale finish' to the international career of Daniel Vettori. Vettori has announced Sunday's match against either Australia or India will be the last of his international career. He will retire as New Zealand's most-capped Test player - with 113 matches - and one-day internationals - Sunday's match will be his 291st for New Zealand and he needs three more dismissals Sunday to finish with 300 ODI wickets. Brendon McCullum (left) celebrates with Daniel Vettori after New Zealand reached the World Cup final . Vettori made his debut aged 18 in 1997 and, now 36, has spent half his life in the New Zealand team. While he says retirement 'is not what I'm thinking about', his teammates want to help him end his career with a win. 'He's been an outstanding contributor for us,' McCullum said. 'He's played for New Zealand for half his life. '(A win) would be a great way to potentially send him off.' Vettori is still a key member of the New Zealand team and has demonstrated his value throughout the World Cup with a series of frugal bowling performances and cameo innings'. He was at the crease on 7 not out when Grant Elliott hit the winning runs in Tuesday's semi-final against South Africa. Vettori was at the crease with Grant Elliott (right) as he hit the winning runs against South Africa . Vettori ahead of his Test debut in Wellington as a 17-year-old way back in 1997 . 'I guess it was potentially his last game on home soil and for him to be out there at the end and be as instrumental and as calm as he was under pressure, it was superb,' McCullum said. 'He was struggling a bit with his back, too. He's played a lot of his career with bumps and bruises and niggles and strains. He's a tough customer and he's been an amazing servant.' But Vettori doesn't want his swansong to distract New Zealand from its aim of winning the World Cup for the first time. 'It's not what I'm thinking about,' he said. 'It's just about having some fun and enjoying the game and enjoying the build-up to a World Cup final,' he said. 'No-one else in New Zealand cricket history has been able to experience that before so it's pretty exciting to experience a grand final week. 'The chance to play a World Cup final regardless of where you are in your career is something everyone dreams about.'","Daniel Vettori to play final international  v Australia in World Cup final .

"The owner of nine grocery stores in central Ohio is accused of leading a large-scale drug ring trafficking heroin, cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to Chicago and Ohio for years. Liborio Alcauter was one of 29 people indicted in a large-scale drugs sting last September. Investigators are also probing claims he hired a Mexican hitman to kill the judge and investigators after his arrest, the Columbus Dispatch reports. 'Ring leader': Liborio Alcauter, a grocery store owner, is accused of leading a gang that trafficked heroin and cocaine from Mexico into Chicago then onto Ohio for years . Alcauter was released from custody last year after a judge deemed him not to be a flight risk. His attorney dismissed the allegations made in a search warrant, telling the Dispatch 'They can say anything they want in a search warrant.' According to the documents read by the Dispatch, one of his co-defendants, Lorena Sevilla, was overheard in her cell describing Alcauter's plot to kill the investigators. 'Sevilla said out loud that Liborio Alcauter wanted to handle things like they did in Mexico and said ""judge dead"" and ran her finger across her throat in a cutting motion,' an affidavit allegedly says. The alleged hitman is believed to be in custody on immigration charges. Alcauter is not working in any of his groceries as the investigation continues.

"Fighting for life: Connor Lynes was found collapsed on his bedroom floor morning after his rugby match . A 14-year-old boy was today fighting for his life after suffering a blood clot on his brain when he was injured playing rugby. Connor Lynes, of Hull, East Yorkshire, returned home after playing for his under-15s rugby league team on Saturday - but was found collapsed on his bedroom floor the next morning. After being taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, Connor was put in an induced coma and doctors removed 90 per cent of the clot - in a potentially life-saving operation. He was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary on Sunday, where he underwent another operation yesterday to try to remove the rest. Now, he may face a third surgery. His family are now asking people to pray for ‘little Robin’, who plays for Lambwath Lions. Connor’s uncle Dave Lynes said: ‘We want people to pray for Connor and keep their fingers crossed. We still do not know if he will pull through. It is just heartbreaking at the moment. ‘He is a cheeky little lad and he is full of mischief. He has got a heart of gold, has lots and lots of friends and is very popular at school, at his club and at Hull Kingston Rovers.’ Mr Lynes said Connor, who lives with his aunt, Sara, was injured after being tackled. He added: ‘Connor was playing rugby for his local under-15s team and took a bit of a hard hit in the tackle. They took him off straight away but he seemed fine. 'He was at home on Saturday night being his usual cheeky self. My sister got up the next morning and found him collapsed on the bedroom floor and rushed him to hospital.' Connor, who plays for Lambwath Lions, suffered a blood clot on his brain when he was injured playing rugby . Mr Lynes said it was tough for relatives to see Connor, a pupil at Winifred Holtby Academy, in hospital, adding that the family are 'totally powerless at the moment'. He said: ‘He has had such a hard life – he lost his father when he was young but is still such a cheeky lad. He is not just my nephew, but he is like a son to me as well.’ Mr Lynes said Connor loves rugby and is a huge fan of Super League side Hull Kingston Rovers. He added: 'Connor broke his leg four years ago and the doctors said he would never play rugby again. It was bad - he broke his tibia and fibula - but a year later, he was playing again. 'He loves the sport and is a massive rugby fan. He is a KR fan and I am a Hull fan and we have a lot of banter between us about it.’ Mr Lynes said: ‘Connor did come out the coma last night and is breathing unaided. He's opened his eyes and even managed a cheeky smile.’ Treated: Connor was put in an induced coma and doctors removed 90 per cent of the clot. He was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary (pictured) on Sunday, where he underwent another operation yesterday . Education: Connor, a pupil at Winifred Holtby Academy (above), is said to be 'very popular at school' Meanwhile, speaking on behalf of Connor’s family, Steve Ball, general manager of the Rugby and Football League Benevolent Fund, said he had visited the youngster at Leeds General Infirmary. The boy is still ‘very poorly’ but in a stable condition while relatives keep a vigil around his hospital bed. Mr Ball said today: ‘Thankfully he is conscious now and aware of his surroundings. He saw me and was able to give me a thumbs up. He may need to undergo a further surgery and we will find out in the next few days.’ He said that Connor had been playing in a group match for Lambwath Lions against another East Yorkshire team from Beverley. Mr Ball added: ‘It was a perfectly legitimate tackle and a freak accident really. He didn’t actually fall ill until the day after the match.’ Meanwhile, a Hull Kingston Rovers spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts are with young Connor Lynes, who is in intensive care following an injury playing the sport he loves yesterday. Get well soon Connor, from everyone at the club.'","Connor Lynes returned home after playing for under-15s on Saturday .

"A sorority at the beleaguered University of Oklahoma has come under fire over its involvement in the racist chant by the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity over the weekend. The Delta Delta Deltas have been identified as the sorority members on a chartered bus when frat brothers started singing 'there will never be a n**** in SAE.' At least one female student can be seen in the video. She appears to raise her cell phone to record the incident. Her date, however, can be seen clapping to the song. It is also believed that female voices can be heard cheering on the racist fraternity brothers. Scroll down for video . Shameful: The now-infamous video appears to have been taken on a charter bus.  The screen shot on the right shows a woman who appears to record the incident . Under scrutiny: Delta Delta Delta sorority has released a statement saying that it was 'cooperating fully' with the university’s investigation into the chant video . Expelled: The Sigma Alpha Epsilon  has been banned from campus after a video surfaced of members shouting and singing racial slurs . Gone: Facility workers removed the letters from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at the University of Oklahoma Monday in Norman, Oklahoma . On Monday the national Tri Delta organization issued a statement saying it was cooperating with the Oklahoma investigation. However, the local Tri Delta chapter has denied reports its members are under investigation for involvement in the horrifying incident. 'The women of the Theta Gamma chapter of Delta Delta Delta fully support the actions taken by the administration of the University of Oklahoma in response to the incident involving Sigma Alpha Epsilon.... However, the Theta Gamma chapter is not under investigation by the university, nor have any chapter members been identified within the videos released,' according to a statement given to the Oklahoma Daily student newspaper. University President David Boren said Monday he was sickened and couldn't eat or sleep after learning about the video Sunday afternoon. The Tri Delta national organization said in a statement: 'We are deeply disappointed by the conduct of the students involved in the incident at The University of Oklahoma. 'Tri Delta expects its members to uphold the highest responsibilities of college women. 'The behavior documented in the video is deplorable and is in no way consistent with Tri Delta's ideals and core values.' The Oklahoma football team decided to protest rather than practice Monday. At the team's indoor practice facility, coach Bob Stoops led the way as players, joined by athletic director Joe Castiglione, walked arm-in-arm, wearing black. Meanwhile, a top high school recruit de-committed from the university after seeing the video. President Boren attended a pre-dawn rally organized by students and lambasted those fraternity members as ‘disgraceful’ and called their behaviour ’reprehensible.’ He said the university was looking into a range of punishment, including expulsion. Enraged: University of Oklahoma President David Boren lambasted members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, a fraternity who participated in a racist chant caught on video and ordered that they vacate their house by Tuesday night . ‘This is not who we are,’ Boren said at a midday news conference. ‘I'd be glad if they left. I might even pay the bus fare for them.’ National leaders of Sigma Alpha Epsilon said late Sunday that its investigation confirmed members took part in the chant and announced it would close the local chapter. The national group said it was ‘embarrassed’ by the ‘unacceptable and racist’ behavior. Boren said members have until midnight Tuesday to remove their belongings from the fraternity house. He said the fraternity was ‘not totally forthcoming,’ and he was still trying to find out who was on the bus so the school could consider disciplinary actions. He said the university's legal staff was exploring whether the students who initiated and encouraged the chant may have violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination. ‘We are also going to look at any individual perpetrators, particularly those that we think took a lead in this kind of activity,’ Boren said. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the efforts by the university and the national fraternity to repudiate the racist comments were ‘an appropriate step.’ It's unclear who recorded the video, when it was made and who initially leaked it online. Boren suggested it was likely taken by another student who didn't agree with what was being said about African-Americans. OU Unheard, a black student group on campus, posted a link to the video after someone anonymously called it to the group's attention Sunday afternoon, communications director Alexis Hall said Monday.

Writing on the wall: Graffiti proclaiming 'Tear it down' is painted on the side of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at the University of Oklahoma Monday . ‘We immediately needed to share that with the OU student body,’ said Hall, a junior. ‘For students to say they're going to lynch an entire group of people. ... It's disgusting.’ The video appears to have been taken on a charter bus, with at least one of the chanting young men wearing a tuxedo. North Mesquite High School football star Jean Delance, a top offensive lineman prospect, told KTVT television and KRLD-AM in Dallas-Fort Worth that he would not attend Oklahoma. He said he spoke Sunday night with coach Bob Stoops, but wasn't told about the incident. ‘I'm very disappointed in the coaches not letting me know. “Hey jean, this is going on. Be aware. I don't want you to be shocked tomorrow when you wake up,""’ Delance told KRLD. ‘But that was just heart-breaking right there.’ A university police cruiser was parked Monday outside the fraternity house, a sprawling two-story, sand-colored brick building on a street lined with Greek houses just west of the center of campus. The Greek letters were removed from the side of the house Monday afternoon. Boren said fraternity members had ‘violated all that we stand for.’ ‘Effective immediately, all ties and affiliations between this University and the local SAE chapter are hereby severed,’ he said in a statement.","Delta Delta Delta released a statement saying that it was 'cooperating fully' with the university’s investigation into the chant video .

"Dramatic pictures have emerged of the moment Harrison Ford was carried away on a stretcher following his terrifying plane crash. The 72-year-old's face is seen covered in blood with his neck firmly strapped into a brace as he his wheeled from the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles on Thursday. First responders are also pictured wrapping bandages around his head before taking him away. He deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground, breaking his pelvis, when the engine failed while flying solo. Scroll down for video . Bloodied: Harrison Ford is carried away from the scene of his plane crash on Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles on Thursday . Keeping vigil: Calista Flockhart was seen leaving the Los Angeles hospital after another lengthy visit with her husband who broke his pelvis while crash landing his vintage plane on a golf course . Emergency care: The 72-year-old's head is seen covered on bandages and his neck was put in a brace as he was wheeled off of the golf course and into the back of an ambulance . Response: The Indiana Jones and Fugitive star was then taken to hospital where his wife, Calista Flockhart, is staging a bedside vigil . Ford's wife, Calista Flockhart has stayed close to his side at hospital. The 50-year-old actress emerged on Friday night appearing tired and emotionally drained following a bedside vigil that lasted several hours. Calista was seen at the wheel of a black Lexus pulling out of the hospital parking garage with an older male companion in the passenger seat. The former Ally McBeal star looked like she hadn't slept in a while, her face make-up free and eyes dark-circled and bleary from possible crying. Her light brown hair hung limply around her face and her manner of dress appeared simple and casual as though she'd grabbed the closest clothing in reach. Calista looked like she needed sleep and was perhaps heading home to recharge for a spell with the intent of returning to the actor's side soon. Wrapped up: Paramedics unroll bloodied bandages around the actor's face. He deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground when the engine failed while flying solo . Treatment: Ford's arm is seen flung across his chest as he is treated by first responders. He broke his pelvis during the crash in his vintage plane . Cautious: He is gently rolled onto his side by members of the fire department as he is placed on a stretcher . On Thursday afternoon, Ford received a visit in hospital from his wife, who was seen looking emotional in her car. A doctor has revealed Ford was moaning in pain, slumped over in the cockpit, when he landed. 'He was stunned a bit,' said spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana. 'He was moaning and in pain.' 'It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious,' Khurana told ABC News. A video has since emerged of the moment the plane started to drop. As Ford descended, the people playing golf at the time were captured on film gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way. Dr Khurana was golfing next to Santa Monica Airport when he saw the plane 'belly flop' and rushed to the fairway where it came to rest. He told TV stations in Los Angeles and GMA that aside from worrying about Ford's injuries from the impact, he saw fuel leaking out of the World War II-era plane. Patrick Jones, an official with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), told reporters in Venice, California that investigators were inspecting the wreckage as well as reviewing documents pertaining to the upkeep of the plane. 'The aircraft will be examined, the engine will be examined, the records of the aircraft will be examined and ultimately we'll submit a factual report,' Jones said. 'All of that process is going to take probably a couple of weeks to a month or so,' the NTSB official said. The final report probably will not be out for a year.' Impact: A doctor has revealed Ford was moaning in pain, slumped over in the cockpit, when he landed . Support: The injured actor is surrounded by first responders as he is taken away on a stretcher . Jones said that the plane being as old as it is in many ways makes the investigation more straightforward. 'This aircraft is a fairly simple aircraft,' he said. 'A lot of it is old-school mechanical. We'll see what it is, we'll look at everything.' Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, flew out of Santa Monica Airport in the Ryan PT-22 Recruit when he experienced engine trouble just minutes into the flight. He was trying to return to the airport when he crashed. Authorities said they have not yet had the opportunity to interview Ford, but plan to do so over the course of their probe. The actor suffered multiple gashes to his head and was left bleeding after the crash. A family spokesman said Ford's injuries were not life-threatening. His son Ben, in a tweet late Thursday, said his father was 'battered, but OK.' Downed: Investigators surround the plane's wreckage. The National Transportation Safety Board say the probe into the crash could take up to a year . Probe: Investigators are examining the wreckage and documents pertaining to the upkeep of the plane in order to determine what happened . Scene: Golf bags surround the crash site in the aftermath on Thursday. Many players on the course at the time rushed to Ford's side when the plane went down . Tired and emotionally drained: The 50-year-old actress appeared understandably distraught . Support system: Calista was accompanied by a silver-haired male companion . Heading home: The weary-looking Calista was perhaps heading home to recharge before making the drive back to hospital . In good hands: Harrison Ford, 72, was last listed in fair to moderate condition in hospital . Fuel leak: The injured actor was pulled from the wreckage as the smell of gasoline filled the air . He and other golfers pulled Ford from the wreckage. Others threw dirt on the fuel so it wouldn't catch fire. Along with his friends who were golfing, Dr Khurana pulled Ford from the wreckage as the smell of gasoline filled the air. 'We wanted to get him out safely and with the fuel leaking out, I motioned to some of the other folks at the golf course to put dirt on the fuel so it wouldn't combust,' he said to CBS News. 'I just wanted to get him out safely so that the situation wouldn't erupt into a fire.' On Thursday, a teary-eyed Calista was seen looking emotional while heading to hospital to visit her husband Harrison in hospital. She had a handkerchief pressed to her nose and her eyes appeared to be tinged in red. Saved: Dr. Sanjay Khurana, who had been golfing when Ford's plane crashed, later said, 'It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his Star Wars films'","The 72-year-old is taken to an ambulance with his neck in a brace .

"This is the moment a driver was rumbled in the carpool-lane with the 'most interesting' of passengers. The state trooper came face-to-face with a life sized cardboard cutout of actor Jonathan Goldsmith when he pulled over the vehicle.

"The warning from Shaun Edwards after Saturday’s demolition job in the Eternal City was that Wales will build on their momentum and arrive at the World Cup with even sharper teeth. After opening with defeat by England, Wales won all of their remaining RBS 6 Nations fixtures. In the end, they were left to rue a late breakaway try from Italy’s Leonardo Sarto that, according to Warren Gatland, represented a title-defining 14-point swing. Wales' Sam Warburton scores a try during the Six Nations demolition of Italy in the 61-20 victory on Saturday . Warburton yells in delight having scored a second-half try for Wales as Warren Gatland's side ran riot . Edwards was left to ponder the ‘what ifs’ in the underground concourses of the Stadio Olimpico, though the defence coach believes Wales will be a significant force when they re-group for summer training camps in Switzerland and Qatar. ‘We’ll be on an even higher plateau by the World Cup,’ he said. ‘The World Cup is the only time that we compete on an equal level to the southern hemisphere teams. They are together for four months every year and we like to think we get better with time together. There are no guarantees but I don’t think we’ll be a bad team come the World Cup.’ The extensive preparations will involve another meeting with Italy for a warm-up match at the Millennium Stadium. Wales' defence coach Shaun Edwards believes the team will be even better by the World Cup . The victorious Wales players applaud the travelling fans at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome . Confidence will be high after the imperious second-half display in Rome — scoring 47 points in 26 minutes — but focus will be on how to shake off their habit of starting campaigns slowly. With most of the squad playing slow-paced regional rugby, fitness levels have been identified as one of the keys to the problem. Gatland will push his side to their limits and centre Jamie Roberts believes they will be even stronger than the Welsh side that reached the 2011 World Cup semi-final in New Zealand. ‘We are definitely better than we were four years ago,’ said Roberts. ‘The core of players are still together and there’s a lot more experience. ‘We know when we get together for a long period of time we are a bloody good team. I think it showed against England that we were a bit rusty when we have just two weeks prep together. The lucky Wales fans who made the trip to the Stadio Olimpico were treated to a masterclass of rugby . Jamie Roberts (centre) opened the try account for Wales early in the first-half on Saturday . ‘Looking back to the last World Cup, we had more time together and really worked in putting in the hard yards in terms of fitness and technical play. That preparation period gives us scope to work on things and improve our conditioning. ‘The warm-up games will be a good measuring stick of where we are. Touch wood, the last few months of the season are injury-free for everyone.’ Based on the defensive display against Ireland and the attacking swagger against Italy, Wales have a powerful formula for success. They broke away from their tight structure on Saturday and played with flair and panache that have been in short supply. Italy capitulated under the speed and intensity, with the Azzurri media calling for coach Jacques Brunel’s head after his side were left chasing shadows. Warren Gatland's men are confident that they can improve ahead of the Rugby World Cup . George North crosses over for Gatland's side as he managed a sensational second half try hat-trick in Rome . ‘We always thought we were capable of an attacking performance like that,’ said Wales skipper Sam Warburton. ‘To be fair to Warren, Rob Howley and the coaches they tell us to play. ‘Over the last few years maybe it was just a confidence issue but we are a lot more confident than we were 24 months ago.’ For the sake of entertainment value it raises the question of whether bonus points should be introduced to incentivise attacking play. Edwards, however, feels there is no need to change the format. ‘I’m not interested in try bonus points or anything like that,’ said Edwards. ‘It’s been one of the best Six Nations in memory. ‘When was the last time three teams had the chance to win it in three separate matches? It’s a great advert for the competition. ‘The defence control what the attack does. If the defence is not very good, you can attack like that. Do you think you could play that kind of rugby against South Africa? If we threw the ball around like that we would lose by 20 points. ‘We’ve taken some positive steps and we’re regretting that bad 40 minutes against England but four wins out of five has been a very good effort for us.’","Wales beat Italy to end their Six Nations campaign on a high note .

"Bath are trying to sign Taulupe Faletau after the World Cup to continue the exodus of leading Wales players to the Aviva Premiership. The 24-year-old Lions No 8 has another full season to run on his current contract with the Newport Gwent Dragons, who have this week indicated that they are 'extremely keen' to retain his services. However, Sportsmail understands that the Tongan-born player is increasingly likely to agree a move to The Rec in the autumn, which would require Bath to pay a transfer fee. Wales No 8 Taulupe Faletau fires out a pass to Jamie Roberts (left) during his side's demolition of the Azzurri . Bath had been linked with Springboks No 8 Duane Vermeulen, but he is set for a big-money move to Toulon . Faletau has been noticeably absent from the list of Wales stars recently signing up for national dual contracts with the Welsh Rugby Union and the regions. Bath have been linked with him in the past but after rumours of a deal in 2013, he committed to another three years at Rodney Parade. Now though, several sources have revealed that the West Country club are closing in. Armed with financial backing from owner Bruce Craig, Bath have become major players in the upper levels of the transfer market. England backrower Ben Morgan was also on Bath's radar before he signed a new deal with Gloucester . They tried to lure South Africa No 8 Duane Vermeulen but it is thought his wage demands were too high and he has opted to move to Toulon instead. Ben Morgan was also on the radar, but he agreed a new deal at Gloucester. If Faletau joins Bath, he will join a growing band of Wales exiles in the Premiership, including George North at Northampton, Richard Hibbard and James Hook at Gloucester, Rhys Priestland who is heading to Bath, and Jamie Roberts who is bound for Harlequins. While Wales coach Warren Gatland has made official his stance against selecting players who move out of the country, he has 'wild card' exemptions and Faletau is certain to fall into that category.","Taulupe Faletau has another full season to run on his current contract .

"Two Everton fans have claimed they sneaked into the Premier League game with Stoke City after one of them pretended to be wheelchair-bound in order to gain access to the disabled section of the Britannia Stadium. The twisted supporters then bragged about their exploits on Facebook - although admitted that some people would see them as 'scum' for their actions. Everton ended up losing the game to Stoke 2-0 and are currently 14th in the league table. Cheat: Two football fans claim they sneaked into the Britannia Stadium by pretending to be disabled . Boast: The supporters posted this message on a Facebook football fans' page admitted they were 'scum' Writing on a Facebook page The Football Bible, one of the fans said: 'Me and my mate decided to go to Stoke away last minute on Wednesday. 'The only spare ticket we could get was in the disabled section though. So he borrowed a wheelchair from work and I went as his carer. 'We're scum aren't we? We're going to hell for what we did in Stoke.' The Everton Disabled Supporters Association has vowed to investigate the fans' claims - but insisted that they could not have obtained their tickets through the club.

He told MailOnline that disabled tickets to away games were generally reserved for fans who regularly attend matches, making it difficult to manipulate the system. Mr Heneghan added: 'You have to keep an eye out for fraudsters. In the past, some fans have just turned up in a wheelchair and been let into the ground - there's no way to guard against that. 'There are people in this world who'll do anything to cheat disabled people. If you're desperate enough, evil enough, devious enough to get into a game, then anyone can do it.' Other disabled fans blasted the stunt at Stoke's Britannia Stadium - Ollie Baskaran wrote on Facebook: 'I'm a wheelchair user and every time I have to book disabled tickets for anywhere, I have to send paperwork etc. just to prove I'm disabled.' However, some web users praised the fans, comparing them jokingly to the fake wheelchair user, Andy Pipkin, on TV's Little Britain.

A spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of the claims of two Everton fans that they gained access to last week's game at the Britannia Stadium masquerading as a disabled supporter in a wheelchair and carer. 'If their claims prove correct and the people concerned can be identified, it will be for Everton to take action against them as appropriate.'

"Claudio Marchisio's knee injury, picked up while away on international duty with Italy, is not as bad as first feared following an initial diagnosis that he would miss the rest of the season. The midfielder was reported to have ruptured ligaments during international training on Friday - with the Azzurri claiming he could be sidelined for between six and eight months before the player returned to Turin for additional tests.

'Whenever I'm called up, it's like the first time,' Coutinho told an LFCTV documentary. 'It's a great honour to wear the Brazilian shirt, which thousands of people dream of wearing one day. I want to honour it whenever I have the opportunity. It means a lot to me. 'I believe being in the team is a dream for every player. You can represent your country. It is a very young squad, so just by having a chance it's a special moment for me. 'My goal is to look for my own space. I believe that is everybody's goal.

'I know that was the only opportunity I had to play at the World Cup in my country,' he continued. 'Whether I should have been called up is a bit complicated to say. I'd rather think about the present and make things happen in the future.

"A 15-year-old boy was arrested Wednesday in the short-lived kidnapping of a 22-month-old toddler that was caught on surveillance video in this small farming town in eastern Washington. The teenage boy, who lives in Sprague, was identified through the use of surveillance video, interviews and evidence collection, Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers said. The boy's identity was being withheld because he is a juvenile, Magers said. 'Over the past 72 hours, deputies and detectives have worked relentlessly on this case,' Magers said in a news release. Scroll down for video... Caught: Authorities have identified the attempted kidnapper in this surveillance footage as a Washington 15-year-old boy. Sprague, Washington authorities have arrested him but have declined to ID him because he is a minor . Detectives started focusing on the teen in the 24 hours before the arrest, Magers said. 'Additional evidence, interviews, DNA collection and surveillance was conducted,' Magers said. 'A search warrant was executed at the suspect's residence.' One of the kidnap victim's young siblings also positively identified the suspect, Magers said. The 15-year-old was booked into a juvenile detention facility on suspicion of second-degree kidnapping, Magers said. The Lincoln County prosecutor's office will make the formal charging decisions. Meanwhile, the brother and sister who bravely gave chase to the teen have spoken about the moments leading up to young Owen Wright being snatched. Brenden, 10, Delicia, 8, and Owen were approached by the stranger as they played in a park in the tiny town of Sprague, Washington, after their babysitter had left them unattended on Sunday. Heroes: Delicia Wright, 8, said that the kidnapper told them he was nice to kids and had been babysitting for a long time, she didn't believe him and her screams helped raise the alarm . Brave: Breden said he wasn't scared by the kidnapper and jumped into action because they he wanted his brother back so they could go to their cousin's birthday party . 'He said he was nice to kids and he had been babysitting for a long time,' Delicia told Good Morning America. Surveillance video shows the man running down the sidewalk with the toddler in his arms. In hot pursuit are Owen's brother and sister. 'I thought he was trying to kidnap him so I ran and screamed,' said Delicia. Big brother Breden said he wasn't scared by the teen and jumped into action because they had an important family function to attend. 'I was chasing him so I could get my brother back for my cousin's birthday party,' he explained. The dramatic scene ended after a pair of local teenagers also chased after the kidnapper and he set the boy down and ran off on Sunday, authorities said. Michael Wright, the father of the three children, said he was relieved that young Owen was unhurt and very proud of his other kids' bravery. 'For my kids to run after him that is an act of courage,' he said. Nicole and Michael Wright hold their 22-month-old son Owen who was abducted from Sprague City Park on Sunday. Owen's sister Delicia, 8, and brother Brenden, 10, were with the toddler and alerted a pair of teenage boys . Wright had left his three children with a babysitter on Sunday while he went to work. They were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house. 'I can't explain the feeling, the anxiety and everything that goes into finding out your children is missing or something has happened to them,' Wright told KXLY-TV. Sheriff's deputies said the 15-year-old talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. Surveillance video from a grocery store showed the kidnapper running, child in arms, with Delicia chasing and Brenden not far behind. 'I said there is something wrong,' she recalled on Tuesday. 'Then this man busts out and runs across the street and he's got a baby and a little girl right behind him screaming,' Giddings said. Isaac Yow, 16, who, along with friend Andrew Crane, 15, chased a 15-year-old who tried to abduct a toddler from a park on Sunday afternoon . 'The girl said, 'That man got my baby brother! That man got my baby brother!'' Giddings said she realized what was happening and sent her teenage grandson and his friend to chase the man. As the older boys approached, the kidnapper put the child down in a vacant lot and fled. No vehicle was seen with the suspect. Authorities said they don't believe the kidnapper is a resident of Sprague, a wheat farming town of about 500 people located 40 miles west of Spokane. 'We'd recognize him if he was local.' said Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers. 'We are leaning on somebody coming through town.' Authorities have no leads in the case.

But we both know each other inside out and how our team will play. ‘Regardless of what happens it won’t affect how close we are.’ Northern Ireland have never qualified for the European Championship finals, and last appeared in a major tournament at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. O’Neill added: ‘I think Mixu has done a great job. His job is quite similar to mine, you have a limited pool of players to choose from and he has got them playing in a nice style. There’s no doubt Finland are a good team but there is a dependence on five or six players.’ O'Neill (pictured) and Paatelainen were together at Cowdenbeath in Scotland .","Northern Ireland face Finland on Sunday night in a European qualifier .

"A high school football recruit has pulled out of attending the University of Oklahoma after a video emerged of a campus fraternity engaged in racist chanting. Jean Delance, a junior at North Mesquite High School in Texas, says he has de-committed from the university and has spoke out in criticism of the footage. The video shows several young men on a bus participating in a chant that included the n-word and referencing lynching. Scroll down for video . Jean Delance, a junior at North Mesquite High School in Texas, who has de-committed from the University of Oklahoma after a video of a campus fraternity emerged showing racist chanting . The footage of the university's chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, also shows at least one woman at the back of the bus clapping her hands along with the vile song, 'There will never be a n***** in SAE.' In a television interview on KTVT in Dallas, Delance described the video as 'very disturbing' and the people in it as 'uneducated'. He said: 'It is very distrubing, I never thought that stuff was still as trendy as back then or that it keeps repeating itself.' He also spoke of his disappointment that Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops did not call him to alert him of the situation. The now-infamous video shows with at least one of the chanting young men wearing a tuxedo, left, while a woman, right claps along with the chant . The University of Oklahoma football team and coaches line up wearing all black in the Everest Training Center in protest of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity video . He added: 'I was just notified by the coaches this morning. I was hoping they would let me know ahead of time. 'If they did that I would have been very calm with it but I just had to find out about it on my own.' The university has now expelled the fraternity over the video with the school's president, David Boren saying he was sickened and couldn't eat or sleep after learning about the video.

National leaders of Sigma Alpha Epsilon have said that its investigation confirmed members took part in the chant and announced it would close the local chapter.

University president David Boren, who says the school were still investigating the video and trying to establish who was on board the bus so they could consider disciplinary action . He said the fraternity was ‘not totally forthcoming’ and he was still trying to find out who was on the bus so the school could consider disciplinary actions. He also added that the university's legal staff was exploring whether the students who initiated and encouraged the chant may have violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination. It's unclear who recorded the video, when it was made and who initially leaked it online. Mr Boren suggested it was likely taken by another student who didn't agree with what was being said about African- Americans.","Jean Delance says he has de-committed from the University of Oklahoma .

"When a fan decided to start an online conversation with JK Rowling about the weekend’s Scotland v Italy rugby match, he was stunned to get a reply. Now the Italian is boxing up a jar of Nutella to send to the Harry Potter author following a wager over which country would win. Andrea Brutto tweeted the writer on Saturday, ahead of the Six Nations clash at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, saying: ‘I’m Italian and I can’t wait for this match. Watch what we can do!’ JK Rowling and her husband watch from the stands during the Six Nations rugby clash between Scotland and Italy at Murrayfield on Saturday . Before the game, the Harry Potter author made a bet with an Italian rugby fan on Twitter saying she would send him a signed book if Scotland won. If Italy won he had to send her a jar of Nutella . To his surprise, Miss Rowling, who lives in Edinburgh, replied: ‘Are you going to be at Murrayfield?’ Her overseas admirer was almost lost for words, saying: ‘I don’t know what to write you cause I don’t understand. Oh my God! Thank you Jo.’ The author then promised to send him a signed book if Scotland won ‘to ease the pain’ – but asked: ‘What will you give me if Italy win?’ He replied: ‘I cannot compare a signed book with one of my gift… But I think a simple but stronger hug or a kiss or a Nutella.’ Miss Rowling agreed, saying: ‘OK, Italy wins, you have to send me some Nutella. Scotland wins, you get a signed book.’ The Italian players celebrate after winning 22-19 in the game, meaning that the author lost the bet with Mr Brutto . After the match, Miss Rowling tweeted the Italian rugby fan congratulating his side on victory and reminding him he still owed her a jar of Nutella . Eventually Mr Brutto replied by posting a picture of the chocolate spread and asking for the author's address so he could send it to her . After a penalty try in the 80th minute gave Italy a 22-19 win over Scotland, she tweeted: ‘At least I’ll have Nutella. Congrats Andrea, you can have the book anyway. I need a very large drink.

"Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho admits he must add more goals to his game as he strives to become one of the best midfielders in Europe.

"Gordon Strachan has declared Scotland  and recalled striker Jordan Rhodes are ready to work together at long last as he prepares to field the nation's 'best out-and-out goalscorer' in a competitive fixture for the first time in 18 months. The national manager kept the Blackburn Rovers hitman in exile as he went about honing a system for the improving Scots, saying that Rhodes was not a fit for the international game he wished to create. But the striker followed up his surprise return to the squad with a substitute appearance in the midweek friendly win over Northern Ireland — and Strachan last confirmed on Saturday that the 25-year-old will be let loose on minnows Gibraltar at some stage of the Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday. Recalled Scotland striker Jordan Rhodes has been called his country's 'best out-and-out goalscorer' Scotland manager Gordon Strachan had left Rhodes out of the side while he changed his formation . Rhodes made his return to the Scotland set-up with an appearance against Northern Ireland on Wednesday . Strachan is set to deviate from his 4-2-3-1 formation in a bid for goals and that could hand Rhodes a start in a two-man strike force against the Group D rookies. It would prove a hit with the Tartan Army, whose favourite Rhodes' last appearance in a qualifying game was as a substitute in a 2-0 defeat by Belgium in September 2013, after which Strachan said he was committed to a style that 'doesn't suit' the £8million forward. Now Rhodes and Strachan's plans are equipped to blend, with the manager explaining: 'I think we've evolved since he was last in the squad and, although he has not evolved with us, I think he has the intelligence to get better all the time because he can take things in. 'But I think he would find it easier playing with us now than it was two years ago. I'd say we make it easier for a striker to play with us now. 'He's probably the best out-and-out goalscorer we've got. But that wasn't the criteria to get us kick-started back then with where we wanted to go.' Rhodes missed 11 Scotland fixtures during his omission but is set to earn a 14th cap with a second Hampden appearance in five days. '(His selection) can't be a one-off because we are playing two games,' said Strachan. 'He's already been playing in one and he's going to play in another one. So that's two. 'We have a few players who could find this the right type of game for them. I picked the squad with that in mind. It's up to everyone to play well enough to be in the side. 'I can't say anyone will have a major role in the future. If I said 'he has a major role' and someone comes into the position and is better, he'll have a major role. It's up to you to play well enough to be in there.'

'The more I played in the Ryder Cup, the more I wanted to become captain and, to be honest, if I could have chosen where and when, then it would have been America and now. 'I have thoroughly enjoyed playing there and I have always felt very welcome, so I am particularly delighted that everything I wanted has come to fruition. 'Europe has a chance to make history by winning the Ryder Cup for the fourth time in succession and I am absolutely thrilled to have that opportunity. But, whatever happens, I will also do everything in my power to ensure the good name of the game and the true spirit of this incredible match is carried forward. 'What made this honour even more amazing is that Davis Love has been elected American captain. We have been very good friends ever since I first started playing in America and I have the upmost respect for him as both a player and a person.

"Six  months after a machete was carved into his thigh, Kell Brook finds himself in a situation where he has to walk like he talks. The fact that he is walking at all is a measure of progress, considering the damage caused during the vicious assault he suffered on holiday in Tenerife last September. But the greater question, and one that has lingered since his condition was no longer deemed life-threatening, centres on what kind of fighter will return to the ring. The answer will finally come on Saturday, when the 28-year-old faces Jo Jo Dan, a tough Romanian who is mandatory challenger for the IBF welterweight world title Brook brilliantly won weeks before he was assaulted. Kell Brook is ready to return to the ring against Jo Jo Dan just six months after he suffered a machete attack . Brook showed off the scar on his thigh from the attack (left) before putting in more hours ahead of his return . Brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die, or that he would be unable to walk ever again . 'I went from being on top of the world to the bottom of the ocean,' was how Brook put it in an interview with Sportsmail last September, his first since the attack. Then, like now, Brook's outlook was dominated by fighting talk and attempts at positive thinking. On Thursday, he says physical testing at his gym in Sheffield shows he is 'getting the same, if not better results, than for the Shawn Porter fight' in which he won the belt. But boxing is a hype industry. And one memory from that initial conversation in his parents' living room is of a subdued fighter revealing that a doctor had recently told him the numbness in his left thigh — pieced together by 38 staples — might never fully go away. Dan has earned his shot at Brook after becoming the mandatory challenger for his IBF world title . Until he steps into the ring in front of Sky's cameras, only Brook himself truly knows if there is any residual physical consequence of the attack, after which he left a trail of blood across a holiday resort before collapsing unconscious and being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. 'I don't have any problems,' he said ahead of Friday's weigh-in. 'I look down and see a scar and that's about it, really. But I remember, when I woke up in hospital in Tenerife, no-one had come to see me yet and I was looking down at the leg. There were drips in each arm. I just thought, 'Two weeks ago I was top of the world and now I am in a hospital bed after major surgery'. I can remember thinking, 'This is horrific'. There were all these staples in it holding it together and I thought it was like a shark attack. I was lucky to be alive. 'I couldn't even walk up the stairs to get on the plane back to England. But here we are.' Brook at home shortly after he was stabbed (left) and showing his scar (right) on the week of his fight . It's a fascinating junction in Brook's career. Sportsmail understands that his promoter Eddie Hearn has kept open the possibility of using Wembley stadium on June 13 should he finally succeed in luring Amir Khan into a huge domestic fight. But Khan is apparently uninterested in Hearn's offer of a £4million payday despite a recent encouraging meeting between camps in Blackpool. Brook said: 'I think the Amir Khan fight is gone for this year. I'm the world champion and I will fight some other massive name.' In the long term, Hearn's ambitious hope is to stage an autumn fight against the winner of Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather — a bout that would unify the division's titles. But there is a long, unpredictable queue to either of those mammoth names, who are considered likely to hold a September rematch depending on the outcome of their May 2 meeting. The attack left Brook needing 32 metal staples in his left thigh after blood was 'spurting everywhere' out of it . Hearn has so far held productive talks with the representatives of legendary Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez, as well as former lightweight world champion Brandon Rios, over a summer bout. Brook said: 'I was born to do this. I have a second chance at it after everything that's happened. I believe it is my destiny to go out there and keep winning. 'I always believed it was my destiny to become world champion and I did. I keep telling myself that I won't stop, not just winning one world title but I want to do it at different weights. Brook seemed in good spirits as he got back into the ring at the workout on Tuesday afternoon . 'It's been horrible going through everything since the attack, all the rehab and everything else but now I am the fittest I have ever been and can't wait to get back in the ring again.' When he does, it will become clearer how much walking one of Britain's most talented fighters can still do.","Kell Brook was the victim of a machete attack in Tenerife in September .

"Next stop the Masters for Rory McIlroy and let's hope his final competitive hole before the season's first major in just over a fortnight's time proves a portent of things to come. Taking dead aim with his second shot on the dangerous 18th hole at Bay Hill on Sunday, the world No 1 judged it beautifully. The eight iron approach finished just 6ft from the hole and he rapped home the birdie putt for a 70 for a tied 11th finish in his first appearance at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where American Matt Every completed a successful title defence. Given McIlroy climbed to within a stroke of the lead on Friday with a run of five birdies in a row during his second round 66, it hardly represented the summit of his ambitions for the weekend. Rory McIlroy finished strongly but had to settle for 11th place at the Arnold Palmer Invitational . Matt Every (left) celebrates winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational and is given the trophy by the man himself . American champion Every made a successful defence of the trophy at Bay Hill on Sunday . But the tournament was really all about prep work ahead of his attempt to become the first European to complete the career Grand Slam and in those terms, he pronounced himself content. 'I feel like I got what I wanted out of the week and saw some progress on the things I am working on between now and Augusta,' he said. 'Now I'll go away and work on them some more and hopefully be ready for the Masters.' That work will be completed at the Bear's Club near his home in South Florida, where the greens will be a lot closer to Augusta speed than those at Bay Hill last week, where he never really looked comfortable. As for the Masters, McIlroy said: 'I'm excited with it now so close, and the chance to win a third major in a row and become just the sixth player to complete the career grand slam. It is a nice position to be in and I am going to embrace it.' McIlroy began seven shots off the lead and threatened briefly to assemble the sort of final round charge that saw him make up just such a deficit to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth last year. Stenson threw away a golden opportunity to win Palmer's tournament . Ian Poulter also had a disappointing weekend as he finished outside the top 20 . He birdied the two par fives, the fourth and sixth, and looked certain to birdie the 8th but the putt somehow failed to drop. McIlroy bent over in exasperation and at the next his race was run in terms of winning when he ran up an untidy bogey. It looked as if the round would fizzle out but he assembled something of a grandstand finish with two birdies in his last three holes. Alongside McIlroy, Europe's other leading hope for a first Masters triumph in 16 years must be the Swede Henrik Stenson but he will be smarting right now after throwing away a golden opportunity to win Palmer's tournament. After two fourth place finishes in a row in Florida, he began the final round with a two stroke lead. After losing it on the front nine owing largely to some forceful attacking play from Americans Morgan Hoffmann and Every, he had regained it with four holes to play. The only thing that has ever held him back, however, has been his putting and his weakness showed up again with successive three putts at the 15th and 16th holes. How costly that proved as Every played a marvellous iron shot to the 18th to set up what proved the clinching birdie. Stenson could not match it to give the unsung Floridian a one shot win. As for Ian Poulter, the UK's other player in contention at halfway, he will be disappointed with his weekend's work after a final round 72 left him outside the top 20.","Rory McIlroy finished strongly but had to settle for 11th place .

"Henrik Stenson was angry with tournament officials after two late mistakes cost him victory in the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill on Sunday. Stenson had seen his two-shot overnight lead turned into a two-shot deficit in the space of eight holes, but fought back to reclaim the outright lead with six holes of the final round to play. However, the Ryder Cup star - who had played the final four holes in four under par on Friday and Saturday - three-putted the 15th for a bogey and did the same for par on the 16th after finding the green in two.

Morgan Hoffmann shakes hands with Stenson on the 18th green after the final round of the tournament . And American Matt Every took full advantage with a birdie from 15 feet on the 18th to complete a closing 66, which made him the third player in the tournament's history to successfully defend the title. Stenson was unhappy at being timed for slow play on the back nine, telling reporters: 'I'm obviously a little disappointed with the outcome. 'I'm as much disappointed with the PGA Tour officials for putting us on the clock on 15, starting to chase us down the stretch. It's busy enough trying to close out a golf tournament and to play the finishing holes without being on the clock. I did not see the reason for that really.' Every, who was four behind heading into the final round last year and three adrift of Stenson on Sunday, said: 'Last year I just made everything but this year I was driving it really well and my irons were spot on.

World number one Rory McIlroy finished eight shots behind the winner after a closing 70, but expressed his satisfaction with his form ahead of his bid to win a third major title in succession and complete the career grand slam in next month's Masters at Augusta. 'I feel like I got what I wanted out of the week, four good competitive rounds,' McIlroy told Sky Sports 4. 'I saw some progress on some of the things I was working on last week. I still need to work on some things ahead of Augusta. 'I am excited going there with the opportunity to achieve three in a row, the career grand slam. It's a nice position to be in. I'm going to embrace it, try not to build it up too much. I know it's a big deal but hopefully I can get my game as good as I possibly can.'

"A judge in South Africa on Monday convicted Bob Hewitt, a former Grand Slam tennis champion, of raping and sexually assaulting three girls whom he had been coaching. The assaults occurred decades ago, according to the victims who are now grown women. Judge Bert Bam granted bail of about $840 (£562), which Hewitt's wife, Delaille, paid. The judge did not say why the bail amount was so low. A sentencing hearing was scheduled in a Pretoria court for April 17. Until then he must mostly remain in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, where he lives, the judge ruled. Hewitt can also visit his daughter, who lives in Johannesburg. Police will confiscate Hewitt's passport from his home on Wednesday. Former Grand Slam tennis champion Bob Hewitt has been convicted of rape and sexual assault . South African Hewitt, pictured in action at Wimbledon in July 1968, must now wait for his sentencing hearing . The charges stemmed from events in the 1980s and 1990s, prosecutors said. Hewitt, who is 75 years old, had denied the charges. The judge rejected an application by Hewitt's attorney, Terry Price, to postpone sentencing so the defence can prepare a psychologist's report that it plans to use in its argument for leniency at the sentencing hearing. Prosecutor Carina Coetzee said that she does not believe there should be any reduction of sentence because so much time has passed. One accuser, 45-year-old Suellen Sheehan, laid an accusation of rape against Hewitt in 2011 and was in court for the verdict. She said her former coach raped her in his car before tennis practice when she was 12 years old. Alleged victims of sexual abuse are typically not identified, but Sheehan and another accuser, Theresa Tolken, have agreed to be named. 'He knows what he did and he's had to live with that,' Sheehan said. The charges against Hewitt stem from events that occured in the 1980s and 1990s . Tolken, said Hewitt raped her in a hotel room in South Africa when she was 13. A third woman, who has asked not to be identified, said Hewitt sexually assaulted her numerous times during tennis practice in Johannesburg in the early 1990s when she was 16. Australian-born Hewitt sat with arms crossed and appeared impassive as the judge explained the reasoning behind his verdict. His wife sat nearby. A South African advocacy group said it does not want Hewitt's advanced age to result in a light sentence. 'This is a case that involves the rape of children, bottom line,' said Germaine Vogel, spokeswoman for Woman and Men Against Child Abuse. The group helped two of the three accusers come forward. Hewitt (left) leaves the court in Johannesburg alongside his wife Delaille . The judge said he is satisfied that all three women told the truth. Bam said the striking similarities among the three women's testimonies showed that Hewitt's conduct was calculated, and revealed a pattern of behavior. All three were impressionable young girls, flattered by the attention of a renowned player, according to the judge. 'Their submissiveness in the circumstances should never have been seen as consent,' said Bam. Letters that Hewitt wrote to one of his accusers, Theresa Tolken, were cited in detail as corroborating evidence. The judge said Hewitt had failed to convince him that the letters were only about tennis. Hewitt was a 15-time Grand Slam doubles champion, winning doubles and mixed doubles titles. He was inducted into the International Hall of Fame, but was suspended indefinitely in 2012 after the Hall of Fame found enough credibility in the sexual assault allegations after its own investigation.","Bob Hewitt has been convicted of raping and sexually assaulting three girls whom he had been coaching in the 1980s and 1990s .

"The European Tour will look to stage the Madeira Islands Open later in the year after it was cancelled due to bad weather on Sunday. The tournament had already been reduced to 36 holes for the second year in succession, but torrential rain meant no play was possible in the second and final round at Santo da Serra. Keith Waters, chief operating officer of the European Tour, said: 'The Madeira Islands Open - Portugal - BPI is a hugely important event for The European Tour so it is disappointing for everyone concerned that we have been forced to cancel this week. Bad weather forced the Madeira Islands Open to be cancelled by officials on Sunday . 'We share a very strong relationship with the hosts and sponsors, so we are already in discussions with the club and the sponsors to reschedule the event for another week in this year's Race to Dubai schedule. 'We must now make every effort to make sure that the Madeira Islands Open takes place this year and that together we can show the world the true potential of this great event and this beautiful island.' Winds gusting up to 47 miles per hour meant no play had been possible on Thursday, while further strong winds on Friday caused a delay of almost two hours before rain ended play early. The European Tour event had already been reduced to 36 holes before Sunday's cancellation . Officials and greenkeepers tried their best to prepare the course for play but the conditions prevailed . Half of the field had yet to complete their rounds when play was abandoned for the day at 6pm and heavy rain which flooded the course caused further disruption on Saturday. With yet more bad weather forecast for Sunday, the decision was taken to make it a 36-hole event, with the top 65 and ties due to play the final round in a shotgun start at 8am. Denmark's JB Hansen held the clubhouse lead on four under par, one shot ahead of a group of eight players including England's Andrew Marshall and Scotland's Peter Whiteford, with the entire field separated by just six shots. It is thought to be the first European Tour event to be cancelled due to bad weather since the Compaq European Grand Prix at Slaley Hall in 1998. European Tour officials will look to reschedule the event for later in the year . Tournament director Jose Maria Zamora said: 'Unfortunately we had 60mm of rain overnight and throughout Sunday and the course became totally unplayable. That made it impossible to start and finish the second round today. 'That would have put us into Monday and we had already been issued a warning for very strong winds on Monday which would again have made the course unplayable. 'We have been very unfortunate with the weather this week but we are hoping to reschedule and show the true potential of the island.'","Madeira Islands Open was cancelled due to bad weather .

"Bernie Ecclestone has suggested next year's German Grand Prix could also fall by the wayside just days after this season's race was officially dropped from the Formula One calendar. As per their contract, Hockenheim is scheduled to host the event in 2016, but at this early stage F1 supremo Ecclestone is uncertain whether it will go ahead. Asked whether he could confirm it would take place, Ecclestone, speaking to a select media group in the paddock at the Malaysian Grand Prix, replied: 'No.' Bernie Ecclestone (left) says German Grand Prix may miss out on the Formula One calendar next year . Informed that Hockenheim has a contract for 2016 and 2018, Ecclestone added: 'It doesn't make a difference. A lot of people have a contract.' Ecclestone intimated if Germany was unable to afford the race this year, then it will struggle to pay the hosting fee next season. The Nurburgring was scheduled to host the race in July, but due to numerous financial difficulties behind the scenes was ultimately forced to withdraw. Ecclestone then turned to Hockenheim to step in and fill the void, but negotiations broke down and time ran out as circuit officials believed they did not have ample time to promote and sell tickets. Hockenheim and Nurburgring have hosted the German Grand Prix for the past seven years . 'The trouble in Germany was the Nurburgring spent an awful lot of money which they borrowed,' added Ecclestone. 'They didn't need to spend what they spent, and therefore didn't need to borrow the amount they borrowed. 'They forgot to pay it back, and that caused a few ripples. It sent a bad message.' Ecclestone didn't confirm if Hockenheim would host next year's race despite having a contract in place . Historic European races are now fast falling away with France, San Marino and now Germany losing their place on the calendar in recent times. Italy is another that will struggle to pay its way beyond the expiry of its current contract in 2016 unless national government steps in to assist, or Ecclestone reduces his fees. Asked whether he was prepared to see F1's European heartland wither away, Ecclestone said: 'There are lots of things we all would like, but we don't have them because we can't afford them.' Suggested to Ecclestone 'if Monza goes, it goes', he said: 'Whatever goes, goes.' The Formula One supremo said Hockenheim having a contract in place 'doesn't make a difference' Ecclestone did concede, however, 'it would be terrible' if Europe did lose all its races, particularly as the series would no longer become a world championship. Many people believe Ecclestone's hosting fees are too steep, which in turn prompts promoters to charge extortionate ticket prices, leading to reduced numbers through the turnstiles. Hockenheim, for instance, saw its audience plummet from more than 100,000 in 2012 to just 60,000 in 2014, despite Sebastian Vettel being a four-time world champion at that stage and Mercedes dominating last year. 'Probably right,' said Ecclestone, regarding comments about over-charging. 'But the teams get 62 per cent of whatever profit the company (CVC, who run the sport) makes, so if we make less money, the teams make less money.' The German Grand Prix has alternated between Hockenheim and Nurburgring since 2007 .","The German Grand Prix was axed from this year's Formula One calendar .

"Williams driver Valtteri Bottas has been warned by the FIA he must stop driving the moment he suffers a repeat of the back pain that forced him out of the Australian Grand Prix. Bottas sustained a very small tear in the annular part of a disc in his lower back during qualifying, leading to severe pain. Although the Finn made himself available to drive on Sunday morning ahead of the race, the FIA ultimately declared him unfit. Valtteri Bottas briefs the press about his injury at the Sepang Circuit Medical Centre on Thursday . Bottas declared himself fit for Melbourne after suffering a back injury in qualifying, but still missed the race . Ahead of Sunday's race in Malaysia, Bottas has now been given the all clear, albeit with the proviso from the FIA that 'in case of a recurrence of pain, or any abnormal feeling, he must stop at the earliest opportunity'. Bottas has no doubt he will come through unscathed as he said: 'The back is good, no pain, which is nice. 'At the end of last week I could do something without any pain, and during the weekend I could swim, cross-train without any pain, so the recovery was really good. 'We've done everything we can in this short period of time - luckily there are two weeks - so I feel confident of getting back in the car.' Bottas has revealed the injury was due to his brake and seat position inside his car, which have since been corrected. 'The back is now in a more neutral position, less pressure on the discs. We are confident that should be it,' added Bottas. Preparations are ramping up in Kuala Lumpur ahead of the Malaysian Grand Prix . Mercedes director Toto Wolff (right) speaks with Bottas in the paddock in Kuala Lumpur . 'I've never had any problems before with the lower back. That kind of thing normally takes a bit of time to build up. 'But there was no warning, it went suddenly under maximum braking. It was like someone putting a knife in there, with the pain ramping up through to midnight. 'During the night it started to ease off. In the morning I would have been ready to race. 'I did pass the tests, but the FIA had access to all the material from the hospital, from the MRI and that stuff. 'Maybe they thought it was better (not to race) in the longer term, which could have been true. 'It was very disappointing, but I also respect the FIA's decision, with the support great from the team.' As a precaution, Williams on Thursday announced Adrian Sutil as their reserve driver, with the German back in Formula One after being axed by Sauber at the end of last year. Although Susie Wolff is test driver and young Briton Alex Lynn the development driver, Williams believe experience is crucial should a sudden change be required. Sir Frank Williams said: 'The fight for a top constructors' championship position will be intense this season. 'Therefore we have selected a driver with recent race experience and are confident if the need arose, he would be a solid pair of hands to race the FW37 and assist our 2015 campaign.'","Valtteri Bottas suffered tear in a disc in his lower back in Melbourne .

"Renault, which supplies engines to the Red Bull and Toro Rosso teams, is considering pulling out of Formula One because of the damage done to its reputation after a difficult start to the season. Renault Sport F1 managing director Cyril Abiteboul said Friday he is looking at his options, 'including getting out of Formula One.' 'If Formula One is that bad for Renault's reputation, if we see that we will continue to struggle with the current formula, if Formula One is not delivering on the value that it costs Renault ... this is what we're looking at,' he said. Renault's Cyril Abiteboul (centre) is pictured at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on Friday . However, Abiteboul was also asked whether Renault was weighing up the option of buying an existing F1 team and becoming a race constructor again. 'We'll have to review the situation from a marketing and strategic perspective,' Abiteboul said. Renault won championships in 2005 and 2006 but withdrew from the sport after heavy penalties for fixing the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. The team principal of Toro Rosso, which is considered to be a takeover target if Renault took that step, said the Italy-based team would be receptive to an offer from Renault. 'This would be a fantastic opportunity for Toro Rosso to make the next step forward,' Franz Tost said. 'To be part of a manufacturer, to work together with a manufacturer, and be owned by a manufacturer would be exactly the step the team needs.' Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo in action during the first practice session for the Malaysian Grand Prix . Two other teams considered to be possible targets for Renault are Force India and Lotus, which have had financial troubles, but both played down any interest. Both teams have engine supply deals with Mercedes through 2020. 'We are not looking for a buyer and are not for sale,' Lotus chief executive Matthew Carter said. Force India deputy principal Bob Fernley said: 'I have had absolutely no discussion at all with Renault.' If Renault pulls out of F1, or switches from engine supplier to competitor, it would put Red Bull in a difficult situation. Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen drives during Friday's practice at the Sepang International Circuit . Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said such a change may leave the Austrian-based parent company with no option but to withdraw from the sport, too, because there would be no other viable option for engine supply. 'It sound like Franz wants to sell his team to Cyril and we will then need an engine,' Horner said. 'Should we find ourselves in a situation without an engine supplier ... you could find yourself actually forced out of the sport.' Red Bull and Horner have expressed frustration with the lack of cost control in the sport, and he referenced that again Friday. Abiteboul (left) sits alongside Red Bull team principal Christian Horner at a press conference on Friday . 'Is Formula One delivering for Red Bull as a brand? There are some worrying signs,' Horner said. 'Red Bull wants to be in Formula One and we want to try and address some of the issues that are currently plaguing the sport that we don't seem to be able to find any traction with.' Horner also said Red Bull has no plans to start making its own engines - a theory fueled by the team's new deal with engineering group Ilmor. 'We have no intention of being an engine manufacturer,' Horner said. 'We (Red Bull and Ilmor) are trying to work in co-ordination with Renault to assist in the areas where perhaps they are not strong.'","Renault is considering pulling out of Formula One .

"We see Jessica Ennis-Hill on TV adverts and billboards, promoting bank accounts, health insurance and sportswear. It is easy to forget we have not seen her on the athletics track for more than 18 months and it has been more than two-and-a-half years since she won Olympic gold on a mild summer evening in Stratford, her most recent heptathlon. Her management team have done a stellar job maintaining her profile during the 18 months she has been away from competition, during which time she had her first baby, Reggie. Jessica Ennis-Hill celebrates her triumph at London 2012 - but she is more likely to be seen in adverts of late . The Olympic heptathlon champions is working under the guidance of long-time coach Toni Minichiell . Liz McColgan, 10,000m . Won gold at Tokyo World Championships in 1991, less than a year after she gave birth to daughter Eilish. Paula Radcliffe, Marathon . Had daughter Isla in February 2007 and won New York marathon later that year. Jo Pavey, 10,000m . Had the best season of her career in 2014, culminating in European Championships gold 10 months after having second child Emily. Catriona Matthew, Golf . Became the first Scotswoman to win the British Open, just 10 weeks after having her second child. Kim Clijsters, Tennis . Won the US Open in 2009, just a couple of years after retiring to start a family. But with the announcement that she will make her comeback in the 100 metres hurdles at the Great City Games in Manchester on May 9 come the inevitable questions. Can she recapture the form that put her on top of the world and does her future status as Britain’s golden girl depend on it? At the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, she is working her socks off under the guidance of long-time coach Toni Minichiello, who is learning new things every day about working with an athlete who has recently given birth. He is broadly optimistic but cautions against expecting too much from her immediately. ‘She’s a couple of months behind where she needs to be so we’re just building back steadily,’ he said. ‘It’s going to be a very big challenge and I wouldn’t expect huge things straight away. But she’s getting back to where she was in terms of some of the markers we’ve put down.’ Back when Ennis-Hill won Olympic gold, a 19-year-old Katarina Johnson-Thompson was 15th, just happy to share a start line with her compatriot. Now 22, Johnson-Thompson is the world’s best multi-eventer and broke Ennis-Hill’s British pentathlon record in Prague this month. Asked if it was unfair to expect Ennis-Hill to match Johnson-Thompson, who has already broken three national records this season, Minichiello was coy. ‘You’re talking about competing with the world’s No 1,’ he said. ‘Ask me in June and I’d be able to tell you better.’ Ennis-Hill has not competed since finishing fourth in the 100m hurdles at the  Anniversary Games in 2013 . Katarina Johnson-Thompson is the best multi-eventer around and has broken the British pentathlon record . When asked if Ennis could compete with Johnson-Thompson, Minichiello said: ‘ask me in June' Ennis-Hill has not competed since finishing fourth in the 100m hurdles at the London Anniversary Games in July 2013. An achilles tendon injury ruled her out of the World Championships in Moscow that summer. She continued to train during her pregnancy but it wasn’t until October last year that she returned to the gym, three months after giving birth.The idea that pregnancy somehow benefits female athletes is compelling. There are several examples of women reaching the pinnacle of their sport for the first time or recapturing former glory after having children. Paula Radcliffe was running again 12 days after giving birth in 2007 and won the New York marathon later that year. Last year mother of two Jo Pavey won 10,000m gold at the European Championships 10 months after giving birth to Emily. Pavey later told me the challenges of being a mother far outweigh the benefits. ‘I know people say it’s a physiological advantage,’ she said. ‘But you have nine months of deconditioning and end it all with a childbirth and while recovering you’re in a breastfeeding state and having no sleep for months. That can’t be beneficial to an athletic performance in the near future.’ Minichiello has noticed some benefits in endurance work but the negatives in terms of explosive power needed for multi-eventing are more obvious. Paula Radcliffe was running again 12 days after giving birth in 2007 and later won the New York marathon . Jo Pavey won 10,000m gold at the European Championships 10 months after giving birth to daughter Emily . Although Ennis-Hill will join Johnson-Thompson in Manchester, the first time the pair will go head-to-head will be in Gotzis, Austria later in the month. Johnson-Thompson’s coach Mike Holmes said they were ‘neutral’ about the potential rivalry, saying: ‘I adore Jess but I can understand why the wider world is fascinated by their match-up and rightly so. ‘If Jess can recapture almost her best that would leave them on a fairly even keel. If Jess was in London shape, she would have the edge but if she’s 100 points off and Kat is at her best it would go down to the wire in the 800m (the final event of the heptathlon).’ Minichiello instructs Ennis-Hill at the Olympic Stadium back in 2012 and is hoping to bring her back to the top . Ennis-Hill and Johnson-Thompson will go head-to-head will be in Gotzis, Austria later in May . Rupert Grant, of Generate Sport Sponsorship, claimed the pair are unlikely to directly compete for advertisers’ money. ‘Jess can play it smartly by supporting Kat as her successor,’ he said. ‘Performance on the track is critical because you can only maintain a profile based on personality alone for so long. But if Jess doesn’t repeat the success to the same level as before, she has cemented herself in the public eye enough to focus on off-track opportunities.’ If she plays her cards right, though, Ennis-Hill could write one of the great sporting comeback stories. Rupert Grant, of Generate Sport Sponsorship, claimed Ennis-Hill and Johnson-Thompson are unlikely to directly compete for advertisers’ money with each other ahead of the comeback of the former .","Ennis-Hill has not been seen on the athletics track for over 18 months .

"Hull defender Andy Robertson has 'no doubt' Chelsea will claim the Barclays Premier League title after witnessing their winning habit first hand. Jose Mourinho's men restored their six-point lead over Manchester City with a 3-2 victory at the KC Stadium on Sunday, substitute Loic Remy grabbing the winner after the Blues let an early two-goal lead slip. Relegation battlers Hull pressed hard for an unlikely decider of their own with the scores tied but Chelsea held on and took their chance when it came. Chelsea's Diego Costa is stopped by Hull City's Andy Robertson and Michael Dawson . And for Scotland international Robertson, those are the qualities that will stand them apart at the end of the campaign. 'There's no doubt Chelsea will be champions,' he said. 'I can't see past them and to be honest I haven't been able to see past them for a while now. 'If they're not at their best they have a manager in Mourinho who gets them to grind out results and that's what they've done again, that's the side they are. 'It's three more points and a step closer to the title. 'At 2-2 we were able to press them higher and make chances, which they didn't deal with too well, but they ground it out and that's why they are going to be champions.' Loic Remy scored Chelsea's winner minutes after coming on in the second half . Remy's shot crept past Allan McGregor and over the line to give Chelsea a 3-2 win . The Tigers may not have improved their own position at the wrong end of the table, but the manner in which they took on the front-runners can at least leave them in good heart. They have arguably the toughest run-in of the bottom five, with Southampton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United still to come, and the ability to compete with the top sides will be a must. 'I don't think we can fault our performance after going 2-0 down to the soon-to-be champions in the first 10 minutes,' said Robertson. 'Our two strikers had their centre-backs on toast, they couldn't deal with our lads at all. Eden Hazard fired Chelsea into an early lead but they were pegged back by Hull before half time . Hazard celebrates his excellent strike that put Chelsea ahead early on . 'John Terry and Gary Cahill are two very good defenders but credit to our strikers, they made them look very ordinary. Unfortunately for us their keeper was on great form. 'If you look at our results we've already picked up points against Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool and we've run Chelsea close twice now, so we take a lot of positives from that. 'A point would have been a bonus but we're glad nobody else picked anything up so we've lost no ground.' Had Chelsea lost points, Thibaut Courtois' first-half gaffe for Hull's equaliser would surely have become a bigger talking point. The Belgian goalkeeper inexplicably miscontrolled Branislav Ivanovic's back pass straight to striker Abel Hernandez, who was left with an open net for his first goal since October. Jose Mourinho's side are six points clear at the top of the Premier League . With the benefit of the three points, not to mention an otherwise superb display from Courtois, Mourinho was able to sweep the incident aside. 'If you tell our goalkeeper every time he has a back pass to kick the ball to the stands the second goal doesn't come, but we don't say that,' he said.

"Gareth Southgate has prioritised holding talks with Mauricio Pochettino in a bid to resolve the uncertainty around Harry Kane’s summer schedule. Southgate has stepped up preparations for Euro 2015 this week, taking his Under 21 squad to Olomouc — where they will be based during the finals in June. On Friday they face the Czech Republic here in Prague. The FA have been meticulously planning their assault on the tournament and Southgate has the backing of Roy Hodgson to take his strongest possible squad available, including Kane. Harry Kane (right) has scored eight goals in ten games for Gareth Southgate's Young Lions . Southgate says he has a good relationship with Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino . But the Tottenham striker’s situation is complicated by his club’s plans to play a money-spinning friendly in Australia at the end of the Premier League campaign, while Sportsmail revealed on Thursday they could also play in Malaysia, too. It has led to fears that Kane, who scored eight goals in 10 games for the Under 21s in qualifying, would be exposed to burnout if he is then made to go on to the Czech Republic. But Southgate plans to meet for talks with Spurs manager Pochettino, saying: ‘The situation with me and Mauricio is good and I have had a (text) exchange with Harry, so I think that situation is good as well. ‘At some point, there needs to be a visit, when we say “Ok, what is the plan?”. But I am relaxed about the situation. We have got a really good relationship with Tottenham and with Harry. Kane is currently training with the England senior squad, but Southgate wants him to play in the summer . Kane's situation is complicated by Tottenham's end of season friendlies in Australia this summer . ‘Mauricio has been very good. He was asked the question “would you like him to rest?” He replied “yes, but” — and the “but” bit has now gone from the debate. I know Mauricio was really proud to play for Argentina and the experiences I have had with him at Tottenham and Southampton is that he has always been really supportive of his international players. ‘As well as that, every quote I have seen from Harry (about playing for the Under 21s this summer) has been very positive.’ Southgate still has a dilemma over Ross Barkley, however. He has not played for the Under 21s since August 2013 and Everton would prefer him to rest this summer after a disappointing season. Barkley was under consideration for this trip, but the midfielder stayed with the senior party. Ross Barkley is eligible for the U21 side, but has never played for the Young Lions under Southgate . Both Barkley and Sterling could travel to the European Championships despite being in the senior squad . ‘I do feel the situation with Ross is different to that of Harry, John Stones and Luke Shaw, as he has never been in one of my squads,’ added Southgate. ‘I was pleased to see Ross named in the senior squad. ‘With Ross not always in Everton’s starting team I think it was important this time round for Roy to back him and keep him involved. Hopefully that gives Ross some belief in what the England set up think of him and his potential.’","England U21 boss says he has a good relationship with Spurs manager .

The West Bromwich Albion midfielder has his eyes on his side’s first European Championship finals appearance but Belfast has not always been a happy hunting ground of late. ‘Our home form wasn’t great in the last campaign,’ Brunt admitted. Chris Brunt is keen to turn Windsor Park into a fortress to help Northern Ireland qualify for Euro 2016 . ‘We have started this campaign well with two away wins, but the home win over the Faroes was also an important result. ‘To build on that would be great. ‘In the last few years, those games were the ones that have tended to let us down. Hopefully we can take that on and carry it on in our remaining four home games and we’ll have a great chance of qualifying.’ The West Brom star is hoping to lead his country into Euro 2016 and they currently lie second in the qualifiers .","Chris Brunt wants to turn Windsor Park into a fortress for Northern Ireland .

"Martin O’Neill says his opinion cannot be swayed by Premier League managers who do not rate his players. The Republic of Ireland boss was making specific reference to winger Aiden McGeady, who has not played a single minute for Everton under Roberto Martinez since the end of January. The 28-year-old is set to figure for the Irish in their crunch Euro qualifier with Group D leaders Poland in Dublin on Sunday night. Everton winger Aiden McGeady is tackled by Ireland team-mate John O'Shea during training this week . McGeady, who has not played for the Toffees since January, jokes with Ireland assistant Roy Keane . But O’Neill, whose fourth-placed side trail their opponents by three points, said: ‘If I was to make a judgement on every single player at club level I might be listening to the wrong comments. ‘Roberto Martinez is absolutely entitled to pick whoever he wants. If he doesn’ t think Aiden is playing well enough to merit a place in his team, that’s entirely up to him. ‘We’ve a different aspect here. We sometimes maybe don’t have that particular choice in hand for players in that position. ‘But Aiden is very important to us and a change of environment might just give him a lift.’ McGeady has scored more goals for his country this season – two – than he has for the Toffees – one. Ireland boss Martin O'Neill says he will not be swayed by Premier League managers' opinions of his players . Former Sunderland and Aston Villa manager says McGeady is a key member of his team . His match-winning double in Georgia in September has helped Ireland stay in contention for one of the two automatic qualifying berths for France 2016. O’Neill added: ‘It’s a disappointment from this side that Aiden’s not playing. It would be great, absolutely fantastic, if players were coming in here on the back of having played the last couple of weekends, but you always sense it’s never going to be that way. ‘What you wouldn’t want is to be going into a game with maybe three or four not having played that much football. ‘But I think adrenaline can carry you a certain distance. Listen, this is a big game, a really big game. It’s taken a long while for it to come around and it’s nearly upon us now so they should feed off all of this and be really positive.’ McGeady was sent off in Everton's FA Cup third round replay against West Ham in January .

"This was a walkover, a day Reading undermined the race for Premier League promotion in a bid to reach Wembley. Steve Clarke's decision to make nine changes is surely down to the ridiculous scheduling of Monday’s FA Cup quarter-final replay against Bradford, but some of his Championship counterparts might not be impressed. Young Reading were picked off by Watford. That’s not the fault of Clarke, the blame lying squarely with wretched broadcasting rules which deem domestic cup games cannot be played on the same night as Champions League fixtures. Almen Abdi (centre) got Watford off to a dream start against Reading by scoring  inside a minute . Watford striker Troy Deeney celebrates Abdi's strike as the Hornets set the tone for the match early on . Watford (4-3-1-2): Gomes 6.5; Motta 7.5, Ekstrand 7, Cathcart 6.5, Pudil 7; Watson 8, Guedioura 7 (Layun 58, 6), Tozser 6; Abdi 7 (Forestieri 7, 8.5); Vydra 8 (Angella 83), Deeney 7.5 . Subs not used: Bond, Doyley, Paredes, Anya . Goals: Abdi 1, Vydra 39, Deeney 48, Forestieri 85 .

Subs not used: Lincoln, Long, Kuhl, Edwards . Goal: Karacan 70 . Referee: Darren Bond (Lancashire) Attendance: 16,600 . But other managers, particularly Mark Warburton and Steve McClaren - whose sides both dropped points - may talk of a duty of care to the league, even if Reading can do nothing but finish mid-table themselves. The average squad number of the visitors here was 26, a statistic to tell all. Clarke is set to name a completely fresh XI tomorrow night and was understandably prickly when asked about the changes. ‘What ramifications? I can’t think for the life of me why there would be any ramifications - I’m not concerned whatsoever,’ he said. I’m allowed to pick from my squad, so I’ll pick from my squad. I don’t understand.’ Fifty-two seconds is all it took the hosts, Troy Deeney popping a neat ball into Almen Abdi, who stroked beyond Mikkel Anderson with the outside of his boot. Marco Motta’s stunning 30-yard half-volley cannoned off the bar six minutes later. Anderson then made an acrobatic save from early substitute Fernando Forestieri’s overhead kick, and this was put beyond doubt when Matej Vydra slipped his man and lifted into the net with ease before half-time.

Vyrdra (right) watches on as his shot goes past Reading goalkeeper Mikkel Andersen on 39 minutes . Just after the break Forestieri darted round his man at the byline, allowing Deeney to get in on the act, tapping home from inside the six-yard box. ‘I’ve got to be happy today,’ Hornets boss Slavisa Jokanovic said. ‘Reading have an important game in front of them - I expected changes.’ To their credit, Clarke’s side improved and he will leave Vicarage Road with some sense of satisfaction after Jem Karacan - making just his second appearance since September 2013 because of persistent knee problems - bent a classy consolation on his comeback. But Forestieri was to slam in a fourth late on, banging the club mascot’s drum in celebration.

"Northern Ireland midfielder Steven Davis admitted he could not have envisaged the ongoing strife Rangers would suffer as he prepared to return to Glasgow almost three years after leaving Ibrox. Davis was sold by Rangers to Southampton in July 2012, just after they were relaunched in the Scottish Third Division following the club's liquidation crisis. He returns to Glasgow for Northern Ireland's friendly against Scotland with his former club having come through more off-field drama and struggling to complete their journey back to the top flight of Scottish football. Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis returns to Glasgow to play Scotland in a friendly on Wednesday . Davis trains ahead of Northern Ireland's clash with Scotland at Hampden Park . Rangers' win at Hibernian on Sunday was only their second in 10 games and it inadvertently clinched the Scottish Championship title for Hearts as they battle to go up through the play-offs. Davis has watched the drama unfold from Southampton and hopes the rise to power of Dave King and his allies, along with the arrival of Stuart McCall as manager, will get the club back on course. 'I think it's positive for the club,' the 30-year-old said. 'For any fan it's nice to see with people who obviously have the interest of the club at heart.

'If the opportunity arose it would be something I would definitely have to consider. It was a great time.'

I have not really had the chance to come back up for a game of any magnitude so it's nice to be back up and get the chance to catch up with some familiar faces and get another chance to play at Hampden. 'I was lucky enough to play there quite a few times and had some success there so I'm looking forward to going back. 'It's a good friendly for both ourselves and Scotland. I expect the game to have a bit of an edge because both sets of players are used to playing against each other at various stages of their careers.

"They have made well over 1000 appearances between them for Barcelona, but Andres Iniesta has admitted that he sometimes struggles to play in the same team as Xavi.

Despite their incredible careers, Iniesta (left) says that he sometimes struggles to play alongside Xavi . 'But it is always a privilege to be by his side because not only does he make your job easier, but he also makes the team work better. 'Sometimes, as with all players, things don't work out. We have been together for a long time now and the feelings are always very good, though.' At 30 and 35 respectively, Iniesta and Xavi have had long and illustrious careers at the Nou Camp, collecting trophy after trophy under a number of different managers. Since Iniesta made his debut in 2002, the pair have been regulars in the first team at Barcelona . Iniesta, at the age of 30, impressed in the midfield on Sunday in the Barcelona midfield against Rayo Vallecano . But together they have remained, and when Barcelona took to the field to face Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, there they were in the midfield once more.

Iniesta though, is still focused on the matches to come. Eibar in the league, Manchester City in the Champions League, and then a Clasico to potentially decide the title. 'More important than being at the top or not is the general feeling of the team after the game we just played,' Iniesta continued. 'We feel good and have to continue along that line.

Barcelona cannot register any new players until next January as part of their of the imposed transfer ban but can still sign players and Koke is top of Enrique's wishlist. Koke, 23, played a key role in Atletico's title-winning campaign last season and has made 16 appearances for the national side and set up the winning goal as Spain beat Ukraine 1-0 on Friday night. The performance of Vicente del Bosque's side is another source of debate on the front pages in Spain after they laboured to victory in the Euro 2016 qualifier. Alvaro Morata scored the goal's only game - his first for Spain - in the opening half before Ukraine gave the reigning European champions a fright in the second.

"Referees' chief Mike Riley has called for video technology to be trialled in the wake of another blunder that saw the wrong West Brom player sent off at Manchester City. Neil Swarbrick apologised on Saturday night for wrongly red-carding Gareth McAuley in the second minute of West Brom's 3-0 loss at the Etihad Stadium, when it was team-mate Craig Dawson who committed a foul on Wilfried Bony. It followed last month's Old Trafford mistaken identity muddle that saw Sunderland's Wes Brown sent off by Roger East for bringing down Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao, when the offence in question was committed by John O'Shea.

The West Brom players emphatically protest the red card as McAuley is dismissed by referee Swarbrick . McAuley (right) appears to ask the referee if he's got the right man after Craig Dawson committed the foul . Asked why referees do not listen to players' on-field explanations of such circumstances, Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) general manager Riley said: 'The referee has got to make his decision based on what he thinks he's seen. His instincts often lead him to trust his judgement. 'It's one of the areas that would lend itself to technology. 'The game has stopped and there's time before we restart the game to have a look at something. That would provide the concrete evidence that would get the decision right. 'I think football as a whole has to look at how we can enhance refereeing performances through the use of technology. West Brom defender Craig Dawson makes a challenge on Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony . Bony continues but Gareth McAuley comes across in cover and gets the ball before the man . 'We've been open-minded to things like the goal-decision system which has made a great difference and a great benefit to referees in the Premier League. 'We need to see what other technology can be used to get refereeing decisions more accurate.' He added: 'We need to test it in live football. Until we do that, we won't know the impact on the game. 'Technology can be helpful but we don't want to destroy the fabric of the game, the fast-flowing spectacle we all love.' BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . McAuley walks past his furious manager Tony Pulis after the latest case of mistaken identity . Riley, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme, did not offer any confirmation that Swarbrick will referee in the next round of Premier League matches, following the international break. 'I've spoken to Neil quite a lot last night and this morning,' Riley said. 'Referees accept at every level your performance will be scrutinised. Any referee, when you come off and you've made a mistake, you're hurt, because you love the game. 'What you want to do is make the correct decision and when you don't there's that feeling that you've let yourself down and let your colleagues down. 'When they make mistakes, it's our job to make sure they understand the mistakes, learn from it and they put it right in the next game.' West Brom captain Darren Fletcher had urged Swarbrick not to leap into the decision to brandish a red card. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher urged Swarbrick to take his time with the decision before the red card . Fletcher told Match of the Day he had spoken to the referee and told him: 'Just make a sensible decision, it's the first minute of the game, take your time. Take your time because this is a massive decision that impacts the rest of the game.' Fletcher added: 'I was really surprised when he showed the red card. I think a lot of our players were - and then to the wrong player as well, which we were trying to say as well, but it fell on deaf ears.' West Brom boss Tony Pulis last week urged the game to embrace technology and permit each team two appeals against decisions in each match. He wrote in West Brom's programme for the match against Stoke: 'A TV call back should be brought in where for 30 seconds the game could be held up whilst they decide if the original decision was correct or not. Two calls allowed during the game from both sides would be sufficient and I believe would help improve the great package that the Barclays Premier League provides for everybody all over the world.'","Professional Game Match Officials Limited general manager Mike Riley has called for video technology to be trialed .

Both sides made a bright start and it lit up even more for the home side when they took the lead in the ninth minute when Murphy got his 22nd of the season after nine minutes. Richard Chaplow's deep corner was nodded towards goal by Christophe Berra and the league's leading marksman was on hand to cleverly poke the ball home off the inside of the post. Murphy almost grabbed his second when he took advantage of dithering from Liam Moore and David Button to take the ball away from the Brentford goalkeeper - but he could only find the side-netting from a near-impossible angle. The home side were on top with Jonathan Parr narrowly missing the far post with a fierce cross-cum-shot while, at the other end, Ipswich keeper Dean Gerken did well to hold Alex Pritchard's curling effort from the edge of the area. However, Brentford were level when Gerken did brilliantly to parry Stuart Dallas' volley but Douglas was on hand to head home the rebound. Jonathan Douglas lifts a finger to the sky in celebration after levelling the match at Portman Road . Ipswich Town's Balint Bajner (centre) plays the ball out of trouble after being surrounded by Brentford men . An even final 20 minutes of the first half saw the visitors shade the chances, Alan Judge heading over from 10 yards and then Andre Gray's snapshot whistling past the post. Ipswich almost grabbed the lead just before the interval when a great breakaway saw Chaplow's shot well saved by Button, before Judge made a brave sliding block to deny Parr the rebound. The home side should have been ahead less than a minute after the restart when Parr broke into the box and perfectly crossed for Murphy who somehow slid the ball over the bar - and the gaping empty net - from five yards out. Brentford's Liam Moore reacts to a missed chance during the Championship match on Saturday afternoon . Cole Skuse (left) brings the ball forward as Ipswich search for a winner, but they were unable to find one . In a chance reminiscent of Parr's in the first half, Berra could only push a good chance wide of the far post on 54 minutes. Button remained the busier of the two keepers and he had to be alert to dive across his goal to save from Tyrone Mings. Back came Brentford with Pritchard's free-kick well held by Gerken before Murphy missed another gilt-edged chance on 65 minutes when the striker raced clear but was denied by a brilliant save from the onrushing Button. Ipswich continued to create the better chances as the second half progressed, with Murphy's shot at Button lacking power and then sub Chris Wood heading wide under pressure. Eight minutes before the end, Teddy Bishop tricked his way through the defence but his low left foot shot was brilliantly saved by man of the match Button.

"An eventful first day at the Arnold Palmer Invitational saw Rory McIlroy come close to achieving something that hadn’t been witnessed at Bay Hill for 20 years while Ian Poulter cheered up his sick three year old son Joshua with a fine opening round of 67. Poulter’s preparations for his final tournament before the Masters were hardly ideal. While driving home from the course on Wednesday, Joshua was being taken to a nearby hospital with what turned out to be a bout of pneumonia. It was past midnight before he was allowed home. ‘It was certainly something of a blessing that I had a late tee-time,’ said the Englishman, who posted five birdies in a round that left him just a stroke off the pace set by American Morgan Hoffman. Rory McIlroy  waits on the first green during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational  at Bay Hill Club . Ian Poulter hits his tee shot on the 18th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . Poulter’s in good form at present, and having thrown away a golden opportunity to win one event in Florida at the Honda Classic three weeks ago, will be keen to give himself a chance to atone at this venue where he finished third in 2013. ‘It was nice to get Joshua home on Wednesday night and my wife Katie is a trained nurse, so I knew he was in good hands when I left for the course this morning,’ he said. After 15 holes of his opening round, a small slice of history loomed for McIlroy, just three weeks shy of his attempt at a career grand slam at the Masters. The world number one was swinging so smoothly he had hit all 15 greens in regulation. Not once in any round in his PGA Tour career has he hit all 18. No-one had done so at Bay Hill since 1995. Poulter hits an approach shot on the 16th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . McIlroy hits an approach shot on the first hole during the first round at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge . Next up was the easiest hole on the course, the par five 16th. Yet it was here the 25 year old contrived to undo all the good work that had gone before. As soon as his second shot left the club face he started laughing at himself in exasperated fashion. He knew what was coming next. The ball bounced on the bank at the front of the green and back into one of the course’s many water hazards. There ended any hope of hitting all 18 greens in regulation. At least on the positive side, there were obviously plenty of excellent blows in those first 15 holes, and the reason he was only two under par at the time was he couldn’t buy a putt, which wouldn’t have stressed him unduly given the shocking state of the Bay Hill greens. Suffice to say that they’re nearer to municipal course standards than Augusta’s. Poulter hits an approach shot on the 18th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . McIlroy of Northern Ireland talks with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald on the fourth fairway in Orlando, Florida . At least McIlroy finished with a birdie for a 70, which hasn’t left him too far off the pace. ‘There were a lot of good signs out there and with this being my last event before Augusta it’s important to play well in the second round and get myself into contention at the weekend,’ he said. Elsewhere, Padraig Harrington’s welcome revival continued with a 68 which left him alongside such luminaries as world number three Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott and the Scot Martin Laird, a former winner of this event. When McIlroy made his way to the first tee at a shade before 1pm he must have been heartened by the enormous crowd that had gathered. McIlroy of Northern Ireland hits his second shot on the fourth hole during the first round . The entire length of the hole was lined several people deep and McIlroy gave them something to cheer with a couple of opening blows that gave him a good look at a birdie, with the putt coming up just short. The first three holes at Bay Hill represent one of the toughest starts of any course on the PGA tour but McIlroy looked in the mood as he registered three easy pars. A chance was wasted at the par five fourth but he got into red figures with a classy birdie at the signature hole. Poulter of England reacts to a missed putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round in Orlando . McIlroy of Northern Ireland hits his tee shot on the third hole during the  Arnold Palmer Invitational . The par five 6th winds its way around a lake for all of its 500 plus yards but it held no fears for the Northern Irishman as he played a marvellous long iron second to 20ft and two putted for a birdie. Another birdie followed at the short seventh but that was the last putt he holed until he got to the 18th. After that effort from 15ft dropped he disappeared for dinner with the tournament host. He couldn’t keep the smile off his face when someone brought it up. ‘It’s going to be a really special evening,’ he said.

'I don't know if he speaks with his wife Coleen about football, I don't think so. 'But we have the process of talking here. Most of my players of my selection are open and that's very nice. 'Michael Carrick is more or less a trainer-coach. He is also willing to talk about shapes and systems. 'That's nice. Rooney also. 'Not every player is very open and then you have to convince him, and then you get a struggle. 'It works or it doesn't work. Give them time. Also give me time to do it.

"For Michael O’Neill, working under Gordon Strachan in the English top flight was a bittersweet experience. In fact, at Coventry City, the midfielder found the experience of being an inferior player to a manager in his early 40s about as palatable as Strachan’s famed longevity-fuelling concoction of porridge, bananas and seaweed. If O’Neill’s injury-scarred spell at Highfield Road was not the most notable of an otherwise successful career, the Northern Ireland manager retains a high regard for his Scotland counterpart and hopes the pair can soon share success in the international arena. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill has been preparing his side to face Gordon Strachan's Scotland . Strachan's side will be hoping to go into their Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar on the back of a win . Scotland have not qualified for a major tournament since France 98, while Northern Ireland have not been seen at a Finals since the days when Brazil’s Josimar rocketed one of the all-time great World Cup goals past Pat Jennings. But on the road to France 2016, Scotland are third in Group D, while Northern Ireland are second in Group F. As the two nations face off in a friendly at Hampden, O’Neill hopes both men can lead their respective countries out of the international wilderness. ‘I played under Gordon at Coventry — it’s always a concern when the manager is a better player than you,’ quipped the 45-year-old former Dundee United and Hibs midfielder. ‘Other than that it was fine. It was a bit unfortunate that injuries thwarted my opportunity at Coventry but it was evident back then what type of manager Gordon was going to be. ‘He had the ability to motivate and to invigorate. He knew how to get players to respond to him. So it doesn’t surprise me how well he has done with Scotland. He was a great appointment and exactly what Scotland needed at that time. Scotland national team boss Strachan, pictured in 2001, coached O'Neill during his time as Coventry manager . ‘It’s pretty evident the improvement they have made under Gordon. And having played half my career up here, it would be good to see both countries qualify for the Euros. ‘We’ve been nearly 30 years away from a major tournament. Scotland haven’t quite had that to deal with - but I’d love to see both countries do it.’ O’Neill still lives in Edinburgh and remains an avid viewer of the Scottish game, not just because it is home to several Northern Ireland internationals. He believes football in this country is in ruder health than many outsiders – and insiders – perceive amid the often unrelenting negativity that has accompanied the collapse and pained rise of Rangers. ‘I watch Scottish football a lot,’ said O’Neill, who may not risk Aberdeen striker Niall McGinn’s hamstring but could start with two Manchester United centre backs in Jonny Evans and debutant Paddy McNair. ‘There are now potential internationals of the future getting their chance in first-teams in the Premiership and Championship and that can only be good for the Scotland national team. ‘There’s been too much negativity about Scottish football at times, obviously because of what’s gone on at certain clubs. But the game is in a lot healthier state than people give it credit for.’ Manchester United team-mates Jonny Evans and Paddy McNair are expected to start in defence . For Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis, a return to Hampden will bring back fond memories of his last appearance in Mount Florida. Back in March 2011, he scored the opening goal as Rangers beat Celtic 2-1 in extra time to lift the League Cup – the club’s last major trophy before administration then liquidation visited Ibrox and leading players including Davis quit. ‘It will be nice to be back at Hampden,’ said the 30-year-old Southampton midfielder. ‘It holds special memories for me. We had a lot of success there with Rangers but my last game, the League Cup Final, stands out. Celtic were always kind of favourites before we went into any Old Firm game and they had the upper hand before that game. But I scored a goal and we won the cup that day. ‘I was lucky to have four years at Rangers and it was disappointing how it ended. That was the hardest thing to take. But I’ll always look back on it as one of the most important and enjoyable periods in my career. Southampton midfielder Steven Davis, pictured in Janaury 2012, returns to his former stomping ground . ‘It’s a bit of an impossible subject to talk about (leaving) because you’re never going to please everybody with what you say. But the honesty of it is we could only try and make a decision based on what we thoughts was best at the time and you have to live by that.’ As he turns back the clock by returning to Glasgow, however, Davis feels the future is bright now that Ibrox is back in the ownership of ‘Rangers men’ like Dave King and Paul Murray. And the former Rangers captain, who played in the 2008 UEFA Cup Final with the Ibrox side, hopes the hiring of nine-in-a-row idol Stuart McCall can kick-starts a Rangers revival back towards past glories. ‘I think (the boardroom change) is positive for the club. For any fan, it’s nice to see people in charge who have the best interests of the club at heart. ‘We all knew it was going to be a difficult period but nobody could have foreseen just how hard it was going to be. ‘But I think Stuart McCall is going to be a good appointment. It was great to see him get that first win on Sunday at Hibs. Hopefully Rangers can build on that and get even stronger. ‘Would I ever go back to Rangers? In football you never know. But it’s a club I look back on fondly and if the opportunity arose it would be something I’d have to consider.’","Michael O'Neill worked under Gordon Strachan during his time at Coventry .

"Lunch with Jack Nicklaus last Sunday and dinner with Arnold Palmer on Thursday night. Rory McIlroy is certainly mixing with the right company as he finalises his preparations for his tilt at the career Grand Slam at the Masters next month. Not just the greats of this sport, either. While on a two-day trip to Augusta last week, the Northern Irishman hit the gym at 6am — and was joined shortly afterwards by Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning. ‘When they came in it was my cue to walk out,’ said McIlroy, smiling. ‘When you think it’s their off-season, it was quite something to see their dedication. They’re both in their late 30s and it emphasised their determination to prolong their careers.’ Rory McIlroy greets fans while walking to the ninth tee during a pro-am at the Arnold Palmer Invitational . Amazing what a pep trip to Augusta can do for a man — that, and a long weekend practice session with his long-time coach, Michael Bannon. When last seen at the Cadillac Championship at Doral 10 days ago McIlroy cut a dispirited figure as he completed the second of two disappointing tournaments in Florida. Here at Bay Hill, on the eve of his first appearance at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, there was a spring to his stride once more. ‘I certainly feel a lot better about my game than I did at Doral,’ he said. ‘And I think this course sets up well for me. Practising the last two days has left me ruing the fact I haven’t played here in the past.’ McIlroy watches his tee shot on the ninth hole during a pro-am Arnold Palmer Invitational  tournament . The accent was clearly on relaxation rather than reconnaissance when McIlroy took his dad Gerry, a former scratch handicap player himself, up to Augusta last Thursday. ‘I think it gave him an appreciation of what it takes to play the course off the back tees,’ said Rory. ‘He’s always asking me why I did this and that when I come off the course. Now I think he knows what we go through.’ McIlroy was coy when asked about his score, noting merely that he played well on the first day. Which probably means a 64 or 65. This is his last scheduled tournament before the Masters in three weeks and, in the absence of eight-time winner Tiger Woods, the local community is certainly glad he’s here. McIlroy  looks over a shot during the pro-am round prior to the Arnold Palmer Invitational . McIlroy slaps hands with a young fan, while walking between holes in Orlando . McIlroy plays a shot at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge in Orlando during the pro-am . ‘Welcome Rory,’ proclaims a huge sign hanging from a house near the 18th green. ‘It was very nice of them to do that and it summed up the reception I’ve had since I’ve arrived,’ said the 25-year-old. McIlroy begins on Thursday in a belter of a threeball alongside good friend Rickie Fowler and another of Augusta’s highly-fancied players — gifted Australian Jason Day. Also in the field are  world No 3 Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott, and among the British and Irish contingent are Ian Poulter, Graeme McDowell, Paul Casey, Danny Willett and Padraig Harrington. McIlroy has scheduled the Arnold Palmer Invitational as his last event before the Masters in three weeks . As for that talk with the Golden Bear, McIlroy was asking about pin placements on certain greens when Nicklaus said: ‘Never forget, Rory — if you’re in doubt, the middle of the green is never a bad place to be at Augusta.’ For a player who has certainly been guilty of playing too aggressively on occasion in the past that might prove the most sage piece of advice of all.","Rory McIlroy is preparing for tilt at the career Grand Slam at the Masters .

"Massimo Cellino, the former Leeds United president, will not return to the club until the end of the season. The Football League had disqualified him from running the Championship club until April 10 in January. He decided to step away from the club last month in order to clear his name. However, the Football League have now said that they have 'settled the outstanding disciplinary proceedings' against Cellino and the club and he can return from May 3. Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino  will be allowed to return to the club at the end of the season . Cellino was disqualified in January after the the non-disclosure of a tax evasion charge against him in Italy . A league statement read: 'The Football League, Leeds United and Massimo Cellino have settled the outstanding disciplinary proceedings relating to the club's non-disclosure of the Italian Court's judgment regarding Mr Cellino, as required under League regulations. 'The club and Mr Cellino have decided in the interests of the club, its players and supporters not to contest this charge. As a result, Mr Cellino's period of disqualification as a 'relevant person', as defined by the regulations, has now been extended from April 10 until May 3, the day after the conclusion of the 2014/15 league season.

'Mr Cellino's right to challenge the decision of the Professional Conduct Committee under Football Association Rule K is unaffected by this settlement. ' Cellino, who took over Leeds towards the end of last season, has decided to independently appeal his Football League disqualification which was initially due to expire on April 10. Cellino recently sold his personal stake in Eleonora Sport - the company he set up to buy Leeds a year ago - and said he would not be returning to the club while he tries to clear his name, giving rise to speculation he could be about to sell up. The Football  League has announced it has settled 'disciplinary proceedings' with the Italian businessman . Andrew Umbers, who stepped in as chairman when Cellino's ban began, insists Cellino does not want to sell and that there have not been any approaches, despite interest from Hollywood film star Russell Crowe, a long-standing Leeds fan who asked his Twitter followers if taking over the club would be a good idea and got an overwhelmingly positive response. Leeds' fortunes on the pitch have certainly not been affected by the ownership uncertainty with the 2-1 win over Ipswich at Elland Road on Wednesday night their sixth in nine games, a run which has lifted them clear of the relegation zone and into 15th place.","Italian owner was disqualified from running Leeds United until April 10 .

"The SFA’s new performance director, Brian McClair is being paid generously for his expertise. But many would have paid a penny for his thoughts on Tuesday night. The moment he read the quotes of his colleague Ricky Sbragia on young Jack Harper. To the uninitiated, Harper is Scottish football’s new wonderkid. Islam Feruz without the attitude. Mark Wotte – McClair’s predecessor – dubbed the Real Madrid youth player Scotland’s answer to Robin van Persie. Real Madrid youngster Jack Harper in action against Ludogorets in the UEFA Youth League match . Scotland Under-19s manager Ricky Sbragia has left Harper out of his squad for the upcoming games . He did so because, by all accounts, Harper does not fit the typical Scottish mould. He is not quite a No 9, not entirely a No 10. He is a creative type who scores goals under the watchful eye of Real coach Zinedine Zidane. So far this season he has scored three goals for Real in the UEFA Youth League and is midway through a five-year deal signed in 2012. Born in Fuengirola, near Malaga, the 18-year-old is Spanish. And Spain’s Under-19 coach Luis de la Fuente has used his birth certificate to try to recruit him. Marvellously, however, Harper does not want to play for Spain. His parents are from Barrhead. He wants to play for Scotland. Incredibly, Scotland seems less keen on him. Sbragia’s Under-19 squad are currently preparing for UEFA European Championships elite round with games against Austria, Italy and Croatia this week. And Harper, dubbed a ‘luxury’ player, is nowhere to be found. In a throwback to the old school thinking which preceded the SFA’s high-profile 2020 performance strategy, Sbragia explains his absence by saying: ‘Our concentration is on the opening game with Austria and we’ve deliberately got more height in our squad. That’s one of the reasons why Jack isn’t in. Highly rated forward Harper has already been linked with moves to Manchester United and Liverpool . ‘The last time he was with us, he did okay, but I wanted a little more impact. At Real Madrid, he can float all over the place. But with us, he has to be more disciplined. ‘It’s purely tactical and there certainly hasn’t been a lack of enthusiasm from Jack about playing for Scotland.’ There might be now, of course. Most of all when Harper learns that young Oliver McBurnie, an 18-year-old striker who plays for Bradford City is in the squad. Currently McBurnie, six foot two in his stocking soles, is on loan at Chester City – a non-league club in the English Conference Premier. Within the SFA, there is a recognition of how damaging and old-fashioned all this looks. Regarded as a progressive, forward thinking and intelligent coach within the corridors of Hampden, Sbragia’s quotes on Harper hint at something else. For McClair, a cerebral former Manchester United colleague of Sbragia’s, the Harper conundrum represents an early test of his diplomatic skills. Scotland boss Gordon Strachan – no giant himself – washed his hands of the matter on Tuesday, saying: ‘I’m not involved in that at all. I let the other guys get on with it. I’ve no idea if it’s physical or whatever.’ Harper is currently midway through a five-year deal with Real Madrid and is tipped to have a big future . Pointing out that most of the country has never seen Harper play, Strachan added: ‘I’ve seen a few people at Chelsea who never get a game anywhere. They go on loan somewhere and disappear into no man’s land.’ That was the fate of Feruz – the ‘wonderkid’ who turned his back on Scotland and was last heard of having a loan deal at Blackpool cancelled. Before leaving his post last October, Wotte urged Scottish youth football to rid itself of the ‘win at all costs’ mentality and develop skills. An appeal which fell on deaf ears with at least one SFA colleague. ‘We have to match these teams physically,’ said Sbragia of the challenge facing his under-19 side. ‘The more I’m seeing games, the more I see things going back to physicality and the height factor.’ The irony, of course, is that Harper is no midget. He is six foot tall. Taller than Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy, the Glasgow-born Everton stars allowed to slip through the SFA’s fingers and play for the Republic of Ireland instead. The worry is that when the SFA host European Championship games at Hampden in 2020, the nation will finally get the chance to see the prodigious talent of Jack Harper. In the red shirt of Spain.","Jack Harper has been left out of the Scotland Under 19s squad for the upcoming games by manager Ricky Sbragia .

"Writer and broadcaster Archie Macpherson says farewell to Dave Mackay on the day football’s legends joined the Tynecastle faithful in paying their respects to the former Hearts, Tottenham and Derby County superstar. History is suffused with irony. It will be noted by posterity that on a day when jubilation should have been coursing through the veins of every lover of Tynecastle, they were in fact muting the trumpets and draping the halls with black rather than maroon. They came to honour a man who hadn’t lived long enough to savour the triumphant emergence of his beloved club from near destitution. Crowds clap whilst the Hearse carrying the coffin of Dave Mackay leaves Tyncastle Stadium for his funeral . But the claiming of their new divisional title will now be a permanent reminder of the resilience that Dave Mackay bequeathed his club when he strode the turf with a broad-chested imperiousness that was the formidable bridgehead for Hearts’ triumphs in the 1950s. As they laid him to rest on Tuesday you couldn’t help but think that nature had played a cruel trick in ending his life only several weeks before the confirmation of the end of the struggle for credibility and self-esteem that his first club had been engaged in for so long. Mackay must, though, have had an inkling of the course of events which was leading inevitably to that apotheosis. The crowds who thronged the streets as the cortege made its way from Tynecastle itself for a remembrance service at Mansfield Traquair, and who threw their scarves at the procession as if to add sustenance to his last journey, must have believed that even in the later stages of his life he will have been mentally kicking every ball for his former club such was his lasting affection for the Gorgie Road. The hearse carrying Mackay's coffin was complete with flowers and a football to mark his passing . I was a student when I first saw the triumphant Hearts side of 1957-8 which he captained, when they not only won the title but created a British goal-scoring record of 132 scored and only 29 against. I don’t know particularly why but I do instantly recall a game they played against Clyde at the old Shawfield where you could be very close to the pitch and, to this day, I will always associate Mackay with ‘glaur.’ For there he was yomping his way through the mud like a primeval predator whilst, through his prompting, Hearts were playing the kind of slick football that as Glasgow boy I thought was simply the preserve of the Old Firm. And I cannot eliminate the image of his sliding into a tackle that took both Mackay and the Clyde man off the pitch and almost into the dog-track fence which surrounded the playing area. He wasn’t censured because the ball was what he was after and got. Nor was he ever sent off in any game he ever played in from schools football through to the highest senior level, although his reputation for toughness did frankly make some opponents quiver when they saw his name posted on the team-sheet, as Sir Alex Ferguson alluded to, in paying his respects on Tuesday. The cortege leaves Hearts' stadium as the city were given the opportunity to pay their final respects . ‘I was playing for Queens Park reserves against Hearts reserves at Tynecastle and the great Mackay was playing because he was coming back from a broken toe,’ said Sir Alex. ‘ He tackled me and I thought: “Christ!” but in those days you had to get up no matter what. So I got up and had a look at that big, barrel chest of his and he just said: “Are you all right, son?” That was a great memory- the only time I played against Dave Mackay- and I’ll never forget it.’ Nor, when he had gone south to English football, will any of us ever forget the iconic photograph of Mackay lifting Billy Bremner off his feet with a clenched fist, like a boy he had caught picking his pocket. We look at it now with affection. I never saw malice in it. Mackay hated the image, as he thought it showed him as a bully. To me, it was like portraying rough-and-ready fatherly instinct. His game never changed with Spurs when, with the likes of the great ‘White Ghost’ John White and Alan Gilzean, he helped establish a regime at White Hart Lane with a proud Scottish accent which made that ground a fortress and a team feared throughout Europe. In that setting it was no surprise that they won the ‘Double’ in 1960-61, the FA cup in succeeding years and the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1963. They loved his commitment, his ability to help pull his team back from occasional adversity. The order of service for Mackay's funeral . That is why so many notables from the English game travelled to Edinburgh yesterday to pay tribute alongside the Hearts faithful. His Spurs former colleagues were there. Pat Jennings, Terry Medwin, Steve Perryman, Gilzean, Mike England, Clive Allen and Cliff Jones, who told the congregation: ‘Whenever I hear the bagpipes playing *Flower of Scotland* I think of Dave - a proud Scotsman who never forgot his roots.’ Gilzean added: ‘The legacy he leaves is unbelievable for three clubs - Hearts, Tottenham and Derby County. He was a fantastic, inspirational guy. No mountain was too high for Dave to climb.’ Tuesday’s cross-border representation reflected the fact that they recognised him as one of the best-ever Scottish exports to the English game. For some reason we did not see the best of him in a Scottish jersey and he did not talk much about being in the side which was devastated 9-3 by England at Wembley in 1961. Within Sir Alex’s comments, though, there was also an element of regret about Mackay’s record in the sense that he was under-appreciated in certain quarters, pointing to the paucity of caps he earned. ‘Only 22 caps for a player as good as that?’ he lamented. ‘Scotland was picked by a committee with its head in the sand. If Matt Busby had been manager, he’d have 50 odd caps. ‘Everyone talks about his courage and his bravery, but he was a fantastic footballer. He was skilful, he could play anywhere and he proved that. I think we’ve seen the passing of a great legend.’ From the master there can be no more fitting epitaph.","Dave Mackay's funeral was held in Edinburgh on Tuesday .

"For those who witnessed Ireland’s approach to playing Scotland at Celtic Park in November at close quarters, suggestions that they are a robust and direct unit scarcely seem tantamount to slander. Martin O’Neill’s side may not quite have mirrored the ultra-industrial style favoured by Jack Charlton’s men all those years ago, yet there were precious few morsels of real quality for the game’s purists to feast on. Were Poland then, doing any more than stating the blindingly obvious this week when they spoke extensively of Ireland’s one-dimensional, strong-arm strategy in their qualifying games thus far? Aiden McGeady celebrates scoring for Republic of Ireland against Georgia . You wouldn’t have thought so but, then again, Martin O’Neill, whose Ireland side entertain the Poles in Dublin, has never been one to resist an ever-so diplomatic counter-swipe at such accusations. Clearly keen to gain the slightest psychological edge ahead of what is being viewed as a must win game for the Republic, the former Celtic manager bristled when word of the Poles’ comments was relayed to him at their Malahide base on Friday. ‘I’m not really bothered about what they say — genuinely not bothered,’ O’Neill insisted. ‘I’m not so sure they could glean that from the games we have played. It’s not for me to retort but Poland are as physical a side as I have seen in some time.’ Ouch. Adam Nawalka’s side are a pretty accomplished one, too, however. Currently sitting on top of Group D, Ireland will surely need snookers to catch them if they leave the Aviva Stadium with another maximum return of points. Having won in Georgia and pinched a point in Germany, Ireland’s campaign hit the buffers with defeat in Glasgow in their last competitive outing. In a section with next to no margin for error, O’Neill’s side badly need to begin a sequence of four home games from five with a win. In that regard, a degree of calculated risk taking is in order. Aiden McGeady’s downturn in form has seen him excluded from Roberto Martinez’s Everton side since January 31 but – while far from ideal - his international manager sees that as no barrier to inclusion. McGeady’s downturn in form at Everton should not affect his Ireland position . ‘You can get away on a bit of adrenaline if you are reasonably fit and I think he’s been fit for a number of weeks. He just hasn’t played for Everton in that time,’ said O’Neill, who handed the player his Celtic debut 11 years ago. ‘Adrenaline can carry you a certain distance. You wouldn’t want to be going into a game with say three or four players not having played that much football. ‘That may happen but you know that as some stage these players are going to tire a bit. But it is what it is. ‘It’s a disappointment from this side but I’m not in charge of their club commitments. ‘Listen, it would be absolutely fantastic if players were coming in here on the back of having played games the last couple of weekends. ‘You always sense it’s never going to be that way. I was involved as a player at Northern Ireland and we had players coming in who hadn’t played much at club level but suddenly they got a lift from playing international football. ‘That’s what I’d be hoping for.’ If O’Neill is bemused by McGeady’s exclusion at club level, he made a fine job of hiding it. ‘That’s entirely up to Everton,’ he straight-batted. ‘If I was to make that judgment on every single player at club level, I might be listening to the wrong comments. ‘Roberto Martinez is absolutely entitled to pick whoever he wants to at club level. ‘If he doesn’t think that Aiden is playing well enough to be picked for his team, that’s entirely up to him. Republic of Ireland coach Roy Keane shares a joke with McGeady during training session . ‘We’ve a different aspect here. He is obviously very important for us. He’d a great start against Georgia, continued that on although he may have been a little disappointed (in how he played) against Scotland. ‘Overall, he is important to us. I think just the change of environment might just give him that lift. I’m hopeful. ‘He’ll be a bit disappointed that he’s not in the Everton starting side. But he’ s here, he knows what he’s done for us in the recent past and that should give him a lift.’ McGeady might well be facing a familiar figure in the Polish goal. Artur Boruc, also formerly employed in Glasgow’s East End, is being tipped to win his 60th cap here after Wojciech Szczesny’s recent relegation to the Arsenal bench. ‘It’s some years ago but in his spell at Celtic he was one of the top five goalkeepers in European football,’ said O’Neill, who left Parkhead in 2005 just as Boruc was coming in. ‘Of course, there’s some water under the bridge since then and he’s now down at Bournemouth. But he was a fine goalkeeper before and if the manager is thinking of picking him, he must have great faith in him at the moment.’ Self-confidence among the Poles is scarcely at a premium. Still unbeaten in the qualifiers, their only blemish so far came in the 2-2 draw with Scotland in Warsaw. O’Neill knows – from bitter experience in Glasgow – how the entire dynamic of the section can turn in an instant. His warning then, not to gift the likes of Robert Lewandowski a prized victory hardly needs to be overstated. ‘We’re 75 minutes into the game and our concentration faded,’ O’Neill recalled of Shaun Maloney’s winning goal from a set-piece. ‘I know as you get tired in a match your concentration goes a little bit, but that really shouldn’t happen. ‘I think Poland’s approach will be a pretty positive, as suggested by the results they have got. ‘In the game against Germany there were moments in the match where I would say fortune broke for them at the time. ‘But they have earned that and they have put up points on the board. ‘Their second-half performance against Georgia in Georgia was particularly strong. ‘I’m expecting a big, big game. But this is the first match of a run where we have four out of five at home and it is up to us to do something about it.’","Republic of Ireland take on Poland in Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday .

"The German Grand Prix has been dropped from this year's Formula One calendar, motor sport's world governing body the FIA has announced. The race had been in doubt due to questions over which circuit would host the race, which has been shared between Hockenheim and Nurburgring in recent seasons. Home favourite Nico Rosberg won the German Grand Prix for Mercedes last year . Officials from both circuits had voiced concern that time was running out to organise the race, which was scheduled to take place over the weekend of July 17-19. A short FIA statement said no agreement could be reached with Bernie Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder (CRH). 'The German Grand Prix has been withdrawn as the CRH and promoter did not reach agreement,' the statement said. The decision means the 2015 season will be shortened to 19 races, with a three-week break between the British Grand Prix on July 5 and the Hungarian Grand Prix on July 26. Hockenheim and Nurburgring have hosted the German Grand Prix for the past seven years . The German Grand Prix has alternated between Hockenheim and Nurburgring since 2007. However, in January, Ecclestone said this season's race would take place at Hockenheim for a second successive year, only for the venue to be listed as 'To Be Announced' when the calendar was unveiled earlier this year. Georg Seiler, the managing director of the Hockenheim circuit, told German newspaper Bild earlier this week that time had run out to organise the race. According to the report, Hockenheim's concerns included the sale of tickets, which had not yet begun. It also said that crowds had shrunk since the glory days of Michael Schumacher, despite the recent successes of German drivers Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg - who won last year's German Grand Prix driving for Mercedes.","German Grand Prix has alternated between Hockenheim and Nurburgring .

"Fernando Alonso has declared himself 'ready to go' ahead of facing one final hurdle prior to his return to Formula One in Malaysia this weekend. The double world champion missed the opening round of the season in Australia following a crash in his McLaren in the second pre-season test in Barcelona in which he sustained concussion. Alonso has since undergone numerous tests and examinations to ensure he is fit to step back into the cockpit of his car, with a final medical assessment by the FIA due to be conducted on Thursday at the Sepang International Circuit. Fernando Alonso has declared himself fit after recovering from concussion for the Malaysian Grand Prix . Given the heat and high humidity in Malaysia the FIA will also be eager to satisfy itself Alonso will be able to cope with the conditions. The Spaniard is adamant he is fine as he said: 'I've been working hard on my fitness and I feel good and ready to go this weekend. 'The heat in Malaysia is always very tough for the drivers, but I've been focusing on this in my training and I'm definitely prepared for all of the weather conditions we can face in Sepang.'

Aware of the difficulties to come, Alonso added: 'I watched the weekend in Australia very closely and I was in touch with the team from the moment they arrived. After leaving Ferrari to sign with McLaren-Honda, the Spaniard will be hoping to get the all clear to race . 'It's clear we have a lot of work ahead of us, but Jenson's result in Melbourne was encouraging from the point of view of reliability and data collection, which are extremely important. 'The weekend will still be tough, but I'm looking forward to getting into the car for the first time in a grand prix and getting back to racing.

"Cristiano Ronaldo disappeared straight down the tunnel of the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday night while the rest of his team-mates went to the centre-circle to applaud supporters. It followed a strange night for the Real Madrid forward just seven days ahead of the Clasico. He failed to celebrate Gareth Bale’s opening goal because he was too busy lamenting his own misfortune at not scoring. Ronaldo failed to connect properly with a scissor kick from the edge of the area and when the ball was headed off the line Bale volleyed it into the top corner. Incredibly Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air both before and after Bale converted the rebound. Cristiano Ronaldo cannot mask his frustration after striking the post with an early chance to put Real ahead . The World Player of the Year endured a difficult game, with his temper bubbling below the surface . It was a tough night for Ronaldo, who will need to improve in time for next week's Clasico . Gary Lineker tweeted: ‘Ronaldo's extraordinarily stroppy reaction to Bale scoring from a rebound from his effort was bizarre and unhealthy.’ Ronaldo was also frustrated when Bale scored his second goal getting the slightest of touches on a Ronaldo shot but enough to divert it past the Levante goalkeeper to wrap up the three points. He also missed a string of chances the day after he was overtaken by Leo Messi in La Liga’s list of top scorers for this season. Ahead of their meeting at the Nou Camp next week the Argentine has 32 goals – two more than Ronaldo. Ever since Ronaldo collected his third Balon D’or in January and announced to the world that he was ‘coming for’ Messi who has four Golden Ball awards, things have worked in reverse for the planet’s two finest players. Ronaldo nicks the ball past Levante's Ivan Lopez but he didn't stay behind at the end to applaud the fans . This acrobatic Ronaldo volley was headed off the line, before Bale fired in the rebound to make it 1-0 . VIDEO Bale was more motivated - Ancelotti . Messi was 12 goals behind Ronaldo last December but he has not been able to stop scoring since the turn of the year and Real Madrid’s Portuguese striker has dried up. ‘Cristiano was lively because he made the first goal and the second. He didn’t score but he contributed a lot,’ said Carlo Ancelotti after the game. Ronaldo hardly cracked a smile when celebrating with team-mate Dani Carvajal . The frustration was written all over Ronaldo's face as he leaned against the frame of the goal . And he didn't look a happy chappy sitting on the pitch during his side's La Liga victory . The Italian coach said he had no reason not to be positive ahead of next week’s Clasico and admitted: ‘Bale was more motivated than usual and the presence of [Luka] Modric helps him. They know each other very well from playing together at Tottenham.' He will need his talisman Ronaldo back in the right frame of mind before the game however. Last week Ronaldo had to be dragged to the centre-circle by captain Iker Casillas, on Sunday night he ducked out of the post match tradition altogether. At least next week’s league deciding showdown is away from home.","Cristiano Ronaldo refused to applaud supporters after the game .

"Three weeks after the video footage taken on the Paris Metro which shamed Chelsea, an initiative is gathering support among fans to fight back against the racists who still attach themselves to the club. Paris Saint-Germain visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg of a Champions League tie which will be forever tarnished by those Chelsea supporters who refused to let Souleymane S board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station as they sang: 'We’re racist and that’s the way we like it'. Many Chelsea fans are keen to use the return fixture to send a collective message around the world, and have been inspired to produce flags, banners, posters and t-shirts to project the mood. The Paris Saint-Germain squad are put through their paces at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho addresses the media ahead of their return clash against Paris Saint-Germain . There will be posters, banners and flags showcasing Chelsea's stance against racism at Stamford Bridge . There will be posters handed out, printed in both English and French which state: 'No Racism at the Bridge. That’s the way we like it.' There will be t-shirts carrying the slogan 'We Only See Blue' and there will be flag hanging from the Matthew Harding Stand bearing a message: 'Blues Against Racism'. Souleymane has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend the game but it is as if bearing witness to his experience, like something from Apartheid South Africa lurking amid the glitz of the Champions League, flicked a switch in the minds of thousands. Rather than cringe and ignore the ever-diminishing faction of racists who have lingered around Chelsea since the 1980s – and other clubs, it must be said - supporters are getting active at ground-level with campaigns which has the potential to be more powerful than all those well-intentioned messages from the top of society. Souleymane S has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend Wednesday night's Champions League tie . Five of the Chelsea fans involved in the disgraceful incident have been suspended from attending matches . Since the Metro footage went viral, another two incidents of racist abuse involving Chelsea-associated yobs singing on trains have been reported to police and are being investigated. Ben Price, a 37-year-old gardener and Chelsea supporter since the early nineties, set up a Facebook page which he found gathered rapid support at home and abroad. Paul Canoville, the club’s first black player, was quick to back the movement, as was Richard West, aka Mr C, the DJ and former frontman for the Shamen, who is a Chelsea fan. Price was responsible for the 'No Racism at the Bridge' posters on show during the Burnley game, last month, and will be outside the Shed End, handing out more before the game against PSG. 'It’s a message that says that collectively we do not tolerate racism and we cannot be branded a racist club,' said Price. 'It’s a message for Souleymane S and for other clubs and their fans and for football’s authorities like UEFA and FIFA and hopefully we can send it around the world, because the eyes of the world will be on us.'","Chelsea fans are fighting back against racists who are attached to the club .

"Wayne Rooney captained Manchester United to a 3-0 victory against Tottenham at Old Trafford on Sunday hours after footage emerged appearing to show him being knocked out cold by his former team-mate Phil Bardsley in a sparring session in his kitchen. Here we assess Rooney's performance in the showdown that took place on the pitch. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney re-enacted a video of him boxing a former team-mate . Ashley Young laughs as Rooney falls backwards as part of his humorous boxing celebration at Old Trafford . Ashley Young and Marouane Fellaini arrive on the scene to celebrate with the United captain . DID HE PACK A PUNCH? Rooney was having a relatively quiet game until the 34th minute, when he seized upon a misplaced Nabil Bentaleb pass, burst through a clutch of Tottenham players and slotted past Hugo Lloris - before celebrating by recreating the video, throwing a flurry of air punches boxer-style and then falling backwards to hit the deck. Having brought the crowd to their feet in that moment, he showed less potency thereafter in his centre-forward role, sending a few efforts off-target, at least one of which he probably should have done better with. Rooney waves to the crowd; his goal put Manchester United 3-0 up against Tottenham in the first-half . COMBINATIONS . Very early on, his link-up play was not coming off, a notable example being when he failed to pick out Juan Mata with an attempted cut-back in the box. He was also not involved in either of the first two goals - but his influence soon grew as he produced several nice touches to help build attacks, as well as getting on the scoresheet himself. LASTING THE DISTANCE . Went the full 90 minutes, and while not exactly a constant threat during that time, he caused plenty of problems for Tottenham in what was a commendable display overall. KNOCK-OUT MOMENT . Undoubtedly delivered one with the goal and celebration, nicely showcasing his strength, technique and willingness to poke fun at himself all in the space of a few seconds. Rooney slots the ball past Hugo Lloris to put Manchester United 3-0 up against Tottenham on Sunday .","A video emerged of Wayne Rooney which appears to show him being knocked out by former team-mate Phil Bardsley .

But there is a fear that the growing swell of opinion opposed to Poyet's regime from fans will have an adverse impact on matters on the pitch.

"Brendan Rodgers believes Liverpool will need another 23 points to reach the Champions League as he insisted sentiment will have no bearing on when he recalls Steven Gerrard. Liverpool’s influential captain is fit again after recovering from a hamstring problem he sustained on February 10 but there is no guarantee that Rodgers will put him straight back into the starting line-up, as would have been the case during the majority of his career at Anfield. During Gerrard’s absence, Liverpool won three consecutive Barclays Premier League games against Southampton, Manchester City and Burnley but Rodgers feels that sequence is going to have to continue in what will be a pivotal week for the club, with tonight’s trip to Swansea followed by next Sunday’s showdown with Manchester United. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) says his team will need 23 points out of their last 30 available . Rodgers shares a laugh with Ivory Coast defender Kolo Toure (left) during the session . Martin Skrtel works on his fitness and conditioning with Liverpool coach Ryland Morgans (left) Liverpool pair Lazar Markovic (left) and Dejan Lovren strike a pose during the training esssion . Gerrard wants to help Liverpool finish in the top four and win the FA Cup before he joins LA Galaxy and while Rodgers is adamant the 34-year-old will have a say on how the campaign maps out, he won’t pick him on reputation alone. ‘We have 30 points to play for, so I am guessing it will be another 23 points,’ said Rodgers. ‘That is how competitive it has been this year. 'We have won nine out of 11 in January and February, it has been a great run but now we have to be focused on these last 10 matches. Everything counts. 'We have to be aggressive in our game and now we have to nail it in the last 10. I know the players are focused on that. ‘Everyone is waiting to see if Stevie comes into the team or not, but it was the same with Daniel. Does he or does he not? What you have seen over my time here is that I rely on the team. 'The team, of course, has to have good players in it, but ultimately it is about the team and what is going to benefit and how we can get results as a team. 'I will repeat again the most important thing is Steven is back fit and we have Lucas Leiva coming back too. ‘That will add to the competition for places and with one game a week, barring the Cup game, then everyone is going to be fighting and being competitive about playing. ‘The beauty of this season is that everyone has had an opportunity in the first three or four months of the season and then we have found a way to win. It is something everyone has to respect. It is about the team and the spirit of the team and I will always pick the best team I feel to win a game.’ Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is back in contention for the trip to Swansea after an injury layoff .

What I do know is that Stevie always puts the team first.’ Raheem Sterling’s future, meanwhile, continues to create background noise but Rodgers maintains the decision to put contract talks on hold until the end of the campaign has nothing to do with finance. ‘I still think he has a lot of development to go and this is the best place for him,’ said Rodgers. ‘It is pretty obvious that this is a great place for him to be and he has said that himself.’ Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana (left) vies for possession with left back Jose Enrique .

"A young man who is torn between  the rough streets of his hometown and a bright future as a basketball star is poised to make a splash in March Madness after keeping his brother away from violence. Isaiah Williams, a 22-year-old forward and junior at Iona College, says he has lost 24 of his friends and loved ones to violence in a section of Newark, New Jersey, called The Jungle. Teammates say that the star 6'7'' player has gone through periods of crying regularly at practice after losing some of his best friends to shootings related to drugs and gangs, but works harder than anyone. Isaiah Williams, (left) 22, grew up in a section of Newark known for gang crime and has grieved for 24 friends that died due to gun violence . Though his team stands on the brink of the national spotlight, Williams has never been fully free of the forces pulling him back to the troublesome past where his loved ones still live. After the death of friend Rahmel Johnson, 20, in 2013, the basketball star left his college life without telling his coaches and went back home to intervene with his brother Kevin, a year younger. Newark's Oscar Miles Village is controlled by the Crips gang and surrounded by rivals, and Williams felt he had to pull his brother, who was with Johnson right before his targeted shooting, out of a dangerous life, according to NJ.com. The guard, who has Family First tattooed on his chest, returned when Kevin vowed to stay off the streets. This season Williams helped lead Iona to first place in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and his brother Kevin attends his games. His life at college is a far cry from his time growing up, where he was immersed in violence that saw him shot at three times. Gunmen sprayed shots at him near his neighborhood rec center, after a fight and riding in a car through a rival neighborhood. The basketball star gives a litany of his friends who have been killed in similar incidents: P-Roc, Smoove,  Goldie, Capo, T Ram, Hot Dog and many others. Though the star forward dropped everything and went to intervene in his brother's life last season, the 6'7'' player has led Iona College to first place in their conference this year . Oscar Miles Village in Newark is controlled by the Crips gang, and rivalries with surrounding gangs lead to a high homicide rate. There were 111 homicides in Newark in 2013. While others were never had a chance leave, Williams found his escape in basketball. 'My friends wanted me to join them. At one time I did, but when I got a little older I said, 'I have to go shoot baskets.' It was my therapy. It took my mind off everything that was around me,' he told the Bradenton Herald. Mr Williams attended seven high schools and colleges before arriving at Iona, and was named Suncoast Conference Player of The Year at State College of Florida Bradenton before transferring to a Division I school closer to home. Iona's location New Rochelle, New York, means he help his loved ones such as Kevin, and his girlfriend Ille and family have been able to watch him thrive despite an injury this season. He now shoots more than 50 per cent from the floor and averages more than 13 points per game while majoring in criminal justice. Williams attended a number of high school and colleges before being accepted to play at Iona College, roughly 30 miles from where he grew up in Newark . Recovering from hardship and improving himself have always been part of his mindset. 'He would beg me to try to get me into the gym with him. I would have to open the gym for him late at night and early in the morning,' his coach in Florida and current assistant coach Brock Erickson told One-Bid Wonders. The Iona Gaels play Siena College on Saturday, with a shot at the NCAA tournament if they advance and can claim their conference championship. Beyond hoping to make an impact at this year's college basketball postseason, Mr Williams hopes that he can make it even further. He has hopes to play in the NBA or Europe. 'I'm going to try to go as hard as I can and if possible make the NBA,' he said. 'That's what I want to do. If I don't get drafted, okay. I'm just going to keep going, and one day hopefully I'll be there.' Williams (back, jumping) hopes to play in the NBA or in Europe and provide help for his family in New Jersey .","Isaiah Williams, 22, grew up in Oscar Miles Village in Newark, NJ .

"On Tuesday night Cristiano Ronaldo broke the record for most goals in European competitions and   Oleksandr Kucher wrote his own name into the history books the following day. Not that it was cause for celebration as the Shakhtar Donetsk defender was hit with the fastest red card ever in the Champions League. Kucher was given his marching orders after just two minutes and 39 seconds when he brought down Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze in the penalty area, conceding a penalty and handing Shakhtar a mountain to climb. Oleksandr Kucher was sent off in the third minute for Shakhtar Donetsk against Bayern Munich . The defender slid in on Bayern midfielder Mario Gotze as he burst into the penalty area . There was minimal contact but Gotze hit the floor as he raced through on goal . Scottish referee Wille Collum deemed it a clear goalscoring opportunity and brandished the red card . The contact was minimal as the 32-year-old clumsily lunged toward the World Cup winning midfielder and Scottish referee Willie Collum reached for his top pocket. The tie, delicately poised after a 0-0 draw in Ukraine three weeks ago, was effectively over for Shakhtar after Thomas Muller scored with the resulting penalty. Bayern ran riot at the Allianz Arena as Jerome Boateng added a second for the German champions in the first half before Franck Ribery, Muller, Holger Badstuber, Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze completed a 7-0 rout on the night and on aggregate.","Bayern Munich beat Shakhtar Donetsk 7-0 at the Allianz Arena .

"After a career spent going head-to-head in the Champions League, Barcelona captain Xavi Hernandez and former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard are about to become team-mates, with the Spain international finalising negotiations on a move to New York City. The 35-year-old midfielder, who has played more games than any player in Barca’s history and won every honour possible, will join Manchester City’s MLS franchise at the end of this season ready to start playing for them in 2016. Xavi (centre) celebrates after collecting the second of his three Champions League medals in 2009 . The veteran midfielder (left) has only been a bit-part player under Luis Enrique this season at Barca . Spanish radio station Cadena SER reported on Wednesday that the player, his father Joaquín and his agent Ivan Corretja met with a representative from the club at the L'Arrosseria Xàtiva restaurant in Barcelona just a stone’s throw from the Nou Camp to negotiate his move to the US. Xavi looked set to leave Barcelona last summer but decided to stay for one more season after a conversation with coach Luis Enrique. Despite that commitment he has played only a small role this campaign and played no part in Barcelona’s 2-1 victory over Manchester City last week. His departure from Barcelona will mark the end of an era. He joined the club as an 11-year-old and went on to make more than 700 appearances. He has won seven La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues. Xavi's former Barcelona team-mate David Villa (above) is already at New York City . Ex-England midfielder Frank Lampard is unveiled at the new MLS franchise in July 2014 . It was Pep Guardiola who famously said of the young midfielder he saw coming through Barcelona’s youth system: ‘This player will retire me’. He ended up playing alongside him briefly before leaving the club and returning to build a team around the Spain star who also played 133 times for his country. Xavi's signing for New York City is a major coup and will also reunite him with former Spain and Barcelona team-mate David Villa, who will be expected to thrive on the service offered him by Xavi, and Lampard who also joins the MLS new boys after winning 11 major trophies at Chelsea in a 13-year period.","Xavi's Barcelona contract expires in the summer .

The last time they came close to reaching a final was 2005 when Manuel Pellegrini was in charge. They lost 1-0 to Arsenal in their Champions League semi-final first leg and won a last-gasp penalty in the second game only for Jens Lehman to save Juan Roman Riquelme’s spot-kick and prevent the game going into extra time. They reached the Europa League semi-final in 2010 but were beaten 5-1 in the first leg, with Radamel Falcao scoring four and making the second game an irrelevance. Suarez scored again at Granada on Saturday but Barca may not risk him being suspended for the cup final . Pedro could come into the side to face Villarreal instead of Suarez as Barcelona bid for a 38th Spanish final . A 2-0 win would see them go through on Wednesday but Barcelona have not failed to score in a Cup game since the 2010-11 Copa del Rey final against Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid. Since then they have scored in 33 cup games. Villarreal will probably need to score three. They are at least buoyed by drawing with Real Madrid at the weekend. ‘You don’t win these games playing with your heart, you win them by being smart,’ said Villarreal coach Marcelino on Tuesday. He has La Liga’s hottest young striker at his disposal in the shape of Luciano Vietto, who has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season and weighed in with 13 assists. His agent Jorge Cyerszpiler – who was Diego Maradona’s first agent – was talking up his client's fondness for Real Madrid in the lead up to this game. Barca must beware Villareal's Luciano Vietto (centre), who is the hottest young striker in La Liga . Vietto tucks away a goal against Salzburg in the Europa League last week, and has 18 to his name this term . Diego Simeone is a massive fan and wants the player at Atletico Madrid next season, while Liverpool lead a clutch of Premier League clubs who are keeping a close eye on the latest South American talent discovered by Villarreal. They are determined not to let their player leave for anything less than €30m and they want to see the 21-year-old help them to their first ever final before they even consider his possible departure.","Barcelona are weighing up whether to rest Luis Suarez against Villarreal .

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 30th league goal of the season but couldn’t prevent Real Madrid dropping two points in a 1-1 draw with Villarreal. He is now only one goal from his tally for last season with 12 games left and has become the first striker to score 30 goals a season for the fifth consecutive campaign in one of Europe’s top leagues but he left the pitch annoyed at Real’s failure to pull away from Barcelona at the top of La Liga. They are now just two points clear of their rivals with a trip to the Camp Nou later this month still to come. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates with Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema after putting Real Madrid 1-0 up from the penalty spot . Ronaldo, who won the penalty himself, looked to have put the hosts in control when he sent Sergio Asenjo the wrong way from the spot . Gerard Moreno celebrates after scoring the equaliser that Villarreal's quality and endeavour deserved, and his side held on for a point . Dani Carvajal makes a stunning goal-line block with his head, diving behind Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas to keep the score at 0-0 . Real Madrid: Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo, Bale, Kroos, Silva (Jese 72 mins), Isco (Illarramendi 78), Benzema *(Hernandez 81), Ronaldo . Subs not used: Navas, Coentrao, Nacho, Arbeloa. Booked: Carvajal, Pepe . Goal: Ronaldo (pen) Villarreal: Asenjo, Mario, Bailly, Dorado, Costa, Pina (Trigueros 61), Sergio Marcos, Moi Gomez, Campbell, Gerard, Giovani (Vietto 62). Subs not used: Juan Carlos, Musacchio, Víctor Ruíz, dos Santos,  Uche . Booked: Bailly, Moi Gomez, Asenjo, Trigueros, Costa . Goal: Gerard . Joel Campbell was in the starting line-up for Villarreal after coach Marcelino made wholesale changes just three days ahead of his team’s second leg cup semi-final against Barcelona. The Arsenal loanee was bundled over by Pepe in one of Villarreal’s first attacks and from the free-kick the visitors won a corner which led to their first clear cut chance. It fell to Gerard Moreno but with only Iker Casillas to beat he shot straight at Spain keeper. When the rebound ran to Moi Gomez his effort was dived-headed to safety by Dani Carvajal. The keeper congratulated the full-back – both had saved certain goals. Bale was seeing plenty of the ball down the Madrid right although he was at times handicapped by his preference for crossing with his left. He should have been awarded a penalty when Jaume Costa grabbed his arm at a corner and stopped him taking off to connect with Kroos’ kick. It was a spot-kick but the referee waved away the Welshman’s appeal. From another Kroos corner on the half hour Bale this time jumped unimpeded and headed just wide. Varane came even closer shaving the post from another corner kick as Real pushed for the opening goal. As the half went on Real took more and more risks with Marcelo flying forward and throwing himself at an Isco pass but failing to connect effectively. Bale then hit the top of Sergio Asenjo’s bar with a cross-shot from the right and Ronaldo blasted a free-kick over from 35-yards. Ronaldo fights for the ball with Sergio Marcos as Real found Villarreal difficult to break down at the Bernabeu on Sunday night . Benzema gets up above Villarreal defensive pair Chechu Dorado and Ericn Bailly but he couldn't direct his header past Asenjo . Ronaldo apologies to Marcelo after failing to play the Brazilian in when well-placed during a frustrating night for the European champions . Villarreal had defended well and for the first time in the league since August Real Madrid went down the tunnel at half-time with the score at 0-0. The Bernabeu crowd had not helped with the usual nervous whistles for Bale when one of his passes went astray. He had shown more than most for the home side and in the second half his pass to Ronaldo brought about the opening goal. As the ball was played in Eric Bailey tried to take the Portuguese for a dance grabbing him around the waist and and spinning him around. The referee pointed to the spot and Ronaldo stepped up to score goal number 30 in the league this season. He could have got his second moments later from another Bale assist but this time Asenjo blocked the effort and took an accidental Ronaldo knee to his face in the process. Ronaldo then returned the favour to Bale but the he pulled his shot high and wide. Real Madrid now looked in complete control having broken Villarreal’s dogged resistance but they were in for a shock. With a sweeping eight-pass move from one end of the pitch to the other Villarreal went from keeper Asenjo to striker Moreno who leveled the scores. He played a one-two on the edge of the Real Madrid area with substitute Luciano Vietto and shot past Iker Casillas to silence the Bernabeu. Tomas Pina keeps a close eye on the World Player of the Year, who was not at his best against the Yellow Submarine . Ronaldo probes at the Villarreal defence, but he and his expensively assembled team-mates struggled to find a way through . Gareth Bale failed to have much of an impact, with the exception of one cross which looped up onto the crossbar late in the first half . Toni Kroos expresses his frustration as Real Madrid missed the chance to extend their lead over Barcelona to four points . Real Madrid were almost back in front from their next attack but when Ronaldo ran on to Isco’s pass and shot goalwards Asenjo blocked the effort. Bale then crossed from the right and Ronaldo rose highest in the area but against Asenjo made the save brilliantly tipping the ball over his bar. Carlo Ancelotti risked the wrath of the Bernabeu by taking off fans favourite Isco to put on Asier Illaramendi and he even threw on Javier Hernandez for Karim Benzema but Chicharito failed to make a difference going down dramatically in the area but not convincing the referee to point to the spot. Vietto fell over when clean through with only Casillas to beat and he then saw the Spain keeper brilliantly turn away his diving header. For Real Jese shot wide with the goal gaping after Asenjo dropped the ball but a point was the very least Villarreal deserved. Juame Costa goes to ground in an attempt to stop Gareth Bale getting past him, but the Welshman got the better of the defender . Bale gets up above three defenders, but for all their chances Real were unable to find a crucial winning goal .","Gareth Bale hits the cross bar as Real Madrid fail to break their opponents down in difficult first half .

"Manuel Pellegrini says he wants to extend his contract at Manchester City despite uncertainty over his future with the Premier League champions and speculation linking him with a move to Napoli at the end of the season. City look set to surrender their title to Chelsea and more pressure will be heaped on Pellegrini if they go out of the Champions League by failing to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola, Diego Simeone and Carlo Ancelotti have been touted as potential successors, and Pellegrini’s agent Jesus Martinez has responded by suggesting that the 61-year-old Chilean might be interested in taking over from Rafael Benitez at Napoli. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini wants to extend his contract at the club . Pep Guardiola (left), Diego Simeone (centre) and Carlo Ancelotti have all been touted as potential successors . But the City boss insists that he will see out his three-year contract that expires in 15 months’ time and would like to stay even longer. ‘My future is very easy,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I have contract here until June 2016 and I will stay here. If I can extend it I will. When I sign a contract I always try to finish it. ‘If you’re not happy then maybe you try and finish your contract before but I’m very happy here.’ Asked about the prospect of finishing the season empty-handed, Pellegrini added: ‘The analysis of me is not just about one title, but you never know what can happen in the future.’ Pellegrini insisted that the spirit in the City dressing-room remains strong despite reports of a half-time bust-up between captain Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho during the defeat to Liverpool earlier this month. Vincent Kompany reportedly had a half-time bust up with team-mate Fernandinho earlier this month . Fernandinho and Kompany reportedly had a disagreement during the defeat at Liverpool in the Premier League . Captain Kompany was dropped to the bench for Manchester City's victory over Leicester Cty . Kompany was dropped to the bench for last week’s win at home to Leicester and Fernandinho was left out altogether, but Pellegrini confirmed that his skipper is in the squad for Saturday’s trip to Burnley. ‘There isn’t any problem in the dressing-room,’ he said. ‘That happened a lot of days ago. It is normal that in one game that they can a discussion between two players but it was not important for the team. Inside the dressing-room, we don’t have any problems. ‘There was a normal scene, nothing important. I don’t talk about things that were not important and things that happened 20 days ago. If it happened yesterday, maybe I can tell you some things. But 20 days ago, it doesn’t matter. The squad is absolutely together.’","Manuel Pellegrini hoping to extend his Manchester City contract .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has gone almost a year without scoring a free-kick in La Liga despite being Real Madrid’s designated taker, and supporters are now asking if the ball shouldn’t be taken off the Portuguese and given to Gareth Bale. The 30-year-old last hit the back of the net from a set-piece in the Spanish league on March 26 last year against Sevilla. His last goal from a free-kick in any competition came in the Champions League last April against Bayern Munich. He has now failed to score a single goal with any of his last 51 free-kicks. Cristiano Ronaldo has gone almost a year without scoring a free-kick in La Liga . Ronaldo deploys his trademark technique as he attempts a free-kick against Villarreal last Sunday . Ronaldo and team-mate Gareth Bale (left) line up a free-kick against Getafe in January . In any straw poll of best set-piece deliverers Ronaldo would be top of many people’s lists but the statistics tell a completely different story, and while his figures are poor Bale’s are far more impressive. Ronaldo has sent 21 of his efforts straight into the wall and placed 14 high or wide of the target; while keepers or posts and crossbars have done for the rest. Gareth Bale has only scored once this season but it is Real’s only goal scored from a free-kick. And although Bale insisted recently on Spanish radio that he tends to take the kicks that favour a left-footer and Ronaldo those that favour a right foot, more often than not it is the Portuguese who takes precedence. When Bale scored from a free-kick against Espanyol in January the strike-rates of Europe’s set-piece specialists were published by Spanish football statistician Mister Chip and they made tough reading for Ronaldo. Ronaldo's last goal from a free-kick came in last season's Champions League against AC Milan in April . Bale fires a free-kick over the Atletico Madrid wall during a La Liga clash at the Bernabeu . Midfielder Toni Kroos could also take over free-kick duties for Real Madrid from Ronaldo . Bale scores a free-kick every 9.5 attempts while Ronaldo's ratio is one every 15.6 attempts. Bale also came out ahead of Andrea Pirlo who scores one every 10.5 attempts and Leo Messi who scores every 14 times he takes a free-kick. Madrid have various options from a dead ball with Toni Kroos and Isco both ready to step in. They also have James Rodriguez and Sergio Ramos on their way back from injury to put more pressure on Ronaldo, and with Martin Odegaard being tipped to play some part in Real’s Champions League second leg with Schalke on Tuesday there is even a 16-year-old pretender to the crown.","Cristiano Ronaldo gone nearly a year without scoring a free-kick in La Liga .

"It was staggering that Louis van Gaal did not turn to Radamel Falcao as Manchester United were trailing 2-1 against Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final. The poor lad must be thinking: What am I doing here? I know he is not the player United thought they were getting, but isn’t it down to the manager to get the best out of him? Radamel Falcao (second right) was an unused substitute during Manchester United's defeat to Arsenal . Michael Carrick (right) was brought on at half-time but Colombia forward Falcao was left unused . Goalscorers change games but instead they chased the match with Daley Blind and Michael Carrick, two sitting midfielders, on the pitch. Surely it would have been better to show greater intent by throwing on Falcao?

"Brandon Marshall is to be traded for the third time in his NFL career and will join the New York Jets after three years with the Chicago Bears. The prodigiously talented wide receiver turns 31 this month, but the move had been widely touted. Deemed an outspoken maverick by many at Soldier Field, he raised eyebrows with a post-game locker room rant after defeat to the Miami Dolphins in October. His appearances as an analyst on 'Inside the NFL' weekly were also said to be a distraction. Brandon Marshall will head to New York on Tuesday for a medical ahead of his move to the Jets . The mercurial Marshall is yet to play in the play-offs . New head coach John Fox and offensive co-ordinator Adam Gase appeared lukewarm about Marshall at best. 'We’re trying to evaluate where everybody fits and how we best use them and, again, trying to put the best football team on the field. He’s part of that process,' Fox told the Chicago Tribune last month. Marshall was close to Jay Cutler - following him to Chicago from Denver via Miami - but raw quarterback Geno Smith could test his short fuse. ESPN broke news of the trade, which will also see the Jets give the Bears a fifth round draft pick. Marshall signed a four-year deal in Chicago last May, and had seven consecutive 1,000 yard seasons before falling short last year - largely due to missing the final three games with a shoulder complaint. Despite the numbers, Marshall is yet to appear in a play-off game. Perhaps that will change in New York. New head coach Todd Bowles was with Marshall during his two-year stint in Miami and will have been influential in the trade. The move will likely mean the end of Percy Harvin's short stint with the Gang Green, with Marshall to pair up with Eric Decker. Marshall was drafted in the fourth round of the 2006 draft by the Broncos and is a mental health spokesman, spreading awareness of his battle with Borderline Personality Disorder.","Marshall turns 31 this month and joins his fourth NFL franchise .

"The Aussie cricket team are set to split a price pool of $5 million if they are to win the final against New Zealand tonight. This will see the 15 man squad awarded with $340,000 each, regardless of how many games they played in the six week stint. The AFR Weekend has reported that even George Bailey who only played one match against England in the tournament will receive the same amount as each other player. The Australian side are set to take home $340,000 each if they are triumphant in tonight's game against NZ . The winners divide the pool up evenly, regardless of how many games each participated in . Other occasional players such as Xavier Doherty, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Marsh will also be presented with the same cut. The runner up pool is not too bad either with each player receiving $150,000 if they were to succumb to the New Zealand team. This is on top of the player's contract payments, IPL contracts and individual endorsement deals. Other teams tend to divvy up the winnings in a different fashion. If New Zealand were to win their prize money would be divided up by who participated in the most games . The Australian squad have 13 players in the top 50 sports earners in Australia, according to BRW . Australian cricketer Mitchell Johnston (2nd right) earned $4.1 million last year and is consequently one of Australia's top sports earners . New Zealand sees players who did not participate in all the games take home less of the prize pool than the players who did. The Sydney Morning Herald have reported that these winnings may not make too much of a difference to the Australian squad members due to their ridiculously high earnings. BRW recently released the Top 50 sports earners in Australia with 13 Australian cricketers making the cut. Shane Watson led the pack with an earning of $4.5 million last year, closely followed by Mitchell Johnston ($4.1 million) and Test captain Michael Clarke ($4 million).","Each cricketer on the Aussie side will win $340,000 if triumphant tonight .

Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets was carried off on a stretcher against Villarreal on Wednesday night and the club face a nervous wait to see if the injury will rule him out of the second-leg Champions League game with Manchester City in two weeks time.
