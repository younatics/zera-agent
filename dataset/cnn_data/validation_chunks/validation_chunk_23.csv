"Caretaker boss Kenny McDowall fears Rangers could be run out of the play-offs entirely – after they threw away a late lead against Queen of the South to draw 1-1. On a night when John Greig, Walter Smith and John Brown returned to sit in the main stand alongside the new board - following the suspension of their predecessors earlier in the day - the team couldn’t match the renewed sense of optimism around Ibrox. Dropping another two points not only means Hearts can win the Championship title before the month is out, it also keeps Rangers in third place behind Hibs - with last night’s visitors only six points adrift. Kenny McDowall issues instructions to his layers during the 1-1 draw with Queen of the South . McDowall says his side must be wary of Queen of the South in fourth and Falkirk in fifth . Asked if he thought that either the Dumfries side or Falkirk could pip his team to the final play-off spot, McDowall said: ‘There is every chance. They are playing for the play-offs as much as we are. So we can’t be disrespectful of them. ‘Queen of the South are a good side, as are Falkirk. They are looking to win games like we’re looking to win games. We’ve got to work harder to turn it about. ‘I think it’s going to go right to the wire, the play-off places, without a shadow of a doubt. We have to find a formula to get winning again, We are stuttering along. ‘We’re not doing enough in front of goal and obviously not doing well enough to defend our goal. It’s nothing other than hard work until we get back to winning games.’ McDowall, who has won only three of his 10 games in charge since stepping in for Ally McCoist, said he hadn’t yet been told if the new board had accepted the resignation he handed to the previous regime. Rangers midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, celebrates putting the home side ahead at Ibrox . Young Queen of the South striker Aidan Smith (centre) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller . ‘No - I would expect them to come to me, as opposed me going to them,’ he said. ‘I’ve got games to concentrate on with the team, I’m here to do that. I’m sure if the board want to keep me they’ll come and speak to me.’ A cool Haris Vuckic finish following a goalmouth scramble with 13 minutes remaining should have been enough to give Rangers an ill-deserved three points from a bitty performance. But Queens equalised three minutes from time, 17-year-old sub Aidan Smith on the spot – and granted plenty of time - to bury the rebound from a Michael Paton shot following a defensive mistake by home sub Bilel Moshni. The home team left the field to a smattering of boos from the second biggest Ibrox crowd of the season. McDowall said: ‘It’s very disappointing, when supporters had come out, the new board is in place and the stadium is full. You get the lead and you are hoping to see it out – and don’t do it through poor, poor defending.’ Rangers legend John Greig was in the stands at Ibrox for Tuesday night's Scottish Championship clash . Vuckic celebrates hos goal with substitute Bilel Mohsni (left), Nicky Clark and Darren McGregor . Queens moved a point clear in the fourth and final play-off spot, although boss James Fowler believed his team could have won, declaring: ‘It would have been a travesty had we not got anything out of it. We were the better team and had the better chances. ‘But the boys reacted well after going behind and we are delighted young Aidan got the goal. ‘Rangers came out fast but we then controlled the game and some of our passing was excellent. We are happy with the point but, being greedy, I’d have liked the three. It’s still going to be difficult to make the play-offs. There are a few clubs in there but we will keep going.’ Goalscorer Smith, making just his second appearance for the club, said: ‘It’s the best feeling ever. The ball just fell at my feet and I managed to lift it over the keeper. I actually thought Michael Paton was going to score before I did. My dad was in the crowd tonight but I haven’t yet had a chance to speak to him. My mum was due to be here but she cancelled and she’ll be gutted about that now!’","Rangers drew 1-1 with Queen of the South on Tuesday night .

"Leicester striker Andrej Kramaric has criticised the standard of Premier League refereeing following Leicester's 2-0 midweek defeat at Manchester City. Goals from David Silva and James Milner gave the hosts victory, in a match that contained several talking bouts. Nigel Pearson's side felt they should have been awarded two penalties during the match when Kramaric and team-mate Jeffrey Schlupp both fell under challenges during the clash at the Stadium. Leicester striker Andrej Kramaric is unsatisfied with the standard of Premier League refereeing against them . And Kramaric believes Wednesday night's match isn't the first time that Foxes have had the rub of the green go against them. 'We should have been awarded two penalties against Man City, one on me and one on [Jeffrey] Schlupp,' the 23-year-old told Goal in an exclusive. 'I admit, my contact with [Joe] Hart was not a penalty, but when Fernando fouled me, it was clearly inside the box. I have to admit: I am not satisfied [with] how referees treat Leicester.' Leicester were denied a penalty when Jeffrey Schlupp (left) fell under the challenge of Wilfried Bony . The Croatia international has scored twice in eight appearances for Leicester since joining the club in January from Rijeka. Despite their struggles as a team domestically, Kramaric feels he has adapted well to the demands of the Premier League - and in particular England's top-flight defender. 'I have played against many top Premier League defenders so far and I can handle every one, no one is impossible,' he added. 'I need just a little more time to get used to everything here.'

He said: 'They are a very talented squad and there's always going to be scrutiny. People have told me they are in a bit of a sticky spell, a sticky spell for them isn't one for us. 'Success is relative, they have two players to each position and have quality there, whatever side they put up against you will have quality.

The manager has been pleased with their level of performance though and they almost snatched a win at Everton last time out before conceding a late Matt Upson own goal to draw 2-2.

'As the season wears on the pressure builds, you can't get away from that. My job is to keep the players freed up in their minds so they can go and play. I do believe there is a lot of belief in the dressing room that we can turn the situation around. 'As I have already pointed out the players playing as well as they can is the acid test, my job as manager is to allow them to do that. 'We have belief in ourselves and time will tell. There aren't any easy games but we have to show we have plenty of character and quite a bit of ability, what we have to do is transfer it into points.'","Leicester are four points adrift at the bottom of the Premier League .

"Following this week's results in the Premier League it is looking increasingly likely that all three teams promoted last summer will be heading straight back down to the Championship. Leicester, Burnley and QPR find occupy the bottom three places in the top flight with just 10 games to play and although there are other teams in sight, form is a big concern for all three. If the trio are all relegated it will be the first time that no promoted team has survived in 17 years, and only the second season none have stayed up in since the Premier League's inception in 1992.

Twice - in 2011-12 and 2001-02 - all three promoted teams have avoided the drop, while only five of the last 18 promoted sides have been relegated. In fact, promoted teams have a 58.2 per cent instant survival rate, with only 27 of the 68 teams to have been promoted to the top flight being sent straight back down. That recent record will significantly worsen though come May unless Leicester, Burnley and QPR can all find form fast. *four teams relegated . **two teams promoted .","Burnley, Leicester and QPR all in relegation zone after promotion last year .

"Nigel Pearson insists he and his Leicester City players still believe they can stay up but admits Saturday’s match against Hull is ‘must win’. Leicester have only played once since drawing at Everton on February 22 – losing 2-0 to Manchester City on March 4 – and have slipped seven points away from safety in that time. Pearson’s side lie bottom of the table on 18 points, seven behind Aston Villa in 17th with a game against Chelsea in hand. Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson insists he and his squad believe they can still avoid relegation this season . Pearson (centre) watches training unfold on Thursday as Leicester prepare for their clash against Hull . But Pearson has not given up hope yet. 'We still have a strong belief in our ability to stay up this season,’ he said. 'Whether other people share it is not that important at the moment. In house there is a feeling we can do it. 'Saturday is a game both sides want to win. But Hull may be happier with the draw than us. We certainly need to win the game.’ Pearson thinks once one victory comes, others can follow. 'That is something we keep very much in our minds because we do have that belief. But you have to get that first one. This is a game a lot of people see as being a pivotal one we have. It will be a difficult game.’ Leicester recorded one of their four Premier League victories in the reverse fixture at the KC Stadium dismissed talk of planning for relegation. 'Now’s not the times to be talking in those terms,’ Pearson added. 'I remain very focussed on the job that needs to be done this season, to negotiate a way through the last 11 games to get enough points to stay up. We always plan ahead, there has to be realism about it.’ Riyad Mahrez (centre) scored the only goal of the game as Leicester won 1-0 at Hull earlier in the season .","Leicester host Hull in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini felt he needed to 'refresh the team' and leave out captain Vincent Kompany for his side's much-needed win against Leicester. Kompany was dropped to the bench along with Pablo Zabaleta and Edin Dzeko, while Samir Nasri and Fernandinho missed out on the squad completely as City beat the Foxes 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium. Central defender Kompany had come in for particularly heavy criticism after City's damaging losses to Barcelona and Liverpool in the past week and Pellegrini decided to act with the season threatening to unravel. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was dropped to the bench for the match against Leicester City . Kompany has come in for criticism this season following a number of high-profile errors for the champions . Asked to explain his selections, Pellegrini said: 'For the same reason Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho, Samir Nasri, Edin Dzeko - that were playing normally - I think it was important to refresh the team mentally and physically after two difficult games. 'We have the squad we want so it was a good moment to refresh the team.' Pellegrini added that Kompany, normally an inspirational presence in the side but in poor form of late, took the decision 'very well, without any problems'. City, trailing Chelsea by five points in the Barclays Premier League having played a game more, were not at their fluent best against the Foxes. But they got back to winning ways with goals late in each half from David Silva and substitute James Milner. Manuel Pellegrini revealed that he dropped his captain as he needed to 'refresh the team' David Silva shoots the ball past Leicester goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to give Manchester City the lead . After a difficult few days, in which Pellegrini's future has been the subject of speculation, the result was a relief. Pellegrini said: 'I think always when you don't have the result you need the next game is very difficult. That is why the most important thing was to win the three points. 'We dominated the game and had a good possession of the ball. 'Maybe Leicester is at the bottom but if you see their results - they drew 2-2 against Liverpool and against Everton and were very unlucky not to draw against Arsenal.' City created a number of chances but were denied on several occasions by veteran goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Yet they still lacked their usual spark and Leicester were aggrieved to have been denied penalties on three occasions while Riyad Mahrez hit the post. Substitute James Milner gets the better of Morgan and Danny Simpson to doubled City's lead . Mark Schwarzer dives but is beaten as Milner runs to celebrate after coming off the bench . Asked if his side should have had penalties, Foxes boss Nigel Pearson said: 'Yes. Simple answer. Three throughout the game - (Andrej) Kramaric in both halves, the second one you could probably say was a bit more marginal but there was contact. The third one on the line is in the box.' Pearson would not get drawn into criticising referee Robert Madley, who also frustrated Leicester with some of his decisions in an FA Cup tie in January. He said: 'I am not talking about them (referees), sorry. Not tonight. You can talk about them and ask the relevant authorities. I don't think there is any point me talking about the referee. Same one we had against Tottenham.' The result left Leicester bottom of the table but Pearson has no doubts about the spirit in his squad. He said: 'They are a resilient group so we will have to get on with it. We can't do anything about it. It is up to the authorities. Our players give everything they have got and they have done again tonight. 'There are lots of positive and we have to take them into the remaining games. There is no point dwelling on negative aspects of situations that we have no control of.'","Manchester City beat Leicester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium .

"Manchester City felt the full force of a sparkling Lionel Messi performance on Wednesday, prompting a debate over whether the Barcelona forward is the greatest player of all time.

"Leicester have announced a £20.8 million loss but have still met Financial Fair Play rules. The Foxes have fallen within the Football League's FFP regulations after announcing their financial results for the year ending May 31, 2014 with the loss down from £34m in 2013. A club statement read: 'Through reducing its costs and increasing its revenue streams, the club has been able to submit a return which is in compliance with the Football League's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations.

'After costs relating to the club's promotion, academy expenditure and other costs allowable under FFP guidelines are added back, the club recorded losses within the allowable parameters set by the League.' Leicester's promotion-winning season last term, where they clinched the Sky Bet Championship title, helped the club increase their revenue to £31.2m - up from £19.6m. Staff costs increased to £36.3m after promotion bonus payments of £9.4m while match receipts rose from £5.7m to £6.9m with the average attendance climbing to 25,003. Chief executive Susan Whelan said: 'The establishment of Leicester City as a successful, self-sustainable Premier League football club remains a long-term work in progress, but these results are a positive reflection of our efforts to build solid foundations to that end. 'It should be noted that one of the most successful seasons in the club's recent history was achieved while ensuring compliance with the Football League's FFP regulations, for which our football management staff and senior management deserve great credit.

"It was only a small-sided game at the end of a session at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground, but heads were turned when teenage striker Chuba Akpom, called over to join them, cut in from the left flank and curled the ball, side-footed, around the goalkeeper to score. The move echoed a former time and a former forward, as if the ghost of Thierry Henry was still haunting the centre’s pitches with his trademark dribble and finish. Alexis Sanchez came running over to Akpom, leaping around excitedly and shouting ‘Titi, Titi, Titi, Titi!’ Arsenal's teenage striker Chuba Akpom has been compared to club legend Thierry Henry . Thierry Henry was Akpom's idol growing up and the youngster is keen to emulate his success . Akpom (left), walks to training with Arsenal team-mates Theo Walcott, Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck . There is still a long, long way to go until the 19-year-old gets anywhere near close to his idol Henry, but nicknames tend to stick around. ‘One day in training with the first team I scored an Henry-type goal, cutting inside and finishing,’ Akpom tells Sportsmail. ‘I could see Sanchez jumping, he’ s an enthusiastic guy at the best of times and he’s going: “Titi, Titi, Titi, Titi!” ‘The next morning he came to me and said “Titi.” 'Then the next morning he came to me and said “Titi.” I asked: 'hold on is this my new nickname?' That’s how it came about and it’s stuck since then. ‘Now the lads just call me Titi or Thierry Henry - I’ll take that. It’s not a bad comparison to have. ‘He was my idol growing up. Playing for the academy and watching Arsenal’s first team I used to see players like Henry scoring every week and it really inspired me.’ Akpom was born and bred in east London’s Canning Town and joined Arsenal aged six. Akpom closes down Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster during September's League Cup tie . Akpom celebrates after scoring during the 2014 International Tournament match with Holland . England U20 play Mexico U20 at 7.45pm on Wednesday 25 March at The Hive, Barnet FC. Tickets for the game at The Hive are priced at £3 for adults and £1.50 for kids and can be purchased by calling 0208 381 3800 or at www.venuetoolbox.com/thehivelondon . Manager Arsene Wenger has been so impressed with his progress the Frenchman has him training with the first team and has included him regularly on the bench this season, featuring several times in the Premier League and FA Cup. Even if the Henry comparisons are premature, there is no denying Akpom is beginning to make his mark where it matters. ‘I’m with the senior team now in the changing room and on the training ground,’ he adds. ‘It’s all about getting familiar with the environment and the players and getting as much game time as I can. ‘A lot of them are international players, a lot are England players; Calum Chambers, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott, Danny Welbeck, Kieran Gibbs. I look up to them. 'They’ve made it into the England senior team. It’s good to be around them and get good advice.’ Akpom is a right-footed front man but likes to drop out wide to the left flank to torment full-backs. Sound familiar? His is quick and skilful with a sharp finish. Most importantly, he scores goal. For Arsenal youth teams and England Under 15 to Under 20 level, bucketfuls of them. Akpom in the thick of the action during Arsenal's Premier League win over Aston Villa last month . The teenage striker celebrates after Nacho Monreal converts the winning penalty in a League Cup tie at West Brom last season . ‘People keep telling me having a child is the best feeling,’ he says. ‘I haven’ t had that yet I’m too young, but when I score goals - I’d be surprised if you beat that feeling.’ He cites one of the game’s greatest goal-scorers, the Brazilian Ronaldo, as another idol and closer to home is aiming at the top. But, unlike the lightning runs down the left wing, he understands all of that will come slowly. ‘Wayne Rooney is another player I look up to,’ he explains. ‘He’s the captain of the national team and that’s something I would like to try to do. ‘I’d love to be a captain - of England and Arsenal. Leading by example off the pitch and on it. It would be a dream. ‘Right now, it’s about getting in the squad first. You look at Luke Shaw, see him go to the World Cup last summer, it shows you how fast things can change. ‘Raheem Sterling is a good friend of mine, Ross Barkley; young players are getting their chance. But now it’s about taking it step-by-step. There’s no rush.’ The Together for England Roadshow is a nationwide drive aimed at inspiring current and future Three Lions fans by strengthening the national side’s relationship with local communities.

"Queens Park Rangers manager Chris Ramsey feels Charlie Austin is more deserving of a place in Roy Hodgson's England squad than Tottenham's Harry Kane. Austin has missed out on Hodgson's latest England squad for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and friendly with Italy, despite accumulating 15 Premier League goals this season – just one fewer than Kane, who is set to earn his first senior cap. The former Burnley man's goal haul puts him above the other three strikers in Hodgson's squad – Wayne Rooney (11), Danny Welbeck (4) and Daniel Sturridge (3) – and Ramsey thinks Austin's ability to score goals in a relegation-threatened side makes him more deserving of an England call-up. Charlie Austin (left) was left out of the England squad on Thursday, but Harry Kane (right) made the cut . QPR manager Chris Ramsey believes that Austin should have been included in the 24-man group . 'Charlie has been fantastic this season his work-rate has been unbelievable and he has the uncoachable thing of being able to score goals' Ramsey said ahead of Hodgson's announcement. 'I am sure he will be in the reckoning for the squad.' When asked if Austin deserved his chance as much as Kane, the QPR boss added: 'Even more so because he is doing it in a team that is struggling at the foot of the table and he has still scored quite a few goals this season.

'Manchester City did not have their best game,' Ramsey said. 'But they all have gone out of the Champions League at a late stage. 'Not making it to the last eight is a blip for this country because over the past few years we have got to the latter stages, but now and again this happens. 'I still think this is the best league in the world and where everyone wants to really come and play. We can see that by the amount of overseas players and managers that we have in this league.'

"West Ham are ready to rise to the challenge of facing a Sunderland side managed for the first time by Dick Advocaat, according to defender Aaron Cresswell. The Black Cats travel to Upton Park on Saturday evening just one point and one place outside of the Premier League relegation zone, having sacked Gus Poyet after last weekend's 4-0 home defeat to Aston Villa. Advocaat has been appointed until the end of the season with the aim of keeping the club in the top flight, and Cresswell - a Premier League ever-present for West Ham so far this campaign - knows the game takes on extra significance following the Dutchman's appointment. Aaron Cresswell (right) says West Ham are ready to face Sunderland on Saturday evening . Cresswell admits it will be tough facing a team who have just appointed a new manager . 'What was already set to be a tough but exciting game has that bit more to it now Sunderland have brought a new manager in,' he told West Ham's official website. 'I don't know too much about Dick Advocaat but he's certainly got a lot of experience and we're expecting a difficult match. Every game in the Premier League is a challenge and we will have to rise to it. 'When a new manager comes in it gives everyone at the club a lift and the players will want to impress the new manager. 'The first game under a new manager seems to favour the team with the new manager and I certainly think that was the case when we played West Bromwich Albion on New Year's Day just after Tony Pulis had taken over.' Dick Advocaat has taken over at Sunderland until the end of the season . Advocaat takes charge of the Black Cats for the first time away at West Ham on Saturday evening . Although Advocaat will want a positive result in his first game in charge, the fixture is also crucial to West Ham and their manager Sam Allardyce. Following an impressive start, Allardyce has seen his side fall away from the pack chasing European qualification with the Hammers having won just one of their last 12 league games. In that spell they have come up against Liverpool, Manchester United, Southampton, Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea but, of their final nine league outings, only two come against sides in the top half. 'We've had a tough run of fixtures recently and while no game is easy in the Premier League, some are harder than others,' Cresswell added. 'Having played all the top clubs in the last two months, we know that we have a fair few winnable games in our last nine games so I firmly believe we can finish strongly. 'We haven't had the results that we feel our performances deserve so we need to work that bit harder to make sure we get what our performances merit. No one at the club wants the season to fade away and we want to finish as high as we can.'","West Ham host Sunderland at Upton Park on Saturday evening .

"Tony Pulis has told Saido Berahino that being selected for England Under-21s in a 'big honour in itself' after the West Bromwich Albion striker missed out on a senior call-up. Berahino was in Roy Hodgson's squad for the matches against Slovenia and Scotland last November but did not feature and will instead play for Gareth Southgate's junior side against the Czech Republic and Germany at the end of this month.

I think we always try to find the best for the player and after we need to understand each other's position. 'But I will give our opinion; we have a good relationship with Roy.

On Kane's call-up he added: 'I'm happy for him and want to congratulate him, we are happy for him. It's Roy's decision, you expect some players to get the call but I'm happy for him.' Meanwhile, Pochettino has reinforced his belief that Danny Rose is England's best left-back despite missing out on the squad. 'I understand about Rose. It's his decision, it's not my opinion,' said the Argentine. 'He's is still in my opinion the best English left back. But it's down to Roy.

"Concerns are growing for troubled former England football star Paul Gascoigne after an astonishing Twitter rant at friends he claim 'screwed him over'. After a 44-day Twitter silence, the football legend suddenly burst into a foul-mouthed rant about his girlfriend Mandy Thomas and a man called Andy. Posting online more than 50 times, Gascoigne, who has publicly struggled with alcoholism in the past, said the pair had 'screwed him over' and that he was 'in tears'. Scroll down for video . Outburst: After a 44-day Twitter silence, Paul Gascoigne burst into a foul-mouthed rant at friends he claim 'screwed him over' It is not clear what the ex-footballer is claiming Ms Thomas and Andy have done as most of the tweets are incoherent. The expletive-ridden rant started last night and ended this afternoon, with Gascoigne appearing to suggest he had tried to visit Ms Thomas at her work at a Post Office in Bournemouth. Last year the couple appeared to be the picture of domestic bliss, with friends saying she had helped him detox from alcohol and was willing to stand by him despite his troubles. Now friends and fans are concerned for the former England midfielder, with fears growing that Gascoigne may need help. One Twitter used wrote: 'Please RT, genuinely concerned for @gazza8gascoigne - can we get @GaryLineker or a friend to check on him before he does something silly!' The troubled footballer appeared to be ranting about his girlfriend Mandy Thomas (pictured) and a man called Andy . Last year Gascoigne and Ms Thomas appeared to be the picture of domestic bliss, with friends saying she had helped him detox from alcohol . Another fan wrote: 'It's sad to hear about this Gazza. Keep your cool in this difficult time. You will have a great support team who will help.' Tracy Stephens posted: '@gazza8gascoigne Don't let them make you ill. Sending you a big hug. Xx' The troubled star, who retired in 2004, has been battling alcoholism for years, but looked to have turned a corner in October last year. Gascoigne was pictured embracing Ms Thomas as they laughed and joked with each other, but two days later he was sectioned following an alcohol meltdown. The star was placed on a three-day emergency detox after being rushed to hospital in the early hours following an apparent alcohol binge. Healthy: The former England star looked well as he appeared on BT Sport last month, joking about his previous alcohol troubles . Gascoigne was in good spirits as he chatted with former drug addict Russell Brand on the football show . There were fears Gascoigne had started drinking again after he was seen popping into an off-licence while still wearing his slippers in January, however he later claimed he was just buying cigarettes. In December last year, he was spotted entering an off-licence in east London, although it wasn't clear whether he bought anything at the store. A month earlier he was pictured looking downcast as he put the bins out in front his property in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes. Last month the former footballer appeared on a BT Sport football programme alongside former drug addict Russell Brand. Gascoigne appeared to be in good health as he touched on his lengthy battle with drink, joking: 'I've been on a whiskey diet – I lost three days!' As well as making light of his dark times, the footballer also touched on the struggles of being in the spotlight. He told fellow guests Jimmy Greaves and Brand how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to 'entertain the fans, win them over', but admitted that sometimes it all became too intense for him. He also admitted that even today 'it's sometimes hard to go to games' because he ends up 'analysing myself.' He added: 'I drive myself nuts. What would I have done there?' The former Everton and Newcastle player last month told the High Court that phone-hacking was linked to his alcoholism . The former Everton and Newcastle player last month told the High Court that phone-hacking was linked to his alcoholism. The 47-year-old former footballer gave evidence at the hearing in London to determine what compensation should be paid by Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) in eight representative cases. In a written statement supplied to the court, Gascoigne said that his fame had brought many benefits but also caused him much heartache as he had struggled to come to terms with the end of his playing career. Constant media pressure made it very difficult for him to lead a normal life and had led to his family not being as close as they once were. He said he suffered from alcohol dependency and also had treatment for drug use and addiction to the drink Red Bull. His statement said: 'I have suffered from mental illness, including paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. I am bipolar and I have an addictive personality.'","Paul Gascoigne tweeted more than 50 times in 16 hours in astonishing rant .

"Everton captain Phil Jagielka says the players have to share responsibility for an alarming slump that has seen them win just one of their last 12 Premier League matches. Wednesday's 2-0 defeat at Stoke left the Toffees in 14th place, just six points above the drop zone with 10 games to go, although 18th-placed QPR have a match in hand. This latest loss saw the heat turned up on Everton boss Roberto Martinez with '£MartinezOut' trending in the UK on Twitter in the aftermath - despite fans in the away end at the Britannia Stadium showing vociferous support for him and the team at half-time - but Jagielka insists the squad must also take the blame. Everton captain Phil Jagielka says the players must take responsibility for their poor Premier League form . England international Jagielka says it is time for the players to 'buck up our ideas' 'The fans were great (against Stoke). It has been a difficult season to watch us because the performances have not been as good as last season,' Jagielka told the Liverpool Echo. 'They are going to vent their frustrations, it is normally the manager that gets it as he is head of the food chain. 'But we as players know we need to buck our ideas up, start performing better and take pressure off him, pressure off ourselves and start getting some more points.' Roberto Martinez is coming under increasing pressure to turn it around after one league win in 12 games . Everton manager Martinez and his team look lost in the Barclays Premier League of late . Martinez swept into Goodison in 2013 armed with promising sound bites and a snappy dress sense to match a refreshing cavalier playing style that had taken Wigan to FA Cup glory only a month earlier. The former Swansea midfielder also oversaw Wigan's relegation from the top flight, but that was largely forgotten as he proved a runaway success on Merseyside, taking Everton back into Europe after a four-year absence and just missing out on a place in the Champions League. But this season has proved much more difficult for the Toffees, with a porous defence and stuttering form in front of goal leading to a growing sense of frustration. Victor Moses (centre) rises up to head home his side's opening goal en route to a 2-0 victory against Everton . Stoke substitute Mame Biram Diouf sealed win with a late goal after reacting to Marko Arnautovic's rebound . What has vexed supporters even more is their contrasting displays in the Europa League, with the Toffees beating high-flying Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg home and away en route to a largely trouble-free run into the last 16. The visit of Dynamo Kiev is next up for Everton in that competition, but Jagielka concedes their focus now has to be moving clear of the Premier League's basement battle. 'We know we need to concentrate on our league form,' he added. 'We have 10 games left now and need to pull our finger out and start picking up points.'","Everton were beaten 2-0 by Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Wednesday .

"Three Florida-based police officers have been fired and a fourth has been forced to resign after exchanging racist texts and creating an N-word-laced video featuring President Barack Obama. James Wells, 30, Jason Holding, 31, and Christopher Sousa, 25, who patrolled a predominantly black neighborhood in Fort Lauderdale, were sacked on Friday for 'department misconduct'. Meanwhile, Alex Alvarez, 22, who apparently created the video, resigned from the city's force in late January, before the five-month  investigation into he and his colleagues' exchanges was complete. The job losses come at a critical moment in the United States as police officers across the nation continue to come under fire for the alleged use of excessive force against African Americans. WARNING: OFFENSIVE MATERIAL . Scroll down for video . Firings: Three Florida-based police officers have been fired and a fourth has been forced to resign after exchanging racist texts and creating an N-word-laced video featuring President Barack Obama. Above, Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Frank Adderley (far right) speaks about the firings at a press conference on Friday . 'Offensive': The iMovie video, apparently created by Alex Alvarez,  displayed 'racially insensitive' images of  a person in a white Ku Klux Klan hood (left) and a caricature of President  Obama with gold-capped teeth (right) 'Racist': The video,  created in the style of a film trailer, also showed images of minority attacks and racist on-screen captions. Above, the words, 'But one n***** would change everything', preceeded the photo of Obama . All of the four officers involved in the case committed misconduct involving racist texts 'exchanged among themselves and former police officers', Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Frank Adderley said . Chief Adderley, who is African-American, added that the officers did not engage in criminal behavior, 'but their conduct was inexcusable and there is zero tolerance for this kind of behavior' in the force. In their cellphone messages, the officers sent each other 'racial, sexist and ethically inappropriate' images and other content, including offensive comments against both Hispanics and homosexuals. They also 'criticized their coworkers' grammar, appearance, work ethic and referred to an entire shift as lazy (expletives)'. And they  even talked about killing and injuring black people, CBS reported. In one text, Sousa reportedly wrote: 'Holdings we are coming and drinking all your beer and killing n******.' In another, Holding said: 'Id have that noose ready (sic)', according to the Sun-Sentinel. Meanwhile, in Alvarez's 'movie trailer-style' iMovie video, the officer displayed 'racially insensitive' behavior by including images of attacks on minorities and a person in a white Ku Klux Klan hood. Texts: All of the four officers committed misconduct involving racist texts 'exchanged among themselves and former police officers', Chf Adderley said. Above, in this text, Christopher Sousa refers to killing n******' 'Misconduct': In a response to Jason Holding, his colleague James Wells calls someone a 'retarded brown' 'Ethically inappropriate': In another text message, Holding writes: 'Id have that noose ready' - in reference to black men. Holding,  Wells and Sousa, all of Fort Lauderdale. were sacked Friday for 'department misconduct' The disturbing footage, which apparently used the N-word repeatedly, also featured pictures of a wanted poster for 'an escaped slave' and a caricature of President  Obama with gold-capped teeth. And it included photos of black men being bitten by a dog and looking down the barrel of a gun. An internal affairs investigation was launched into the four officers' conduct last October after Alvarez’s former fiancée emailed screenshots of their racist text exchanges to Chief Adderley. Following the allegations, Wells, Holding, Sousa and Alvarez were dismissed from their normal duties. In January, Alvarez resigned. The other three  were  sacked for misconduct this week. Disturbing: Officer Alex Alvarez, 22, who apparently created the video (pictured: a still), resigned from the city's force in late January - before the  investigation into he and his colleagues' exchanges was complete . Shocking: The video for the ficitious 'The Hoods' film, which apparently used the N-word repeatedly, featured pictures of a wanted poster for 'an escaped slave' and black men looking down the barrel of a gun (pictured) Brutal: It also included photos of black men being bitten by a dog (pictured), a police investigation determined . The firings were based on 'sustained department misconduct and ... conduct unbecoming of a police officer', including the 'Uncle Al Films' video for  'The Hoods' movie, according to WSVN.com. Chief Adderley told NBC Miami the officers had told him they had been just joking around. 'Based on the investigation, they felt, in their words, that it was a joke,' he said at a news conference Friday . However, Alvarez's fiancée, who has not been identified, reportedly told investigators that her officer ex-lover had thought that 'black people should be slaves' and  was obsessed with the 'KKK'. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler said he was 'very disappointed, disgusted and shocked' by the inquiry's findings, describing the officers as 'a few bad apples' in a 'diverse' police department.

'Based on the investigation, they felt, in their words, that it was a joke,' he said at a news conference Friday . Listening: Police officers listen as Cf Adderley talks to the media on the results of the internal affairs inquiry . He added city and department leadership had agreed that the multiple sackings were appropriate. Meanwhile, City Manager Lee Feldman said: 'It's extremely unfortunate that these acts of racism and hatred took place'. He also expressed his thanks toward Alvarez's fiancée for coming forward. The police department in south-east Florida, which has around 500 agents, has now created a human diversity class that all officers must attend on an annual basis in the wake of the incident. The Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #31 represents the officers. FOP President Jack Lokeinsky said everyone is entitled to due process, and the officers have the right to a fair review of the facts.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has questioned the long-term effects of holding the 2022 World Cup in the winter. The final of the showpiece event in Qatar is to be on Sunday, December 18 - a decision which will allow traditional Boxing Day club matches to take place in Britain and avoid the fierce heat of June and July. It will be a shortened tournament over 28 days instead of the usual 32, starting on November 21. December 18 is also Qatar's national day. Manuel Pellegrini has expressed concern over the plans to play the Qatar 2022 World Cup in winter . The Manchester City manager watches on during his side's 1-0 defeat by Barcelona on Wednesday night . However, Pellegrini is concerned how Premier League games, which would usually be scheduled for November and December, will be caught up later in the season and the impact of doing so on the next domestic campaign. 'I think it is difficult to stop all the European leagues in that month, especially in our league at this moment, and not play football here in November and December,' Pellegrini said. 'When you recover those amount of games what will happen in the next season, when you finish late, how many days the national squad will need their players? 'I don't think it is easy. It is a big task.' Swansea manager Garry Monk echoed Pellegrini's thoughts, but conceded that teams would just have to 'get on with it'. Swansea boss Garry Monk says the break will be strange but the clubs will just have to get on with it . Roberto Martinez says teams around Europe will have to adapt to the affect of a winter World Cup . 'It will be strange having a two-month break in the middle of the season. I'm not sure how that's going to work and I'd have to see the exact lay-out of it, but I don't think it's a great thing,' he said. 'It's beyond the powers of Swansea City, but I can't imagine too many teams are happy with it. But it sounds as if we're just going to have to get on with it.' Everton boss Roberto Martinez conceded the tournament moving to November would need plenty of adaptation, but he always expected a World Cup in Qatar to be held over the winter. 'You need clarity and then you can prepare towards that,' Martinez said. 'But I always felt that once it was given to Qatar it was going to be a winter World Cup. 'When all the talk is about wanting the World Cup in different continents and different countries, and when the hosts are going to be Qatar, it's only normal that it's going to be played in the winter. 'That's going to affect two or three seasons around that date, but we need to adapt and make it a big football celebration like the World Cup's supposed to be.' Hull boss Steve Bruce says playing the World Cup in the winter is the only sensible solution . Hull manager Steve Bruce thinks a World Cup late in the year is a sensible move in such a hot climate, but took the chance to push for a winter break. He said: 'We've got plenty of time to adapt. I've always said in this country we need a break, we should copy everyone else. When you see other teams come back there's a freshness about them because of the winter break. 'We've got plenty of time to put the schedule in. Once FIFA picked Qatar there was only one solution and they've picked the sensible one.' West Brom manager Tony Pulis agreed. 'Whichever way you try to cook it they have worked it to suit the country at the best possible time. They have moved everything around to suit them, full stop,' he said. 'They are the governing body and, irrespective of what you do say and don't say, there might be loads of people unhappy with it, but they have got it through and it's been agreed. 'Everyone has to get on with it. What will be the situation in England, is everything is going to have to be reorganised and revamped? That's going to be interesting.'","Qatar 2022 World Cup will take place from November 21 to December 19 .

"Novak Djokovic is the ultimate problem for everyone in men’s tennis to solve — and for Andy Murray in particular. The British No 1 went down 6-2, 6-3 in 88 minutes to his direct contemporary on Saturday in the latest match of what has begun to look like a one-sided rivalry. The 27 year-old Serb’s victory not only put him into the final of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, it also represented his ninth victory out of 10 against Murray, the exception being the 2013 Wimbledon final. British No1 Andy Murray crashes out of BNP Paribas semi-final at Indian Wells after losing to Novak Djokovic . Murray plays a shot during his semi-final match against Djokovic in Indian Wells on Saturday . Djokovic celebrates his win over Murray that sees the Serb progress to the final of the BNP Paribas Open . Djokovic and Murray meet at the net following their quick semi-final in California on Saturday . And Murray said: ‘The frustrating thing is obviously getting off to a bad start in both sets. Novak didn’t give me any free points at the beginning of either set and I made a few too many errors early on. ‘At the end of both sets, I started to play a bit better and made it tougher and was able to push him a bit, but not enough at the beginning of the sets to make it challenging enough for him.’ Djokovic was in sublime form and Murray’s only chance appeared to be to serve outstandingly well, which he did not. On the kind of medium-slow hard court that is so commonplace on the ATP Tour the world No 1, when fully prepared and motivated, looks irresistible. Djokovic said: ‘I tried to start with the right intensity, I got a crucial break at the start. Andy made a lot of unforced errors, his first-serve percentage was low. I’m sure he knows I’m returning well, I know he’s returning well, so that puts added pressure on our serving.’ Murray's caoch Amelie Mauresmo watches on from the stands in Indian Wells . Djokovic will play either Roger Federer or Milos Raonic in the final on Sunday . There was nothing in the way of the aggravation that marked their last meeting, the Australian Open final, where Murray looked like he was getting the upper hand before his opponent started hamming up his physical state and the Scot became distracted. That was part of what has been, by and large, a decent start to the season for Murray, but his problem remains that Djokovic plays in a similar fashion to him and does it decisively better. Murray had been in impressive form over the past 10 days while Djokovic enjoyed a walkover in his scheduled quarter-final against Bernard Tomic. And Djokovic will now face Roger Federer in Sunday's final after the Swiss came through his semi-final against Rafa Nadal’s conqueror, Miles Raonic. Federer beat the Canadian 7-5, 6-4, finally finding the break he needed in the 11th game of the first set. He clinched the opener with a forehand winner, then broke Raonic’s serve again at the start of the second set. Raonic, enticed to the net repeatedly by Federer only to see power strokes whizz past him, struggled against Federer’s serve and the world No 2 completed the victory with a volley at the net. Murray trudges off the court after his 6-2, 6-3 defeat in Indian Wells .

"He was livid, spinning towards Kevin Friend and telling the fourth official exactly why Diafra Sakho shouldn’t have been able to crash home the late winner. Dick Advocaat then grumpily crossed his arms in acceptance. Referees are going to get to know this man over the next two months. On his first public outing in England, Advocaat was nothing if not eccentric, incapable of remaining still for longer than a few seconds. His gesticulations were constant, nervous energy overt. Staying slumped in his cushy Upton Park dug out just wasn’t an option for the Sunderland coach. Keeping Sunderland up looks like being the pensioner’s toughest job in a long managerial career and — despite an understated entrance to the Premier League in which no photographer deemed it necessary to capture an image of him before kick-off — Advocaat felt the need to show those loyal band of travelling supporters in the Sir Trevor Brooking stand that he means business. Dick Advocaat was left disappointed as Sunderland fell to a 1-0 defeat at West Ham in his first game in charge . West Ham striker Diafra Sakho smashes in a late winner to give his side their first win in 13 league games . West Ham's Carlton Cole (centre) tussles with Sunderland's Patrick van Aanholt (left) and John O'Shea (right) The Dutchman may only have the job for nine matches but he is insistent on stamping his authority on a rag-tag squad who would not fight for previous incumbent Gus Poyet. The signs are positive for the struggling club and Advocaat must surely have left east London with a sense of satisfaction that his message has been heeded in a matter of days, even if his team failed to hold out. Advocaat is acutely aware that his body language resonates with those wearing the club’s colours before him. Even at 67, the basics still enthuse him. Jordi Gomez, normally little more than a luxury midfielder, was one shining example of the difference between Poyet and now. Sunderland playmaker Jordi Gomez (right) tussles for the ball with West Ham midfielder Alex Song (left) Advocaat controversially included Sunderland winger Adam Johnson among his substitutes at Upton Park . Johnson, who is currently on bail from sexual assault charges, was met by a chorus of boos from the crowd . Advocaat almost leapt in celebration when Gomez left his central station to shut down Aaron Cresswell during what appeared an innocuous patch of play. For him, that epitomised tangible change amid the serious problems he inherited. First battle won. The second, of course, is finding someone who can actually stick the ball in the net. One goal in seven games, dating back to February 7, is laughably abysmal. So it was understandable that Advocaat opted for three up front in Connor Wickham, Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe. Less cautious than fellow countryman Louis van Gaal but every bit as passionate, he clasped his ears in frustration at Defoe’s galling, first-half miss. Advocaat looked as if he was living on the edge, a characteristic typified by introducing Adam Johnson with 17 minutes remaining. The winger, recalled from suspension, was booed and subjected to a volley of disparaging chants, but that matters little to his manager. Results are paramount from now until May 24. Advocaat will try to earn those wins while hopping about on the touchline. Advocaat faces a difficult challenge to keep Sunderland in the Premier League and has eight games to do it .","Dick Advocaat lost his first game in charge of Sunderland 1-0 to West Ham .

"Sunderland have replaced Gus Poyet with Dick Advocaat in a late bid to stave off relegation from the Premier League. The humiliating 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa not only came at the expense of the Uruguayan's job, but also leaves the Black Cats a single point above the drop zone. Here, Sportsmail looks at how some other clubs have fared after bringing in a new boss at late notice... Dutchman Dick Advocaat has nine games to stave off relegation at the Stadium of Light . Christian Benteke scores as Aston Villa humiliate Sunderland 4-0 in the Premier League on Saturday . Gus Poyet waves as he leaves the field after what would be his last game as Black Cats boss . Norwich - Chris Hughton and Neil Adams (6 April 2014) Hughton guided Norwich to 11th in his first season but struggled the following season and was sacked with the Canaries five points clear of the drop in 17th, but with Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea as four of their last five games. It was always going to be an uphill struggle for youth coach Neil Adams and, despite picking up a point against the Blues, were relegated. Time ran out for Chris Hughton at Norwich, but Neil Adams (right) couldn't save Canaries from the drop . Reading - Brian McDermott and Nigel Adkins (11 March 2013) It looked like a shrewd move when Reading replaced promotion-winning boss Brian McDermott with Nigel Adkins, who had been somewhat harshly binned by Southampton in January. But it was too late for the former physio to heal the Royals' season, winning just one of his eight Premier League games as Reading made an immediate return to the Championship. Brian McDermott left Reading under a cloud but Nigel Adkins won just one game as Royals were relegated . See how the other SEVEN managers from Holland have fared in Premier League hotseats . Hull - Phil Brown and Iain Dowie (15 March 2010) After the half-time team talk on the pitch and singing to celebrate survival in 2009, Phil Brown's luck finally ran out having won just one of his last 15 games as Hull boss. He was placed on gardening leave and replaced by former Charlton and Crystal Palace manager Iain Dowie, but the rot had already set in and Hull collected just six more points on their way to relegation. Phil Brown lost the eye of the Tigers while Iain Dowie couldn't claw his way to safety with Hull . Newcastle - Chris Hughton and Alan Shearer (1 April 2009) When Joe Kinnear was required heart surgery in February 2009, Hughton was temporarily placed in charge but only won one of his six games, leaving Newcastle in 18th. Club legend Alan Shearer was surprisingly parachuted in to turn things around but his only victory came in a 3-1 win against Middlesbrough and the Magpies suffered a shock relegation. It can work... but beware short-term fixes: . Bringing in a legend is no guarantee as Newcastle found after replacing Chris Hughton with Alan Shearer . Sunderland - Martin O'Neill and Paolo di Canio (30 March 2013) O'Neill was dismissed with Sunderland 16th, a point above the drop zone but having played a game more than fellow strugglers Wigan and Aston Villa. Controversial Italian Paolo di Canio quite literally made his mark — ruining his suit with a knee-slide to celebrate 3-0 victory over rivals Newcastle — and secured a comfortable 14th place. But that was about as good as it got for Di Canio at the Stadium of Light as he was sacked just five games into the following campaign with his side rock bottom on one point. Martin O'Neill couldn't find the answers while Paolo di Canio's success at Sunderland was short lived . Fulham - Chris Coleman and Lawrie Sanchez (10 April 2007) They may have gone seven games without a win but it was a shock when Coleman was sacked with five games to go — especially as Fulham were five points clear of danger. Former Northern Ireland boss Lawrie Sanchez made a stuttering start but eventually ensured survival on the penultimate day with a 1-0 win over Liverpool. His reign didn't last long, though, as Roy Hodgson came to the rescue in December 2007 with Fulham still battling against the drop.

"As the Premier League season enters its final straight, a few unexpected names have risen to the fore as teams fight to either stave off relegation or strive for a top four finish. Tim Sherwood attacking instincts have managed to get Aston Villa firing again with three of his players making the top 10 in the Player Performance Index PPI chart created by EA Sports. Meanwhile, Marouane Fellaini's improving form, which included a fine goal against Tottenham, has been silencing his early critics at Old Trafford. 10. Charles N'Zogbia, Aston Villa (PPI score: 34.4) The first of three Aston Villa stars to have been reinvigorated by the arrival of new manager Tim Sherwood. The former Wigan winger has been released from the shackles of Paul Lambert's previous reign and was back dribbling down the touchline this weekend while providing an assist in Villa's 4-0 hammering of Sunderland. No 10: Aston Villa winger Charles N'Zogbia is back doing what he does best under Tim Sherwood . The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning Performance . 2. Player's Performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . 9. Joel Ward, Crystal Palace (35.9) Not only did the Eagles defender win four tackles and make seven clearances during his side's 3-1 defeat of struggling QPR, but he also managed to score. The sight of of a full-back celebrating in the style of Cristiano Ronaldo will still be etched in the minds of worried Rangers fans. 8. Wilfried Zaha, Crystal Palace (38.8) On his current form, Wilfried Zaha could earn himself a move to Manchester United... wait a minute! The speedy winger is one of several players to have risen from the flames of criticism this weekend with 16 passes completed in the opposition half to compliment his brave goal against QPR. No 9: Crystal Palace defender Joe Ledley (right) celebrates his goal against QPR  a la Cristiano Ronaldo . No 8: Wilfried Zaha suffered a nasty collision with the goal post for his troubles of scoring against Rangers . 7. Brown Ideye, West Brom (39.5) The Baggies' record £10million signing was almost offloaded for a cut-price fee in January but has come good with five league goals since the close of the transfer window. His latest, which claimed the match winner in Saturday's 1-0 victory over Stoke, ended a spell of four games without a goal. No 7:Brown Ideye scores the winer against Stoke, his fifth league goal since almost being sold in January . 6. Michael Carrick, Manchester United (38.3) Louis van Gaal's Manchester United are simply better when Michael Carrick is in the side as the cultured midfielder showed in arguably their best performance of the season against his former club Tottenham on Sunday. Carrick netted a rare headed goal but making 42 of 50 attempted passes for a completion rate of 84 per cent was equally impressive from the former England international. No 6: Cheikhou Kouyate has been compared with Patrick Vieira and was impressive this weekend . 5. Aaron Ramsey, Arsenal (41.4) The Welsh midfielder prepared for Arsenal's do-or-die Champions League showdown with Monaco on Tuesday with an all action performance in the 3-0 defeat of West Ham. Aaron Ramsey scored the Gunners second goal, provided an assist for Mathieu Flamini's third without ignoring his defensive responsibilities with  four wining tackles and three interceptions to leave Arsenal fans believing miracles can happen at the Stade Louis II. No 10: Aaron Ramsey skids on his knees after scoring in an all action display against West Ham . 4. Marouane Fellaini, Manchester United (45.7) At one time, it seemed as if Marouane Fellaini's only admirer at Old Trafford was the manager who signed him, David Moyes. But, despite being largely ignored by Van Gaal, the Belgium international has forced his way back into the side and received no less than a standing ovation after scoring a goal and keeping his passing tidy with a 78.6 per cent pass completion rate. No 4: Marouane Fellaini slots in a left footed shot during Manchester United's best performance of the season . 3. Romelu Lukaku, Everton (47.6) Everton's record £28million summer recruit has come under criticism as Premier League clubs have come to terms with Roberto Martinez's tactics this season. Nonetheless, the former Chelsea battering ram has starred in Europe and taken his league goal tally into double figures with a strike supplemented by an assist in the Toffees' 3-0 defeat of Newcastle. No 3: Romelu Lukaku made an assist and scored his 10th league goal of the season against Newcastle . 2. Christian Benteke, Aston Villa (54.7) Aston Villa were the biggest winners of the Premier League this weekend, which a 4-0 first half scoreline at Sunderland leading to Gus Poyet's eventual departure from the Stadium  of Light.

'We have had some good wins and we want to continue that and really maximise everything that we have got in the group. 'We believe we can stay up.

"Ready for retirement? David Cameron was seen doing shopping and enjoying a slice of cake near his home in Chipping Norton . David Cameron looked as if he was preparing himself for the quiet life today as he was spotted picking up some shopping and watching his son play football. The Prime Minister was seem walking out of a shop in Chadlington, near Chipping Norton, holding a carrier bag filled with shopping as he tucked into a slice of cake. He was pictured gorging himself on the slice as he walked around the market near his Oxfordshire home, paying for fruit and veg and chatting with locals. The Conservative leader, who today finally reached an agreement with opposition parties and broadcasters on televised election debates, was earlier seen watching his son Arthur play football for Chadlington FC. Despite Arthur's under-9s team losing 2-1, Mr Cameron remained in good spirits as he chatted with other parents during the match. Sporting a black jumper and cosy black Berghaus coat, the Prime Minister later picked up a few essentials from Sainsbury's, carrying them in a bag for life. He was then seen entering Chadlington Quality Foods - a community-run bakery and deli - leaving a few moments later with a slice of cake in a white paper bag. Mr Cameron stopped to chat with a few market traders before paying in cash for some fruit and vegetables. The Prime Minister's jaunt through the Oxfordshire town came on the day it was finally announced that broadcasters and political leaders had reached an agreement on televised debates in the run up to May's General Election. Broadcasters have confirmed plans for a seven-way discussion on April 2, as well as a range of other programmes before the nation goes to the polls. The first will see the Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband  interviewed separately before answering questions from a live studio audience.

The final encounter will be a special Question Time on BBC One on April 30. Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Nick Clegg will answer questions separately from a studio audience. There will be no head-to-head debate between the Prime Minister and the Labour leader. Labour immediately branded Cameron a 'coward' for avoiding a head-to-head debate with Miliband. A source said: 'The cowardice of David Cameron is still preventing the head-to-head debate on the 30th. 'Cameron is now in the ludicrous position of saying he will attend the same programme and take the same questions from the same audience as Ed Miliband, but will not debate him face to face.'

He emerged again moments later and was nibbling on a cake as he took a stroll on his Saturday off . David Cameron (left) and Ed Miliband (right) will face off alongside five other party leaders in a single televised general election debate on April 2 .

But a Tory source insisted they had secured a better deal than they were hoping for. 'If anything this is an improvement on the deal we were offered last week.

He has obviously been a regular for us all the way through the campaign. But he feels at this moment in time he has got some priorities at club level. There is some uncertainty about where he is going to be at club level next season.’ Ince has had a whirlwind year in club football, moving from Blackpool to Hull City in a deal that involved a drawn-out £2million compensation case between the two clubs. It even looked like Ince could have moved abroad at one point with his father's former club Inter Milan said to have shown interest. He has since been on loan at Nottingham Forest and Derby in the Championship. Southgate was told that Ince did not want to be selected and sought clarification from the player and his father . Ince challenges for the ball with Middlesbrough's Lee Tomlin during Tuesday's top-of-the-table clash . Southgate was speaking at Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium after announcing his squad for the forthcoming friendlies with Czech Republic and Germany. He has, of course, lost Harry Kane to the senior squad, but hopes to have the Spurs striker available for the Euros. ‘Myself and Roy (Hodgson) are constantly talking about that and he’s made it clear we’re able to pick any players who are eligible,' he added. ‘One or two have been up to senior team but haven’t yet established themselves. It’s nice to have them back in the fold. ‘It’s great that Harry has gone up this time – it sends a message to the rest of the squad that the pathway is there.' Southgate cannot call on Harry Kane as he is in the senior squad but the boss wants him back for the Euros .

"Hull have been charged by the Football Association for failing to control their players in Saturday's goalless Premier League clash against Leicester. The charge appears to relate to an incident where a number of Tigers players reacted furiously to Alex Bruce being booked by referee Jon Ross for a robust but ultimately fair challenge on Riyad Mahrez. An FA statement read: 'Hull City have been charged by The FA for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion. 'The allegation relates to an incident which occurred in or around the 68th minute of their fixture against Leicester City on 14 March 2015. 'The club has until 6pm on 23 March 2015 to respond to the charge.' Hull City have been charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion . The incident came in the middle of a highly-charged period as Michael Dawson had been booked two minutes earlier for a challenge on Jamie Vardy, and Tom Huddlestone was dismissed for the visitors just four minutes after, earning his second booking for a foul on Vardy. The issue of players applying pressure to referees came to the fore last week with Chelsea being accused of being over-zealous during their Champions League clash again Paris St Germain. And following the match at the King Power Stadium, Tigers boss Steve Bruce launched a thinly-veiled attack on the Leicester players for their behaviour towards the officials. 'I've got no problem with Huddlestone's two yellow cards, but is every challenge now a yellow if you mis-time it?' he said. Alex Bruce reacted furiously to being booked by referee Jon Ross for a  challenge on Riyad Mahrez . Hull City manager Steve Bruce was unhappy with the behaviour of Leicester players . 'It got a bit angry towards the end, but for me the referee booked my two centre-backs for (fair) challenges. 'There's a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek and if we're not careful...I saw everyone surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. 'There wasn't a nasty challenge in the game yet we've had five yellow cards and a sending off. I never saw that coming. 'The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we're going to go down the route of every other league - jumping around and whinging and trying to get people yellow and red cards - for me that's not right.' Foxes manager Nigel Pearson strongly disagreed, and when asked for a response to Bruce's statement said: 'How many times have you seen us play this year? 'You're not in a position to judge my players on that. You're asking me and I've told you, ""No, I don't think it's a fair assessment"".

"Financial accounts for QPR show their 'real' losses last season were almost £70million - a figure that still leaves them facing a fine of more than £50m. The Football League's complex Financial Fair Play rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs. A tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend. Earlier this month QPR announced they had made a loss of £9.8m but the accounts filed at Companies House now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of the owners, mainly Tony Fernandes, writing off £60m of old loans in an 'exceptional item' in the accounts. QPR owner Tony Fernandes was among those to write off £60million of old loans to the London club . QPR's players get put through their paces in training ahead of Saturday's game against Crystal Palace . Q: Queens Park Rangers accounts for 2013-14 have now been filed in detail at Companies House. What do they show? A: They show that the club’s ‘true’ losses for last season were £69.8m, instead of the £9.8m declared by the club earlier this month. They used an accounting method, an ‘exceptional item’, to count a £60m write-off of loans to the owners as effective income. Their real income was £38.7m. Q: Why does this matter? A: Because if clubs lose lots of money in the Championship, where QPR played last season, they face potential ‘Financial Fair Play’ fines from the Football League. The FFP rules are in place to stop clubs ‘financial doping’ and stop them spending themselves to bankruptcy. To simplify: clubs that massively overspend, and lose lots of money as a result, face fans which grow in relation to the overspending. Q: How much fine do QPR face? A: If they’d really lost only £9.8m last season, the fine would have been tiny, perhaps not even a million pounds. But if the real loss is £69.8m, the fine could be as high as £58m, and is likely to be at least £50m. That would be the biggest fine on any club for any reason in global football history. Q: Who will decide? A: Lawyers, probably. The parties are locked in talks about what happens next. Q: What do QPR say? A: No comment. Effectively, QPR counted that £60m write-off as extra income. But that money is noted in the accounts as being a 'related-party transaction' - and the Football League's own FFP rules explicitly rule out that related party moves of the kind QPR have undertaken. The League rule out such moves in order to prevent 'artificially' lowered losses. A QPR spokesman told Sportsmail: 'We have no comment.' A Football League spokesman reiterated an earlier League statement that the League remains in talks with QPR about the situation, but won't add details. If the League ultimately rule that QPR's 'real' losses are £69.8m, then the FFP fine they potentially face will be £57.9m. QPR will legitimately be able to write off some of that £69.8m as acceptable losses - for youth investment, and some bonuses, for example - but realistically they are looking at a fine of £50m-plus. Yet QPR are locked in legal arguments questioning whether the League have the right to levy any fine at all, and if they do, at what levels. QPR posted losses of £65.4m in the 2012-13 season and it was expected these might fall after cost-cutting in the Championship. But the new accounts show in fact that as QPR's income plunged from £60.6m in 2012-13 to £38.7m in 2013-14, there was no significant reduction in the biggest single outgoing - player wages. The wage bill was £78m in the 2012-13 season and £75.4m in 2013-14 in the Championship. Quite how this now plays out remains to be seen: lawyers are likely to remain occupied for weeks if not months or years on both sides. Junior Hoilett (centre) has an effort on goal as QPR prepare for a relegation clash at Selhurst Park . Striker Charlie Austin is in discussions over a new £60,000-a-week deal at Loftus Road . QPR could refuse to pay a Football League fine if Chris Ramsey keeps the club in the Premier League . If QPR avoid relegation from the Premier League this season, they can continue to refuse to pay any fine levied and the Football League will not be able to force them to pay while they remain in the Premier League - and outside Football League jurisdiction. The worst-case scenario for QPR is relegation to the Football League while continuing to refuse to pay a fine to the League, who have already said QPR would not be allowed back into the Championship if there was an outstanding fine unpaid. In other words, if QPR don't pay what the League ultimately demand and go down, they face the nightmare prospect of a drop to non-league football. Their lawyers are believed to be considering all options to prevent this.","QPR announced a loss of £9.8million up to May 2014 earlier this month .
Their 'real' loss was almost £70m after £60m of  loans were written off .
The London club could face a Football League fine of more than £50m .

"The message, as Neil Jenkins relaxed at his al fresco media conference overlooking Rome’s Central Park, was that Wales have not even thought about the maths. The Wales assistant coach insisted his squad are not interested in points- difference — just winning a Test match against Italy. They have piped a respectful tune towards today’s opponents but there is a title on the line and head coach Warren Gatland knows that his side must go for the juggernaut victory at the Stadio Olimpico. The Kiwi needs his back line to go full throttle and take every point they can to close the gap on England and Ireland. Wales were heaped with praise for their defensive display last week but — with the wingers in danger of not scoring a try all tournament for the first time since 1995 — wing Liam Williams is ready to shift the focus towards attack. Liam Williams insists Wales will pile on the points against Italy in Rome . Neil Jenkins says the first objective is to win the game . ‘We know a lot of things need to happen,’ said Williams. ‘We are on first so we’ll go out, do the business and then sit back and watch the other matches. It would be nice for one of us wingers to get on the scoresheet, but it isn’t about me or George North getting across the line. The only thing that matters is getting the job done.’ Williams and North both scored during last year’s 51-3 rout of Scotland on the final day of the competition. A similar scoreline in Rome would make Gatland’s side big favourites for the title although they would have to wait for their reward as the new trophy is already at Twickenham and its replica in Edinburgh. For Williams, it is a chance to silence his critics once and for all. The 23-year-old Scarlet, formerly a blast-furnace worker, was targeted on social media during last year’s tour of South Africa. His shoulder charge gave the Springboks a decisive penalty try and he was then sent off in his first club game of the season. Williams was ordered to improve his discipline and has subsequently conceded one penalty in six Tests, compared to 13 in his first 16. ‘I had to learn the hard way,’ he said. ‘Some didn’t want me to be picked in a red shirt again. I had quite a lot of stick, but it goes in one ear and out the other. On Twitter, I just blocked people who were having a go. It was rubbish, really. You don’t need it. Warren Gatland will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the Italians . Wales, pictured this week in training, have travelled to Rome knowing a win could secure Six Nations glory . ‘I hope they’re happy that I’ve started four out of five games in this Six Nations. I’ve worked on my discipline and it’s going well. I’m trying to handle situations differently — do what I have to do and then get out, instead of getting involved in stupid things. Keep my body in the oven and my head in the freezer.’ Sharing his surname with famous predecessors — JPR, Shane and Martyn to name three — Williams will now hope to match their big-game temperament. He will look to the forwards to provide a platform for victory — although the front-row casualty list is a worry — but it is up to the back line to deliver a title-winning scoreline. The absence of Sergio Parisse is a huge boost for Wales. The Italy captain has a foot injury and the odds of Wales winning the title shifted when his omission was confirmed. Mike Phillips passes the ball during an open session in Cardiff on Tuesday . Sam Warburton (left) and George North (right) lead the celebrations after beating Ireland last week . But, sticking to message, Jenkins talked up the quality of his cover. ‘He caused us a lot of problems last year,’ he said. ‘He is a fantastic player, a world-class No 8, and if he’s not playing they are going to miss him. But they have good players in their back row. Sergio didn’t play two years ago but they were pretty strong.’ Parisse’s absence should temper Italy’s gung-ho approach while the captaincy has been handed to hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini. Wales centre Jonathan Davies said this week that Ireland should ‘fear the wounded animal’ of Scotland, but Italy are also limping after losing to France so Wales must also be on their guard. ‘We’ve got more than one point to prove,’ said Ghiraldini. ‘Everything starts from our first phase and our scrum has to be at its best. We have guys like Martin Castrogiovanni, Michele Rizzo and Mauro Bergamasco with good experience. Sergio is a big loss — he could play in every national team in the world — but we have to keep believing.’","Wales are one of three teams in with a chance of winning the Six Nations .

"Liverpool host rivals Manchester United on Sunday as both teams look to take another step towards securing a place in next season's Champions League. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at three of the key battles which could decide the game at Anfield. MARTIN SKRTEL v MAROUANE FELLAINI . The 6ft 4in Fellaini has given Manchester United a new dimension in recent weeks and has looked a better strike partner for Wayne Rooney than either Radamel Falcao or Robin van Persie. But if you needed the perfect warrior centre-half to combat Fellaini, Martin Skrtel would be high on your list. The shaven-headed stopper is fearless and as hard as nails. He knocked himself out making a challenge in an FA Cup tie against Blackburn earlier this month. Martin Skrtel (left) will need to deal with Marouane Fellaini's (right) height and physical presence on Sunday . JORDAN HENDERSON vs MICHAEL CARRICK . Different type of midfield players but whoever gets the upper hand could have a decisive influence on the result. Henderson is all about energy and mobility and scored the winner at Swansea City on Monday night. Carrick’s range of passing is outstanding, he gets the other United players on the ball at the right time. Both are vice-captains of their club and rivals in Roy Hodgson’s England squad too. Jordan Henderson (left) and Michael Carrick both play in the centre of midfield but they have different styles . DANIEL STURRIDGE vs PHIL JONES . Both players were tipped at one time to be the future of English football and are on the way back after injury. If Sturridge’s stealth and trickery win out, Liverpool will fancy their chances. But Jones is strong and will try to outmuscle the striker. Both have been named by England in the squad to face Lithuania and Italy and will be keen to show they are back to their best. Daniel Sturridge (left) will be looking to bamboozle Phil Jones (right) with his pace and trickery at Anfield .","Liverpool host rivals Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday .

"As he knelt next to the goal clutching his slit throat, while blood pulsed out like a fountain and pooled around him, all Clint Malarchuk could think of was to get off live TV so that his mum did not have to watch him die. The footage remains on YouTube of the extraordinary incident precisely 26 years ago on Sunday when the then 27-year-old ice hockey goaltender suffered one of the most gruesome injuries ever seen in professional sport. His throat cut by a stray skate, he survived thanks to his team’s trainer reaching into his neck to pinch shut the severed artery that would later need 300 stitches. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Clint Malarchuk's throat was cut by a stray skate during an NHL game and required 300 stitches . But the traumatic accident led to a spiral of nightmares, insomnia, chronic depression and alcoholism. Twice he tried to kill himself, with the bullet from one attempt still lodged next to his right eye, and only now feels he can cope with his demons thanks to the love of his fourth wife. Malarchuk was playing for Buffalo Sabres in the NHL against St Louis Blues, when the freak accident left him fighting for his life. Amid shocking, gory scenes, Malarchuk tried and failed to get to his feet, as three pints of blood spilled on to the ice. ‘Once I realised this could be death, my first thought was “get off the ice, go through the gate, get off camera”,’ Malarchuk told The Mail on Sunday. ‘So my mum didn’t have to watch me die.’ Malarchuk’s mother, Jean, both of whose own parents were English, always watched her son’s matches live on TV. Malarchuk’s traumatic accident led to a spiral of nightmares, insomnia, chronic depression and alcoholism . NIKI LAUDA: Came close to death after his Ferrari burst into flames at the 1976 German Grand Prix. Suffered massive injuries but won F1 titles later. ALEX ZANARDI: Lost both legs in a CART crash in 2001 but returned two years later to race in the World Touring Car Championship for BMW. He also went on to win two golds and a silver in handcycling at the Paralympics in London. DAVID BUSST: Coventry defender's double leg fracture against Man Utd in 1996 involved the fibula piercing the skin. Considered English football’s worst leg break. DANIEL ALBRECHT: Swiss skier sustained serious brain and lung injuries after horrific wipeout at Kitzbuhel, Austria in 2009. Returned to action nearly two years later. FABRICE MUAMBA: Suffered cardiac arrest playing for Bolton against Tottenham in March 2012. His heart stopped for 78 minutes but he recovered. Amazingly Malarchuk was back playing within 10 days, resumed his career as a player and then became a coach. But three years later, in 1992, trying to obliterate his demons, he drank a bottle of whisky and took pills that led to his heart stopping. His OCD and depression were finally diagnosed. ‘It was the first time the chaos in my head was given a label,’ he says. At another low, in 2008, drunk and sitting in his barn, he put a gun to his chin, pointed upwards and pulled the trigger. The bullet richocheted off his molars, took out some teeth and a piece of his tongue, went through his top palate and sinus. His wife Joanie then insisted he undertake the longest and most intense rehab of his life, six months. ‘She is an incredible woman, she saved my life,’ said Malarchuk from their home in Nevada, where he has written a searingly honest auto-biography. ‘I thought at first it might be a kinda hockey book. But the reaction we’ve had has touched people. It’s a book about life.’ It transcends sport, detailing the brutality of depression. ‘It’s everywhere, not exclusive to any occupation, any economic status,’ said Malarchuk. ‘But there is still a stigma around it in sport, where there is constant expectation upon you. I was mentally ill. But I thought I was mentally weak.’ Malarchuk’s story is far from all doom and gloom. He recalls being drafted to the NHL at 20 in 1981, on a salary equivalent to £150,000 a year. The Quebec Nordiques clubhouse had a smoking room and beer fridge. He describes a catalogue of japes, including the time that he and a team-mate, both rodeo men, hired horses and charged them up and down a golf course as colleagues tried to play. Malarchuk was required to give two press conferences the day after the accident . He recounts the occasion at the Washington Capitals when he met the US President, Ronald Reagan. ‘I wasn’t interested in politics, I talked to him about movies,’ said Malarchuk. He asked Reagan about Barbara Stanwyck, one of the great pin-ups of Reagan’s acting era. ‘Between you and me, Mr President, you ever take a run at that?’ Malarchuk asked. Reagan replied: ‘No, but I sure would have liked to.’ Then he shook Malarchuk’s hand and moved on. In early March 1989, Malarchuk moved on, traded from the Capitals to the Sabres at short notice. He packed his stuff in his truck, made a seven-hour drive to his new team, kept a clean sheet in his first game and helped his side to three wins and a draw in his first five. He was an instant hit. Then came the game that has defined his life. The hospital where his life was saved was mobbed by media, some of whom pretended to be staff or relatives to get to Malarchuk, who was required to give two press conferences the day after the accident. He broke down during the second. The hospital could not cope with the ‘circus’ and he was discharged on day two. Astonishingly, he was played as a substitute within 10 days. Malarchuk's remarkable story is far from all doom and gloom . ‘If I had to go through it again, I think I’d want to come back as quickly as did first time,’ he said. ‘But I shouldn’t. Weakness through the blood loss was an issue. Today you’d also have a counsellor explaining the psychological impact of the trauma who’d be telling you there’s no need to get back quickly. And I would follow their instructions.’ Instead it was 19 years later in the rehab that followed the gun incident, that Malarchuk came to terms with what he now knows was the post-traumatic stress disorder that exacerbated his problems. Back then, he got on with his job, which included taunts from rival fans, including throat-slashing gestures from Boston Bruins supporters ‘reminding me to die’. One particularly powerful part of his book takes you deep inside his mind at that time. It might also be the mind of any elite sportsmen, tackling pressure and dark hidden thoughts, obsessed with not failing. ‘I knew I was struggling, but I was too stubborn, maybe too afraid, to ask for help,’ he writes. ‘I was trained to cowboy up. If you get bucked off the horse, you get back on.’ Now, he says, he can acknowledge his problems and ask for help. ‘What’s different is I know what tools I can use to try to handle the issue,’ he said. His book concludes: ‘I nearly bled out in front of thousands. This is about sharing the rest of me, because I know there’s a reason I’m still breathing. ‘I have PTSD and OCD, depression and alcoholism. I still have meds to take and wounds to heal. I still have a long, tough ride, but I’m tightening my grip and holding on — because this life is a crazy game and I’m determined to win it.’","Clint Malarchuk's throat was cut by a stray skate during NHL game .

"Five men involved in incidents on the Paris Metro ahead of a Chelsea match have been served with summonses, police have said. The men will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders', Scotland Yard said. Controversy erupted last month when Chelsea fans were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let a black man on a train ahead of the Champions League clash against Paris St Germain. Souleymane S, a black man, was prevented getting on a train by Chelsea fans in Paris in February . Fans appeared to be chanting: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' Footage captured by a bystander before Chelsea drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-Germain appeared to show a man being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. The commuter, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane, said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart'. He said: 'We're in 2015, aren't we, and we're in France. We're in a civilised country and when you are in a civilised country there are certain things you can't do. 'For me, it's a humiliation. I was humiliated in my country. I was humiliated in front of my family, humiliated in front of my mother and father.' In light of the incident, Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to establish whether police could make an application for football banning orders. Chelsea FC said previously it was 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved.

"Rory McIlroy fired three successive bogeys late in his third round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational here at Bay Hill on Saturday to ruin a charge through the field. World No 1 McIlroy had closed to within one of the lead when he dropped shots at the 14th, 15th and 16th to finish the day seven adrift of tournament pace-setter Henrik Stenson. McIlroy said afterwards he still hoped to push himself into contention with a fast start on Sunday but admitted victory in his final tune-up before the US Masters was now unlikely. Rory McIlroy plays out of a bunker on the 11th hole during the third round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . The world No 1, pictured playing his approach to the green on the sixth, carded a one-under-par 71 . McIlroy is seven shots behind leader Henrik Stenson after bogeying three holes in a row on the back nine . 'Everything was going really well for 13 holes,' McIlroy said, 'and I got myself right into the tournament. Then I had a messy three holes. It would have been nice to have been a little bit closer to the lead.' McIlroy was not too dismayed by his late hiccup. He has worn the air this week of a man intent on saving his best for the Masters, which starts at Augusta in less than three weeks. So McIlroy chatted a little about Ireland's win in the Six Nations and opened his eyes wide when he heard how close England had come to getting the final try they needed. He will try to close the gap to Stenson and then spend the next fortnight honing his game in private. Henrik Stenson sits on top of the leaderboard after a second consecutive round of 66 on Saturday . Stenson, pictured after hit his drive on the eighth hole, has a two-shot advantage heading into the final round . Everything is about the build-up to Augusta where McIlroy will attempt to join a select group of the greats of the game by winning the only Major that has eluded him. Victory would lift him into the company of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods who all won the Masters, the US Open, The Open and the USPGA at least once in their careers. 'I have pretty much got what I wanted out of the week so far,' McIlroy said. 'It has highlighted a couple of things I need to work on and that's what I will do in the next couple of weeks.' McIlroy, pictured lining up a putt on the 10th green, will prepare for the Masters in the coming weeks . The 25-year-old is looking to complete a career Grand Slam with victory at Augusta next month . One of the reasons McIlroy played Bay Hill was because he wanted to replicate his routine from 2011 when he had a fortnight off before the Masters and led the field before collapsing on the back nine. 'It worked pretty well at Augusta, at least for 63 holes,' he said. McIlroy dined with Palmer, 85, on Thursday night, soaking up his wisdom and listening to tales of the way golf used to be. At the start of next month, he will be seeking to make some history of his own.","Rory McIlroy shot a one-under-par round of 71 on Saturday in Orlando .

"Louis van Gaal has been here before with the press questioning him, his players seemingly confused by his philosophy and the public bemused as the season tailspins into mediocrity. The only difference on the previous occasion was that Van Gaal tired of the challenge and gave up. It was 2008 and he was at AZ Alkmaar, an admittedly different proposition to Manchester United. But the ingredients were similar. The club was under-achieving, languishing in 11th place when they had been expected to challenge at the top of the table. And it seemed as if the players could not grasp what he was demanding from them. So Van Gaal walked out. He resigned from Alkmaar in March 2008. Louis van Gaal, pictured in training on Friday, takes Manchester United to face Liverpool at Anfield . Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring United's final goal in their 3-0 win against Tottenham last weekend . Van Gaal, pictured in 2007, resigned as manager of AZ Alkmaar only to return to the club and win the title . But then something remarkable occurred in the form of a players' mutiny. The team rebelled against Van Gaal's own decision to walk out leave them and demanded him back. Led by captain Stijn Schaars, central defender and vice-captain Kew Jaliens, midfielder David Mendes and Australian goalkeeper Joey Didulica the team leaders asked for a crisis meeting with the directors and the owner of the club. 'We felt insulted when the club told us Van Gaal was leaving,' said Kew Jaliens. 'The entire squad, felt that Van Gaal is the right man and the only man who could take this club and our squad to a higher level.' As United travel to Liverpool on Sunday with Champions League qualification hanging in the balance, the question is whether United's players and directors would do the same for Van Gaal today. Of course, thing aren't quite as bad as they were at AZ. After all, three defeats in 24 games would be satisfactory for most clubs. And last week's 3-0 win against Tottenham was a possibly the first sign that a new successful United team could emerge in the post-Ferguson era. Stijn Schaars, pictured during his days as an AZ Alkmaar player, did not want Van Gaal to leave the club . Antonio Valencia, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao (left to right) train ahead of their trip to Anfield . Indeed before Sunday's game at Anfield, Van Gaal was confident enough to talking about extending his time at Old Trafford beyond his current three-year deal. 'This will be my last job but there could be five years to go yet,' he said. 'I can extend my contract. You never know. I'm in a situation where I signed for three years because you can build something up in that time and the club agreed with that. I don't know how I would react in the circumstances when Manchester United ask me to extend, and if I should do that.' Perhaps their 3-0 win over Tottenham last weekend could be viewed as the United players own vote of confidence in their manager. Wayne Rooney later revealed that he had spoken to the team the night before and certainly it seemed as though they might have finally 'got' the elusive Van Gaal philosophy. And not before time: Sunday's clash with Liverpool could be defining for judging Van Gaal's first season a success or failure. Put baldy, finish fourth and Van Gaal can be broadly satisfied; finish fifth and he can expect to be questioned as to whether he is still among the top coaches in the world. It is crude and unsatisfactory measure of his first season – a point here or there might make the difference between fourth of fifth. Van Gaal has revealed the United job will be his last but he could extend his contract at Old Trafford . But Van Gaal needs to demonstrate that United are making progress and qualification for the Champions League is the only tangible way to do so. Last Sunday's victory was welcome, but was notable for being one of the few outstanding performances this season. The defeats at Swansea and to Arsenal in the FA Cup are still fresh in the mind. At times United's players seem to be inhibited by Van Gaal. Some at United believe he has been in danger of losing credibility among the players at times when he spoke about his 'philosophy', given the amount of times he has changed his formation. In addition, the players have seemed 'strangled' by Van Gaal at times, said one United source. His sheer intensity seems to overwhelm them. At Bayern Munich they would relate to that. They remember him there as coach brought back discipline to the squad and who introduced fresh intensity and a crisper, sharper passing game, a tactical prerequisite for a modern elite Champions League club. The Bayern players found their standards had to rise considerably to meet Van Gaal's expectations of passing accuracy and the foundations he laid have helped build the success of the club since he left. The Bayern Munich players felt they had to raise their standards considerably while Van Gaal was at the helm . But his discipline eventually was perceived as eccentric and bizarre, according to some at Bayern. The self-confidence, which helped underpin the team as they won the German League and Cup double in the first season and reached the Champions League final, became a liability as he sought to control more and more areas of the club. They still talk with wide-eyed astonishment about the day he dropped his trousers in team talk to demonstrate that he had the 'balls' to drop any of the star players. And they still raise their eyebrows at the manner in which Van Gaal organised meal times after training. Lunch time was a communal affair. And at Bayern, the whole team had to be assembled in matching kit before Van Gaal would give the signal for the meal to start. He once refused to allow the highly-respected club doctor, Hans Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who was then in his 60s, to join in lunch until he had gone back to change his socks. Mueller-Wohlfahrt was in his white club socks and the stipulated dress code was red socks. His obsession with order carries over on the pitch and his greatest strength for some and his biggest weakness for others. Johan Cruyff, his great football adversary, is one of those unimpressed with his need to control. Johan Cruyff says Van Gaal is a very good organiser but that's not the way he likes to do things . 'The difference is that he always organises a lot of things for people,' said Cruyff. 'I always use the basic quality of people to achieve what I want to achieve. That's a different way of thinking. I always love that they do things. And when it goes wrong, well, try to correct it in one way or another. His way is more as a very good organiser. That's the way he is' Of course, when he gets it right and a club or a group of players buy into what he has to offer, Van Gaal can be phenomenally successful as his time, at Ajax and his early days at Barcelona and Bayern demonstrate. And, of course, at AZ Alkmaar. That famous meeting, when the players begged him to stay at the Dutch club was a heated and emotional affair in which Van Gaal demanded the fill support and commitment of the players if he were to stay. The players agreed. The following season they won the Dutch league, the first time for 27 years that it had been won by a team other than PSV Eindhoven, Ajax or Feyenoord. If he can do the same for United next season, his genius will be confirmed. If they lose on Sunday and the club's trajectory doesn't change, he won't need to worry about what to do when he sitting down with the Glazers to extend his contract.

"Daley Blind's only previous visit to Anfield came as a wide-eyed 10-year-old when his footballing father Danny secured tickets for a game against Arsenal from Jari Litmanen, a former team-mate who had signed for Liverpool. Among the players on view were Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen and Thierry Henry. 'It left a great impression on me,' said Blind. 'As a young boy from Holland who loved football, I just took everything in. The crowd noise and atmosphere were crazy. It was a special day.' At lunchtime on Sunday, Blind will return to Anfield for the first time with his new Manchester United team-mates. This year's clash carries even greater significance than usual with a Champions League place at stake and for Blind it carries on the family tradition of being involved in big matches. Daley Blind (right) will play at Anfield for the first time with Manchester United on Sunday afternoon . Blind is enjoying his time in Manchester but admits he had to adapt to the pace of the Premier League . The 25-year-old scores his first goal for United to salvage a 2-2 draw against West Brom in October last year . His father played 42 times for Holland and was captain of Ajax's legendary 1995 Champions League-winning side alongside Patrick Kluivert, Edgar Davids and Edwin van der Sar. It was a first major triumph for an emerging manager called Louis van Gaal who clearly likes the Blind family. Almost two decades later, he selected Daley for Holland's World Cup team last summer and then signed him for Manchester United in a £14million deal from Ajax. It has been an eventful debut in the Premier League for both of them. Manchester United's results have been far better than last season when they finished seventh under David Moyes. They visit Anfield having lost just twice in 19 league games. At the same time, their performances until last weekend's 3-0 victory against Spurs had been patchy with new signings like Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao struggling. Blind has been a steadying influence, his versatility useful as Van Gaal has tried to juggle injuries and suspensions. The 25-year-old has been used mostly as a holding midfielder but with Michael Carrick returning last weekend, he switched to left back as United turned in their best performance of the season. Blind says his manager is essentially the same person in England as when he took Holland to the World Cup semi-final. Blind talks with his dad, Holland coach Danny, during a training session at last summer's World Cup in Brazil . The Holland international believes he is similar to his dad when out on the football pitch . Blind, pictured alongside Radamel Falcao, was one of a number of summer signings made by Louis van Gaal . Blind screams with delight after curling the ball into the bottom corner of Boaz Myhill's net at the Hawthorns . 'People only think he's intimidating because he is honest. He is honest to people,' explained Blind. 'Yeah, sometimes the truth can be hard to some players or people. But I really like that in a person and especially in a manager. 'Every player knows their job, what they have to do in training and matches. It is very clear and I think that makes everything a bit easier for players. As a team we believe in his philosophy. 'It is a good feeling for a player if you know where you stand. Sometimes it can be a bit frightening when somebody is really honest but I think it is positive. I don't get any special treatment, definitely not. I make mistakes, too, and I try to learn when he says something. It can look as if he is angry but he is trying to make you better. He does that from a football perspective, it's not personal. He treats everybody the same.' In keeping with United's season, Blind has experienced highs and lows. A knee injury that kept him out for six weeks in the autumn was frustrating. When fit, he has weighed in with important goals at West Brom and West Ham and last week was vital in the Spurs win, with Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo unavailable. It was seen as a return to the old, swashbuckling United. Blind doesn't think it's that simple. He believes United didn't change their approach much, the major difference was getting two early goals. United boss Louis van Gaal has tried to implement his own philosophy at Old Trafford this season . Louis van Gaal is pictured with Danny Blind and Ajax chairman Michael van Praag back in 1994 . Blind, pictured in action against Tottenham, has proved his versatility under Van Gaal this season . Danny Blind leads his son out during his Ajax days (left) and lifts the Champions League trophy in 1995 . The Dutchman looks dejected alongside Wayne Rooney and Tyler Blackett during defeat by Leicester . 'Everything came together. We tried to play attacking football. But there were still moments we used David de Gea to switch play or had to show patience. But of course when you are leading 3-0 at half time it is a lot easier because the fans are excited. I think we have played better and better in recent weeks, against Spurs maybe we did it for longer.' The cries of 'attack, attack' heard from United fans this season are meant to lift the players. But Blind says the team have to use their heads in matches, too. 'Of course, you go on the pitch feeling you want to win. Every game is difficult in the Premier League, you have to be also smart in the games. 'Sometimes you need to have composure. Against Tottenham, we attacked them in the first half. Then in the second half, we let them come at us a bit more and played from there. I think we can play different styles.' That adaptability is one of the reasons Van Gaal signed Blind rather than any other member of his Dutch World Cup squad. He has proved invaluable in a season where United have suffered an unprecedented number of injuries and said: 'I think I am a player who can switch really fast in my mind. For me, it is not an issue where to play. I know what you have to do in each position. I think it is an advantage for me.' Blind has been particularly impressed with Manchester United's travelling support since joining the club . Blind (back row, second from right) left Ajax for Old Trafford in a £14million deal late last summer . The former Ajax man was a key part of Van Gaal's squad as Holland reached the World Cup semi-finals . Danny Blind and his son pose in front of Christ the Redeemer in Rio during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Van Gaal described Daley's father as the best leader he's ever had — some claim when he has managed at Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Daley says he has inherited characteristics from both parents. 'I think on the pitch I am more like my dad. Calm and thinking about stuff. Off the pitch with my friends, I am more like my mum. She says things straight away, very direct. I can speak sometimes without thinking. 'I was five when my dad won the Champions League. I can't remember watching it live on the television but, growing up, I saw all the videos and dreamed it might be me one day. I am proud of his achievements and proud to carry the name Blind. 'I guess I must have seen Louis van Gaal as a boy when I'd go to watch my father train but I can't remember anything specific. I first got to know him with the Dutch team. 'When Louis van Gaal tells me things, I think it might be the same advice he used to give my father!' Daley and Danny also work together with their national team where Danny is a coach and tipped to be manager. 'Sometimes I prefer to speak to the other trainers,' laughs the younger Blind. 'If he's close by, I might whisper ""Dad"". The other players think it's funny, they accept it.' Danny is also a regular visitor to watch his son play at Old Trafford but won't be at Anfield on Sunday afternoon. Blind netted another late equaliser for Manchester United in their 1-1 draw at West Ham in February . Marouane Fellaini celebrates with his team-mate Blind after his crucial strike at Upton Park . Blind only knew compatriot Robin van Persie and Andreas Pereira before he joined United last summer . Off the field, Daley has settled in well and chosen to live in a city-centre apartment rather than a sprawling footballers' wives pad in Cheshire. 'I like people around me and everything within walking distance,' he says. 'Occasionally people want to take a picture on the street but that's not a problem. I liked Amsterdam and I like Manchester, they suit me.' It also gives Blind peace of mind that his girlfriend is in a safe environment when he is away with the United squad. For someone who knew only two of United's players when he arrived — national team-mate Robin van Persie and youngster Andreas Pereira, who started his career in Holland — Blind has acclimatised well. One of his social objectives is to try to find time to restart golf lessons. He has been in England nearly eight months now. 'The best thing for me is the amount of away fans that follow United. The stands are always full, it was a big surprise when I first saw that,' he said. 'On the pitch, the pace and power of matches was new for me, box-to-box. My first game at home to QPR wasn't the quickest but I still felt more tired than after any Ajax match. When we played at Manchester City and had a red card (Chris Smalling), wow, the intensity but I think I coped well.' If a problem does arise, his manager is an important safety net. 'He is personal, any player can always reach him if they want to,' he says. And the result when Blind visited Anfield just over 14 years ago? Liverpool lost 2-1. A repeat on Sunday would leave United with one foot firmly in the Champions League. Like father, like son.","Daley Blind and Manchester United take on Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday .

"A revitalised Marouane Fellaini owes his eventful Premier League career to a stand-out performance at Anfield – the ground he returns to on Sunday carrying the Champions League hopes of Manchester United on his broad shoulders. Fellaini was a 20-year-old with Standard Liege when his outstanding display against Steven Gerrard in a 2008 Champions League qualifier persuaded Everton to buy him 19 days later for a club record £15million. He became a cult hero at Goodison Park for the next five years before signing for Manchester United in 2013. Now in his second season at Old Trafford and used mainly as a striker by Louis van Gaal, he is in the best form of his United career and scored and made an assist in last weekend's 3-0 victory against Tottenham. Marouane Fellaini fired Manchester United into the lead against Tottenham with a smart finish .

'Marouane had been on Everton's radar for a while. His ability to play in different positions was attractive because the club didn't have the money to pay big fees on several players,' explains Round. 'David asked me to go and watch him play Liverpool at Anfield and he was very impressive. A lot of players would have been dominated in midfield by someone like Steven Gerrard in his own stadium but Marouane competed and gave as good as he got. He wasn't overawed and you could see he had ability. 'When David asked my opinion, it was positive and the club signed him in what was a big deal for them given their finances at the time.' Former Everton assistant Steve Round watched Fellaini play against Liverpool for former club Standard Liege . Round gave the midfielder a glowing reference to David Moyes who sanctioned a £15m deal to sign him . Fellaini became one of the most instantly-recognisable figures in the English game with his huge hair making him appear even bigger than his 6ft4ins frame. He became a fearsome threat in the air though opponents often felt he was too aggressive with his elbows and it has to be pointed out the Belgian has received 56 yellow cards and two reds since he moved to England. Having worked closely with Fellaini, Round says there is far more to his game than the 27-year-old is given credit for. 'He is technically very good, he may not have the same range of passing as Gerrard but he rarely gives the ball away. And his chest control is as good as anyone I've seen in the game. He can play three positions well; holding midfield, number 10 or up top, where we used him with Tim Cahill in the season we reached the FA Cup final. I think he is best in a more advanced position where he has more freedom and not as much defensive responsibilities. Round (left) was assistant to Moyes at Everton and then Manchester United . Fellaini became a cult hero at Goodison Park, where he spent five seasons . 'Marouane can hold the ball up and bring others into play and I can see why Wayne Rooney enjoyed playing with him, in a similar way that Michael Owen benefitted from Emile Heskey's physical presence for England.' A protracted transfer from Everton to United was finally completed in the summer of 2013 for £27million after Moyes and Round had been appointed at Old Trafford to begin the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. 'I remember Ryan Giggs warning us that Manchester United can take some getting used to for new signings. He sited the example of Patrice Evra who turned out to be a great player for the club. Ryan said he was taken off after 45 minutes of his debut against Manchester City because it was such a culture shock. 'Marouane is a humorous guy, always able to take fun out of himself. I like him. But I guess being the only signing of that transfer window brought its own pressure and looking back maybe he was a bit quieter at the beginning than he was at Everton. But that's also natural when you are joining a new club with players who have been successful.' Fellaini followed Moyes to Manchester United, but was considered a figure of fun after the disappointing season under the former Everton boss . Fellaini starred in the 3-0 win over Liverpool at Old Trafford in December, and offers Van Gaal an alternative . After a nightmare first season in which United finisehd seventh, Moyes was sacked and Round left too. Fellaini stayed but was regarded at that time as a figure of fun. Round is not surprised he has been able to turn his fortunes around. 'I always thought he would show people what he could do at United. It's like Ryan said, it can take a few months for a new signing to be comfortable. He has always worked hard in training, he doesn't hide when things aren't going well. That has helped him. 'It's hard to say what will happen at United next. The pressure is always on to win matches and you don't know what the manager will do in the summer. But Marouane has shown this season he is an asset to Manchester United.' And at lunchtime on Sunday, he will hope to show that at Anfield, the ground where it all started for him. The only thing he'd like to change is the result – seven years ago, Liverpool edged Liege 1-0 with an injury-time winner from Dirk Kuyt.","Marouane Fellaini joined Everton from Standard Liege in 2008 for £15m .

"Francis Coquelin has emerged as one of Arsenal's standout performers this season, since returning from a loan-spell at Championship side Charlton Athletic in December. The 23-year-old Frenchman had been on the peripheries for some time and was loaned to the Addicks in order to gain first-team football; but following injuries to the likes of Jack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta, he was recalled to north London after just five games. Now, granted the chance to fill Arsenal's void between defence and midfield, Coquelin has not looked back and is thriving in his role as the Gunners' enforcer. Francis Coquelin skips past QPR midfielder Sandro (right) during Arsenal's 2-1 win at Loftus Road .

The manager gave it to me and I can show for the first time what I'm capable of. 'It's not to be big-headed, but I've always had confidence in myself.' Arsenal's next game is against Manchester United in the FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford on Monday. The Gunners lifted the trophy last year after defeating Hull City in the final, but know they will have to be at their best to repeat the feat this term. And Coquelin insists that Arsenal have plenty left to play for this season, challenging for the Cup, while also attempting to finish in the Premier League's top four and overturning a 3-1 defect in Europe against Monaco. He said, 'We've got a lot to fight for. We've got a big game in the Champions League and we need to try and turn that one around. Everything is possible in football.'

"Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet is too modest to claim the club’s recent revival is partly due to his own impressive personal comeback after he had been dropped earlier in the season by manager Brendan Rodgers. Nevertheless, the facts show that the resurgent Reds go into Saturday's potential top-four decider against Manchester United at Anfield having been beaten only once in 19 domestic games — a Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea — since Mignolet returned to the side on Boxing Day. Prior to that, they had lost four out of seven in the Premier League and had slipped to 10th place. Simon Mignolet has been in impressive form for Liverpool during their resurgence in the Premier League . The Liverpool goalkeeper was dropped from the side earlier in the season after a number of mistakes . The Belgian first found out he had been axed the day before Liverpool faced United in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford in December when United won 3-0. ‘The gaffer took me into his office to tell me I wouldn’t play against United. It was disappointing and I could have let my head drop, but I decided to be positive to make sure my period on the sidelines was as short as possible,’ said Mignolet. ‘I trained the next day to make sure I’d be ready in a better way when the opportunity arose.’ His wish came true. When in-favour Brad Jones injured his thigh four matches later at Burnley, Mignolet came on, kept a clean sheet and has not looked back since. A 1-0 win at Swansea City on Monday was his sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home — the first time that has happened since the days of Bill Shankly. Mignolet makes a fine save from a Gylfi Sigurdsson strike during the win against Swansea on Monday . The Belgian keeper kept his sixth consecutive Premier League away clean sheet against the Swans . Victory against United would lift Liverpool into the top four and they would then be favourites to join Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in next season’s Champions League. The loss at Old Trafford when Rodgers first introduced a three-man defence and played Raheem Sterling up front now appears to be a watershed in the club’s campaign. ‘I don’t think it’s anything to do with me personally,’ said Mignolet. ‘The gaffer changed the system [to 3-4-3] and since then things have been very organised. We don’t give many chances away and everybody is willing to work for each other. ‘It’s all about working as a unit. We have dealt well with set-pieces and at the other end, scored goals.’ Having been heavily criticised for key mistakes earlier in the season and dubbed ‘Dracula’ by former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar for being indecisive with crosses, Mignolet is not taking recent good publicity for granted, even though he was Liverpool’s man-of-the-match at Swansea following crucial saves from Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis. Mignolet, who was dropped earlier in the season, trains alonside Joe Allen and Lazar Markovic . Liverpool have only lost once in 19 domestic matches since Mignolet returned to the side . ‘As a goalkeeper you’re only remembered for your last game. I know I played half-decent against Swansea but if things turn around against Manchester United on Sunday, no one will mention that,’ he said. ‘I know how it goes and how football is. You have to accept it, but that is also something positive because there’s always something new around the corner. ‘The next game is always the biggest one. That’s what we say.’ After last season’s thrilling challenge for the league title, Rodgers reacted bravely when the first half to this campaign did not go according to plan. Liverpool impressed at Old Trafford in December but fell to a 3-0 loss after a David De Gea masterclass . Emre Can has emerged as a key figure in Liverpool's three-man defence in the past few months . Summer signings Mario Balotelli, Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert were sidelined, while club captain Steven Gerrard was allowed to negotiate a deal to join LA Galaxy this summer. Instead, Sterling was used as a centre-forward until Daniel Sturridge’s recent return from injury as Rodgers returned to last season’s quick-passing style. At the back, midfielder Emre Can was asked to be part of a back-three with Martin Skrtel and the restored Lovren. As results improved, Markovic and Lallana were brought back in and the team remain unbeaten in the Premier League in 2015, having taken 33 points from a possible 39. Liverpool have narrowed the gap on United from 10 points to two. They are rediscovering the art of scoring goals while keeping it tight at the back. The Reds haven't tasted defeat in the Premier League since the outing at Old Trafford . ‘Swansea was an example where we had to grind it out. It was 0-0 at half time and then we came out and put pressure on them high up the field. And we scored out of that [through Jordan Henderson],’ added Mignolet. ‘I think that’s what we are about. The 3-0 defeat away to Manchester United was a while ago and there’s no point in reflecting too much on what has been. Professional footballers have to adapt to any system. It is more to do with the organisation and how everybody does their job rather than the system itself. ‘At the moment, the players are all working really hard. If the gaffer points something out, everybody is ready to listen and make sure it gets done. And it is clicking. ‘There is no point looking over your shoulder [at the past] because what we are thinking about is preparing ourselves the best we can for the Manchester United game.’","Simon Mignolet has been in impressive form for Liverpool in recent weeks .

"It was Billy Connolly who once joked that Ally Macleod thought tactics were a new kind of peppermint. And amusing though that might have been, it expressed a British suspicion that tactics somehow meant over-thinking the game. Some will say the game is all about having good players and that the manager only has so much control. Of course, you can’t legislate for everything that’s going to happen on the pitch. But, when Brendan Rodgers turns around a season by simply deploying players in different areas of the pitch, even the most hardened sceptic ought to be able to see just how important tactics are and that tweaking your system can be a game-changer. Brendan Rodgers addresses his players as they prepare for the Manchester United clash at Anfield . The Liverpool manager was under pressure earlier in the season after a poor start to the campaign . The Liverpool manager was on the back foot in December. His team were conceding goals, they could not score and they didn’t look anything like the side they had been the previous season. People were even suggesting he might be sacked. What a bold and clever move to go to three at back and push the wing-backs on. Ironically, he first did it at Old Trafford in December — and his reward was a 3-0 defeat. But they have not lost in the Premier League and FA Cup since then and even on that day you could see they were on to something. They had six one-on-one opportunities and should not have lost the game. It is a shrewd system. I played it with England when we won Le Tournoi in France in 1997, when I had Paul Merson and Paul Scholes behind Ian Wright and two holding midfield players behind them. Those two in the pocket — the Merson/Scholes pairing in my team or two of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling for Liverpool — have the freedom to get wide, to move in front of wing-backs or to go inside into positions that threaten in the box. Lallana and Coutinho have done it particularly well. That system has turned their results around. Liverpool manager Rodgers talks to midfielder Adam Lallana at training ahead of the visit of United . Rodgers issues instructions to his players before a training session at Melwood on Friday . Glenn Hoddle played three at the back when he was England manager . The shock factor: why Liverpool’s 3-4-3 works... The key is that no one else plays it. I watched the 2-2 draw against Arsenal in December and although Liverpool equalised in the last minute, it was clear that Arsenal didn’t have a clue how to play the system. Liverpool had 63 per cent of the possession. And I doubt that’s ever happened to a team of Arsene Wenger’s playing with 11 men. Liverpool can push the front three up to press the opposition high up the pitch. The wing-backs don’t have to get back and cover as much as a full-back does, so they can be right in behind and the side has five, six or even seven pressing up top. It has restored the energy to Liverpool’s game, enabled them to pin teams back and to dominate possession. Suddenly, they looked like the 2013-14 side. If you need to defend, you can drop deep and have a back five, so the system has flexibility. But Liverpool usually deploy it in a positive fashion and the way in which it uses space to ensure that everyone has an option means it is incredibly hard to play against. Martin Skrtel heads the equaliser in injury time during the 2-2 draw with Arsenal back in December . Arsene Wenger tries to organise his Arsenal side as they relinquished 63 per cent possession to Liverpool . ... but Louis van Gaal’s back three doesn’t work . Louis van Gaal has used a back three several times in his career — in his Ajax team that won the Champions League, at Barcelona and very successfully in the World Cup with Holland. But at Manchester United he hasn’t been able to deploy it with the success that Rodgers has at Liverpool. The key for me is that your back three need to be able to accept the ball and move it even under pressure. Liverpool are prepared to give their defenders the ball under pressure and they’ve been comfortable with that. That’s why Emre Can, initially signed as a midfielder, has been so important. His technique on the ball gives them a safety valve in possession at the back. United, with the likes of Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans, have not succeeded because they are not comfortable in possession under pressure. Therefore the system hasn’t proved to be an attacking springboard and can slow down their game. Rodgers has deployed Emre Can, originally signed as a midfielder, as one of the back three . Louis van Gaal has also used three at the back with United but has not enjoyed success like Rodgers . The likes of Chris Smalling (above) and Jonny Evans are not accomplished enough on the ball . United have hit on a system to match Rodgers . Sunday’s match against Tottenham saw United produce an impressive performance when they looked to be back to where they should be for the first time this season. Admittedly Spurs were poor. After their best results earlier in the season — the 3-0 win over Liverpool, the 2-1 win at Arsenal or the 2-1 win at Southampton — they will have come away thinking: ‘How did we do that? Without David de Gea we would have been struggling!’ But after the Tottenham game, for the first time in a long time, they would have come off knowing that they dominated the game and that they had deserved their victory. That’s why I believe Van Gaal will stick with this format for a while, although it might need a tweak at Anfield. It looks very similar to the Ajax system of the early Nineties. Marouane Fellaini produced a smart finish to open the scoring against Tottenham last weekend . Carrick showed no hesitation in celebrating against his former club after finding the net last Sunday . They played one holding player against Tottenham — and having Michael Carrick back in that role really makes a difference — with Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini as the inside right and left. Juan Mata and Ashley Young played so wide it reminded me of Finidi George and Marc Overmars in Van Gaal’s Ajax days. And I can see Angel Di Maria doing that job as his confidence returns. Mata had to stay wide, which is not his natural game, but that gave space to inside forwards. Spurs could not deal with that and Felliani killed them off. They’ll try to do that against Liverpool’s wingbacks and pin them back. But United must ensure an extra player drops in deep alongside Carrick, especially in that opening 20 minutes. I would not want to get stretched. At the right time you can press with three players in attacking positions through Wayne Rooney, Herrera and Fellaini. But initially I would drop players deep and tell Rooney to save his energy for the times when United have the ball. Ashley Young and Juan Mata played so wide against Tottenham just like Marc Overmars and Finidi George did for Ajax under Van Gaal . But it’s Liverpool who now have the momentum . Liverpool’s win at Swansea on Monday was so important. If they had not won, they would have needed a win on Saturday to stay in touch. Now they can use this game as a springboard to the top four. Win and they’re in the driving seat. They have the momentum at the right time; their confidence is sky high. They are in the FA Cup with a replay at Blackburn to overcome. Suddenly the season looks like it could have the potential to match last year. Certainly a trophy and top-four finish was unthinkable when these teams last met. Not so now, largely thanks to Rodgers’s tactical rethink. On Sunday at the Nou Camp we have the privilege of watching two of the very best when Barca take on Real Madrid and Lionel Messi comes up against Cristiano Ronaldo. But what we saw on Wednesday night against Manchester City has confirmed my opinion that at his very best, Messi is the better player. His feet are so quick and his ability to manipulate the ball at speed is up there with Diego Maradona. What I would say is that, though Messi is better when both are at their best, if they’re in a relatively unsatisfactory run of form, then Cristiano Ronaldo is the better player. In those periods he gives you more than sheer skill. He still contributes in other areas, with his athleticism and strength. But for me, Messi is a better player. Lionel Messi has been in superb form for Barcelona since the turn of the year . Messi put in a man of the match display against Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday . Messi trains on Saturday ahead of Sunday's crunch Clasico against Real Madrid . Cristiano Ronaldo's form has dipped, compared to his own high standards since winning the Ballon d'Or . The greatest? Of the players I’ve seen and played against it’s Maradona. His ability to take players on with the ball seemingly stuck to his feet as he weaved around him was sublime. Only Messi really has come close to that. He was better than Messi at free-kicks. Maradona and Michel Platini and Zico were probably the best at free-kicks and all ahead of Messi in that particular discipline. But people who haven’t seen Maradona play should check out the DVDs and watch him on YouTube. Can you imagine Maradona today, on these pristine pitches, with the lighter, more malleable footballs, protected from the hard men by the much tougher rules of the game and in an era in which man-to-man marking has fallen out of fashion? I would love to see that. My word, what a sight that would be.","Liverpool play Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday in top-four clash .

"Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry is preparing to fight a ban from the roads after blaming his drink driving on a 'rare' metabolism. The 49-year old former Rangers and Blackburn Rovers defender was arrested last month after police stopped him near his home in Lytham, Lancashire in the early hours of February 21. Officers had claimed Hendry who was nicknamed 'Braveheart' when he captain of Scotland was almost twice the limit after failing a breathaylser test. Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry, pictured arriving at Blackpool Magistrates, has admitted drink driving . Hendry goes in for a challenge on Ronaldo at the World Cup in 1998 while John Collins looks on . But on Wednesday, widowed father of four Hendry disputed the reading and asked Blackpool Magistrates to have the case adjourned so his metabolism could be tested. The court heard that Hendry admitted drinking before driving his blue Ford Focus, but argued the amount of alcohol he drank over a certain period of time should not have put him over the limit. His lawyer Glyn Lewis - who has previously represented a string of celebrities over his expertise in exploiting motoring legal loopholes - said: 'Usually we go to sentence and it is inevitable he would have to be disqualified because he has entered a guilty plea because he accepts the facts. 'But the instructions I have over the amount of alcohol consumed and the time period, when you do the calculations they don't correlate with the figure he has given. 'There are two possibilities - one is because of the fact that he has got some alcohol in his system he is unaware of and the other is quite rare is we have somebody whose metabolism is such they provide a specimen of breath which does not correlate with the reading of blood. 'We have had a forensic scientist give us an indication that the figures provided by the defendant don't correlate with the figures given by the sample. He was stopped by police and arrested near his home in Lytham, Lancashire in the early hours of February 21, and was found to be driving his blue Ford Focus while almost double the legal alcohol limit (stock picture) Hendry, pictured hear tackling  Nicolas Anelka in 1997, made more than 300 appearances for Blackburn . 'We accept the prosecution's case - the police followed him, he wasn't driving erratically, nothing unusual about that, he accepts that - the question is why is this alcohol reading being given that is being investigated. 'We can establish what he consumed and when it was because there are receipts. 'Mr Hendry might have to be tested for his metabolism in the lab with a reconstruction of the whole evening's events. The ratio between breath and blood is not the same for everyone. 'If our investigations don't have foundation in science we would bring it back to court and have it dealt with. Mr Hendry wants the matter to be dealt with as quickly as possible.' The court agreed to adjourn for a 'special reasons' hearing  in which Hendry will call evidence from a forensic service scientist and two civilian witnesses who were with him on the night of the incident. Hendry - who arrived for the hearing in sunglasses and a grey suit - had 63 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 milliltres of breath- the legal limit is 35mg. Initial forensic tests conducted on behalf of Hendry had shown the figures did not correlate and further investigation was needed, said Mr Lewis. The 49-year old former Rangers defender has blamed his 'quite rare' metabolism for being over the limit . Hendry playing for Rangers against Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen in October 1998 . The solicitor added that the later sentencing bench could have the option not to disqualify Hendry from driving but the conviction would stand regardless. Hendry, was granted unconditional bail until April 22 when the case will be heard in full before sentencing. The ex-Permier League footballer had a long playing career, captaining his country in the 1998 World Cup and appearing for a series of clubs including Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Bolton Wanderers and Rangers. Last week police confirmed he had been given a warning amid claims he had pestering former girlfriend Sarah Kinder a beautician he had been dating after the death of his wife Denise in 2009 following botched cosmetic surgery. Miss Kinder, 40, claimed he looked in her window and sent her unwanted texts and social media messages after their four-year relationship ended late last year.

"Christian Eriksen's consistently brilliant performances with Tottenham Hotspur this season have attracted the interest of clubs around Europe - but Spurs icon Jurgen Klinsmann hopes the Dane will resist the temptation to move. The 23-year-old has 11 goals for Spurs this season and, alongside breakthrough star Harry Kane, has provided the main attacking threat as Mauricio Pochettino looks to break into the Barclays Premier League top four. And with Europe's elite inevitably sniffing around in the hope of signing Eriksen, former Tottenham striker Klinsmann has expressed his hope that the north London club can hang on to one of their star performers.

'Every player chooses their own path and sees their own limit, and I'm sure he wants to see his own limits and where he can go one day. 'For me, Tottenham was a wonderful experience and I wouldn't have wanted to miss a second of it. But I chose to leave the club for Bayern Munich to win trophies.

"Wojciech Szczesny can regain his place as Arsenal number one if he dedicates himself completely to the task, according to former double-winning goalkeeper Bob Wilson. The Poland international is expected to feature in the FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United on Monday night, provided he recovers from the virus which stopped him from being on the bench for the midweek Barclays Premier League win at QPR. Szczesny, 24, has not started a league game since the 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, where he was culpable for the goals and afterwards was also caught smoking in the showers. That indiscretion resulted in a fine from the club. Wojciech Szczesny (right) has not started a game for Arsenal since Southampton on New Year's Day . The Polish shot-stopper has been ousted by David Ospina (right) but is likely to play on Monday night . Despite Colombian David Ospina making the most of his opportunities in recent weeks, Wilson, part of the Gunners' 1971 league and FA Cup-winning side, still believes 6ft 5in Szczesny has what it takes to cement a regular place between the posts once more. 'From the time Wojciech got into the Arsenal first team there were a lot who asked if he was good enough and I thought, ""this boy has the potential to really be a solid, outstanding goalkeeper"". I still believe that because he is - for his position - still relatively young,' Wilson said. 'All I would a say to him is ""look, Arsenal is one of the greatest football clubs. If you go from here I am not sure you are ever going to get a club as good as this. At your age now you need to dedicate yourself to being the best you can be, to the exclusion of a lot of other things in your life"".' Former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson says Szczesny must work hard to regain his place in the team . Ospina has made the most of his opportunity, tying down the No 1 goalkeeping position at the Emirates . Wilson recalled: 'I was a very late starter, but once I was in the Arsenal side, my family almost came second to my ambition. 'I devoted every moment to regular training and then when the boys went in for their bath, I stayed out [on the field]. 'I wanted to make sure I never ever left the game saying I could have been better, so my message to Wojciech would be ""come on, prove how good you can be"".' Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is confident Szczesny, who has played in Arsenal's last two FA Cup ties, will be sharp if selected again. Arsene Wenger (centre) will have a tough choice on his hands if Szczesny (right) impresses in the FA Cup . 'Wojciech is used to playing in big games and I think he will take that as a big challenge to show his quality,' the Gunners boss said. 'He works very hard in training, so I don't think that will be a problem.' Arsenal head to Old Trafford in search for a first win there since September 2006, but on the back of good league form. Wenger said: 'We are the holders of the FA Cup, this competition is important to us and we want to go there to produce a result.'","Former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson believes Wojciech Szczesny is good enough to regain his place in the Gunners' starting line-up .

"Jody Cundy recognises the clock is ticking as he bids for Paralympic gold four years on from his notorious explosion at London 2012. Cundy was favourite for victory in the London 2012 C4/C5 one-kilometre time-trial at the Olympic Velodrome, only for his Games to end in an explosive rant at officials. Race commissaries deemed rider failure to be the result of a start gate issue; Cundy argued it was faulty, but his protests were dismissed. It was a seminal moment of the Paralympics, when the watching public realised Paralympians are athletes first and foremost. Joy Cundy is aiming for gold at the Rio 2016 Olympics after his dramatic disappointment at London 2012 . Now Cundy, a five-time Paralympic champion swimmer and cyclist, is going for gold at the Rio Games in 2016, with the Paracycling Track World Championships, which begin on Thursday, a key indicator. The 36-year-old from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire said: 'I've always got that missed gold in London that's always playing on the back of my mind. 'That helps me get up in the morning, continue training and make sure we put all the wrongs to right when we get to Rio. 'I seem to be still getting faster and in training I'm in better form than I was prior to London. 'I'm not getting any younger, but I'm good enough to keep going through to Rio. 'Apeldoorn's going to be the first checkpoint to see if I'm on target.' Race commissaries deemed rider failure to be the result of a start gate issue however Cundy disagreed . Cundy, favourite for gold before his false start in the 1km time trial, shows his outrage after his exit . Cundy acknowledges Tokyo 2020, when he will be 41, may be four years too far and Rio may be his last chance. He added: 'I keep thinking I'm new to the sport, but I joined the squad in 2006. This is my eighth year on the team. 'I've nearly had as many years on the cycling team as I had on the swimming team. 'It's certainly getting harder with each year I do it.' Yet Cundy is still making improvements. Despite being hospitalised to intensive care last November with a swollen epiglottis, Cundy bounced back to post a sea-level personal best in his favoured kilo event at the Newport International event in January. Cundy aims to put his blow-up in the Olympic Velodrome behind him at the Paracycling Track World Championships, which begin in the Netherlands on Thursday . The track in Apeldoorn, Holland which hosts this week's competition is not known for being fast, though, so returning with the world champion's rainbow jersey is the primary objective. Cundy is held back by a team official after the DNF . Cundy added: 'It's about winning the world title and performing as well as I can against my main competitors.' Cundy, a C4 athlete who is a below-knee amputee, races against riders with a lesser impairment than his own in Paralympic competition. The times posted are factored, but Cundy wants to be quicker than all of his C4 and C5 rivals in Rio. 'On the factors they've currently got it's about a 0.6 or 0.8 (of a second) advantage I've got,' he added. 'But I'd rather win on time, be faster on time, that way there's no doubts.' Cundy is joined in the team by 11-time Paralympic champion Dame Sarah Storey, who is defending two world titles. Neil Fachie and his pilot Pete Mitchell are also defending their one-kilometre time-trial tandem title, while Commonwealth Games winning pair Sophie Thornhill and Helen Scott are in partnership in the women's tandem events. Crystal Lane, Lora Turnham (piloted by Lauryn Therin) and World Championships debutants Megan Giglia, Steve Bate (piloted by Adam Duggleby), Louis Rolfe and Jaco van Gass complete the team. Britain topped the medal table at the 2014 event in Aguascalientes, Mexico, winning 10 medals, seven of them gold.","Jody Cundy was favourite in London 2012 C4/C5 one-kilometre time-trial .

"A bee attack during a baseball game in Utah forced players and spectators to flee, sending one man to the hospital and injuring several others. St. George Fire Capt. Robert Hooper says the man was stung between 200 and 300 times late Friday morning at Elk's Field in St. George. But he told the Deseret News the man didn't exhibit any signs of a severe reaction, and was alert and talking to emergency responders. Hooper said an established underground beehive near a telephone pole at the baseball field was disturbed just after 11 a.m. Scroll down for video . Spray away: Fire crews in St. George, Utah, blast a swarm of bees that attacked a baseball on Friday with foam and water to kill them. Several were injured . Swarmed: Baseball fans watching a tournament at Elk's Field in St. George on Friday got the scare of their lives when hundreds of bees began attacking them while they were sitting on the bleachers . Victim: Several people at the game had to be treated for stings, such as this boy, who was hit on the arm . Ouch: Some women at the game show the stings to their head they received when the bees descended . Hit: This St. George woman was one of several stung by bees at Elk's Field on Friday during a freak attack . Attack: One man was seriously injured and several other people received minor injuries when over 1,000 bees swarmed Elks Field in St. George, Utah, about 11am Friday after their underground hive was disturbed . The victim's name wasn't immediately released, however he is said to be in his eighties, according toKCSG. Several other people were treated for stings at the scene. Lone Peak High School baseball coach Matt Bezzant told The Spectrum newspaper of St. George that the bees came from a dugout and players were chased by as many as 70 bees at one point. Fire crews doused the dugout area with a chemical foam to combat the bees. It's not known exactly what caused the bees to become so aggressive but fire officials say it's not uncommon for bees to begin migrating and colonizing at this time of year .

"Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has heaped praise on  Radamel Falcao, claiming his international team-mate can be an 'amazing player' for Manchester United. The shot-stopper will be in Arsenal's FA Cup squad to face United on Monday night, and despite it being unclear whether he or Wojciech Szczesny will start in goal, Ospina will be making sure his team-mates are well aware of Falcao's threat. 'We haven't spoken about the match but we are in contact and I am absolutely convinced and can say with all confidence that Falcao is a player with a winning attitude, he has a strong mentality and is a great professional,' Ospina told the Evening Standard. Radamel Falcao has failed to impress at Manchester United after scoring just four goals in 20 matches . Falcao's international team-mate David Ospina (right) has praised the striker, calling him a 'great professional' 'He has demonstrated that in every team he has ever played in. When he has stability and continuity, he will come to the forefront and he is going to be an amazing player for Manchester United,' Ospina continued. 'We will never underestimate him. He is an excellent forward and I will hope to stop him scoring any goals against us if I play.' Ospina has been instrumental in Arsenal's recent run of form, nailing down the No 1 spot for Arsene Wenger's side. Manchester United are undecided on whether to give Falcao a permanent deal when his loan spell ends . Ospina believes that Falcao (left) can be an 'amazing player' for United if he is given the chance . Despite this, Szczesny was in goal for the Gunners' previous two FA Cup ties and has recovered from an illness which ruled him out of the previous match.

The Colombian striker, who plays with Ospina for his country, joined United on deadline day last September in a loan move worth £6million, but is yet to secure a permanent contract.

"Phil Jones played as a deep-lying midfielder, but it didn’t feel like a midfielder’s performance. He was embarrassed by Giorgio Chiellini for their goal, and he was lucky to get away with losing his man at the previous set-piece. When England were in possession, he didn’t work hard enough to get on the ball — he was happy to let Chris Smalling bring the ball out. Manchester United defender Phil Jones failed to impress after being handed a midfield role . Jones (right) returns to the centre circle after playing a part in conceding Italy's opening goal . Roy Hodgson's 'experiment' of playing Jones as a deep central midfielder didn't pay dividends . Read Martin Samuel's full match report from the Juventus Stadium . Out of possession, he often flew out in an attempt to deal with the danger. This is fine when he wins the ball, but a very risky tactic. In fairness, he dropped back nicely in between the centre halves regularly, which is clearly what he feels comfortable doing. The main problem is that he has a habit of chasing the ball when he can’t win it. He looks like he’s been fired out of a cannon! He’ll need to assess situations better and hold his position in front of the back four. Sir Alex Ferguson famously labelled Jones the next Duncan Edwards, but he didn’t look very Edwards-like. At 23, it feels like we’re still trying to figure out his best position. He is being asked to play a role that needs to be filled by a more technically-proficient player — like Andrea Pirlo. Wayne Rooney looked excellent against Italy, like the elder statesman leading his younger team-mates. He does everything with intelligence and showed his quality with 30-yard diagonal balls and a fine effort against the crossbar. Wayne Rooney stepped to the fore in his role as captain and was unlucky not to score in Turin . England captain showed a good understanding with Harry Kane on their first start together . He also linked up really well with Harry Kane, especially in the second half. It looked like they had a kind of telepathic togetherness. I’m sure that will be something Roy Hodgson will be keen to see more of in the future. It’s interesting how, recently, strike partnerships have seemed like a thing of the past, but Rooney and Kane demonstrated they have an excellent understanding and play like a pair, not individuals. Jagielka shows why he's still valuable to Roy . When you look at Phil Jagielka’s rise in international football, it has been completely without fanfare. He had a couple of hairy moments, but still looked the best defender on show in Turin, weighing in with countless clearances and blocks. He also reads the game very well. Everton centre-back Phil Jagielka proved he is England's best defender with a fuss-free performance . Jagielka fared better than fellow defender Chris Smalling who was forced to withdraw after feeling unwell . He was relegated to the Championship with Sheffield United in 2007 and bought by Everton, where he took a while to mature. But right now, he looks better than Smalling and Jones, who have had a lot more hype surrounding their breakthroughs into the England squad. Jagielka was left out against Lithuania, but showed he should still be first-choice.

"Administrators at a Catholic university in Florida agreed to help an honors student start a campus club that would send money and supplies to the ISIS terror army. Hidden camera footage released Monday morning shows officials and faculty at Barry University advising a senior – identified only as 'Laura' – about the best way to secure funding for a club she called 'Sympathetic Students in Support of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.' 'I want to start fundraising efforts on campus, and what I want to do is raise funds to send overseas,' she told Derek Bley, the school's Coordinator for Leadership Development and Student Organizations. Bley offered to help her create the organization and agreed with her request to 'pass out Islamic State flags and educate people' at an annual student 'Festival of Nations' fair. The video is from Project Veritas, a conservative 'guerilla film-making group' that last week captured a Cornell University dean agreeing that ISIS and Hamas would be welcome at the Ivy League school. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . When an honors student at Barry University in Florida asked campus administrators about getting college funds for a club supporting the ISIS terror army, her idea was met with approval . The Barry professor in charge of the undergraduate honors program agreed to serve as the pro-ISIS group's faculty advisor after hearing that its mission would include 'raising money and sending it to the Islamic State' 'We're not here to limit people,' Derek Bley, 'leadership development' coordinator, told 'Laura' as the student filmed him with a hidden camera . Barry University, based in Miami Shores, has received more than $112 million in federal grants and contracts, and another $109 million from Florida taxpayers since 2000, Project Veritas said Monday, citing figures from OpenTheBooks.com. It also once received tuition money from retired NBA great Shaquille O'Neal, who graduated in 2012 with a doctorate in Education. His final 'capstone project' – a load-lightened version of a doctoral dissertation – focused on 'humor and seriousness in leadership styles,' according to the Miami New Times. The school's mission statement says 'all members of our community' must 'accept social responsibility to foster peace and nonviolence.' Yet Bley was enthusiastic about Laura's terror-funding venture. 'We're not here to limit people and their clubs, he said. 'If there a demand or a need, or an interest that students have to do this, we're here to support that.' 'If you've got ... people who are interested, and this is something you want take and run with,' he added. 'we're here to help you get that done.' 'WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THAT': Bley explained that his office wouldn't make judgments about the kinds of activities and clubs college students wanted to sign up for . The only objection? Asking students to support a group with 'ISIS' in its name, a multicultural program coordinator thought, might hold the organization back – so why not rename it? Laura put the murderous ISIS army's credentials front-and-center. 'They are terrorists,' she told Bley, 'but, like, we're trying to help them. We're trying to, like, educate them and give them funding so that they don't have to be impoverished and get involved in acts of violence.' 'You should create jobs and help promote education in the Islamic State,' she added later, 'because that's what helps reduce terrorism.' That was a subtle jab at U.S. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, who said last month on MSNBC that 'we cannot kill our way out of this war' with ISIS.' The Obama administration, Harf said, should instead 'go after the root causes that lead people to join these groups' – including 'lack of opportunity for jobs.' At one point Laura expanded her fictional club's mandate to include providing paper and pencils to the 'widows and orphans' of dead ISIS jihadis. Barry University is a Catholic institution founded in 1940; its enrollment includes more than 9,000 students, about half of whom are undergrads like Laura . CAMPUS COLLABORATORS: Barry University administrators Derek Bley (left) and Frederique Frage (center), and professor Pawena Sirimangkala, helpfully counseled an undercover investigator about how to start a pro-ISIS student club . FLY THE FLAG: Laura was told her fictional pro-ISIS group would be allowed to pass out ISIS flags and 'educate' people during a campus 'Festival of Nations' event . FAMOUS ALUMNUS: Shaquille O'Neal earned an Education doctorate in 2012 . Another part of her pitch to college officials was a mission that included providing flashlights to ISIS fighters and their families. 'A lot of the facilities have been destroyed' in Iraq and Syria, she said, 'so there is not a lot of electricity and power.' 'A lot of the fighters, they can't see at night, you know?' she continued. 'So, like, people are attacking them and they can't see at night. And because they are so poor, like, they don't have night vision and stuff.' Bley explored the idea, speculating about the 'thousands of dollars' it might cost to send 'bulk shipments' of flashlights to the Middle East, 'like the ones at Costco and stuff.' The only objection Laura encountered was related to the group's proposed name. 'The only thing, as far as the name [goes],' she heard from Frederique Frage, the university's associate director of international and multicultural programs, is that 'technically our country is at war with ISIS'. Frage was quick to add: 'I am not saying that – at all – ISIS represents Islam.' But students might have 'some reservation' supporting a group engaged in a 'humanitarian effort' aimed at the terror group, she said. 'It's just unfortunate.' Another multicultural program administrator, Daisy Santiago, chimed in that Laura should rename her group 'Students in Support of the Middle East' – 'as opposed to having the 'ISIS' [name].' Project Veritas has already stung a Cornell University dean who said on camera that the Ivy League school would welcome an ISIS 'freedom fighter' who wanted to run a training camp . JOBS FOR JIHADIS? State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf insisted in February on MSNBC that an employment program in the Iraq and Syria could stem the tide of ISIS . A professor who runs the university's honors program later agreed to serve as the pro-ISIS club's faculty advisor. Laura explained that despite a less focused name that didn't include any mention of terror groups, her organization's mission would remain 'raising money and sending it to the Islamic State.' Professor Pawena Sirimangkala responded: 'I'll sign. I'm glad to do it.' Laura, an email from a Barry University administrator confirms, is set to receive an award on Monday from the school, as the 'outstanding senior in the Communication Department.' In December the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal government agency, named Barry University to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. The distinction acknowledges universities that place a premium on community service efforts. Daily Mail Online has contacted the university staff named in the video and has not received a comment from them. In a statement provided to Daily Mail Online by the university, Scott Smith, vice president for student affairs, said, 'There has been no formation of an ISIS-related humanitarian aid group at Barry University' and that ' no paperwork' has 'ever' been filed to create such an organization. 'If a student or students are interested in forming a recognized student organization, they are advised on the established processes to follow for approval,' Smith stated. 'However, submitting a request does not guarantee approval since the purpose of all student groups must be in accordance with Barry University’s Mission Statement and Core Commitments. 'Barry University would not approve any group supporting a terrorist organization.'","Honors student set to receive communications award at Barry University in Miami told college officials she wanted to start a club to support ISIS .

"Michel Platini has raised the spectre of the Heysel disaster and warned of a growing issue of hooligans and political fanatics taking control in football stadiums in Europe. The UEFA president, who was on the pitch for Juventus at the European Cup final in Brussels 30 years ago when 39 people - mainly from the Italian club - died after rioting Liverpool fans charged Juve supporters causing a wall to collapse. Platini has called for tougher stadium bans and a European-wide sports police force. Speaking at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, Platini said: 'Europe is seeing a rise in nationalism and extremism the like of which we have not witnessed for a very long time. Michel Platini wants to see a European sports police force introduced to prevent football hooliganism . 'This insidious trend can also be observed in our stadiums, as football is a reflection of society. Given its popularity, our sport is a barometer for the ills of our continent. And that barometer is pointing to some worrying developments. 'I therefore renew my call for greater awareness of this issue among the public authorities, so that we can avoid reliving the dark days of a not-so-distant past - a past where hooligans and all manner of fanatics called the shots in certain European stadiums. 'In recent months, we have all been struck by certain images that I thought were a thing of the past. Some of us experienced that past at first hand. In my case, it was exactly 30 years ago ... Nobody wants a repeat of such events. The Heysel disaster took place in 1985 during European Cup Final between Juventus and Liverpool . 39 fans were killed when they were crushed to death when Liverpool fans breached the neutral area . Most of the fatalities were Juventus fans and Platini wants to avoid any future incidents like this . 'We need tougher stadium bans at European level and - I will say it again - the creation of a European sports police force.' Platini also appeared to have a veiled dig at Sepp Blatter for deciding to run for a fifth term as FIFA president despite having said at the UEFA Congress four years ago that his fourth term would be his last. Blatter then described himself as the 'captain of the ship in troubled waters bringing in back on the right route'. The Italian, who is himself being re-elected unopposed for a third term, told UEFA delegates: 'I regard myself as a simple team-mate - at most your captain. But not the captain of a ship that is being battered by a storm.' Dynamo Kiev fans clash with riot police during mass fighting in the Olympiyski Stadium in the Europa League . Kiev's players were forced to step in and try to calm their fans down which forced the match to be halted . Sept Blatter is preparing to run for a fifth term despite saying that his current one would be his last . Platini's printed speech included the words 'clinging to the helm for dear life' but he dropped that line when he delivered the speech, saying only: 'No. I am simply the captain of a winning team - one that wins because it boasts 54 talented presidents and general secretaries who are prepared to play for each other.' In his speech to the Congress on Tuesday, Blatter made no reference to standing again for FIFA president but once again urged football to resist calls to boycott to the 2018 World Cup in Russia due to its involvement in the civil war in Ukraine. Blatter said: 'Football shall be united, sport shall be united when it comes to boycotts because boycott has never given any results. We have to pay attention to political interference's. The autonomy of sport must be guaranteed.' Platini has experienced first hand football hooliganism when he was on the pitch for the Heysel disaster .","Michel Platini wants to create a 'European sports police force' in the future .

"The attorney representing the University of Oklahoma's disgraced fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon has said he believes the members - including those who chanted racial slurs - deserve a second chance. Stephen Jones, who represented Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, spoke at a press conference on Friday as he said he is seeking a 'non-legal' resolution with the university. Its president, David Boren, expelled the two students filmed leading the racist chant last weekend - but Jones said that Boren himself recently said that everyone deserves a second chance. 'We certainly think that's true for the members of the SAE house,' Jones continued. 'And perhaps even for the members who were involved in this unfortunate confrontation with the university and the basic values of SAE.' Scroll down for video . Stephen Jones, the attorney for the local chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said in a press conference on Friday that the students filmed making racist chants were just a small number of people at the event . Jones is representing students and alumni from the fraternity. He is not representing the two students, Parker Rice and Levi Pettit. He said that he hopes to reach a 'non-legal' resolution with the university, which he indicated acted hastily when it closed down the frat house on Monday. He added that he also wants to ensure the students - some of whom have received death threats - are granted their right to due process. 'I'm not ruling out a lawsuit,' he said. 'I'm saying that our preference is proceeding in a non legal solution... If that is not possible, then obviously we will have to consider other possibilities.' Jones also pointed out that hundreds of students and fraternity members had attended the event where the footage was filmed, and that the 'inexcusable' chant was the action of just a handful. 'We're talking about one incident with nine seconds of video on one of five buses,' he said. Ringleader: Parker Rice, a University of Oklahoma freshman from Dallas, has been identified as the conductor leading the 'there will never be a n***** in SEA' chant on Saturday. He has since been expelled . Outed: Levi Pettit was identified by his family on Tuesday night. They apologized for his 'disgusting' behavior. Right, Pettit - an accomplished golfer at his former school Highland Park - is pictured putting in a 2013 photo . Also on Friday, a spokesman for the fraternity's national headquarters revealed that officials with the Oklahoma chapter have stopped communicating with them. 'We have not heard from the Oklahoma chapter,' spokesman Brandon Weghorst said. 'They have not engaged us since the time the chapter was closed.' Weghorst said the national fraternity is moving forward with plans to expel all of the suspended members of the OU chapter, a move that will permanently revoke their membership. The frat house was shut down after a nine-second video recorded last weekend emerged showing members singing a song using racial slurs and referencing lynching. 'There will never be a n***** SAE' they were heard singing aboard a bus. The fraternity was closed immediately and all students and staff were ordered to remove their belongings from the frat house by Monday night. One of the alleged ringleaders, Parker Rice, said earlier this week that he has left the University of Oklahoma and is 'deeply sorry' for what he did. Lawsuit? The university's president, David Boren, pictured on Tuesday, ordered the chapter to close down . High profile: Jones is pictured in 1996 with Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, whom he represented . 'For me, this is a devastating lesson and I am seeking guidance on how I can learn from this and make sure it never happens again,' he said in a statement. 'My goal for the long-term is to be a man who has the heart and the courage to reject racism wherever I see or experience it in the future.' Brody and Susan Pettit, the parents of Levi Pettit, also apologized to the 'entire African American community' for their son's 'disgusting' actions. But the family added that they had raised him to be 'inclusive,' saying: 'We know his heart, and he is not a racist.' An investigation into the involvement of other members is still underway. Investigations into racism at Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapters have now extended to college campuses in Louisiana and Texas, the organization said Thursday. It came after its national office received word that members in those places knew the racist chant caught on video in Oklahoma. Shut down: Workers can be seen removing the letters from the SAE house on Monday after it was shut down . Moving out: Two men can be seen laughing as they remove furniture from the house on Monday . Spokesman Brandon Weghorst said the chapter at the University of Texas at Austin was being 'fully cooperative' and that a probe at Louisiana Tech in Ruston was in its early stages. He said no new allegations had been substantiated. 'We had no idea of this type of behavior was going on underground,' Weghorst said Thursday. 'This is the type of stuff (the chant), it goes underground and it goes under the radar. 'It's dangerous because — if we don't know about it, we can't stop it.' The president of the university's SAE had previously issued a statement denying that his chapter had ever performed a similar chant. Luke Cone said he could 'speak on the behalf of my fraternity brothers that we are all profoundly distressed' about the language in the video. The SAE chapter at Louisiana Tech did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday, but a university spokesman said it has been unable to substantiate an allegation that a former member participated in the chant in 2010. 'Once we learned that, we immediately got with the current chapter president and the leadership of that chapter to ensure this activity wasn't taking place here at Louisiana Tech,' said spokesman Dave Guerin. Anger: Protesters hold up signs outside the Rice family home in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday . 'They assured us that it wasn't. We can't really attest to back in 2010.' Some members of some of the largest SAE chapters in the country on Thursday denied any knowledge of the racist chant. 'In my four years, I never have seen anything or heard anything like that in my individual chapter,' said Will Sneed, past president of the SAE chapter at the University of Arkansas. Meanwhile, the University of Oklahoma football team expressed its outrage Thursday in a statement calling for fraternity leaders to be 'expelled, suspended or otherwise disciplined severely'. 'As a team, we have come to a consensus that, in any organization, the leadership is responsible for the culture created, and in this case, encouraged. ... Allowing this culture to thrive goes against everything it means to be a Sooner,' the players said.","Stephen Jones, who represented the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, is now representing Sigma Alpha Epsilon at OU .

"Egyptian authorites have launched an investigation after a European porn star filmed a graphic movie while visiting the pyramids. The porn star flashes parts of her body repeatedly while on a coach trip to the tourist destination. Speaking to the camera, the woman called Aurita complains about the views. The actress called Aurita is filmed walking around the pyramids, pictured with a cameraman . During the ten-minute long trailer, the actress constantly complains about having to visit the sites . As tourists look at the historic sites, the porn actress takes the opportunity to flash her cameraman . Driving past the pyramids, the 'actress' claims 'this f****** sucks. What is there to look at?' 'It really sucks, even our resorts are better.' Next, she holds up a an ornamental cat which came from a souvenir stall. She told the camera man: 'First he wanted ten bucks. I told him I won't buy it. I said I know where to get them for three bucks. Then he agreed three bucks'. Once out at the pyramids, she points to one in the distance and said: 'Look, it's unfinished.' When an Egyptian man approaches she tells him 'I don't want to ride on a camel.' Her camera man suggests that she pays the man, she replies: 'I don't want to give him a dollar.' The actress appears on the trailer wearing a tight pair of blue hotpants and a yellow top. She continually flashes various parts of her body towards the camera, even with fellow tourists in the background. When her cameraman asked her to stand beside the Sphynx, she claimed: 'I don't want to stand here. We've already filmed it.' The actress tells viewers that one of the pyramids looks as if it's unfinished and sounds bored by the tour . She also said that the tourist resorts 'back home' are better claiming 'what is there to look at?' The movie culminates in graphic pornographic scenes involving the actress and a male co-star. According to a report on Newstime Africa Egyptian authorities have been angered by the graphic film which features several iconic locations around Giza and Cairo. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damati said: 'A set of sexually explicit scenes was illegally filmed inside the Giza Necropolis by a foreign tourist while visiting the site.' He confirmed that prosecuting authorities are studying the movie Al-Damati said the incident had since been referred to prosecutors for investigation. The woman and her cameraman followed unsuspecting holidaymakers on a guided tour of the ancient sites . The woman even complained about having to pay $3 for an ornamental cat, pictured,  from a street vendor . Egyptian authorities have launched a probe after a porno actress filmed a movie around the Pyramids . The company behind the movie released a ten-minute teaser video on the internet, introducing the the actress, who is believed to be Russian. Initially Egyptian authorities claimed the movie had been faked, but now they have reversed their decision. However, Egyptologists have branded the movies 'demeaning' and said the government should act to prevent its further distribution due to the effect it will have on Egyptian culture. Bassam al-Shamaa said: 'Surveillance cameras aren’t enough to secure such important sites. A full security cordon must be installed to prevent such incidents – which demean Egyptian civilisation – from reoccurring. 'If camera records confirm the filming of this video, the antiquities minister and the relevant security personnel should resign.'","Egyptian authorities have launched a probe into a new porn movie .

"A University of Oklahoma fraternity has been shut down after members were caught chanting the n-word and glorifying lynching in a sickening video - on the same day that President Obama spoke at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march. The footage, uploaded to YouTube Sunday, shows members of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter singing that there 'will never be a n*****' in their fraternity. In the brief clip, one two students stand up to a group of their peers, wearing bow ties and dress shirts, in the vile chant, sung to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It. The footage is believed to have been filmed on Saturday - when the rest of the nation was focused on Selma, Alabama, where the president said the civil rights movement has not yet completed its long march. Scroll down for video . 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma . The idiotic student could be seen leading the chant as one of his friends tried to stop the filming . National heads of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the fraternity Sunday night after the video was shared widely online, and suspended all of its members. During the sickening clip the students are clearly heard singing: 'There will never be a n***** SAE, there will never be a n***** SAE. 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** SAE.' A female voice in the background can also be heard asking a friend: 'You've never heard it before?' The footage shows the group on a bus, apparently headed to a party. It was made public by a black students' pressure group at the university called Unheard. In the wake of the video, the national leadership of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has branches across the country, said the University of Oklahoma chapter would be punished. Reaction: The national heads of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon have said those responsible will be punished . Frat house: The SAE base at the University of Oklahoma is pictured above. The national organization has some undergraduate 15,000 members . Brad Cohen, the Eminent Supreme Archon of the organization, confirmed that the video was authentic. He added that he was 'shocked and disgusted' by it, and said those responsible 'will be dealt with'. Cohen also said the song, which the video participants seemed to know well, was not part of any SAE traditions. A statement from SAE said: 'Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video. Investigation: Oklahoma University President David Boren released a statement via Twitter saying the 'behavior will not be tolerated' 'Reprehensible': The university's president, David Boren, said investigations were underway and warned this behavior would not be tolerated . Shut down: National President of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Brad Cohen, took to Twitter to say the fraternity chapter had been closed and called on the university to expel the students involved . 'In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently. 'We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. 'Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.' Timing: While the SAE members were chanting, President Obama was addressing crowds in Selma, Alabama, on the 50th anniversary of the civil rights marches there . Anniversary: The sickening chant was made exactly 50 years after the march for civil rights led by Dr Martin Luther King, center above, from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama . SAE has more than 200 chapters across the country, 15,000 undergraduate members and around 200,000 alumni. The mission of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is 'to promote the highest standards of friendship, scholarship, and service for our members based upon the ideals set forth by our Founders and as specifically enunciated in our creed, The True Gentleman.' For more than half a century, new members are required to memorize and recite the following: . 'A True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.' David Boren, president of the University of Oklahoma, said that the University had launched its own investigation into the video. Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video. In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently.We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities. This type of racist behavior will not be tolerated and is not consistent with the values and morals of our fraternity. We have more than 15,000 collegiate members across the nation, and this incident should not reflect on other brothers because this type of hateful action is not what Sigma Alpha Epsilon stands for. This is absolutely not who we are. We teach our members to serve as role models in their communities and to live up to our creed, “The True Gentleman.” When members fail to do so, we will not hesitate to take corrective actions or to impose sanctions. Any behavior that is not aligned with the conduct we expect is unacceptable. Equally unacceptable is bystander behavior of members who fail to intervene when they witness conduct that deviates from our beliefs. “I was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video,” said Brad Cohen, the fraternity’s national president. “SAE is a diverse organization, and we have zero tolerance for racism or any bad behavior. When we learned about this incident, I called an immediate board meeting, and we determined with no mental reservation whatsoever that this chapter needed to be closed immediately. I am proud of my fellow board members because we mean what we say.” Alumni who serve on the chapter's house corporation board and who serve as advisers are appalled by the video and the song that was sung in it. They do not condone offensive and hateful behavior and will hold accountable the men who participated in the incident. Although Sigma Alpha Epsilon regrets the closure, we believe members must be held responsible for their actions. We are hopeful that we can re-establish the Oklahoma Kappa chapter at some point in the future with a group of men who exemplify our beliefs and who serve as leaders on campus and in the community.","Sigma Alpha Epsilon members said there 'will never be a n*****' in their fraternity .

"Nike appears to have missed the mark with its new women's sportswear collection which many female athletes claim is incredibly insulting because of the overtly girly designs. The iconic sportswear company teamed up with Japanese fashion label Sacai for the eight-piece NikeLab x Sacai capsule collection, which the brand debuted last month, but many women were left outraged by the impractical pieces, a majority of which retail for $200 or more. 'Nike called it a “bold expression of femininity"". In reality, it’s comical and insulting to female athletes everywhere,' writer Megan Wiegand said in a piece for Slate. Scroll down for video . Female athletics: Nike's collaboration with Japanese fashion label Sacai resulted in an eight-piece collection featuring billowy tops and pleated skirts . Not right: Critics of the 'feminine' sportswear line took to social media to air their grievances with the brand's impractical designs . Peppy look: This model was snapped running in a sweatsuit from the collection, which features a peplum back . She later added: 'The Sacai collection is undoubtedly a vanity project for Nike, but its premise - that female athletes prize style and appearance over functionality and performance - is completely tone-deaf.' Others have taken to social media to air their grievances with pieces featuring excessive amounts of pleated, billowy fabric that is sure to get in any athletes way - no matter what the activity. 'Seriously, that Nike women's line is HIDEOUS. Women's athletic wear needs improving, but this is NOT an improvement. Capes? Dresses? WTF! (sic)' one commenter wrote on Twitter. New wings: The billowy fabric on these pieces from the line can be seen flowing in the as the model runs forward . Not a fan: This commenter tweeted that the entire collection was 'horrifying' Party out back: This jacket looks normal in the front but features plenty of pleated fabric from behind . Bizarre pairing: This royal blue sweatshirt and skirt combination features matching transparent pleats and a hint of hunter green . Another woman tweeted: 'Ew. Yeah, that new Nike women's fashion line is a miss.' Someone else joked that the skirt-filled collection: 'Looks very practical.' However, Sacai’s founder Chitose Abe explained on Nike's website that wearability was a significant consideration in her designs.

Impractical design: This Twitter user joked that the NikeLab x Sacai collection is perfect as long as you are not trying to work out . High-tech: The back of this sweatshirt is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges, and according to the Nike website, the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed .

'The idea of functionality is important to me, as is fabric innovation, which has always been at the heart of Sacai,' Ms Abe said. 'For me, Nike is an original icon with performance and innovation at its core. It has been inspiring to work together.' Indeed, Ms Abe claims that the flamboyant-looking fabrics and over-the-top embellishments on each of the designs has been added in order to enhance the performance of the athlete. The back of one sweatshirt, for example, is cut open to reveal a transparent camisole with lace edges, and according to the Nike website, the special hem was a new fabric innovation that was specifically developed by Abe and the brand.

"His nine-year career at Arsenal has been an emotional and physical roller coaster. Often showing glimpses that he is the perfect mix of power and guile his manager craves before spending weeks, or even years, in the treatment room, Arsene Wenger now looks set to release this French midfielder at the end of his contract in June. The ride is coming to an end. 1554 days, 222 weeks, over four years out injured. The numbers aren't as pretty as his playing style can be. This is the curious case of Abou Vassiriki Diaby. Abou Diaby poses with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger upon his signing in January 2006 . Diaby challenges Bolton's Matt Jansen (C) during a 1-1 draw at Highbury in 2006 .

When Diaby arrived in the Premier League on January 13, 2006, Arsenal beat off competition from Chelsea and Jose Mourinho to sign the 19-year-old from Auxerre. Comparisons were already drawn to club legend and former captain Patrick Vieira because of his height, intensity and technique on the ball. 'Diaby is a bit more offensive than Vieira but when he plays a more defensive role he is very similar,' Wenger said. He started off well, scoring his first goal for the Gunners in April against Aston Villa, but his debut half-season in north London ended in despair. Diaby was the victim of an 'assassins tackle' from Sunderland youngster Dan Smith - according to Wenger - his sickening scream as he fractured his ankle at the Stadium of Light must still be heard by the boss.

A bandaged Diaby under pressure from Manchester City's Michael Ball (right) during Arsenal's 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in the league in April 2007 . Arsenal have played in 350 league games since About Diaby signed. He has featured in 124 of them or 35%, one every 15.7 days. League games by season: 2005/06: 12, 2006-07: 12, 2007-08: 15, 2008-09: 24, 2009-10: 29, 2010/11: 16, 2011-12: 4, 2012-13 11, 2013-14 1, 2014-15: 0 . Put simply, the 28-year-old has never recovered. Whether it be a calf muscle or a hamstring, an abdominal strain or a cruciate ligament, Diaby's talent looks set to be wasted. He has clocked up 42 injuries during his Arsenal career, according to data from physioroom, averaging a new setback every 80 days. The Gunners have played 350 league games since his arrival but Diaby has featured in just 35 per cent of them. Despite his struggles, his almost constant spell on the sidelines hasn't been short of its positive moments. In early 2012 Diaby came back into the Arsenal team to feature alongside Mikel Arteta and Santi Cazorla and impressed, even scoring on his return to the French national team. Wenger heralded his fellow countryman as a holding midfielder when he made his one and only performance this season, a slack display against Southampton in a Capital One Cup defeat. Diaby is embraced by team-mates Eduardo (left) and Diarra (centre) during Arsenal's 3-2 win at Blackburn Rovers during the Carling Cup quarter-final in December 2007 . Diaby dives in to challenge Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney during the Champions League semi-final at Old Trafford in April 2009 . Diaby scores past AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Sergio Romero during the Champions League Group H clash at the Emirates Stadium in November 2009 . The Arsenal midfielder scores a header past Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina in February 2010 . As recently as November, the Gunners' boss was insistent that Diaby would be offered his new contract if he were to prove his health. 'If he comes back, I will keep him. I always believed in him. In football, the most important thing is health.' But Diaby hasn't come close to featuring since, and given the wealth of midfield options Wenger has available it is extremely unlikely he will ever don the Arsenal shirt again, even if he were to return to fitness. He is the second longest-serving player at the club behind Theo Walcott, and is a much-loved figure in the dressing room. His emotional pull remains strong with the fans, who would love for him to be the midfield destroyer and box-to-box runner he has shown he can be. Diaby vies for the ball with Barcelona star Lionel Messi during the Champions League quarter-final at the Emirates Stadium in March 2010 . Diaby battles with Liverpool midfielder Joe Cole (left) during a 1-1 draw at Anfield in August 2010 . Diaby appeared on the final day of last season for Arsenal away at Norwich in his most recent Premier League appearance for the club. It was also his only appearance last season . However, this isn't a perfect world and head must rule over heart, especially at a club vying for the top places. Diaby has played one Premier League game in his last two years, and Arsenal have backed the player admirably. But as the midfielder looks to get back to full strength once again, wherever that may be, this quote by Vieira should not be forgotten. 'If he could have improved constantly, he would have reached an exceptional level. About his potential, he is better than me, better on a technical level, better dribbler, and better scorer too.'

"Louis van Gaal has revealed that the Manchester United team chef has been helping his side prepare for their Premier League clash against Liverpool on Sunday. Van Gaal will be taking charge of a team at Anfield for the first time in his career and it will also be a new experience for several of his players, like Daley Blind, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao. They have not been short of advice, however, with Ryan Giggs and the team chef preparing them for what to expect. Louis van Gaal has revealed that the Man United team chef has been helping his side prepare for their Premier League clash against Liverpool . The occasion is set to be even more highly-charged than usual with both teams competing for a Champions League place and just two points separating them in the Premier League table. Van Gaal said: ‘I have always my assistant manager to say that to me. And he said that also to the players in his presentation of the analysis of Liverpool but I also have the cook, Mike, and he is saying that every day to the players and to me. ‘I like that because that shows that it is a very particular match especially for the fans of Manchester United and it helps also to focus and concentrate on this match.

Wayne Rooney (centre) and his United team-mates train ahead of the trip to Liverpool . ‘Liverpool is not the ground that Manchester United has won a lot (at) so when we show it again in Liverpool then we are a little bit further, I believe.’ United have had Chris Smalling and Angel di Maria sent off in big games against Manchester City and Arsenal this season, and Van Gaal warned that they have to keep their cool at Anfield. He hinted that he has deliberately been winding them up in training to test their temperaments. ‘I am the referee in the games that we have had on the training pitch and I have whistled in the way that they have to control their aggression, for example,’ he added. ‘To prepare them already the atmosphere. And I have mentioned that to them after lunch. Control of emotion is also a talent.’ Antonio Valencia and Radamel Falcao battle for the ball during training on Friday .","Manchester United face Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday .

"A Russian schoolboy has been filmed falling 100 feet to his death after accidentally grabbing a 30,000 volt electricity cable while making a free-climbing video. The 14-year-old, identified only by the name 'Maxim', was climbing along the top of a railway bridge in the capital Moscow while a friend of the same age filmed his dangerous stunt. After walking along the metal railing once, Maxim stops and walks towards the edge of the bridge to get a better view. However he appears to stumble and instinctively grabs the high voltage cable, which electrocutes him and causes him to fall on to the railway tracks below. Risky: The 14-year-old, identified only by the name 'Maxim', was climbing along the top of a railway bridge in the capital Moscow while a friend of the same age filmed his dangerous stunt . Shock: After walking along the metal railing once, Maxim stops and walks towards the edge of the bridge to get a better view. However he appears to stumble and instinctively grabs the high voltage cable . Transport police in Russia issued the disturbing video as a warning to others against performing dangerous stunts on railway lines in order to get pictures and video to put on social media. Maxim had climbed onto the top of the railway bridge not far from Sheremetyevo International Airport in the Russian capital Moscow together with a friend also aged 14-years-old. And as the second schoolboy videoed, Maxim crouched as he edged his way towards the end of the bridge and then turned round and slowly walked back, this time standing higher. Seconds later he appears to lose his balance and instinctively grabs the 30,000 volt electricity cable in the hope of regaining his balance. However a cloud of smoke is seen coming from the schoolboy's right hand as the current knocks him unconscious and causes him to tumble off the railing on to the railway tracks 100 feet below. Horror: A cloud of smoke is seen coming from the schoolboy's right hand as the current knocks him unconscious and causes him to tumble off the railing on to the railway tracks 100 feet below . Plummet: Maxim's tragic death was captured on film by his 14-year-old schoolboy friend . The 14-year-old was climbing along the top of this bridge when he slipped and fell to his death . The schoolboy fell from the top of the bridge on to the railway lines 100 feet below . Transport police spokeswoman Jana Vasilieva said: 'This was a tragic accident that cost a young man his life and illustrates the danger of trespassing on railway property. 'The incident is still being investigated though so we cannot say any more this stage.' Video of the incident emerged on the same day a shocking video was released showing the moment passers-by refused to help a fatally injured young man who burst into flames while trying to steal copper wire from an electricity substation. The unidentified South African, who appears to be in his teens, was seen with horrific burns covering most of his upper body following the incident in the outskirts of the city of Witbank. With his terrible injuries clearly visible, the young man says he is in agony and begs passers-by to take him to the hospital - but he is cruelly told to walk if he wants treatment. The burns victim then walked to a health clinic, where an ambulance was called, but he died several hours later.","Schoolboy named Maxim was filmed climbing a railway bridge in Moscow .

"David Luiz might insist Jose Mourinho isn't all that, but his club think differently after offering Paris Saint-Germain's stars a staggering £180,000 per man if they beat Chelsea.

Luiz has said that Blues boss Jose Mourinho isn't special in the run-up to the Champions League second leg . And, if they manage to progress on leaving the capital, PSG will pay out 250,000 euros to each of the squad. The Qatari owners are using their mammoth wealth to offer incentives to a team that has reached the quarter-finals in both of the last two seasons. With that in mind, Laurent Blanc's side will scoop 1m euros (£716,000) each should they win Europe's premier competition. That though hinges on whether they are capable of negotiating a tricky away leg. West London was the scene in April last year when PSG blew a two-goal first leg lead and crashed out of the competition – Demba Ba scoring a late winner to put Chelsea through on away goals. PSG's players have already pocketed 100,000 euros (£71,600) a man for getting out of their group, with that to rise to 450,000 euros for a semi-final berth and 700,000 if they compete in the Berlin final on June 6.

"Facebook has unveiled an enormous new office in Silicon Valley, which is large enough to hold a 9-acre park on its roof, and will house 2,800 workers in a single room. The new building in Menlo Park, California, measures 430,000 square feet and apparently has the 'largest open floor plan in the world'. The social network's newest location was revealed by founder Mark Zuckerberg, who posted an aerial view on the building on his public page. Scroll down for video . Park life: Facebook's enormous new office in Menlo Park, California, was unveiled yesterday . Settling in: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is pictured above having a meeting in an office-cum-ball pit, which was seemingly crammed with plastic playthings as a first-day prank . He wrote: 'Our goal was to create the perfect engineering space for our teams to work together. 'We wanted our space to create the same sense of community and connection among our teams that we try to enable with our services across the world. To do this, we designed the largest open floor plan in the world - a single room that fits thousands of people.' Lush: The office features a 9-acre park on top of its 430,000 square feet of indoor space . California skies: The office is not far from Facebook's current Silicon Valley campus - to which it is connected by tunnel . Relaxing: The waterfront office was documented by a small army of Instagram photographers ahead of opening day . Plans: This architect's model of the office shows the single, long, open-plan room inside the office . As well as the huge open space, which has yet to be pictured, there will be smaller spaces for meetings. One Facebook employee posted an image of Zuckerberg and Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer meeting in one room, which had been filled with plastic balls - seemingly a first-day prank. According to local news outlet The Almanac, 2,800 engineers will eventually work in the main, open room. They have reportedly not all been hired yet.

Trendy: The building will one day play host to 2,800 Facebook employees - but it is not yet at capacity . Construction on the new building, which is not far from Facebook's existing campus, and will be connected via tunnel, was started in September 2014.

"Dinner with Arnold Palmer on Thursday night clearly agreed with World No 1 Rory McIlroy. All those indifferent rounds in Florida so far this year were swept aside on Friday as the Northern Irishman notched up five birdies in a row at one point on his way to a superb 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. It was the first time in eight rounds in the Sunshine State this year that he had broken 70 and what a way to do it. From out of the pack, the 25 year old is now bang in contention for a morale-boosting victory in his last scheduled start before his attempt to complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters next month. Rory McIlroy hit a second round of 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Friday . It was the first time in eight rounds in Florida this year that the World No 1 had broken 70 . McIlroy looks to have played himself back into form ahead of the Masters next month . ‘I’m just feeling more comfortable day by day, and it was great to see a few putts finally drop,’ said McIlroy, whose performance drew a glowing tribute from his good friend and playing partner, Rickie Fowler. ‘After what I saw today and the fact he’s clearly the best player in the world, he has to be the favourite for the Masters,’ said the American, who was pipped at the post to both The Open and USPGA Championships last year by McIlroy. ‘That course suits his game. He didn’t start out hot today but when he gets it going as he did on the back nine, it’s hard to hang with him. If he continues to play like that, he will be ready for Augusta, for sure.’ Fowler was right when he said nothing appeared to be happening for McIlroy over his front nine, the inward half on the course. In fact, he’d played much better on the first day, when he opened with a 70. But after finally getting a putt to drop at the second, and enjoying a small stroke of fortune at the third, where his pulled drive carried a water hazard by just a couple of yards, it all started to click. A good wedge to the third green set up a birdie and then came his third in a row at the par five fourth. At the fifth his wedge shot finished 18 inches away and then came another birdie at the long sixth, where he got up and down from a greenside bunker. ‘It’s a lovely feeling when you get on runs like that and the game suddenly feels very easy,’ he said. Fowler's good friend and playing partner Rickie Fowler admitted McIlroy is now favourite for the Masters . McIlroy had five birdies in a row in Dubai earlier this year but this was the first time he had enjoyed such a run in an event on the PGA Tour, and it electrified the huge galleries at Bay Hill. By this stage he had gone from being nowhere near the leader board into a tie for second place. Not even a bogey at his penultimate hole could dampen his enthusiasm. ‘It was obviously not the finish I was looking for but I’m still exactly where I wanted to be, with a real chance to win the tournament going into the weekend,’ he said. McIlroy will actually begin the third round on Saturday five shots behind American pacesetter, Morgan Hoffmann, who has played brilliantly so far to post blistering rounds of 66 and 65. But can the little-known Hoffmann keep it going? The New Jersey native is the same age as 25 year old McIlroy but there the comparison ends. A solitary top three finish in 67 starts on the PGA Tour suggests he could struggle over the weekend. Three shots off the pace are world No 3 Henrik Stenson and defending champion Matt Every, while McIlroy is not the only big name from the UK in position to have a crack at winning this prestigious title. Matt Every is also in the mix, three shots behind surprise leader Morgan Hoffman . Ian Poulter is in contention at halfway after rounds of 67 and 70 put him one shot behind McIlroy . For the third week out of four in Florida, Ian Poulter is in contention at halfway, standing just a shot behind McIlroy following rounds of 67 and 70. He also gave a positive bulletin on his three year old son, Joshua, who is making a good recovery from pneumonia. ‘It was great to see him looking a lot perkier than when I left for the course this morning,’ he said. Padraig Harrington, who began this Florida swing with an amazing comeback victory at the Honda Classic, is also in the top 20 at halfway after rounds of 68 and 71. But there’s no getting away from the man who will attract nearly all the attention this weekend. As for that dinner with Palmer, McIlroy was still buzzing. ‘It was fantastic, it really was,’ he said. ‘We spoke for two and a half hours and he was telling stories of the old days and some of the things he’ s done from a commercial standpoint. He was very close to his father just like I am and he shared a few stories about that. It was just great to be in his presence and enjoy his company.’ Pat Perez hits his tee-shot on the picturesque 11th hole at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge .","Rory Mcilroy five shots behind leader Morgan Hoffman at Bay Hill .

"Every transfer window, clubs scramble to pick up the best bargains, often leaving fans brimming with excitement over the latest big-money import. But, seven months after last summer's window swung shut, which of those deals have proved to be the worst value for money? As we reach the business end of the season, Sportsmail takes a look at which summer signings have promised so much but offered so little for their respective clubs. 10 - FERNANDO . Porto to Manchester City . One of two Manchester City entries after a summer which saw Manuel Pellegrini’s side go backwards. Fernando is one-paced, doesn’t impose himself on games and is a man out of his depth, particularly in the Champions League. Porto must’ve laughed all the way to the bank when losing Fernando and Mangala. Any better than Javi Garcia? Sportsmail’s not so sure. Brazilian midfielder Fernando has struggled to make an impact at Manchester City since his summer move . Fernando (right) looked out of his depth during City's Champions League campaign . Sanchez plus Chelsea duo Fabregas and Costa have all justified big money moves... but who is your signing of the season? 9 - RICKIE LAMBERT . Southampton to Liverpool . Who knew that a striker who spent most of his career in the lower divisions probably wasn’t going to be cut out for life at Anfield? Well, quite a few actually. But that didn’t stop Brendan Rodgers taking him from Southampton for £4m last summer. Perhaps at that price it was worth taking a punt on Lambert but the former Bristol Rovers frontman has had no tangible effect on the side and been reduced to becoming a glorified lump up front in the final moments if Liverpool are chasing a game. Rickie Lambert's dream move to Liverpool hasn't worked out the way he would have hoped . Lambert celebrates just his second Premier League goal for Liverpool against Aston Villa in January . 8 - ANGEL DI MARIA . Real Madrid to Manchester United . This list is all relative. If you pay £60m for one of the world’s superstars, there is a reasonable expectation that he wins you a few games; but good performances of Di Maria’s can be counted on one hand and he hasn’t been able to get to grips with English football. Louis van Gaal has quite rightly persisted with the former Real Madrid man, although we have witnessed just why Carlo Ancelotti wasn’t overly fussed about him leaving the Bernabeu. Former Real Madrid star Angel di Maria (right) seems to have lost his way at Manchester United . Di Maria is shown a red card by referee Michael Oliver during United's 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal . 7 - GARETH BARRY . Free agent to Everton . The epitome of everything that’s been wrong at Everton during Roberto Martinez’s tricky second season in charge. On paper an excellent signing - particularly for free - but Barry’s inability to drive forward from midfield has slowed Everton down. They're not the most patient lot at Goodison Park and he has been no stranger to the fans’ ire. Everton midfielder Gareth Barry (right) has endured a tough season at Goodison Park . Barry is shown a red card for a late challenge on Willian during Chelsea's 1-0 victory against Everton . 6 - MARIO BALOTELLI . AC Milan to Liverpool . It just hasn’t worked, has it? Balotelli’s difficulties at Anfield have actually shone quite the light on how well Roberto Mancini did in charge of the tempestuous striker at Manchester City. The £16m fee sounded a snip at the time, but Rodgers hasn’t been able to get anywhere near what’s required. The Italian is a completely different player to that fearsome forward of Euro 2012. Move him on. Mario Balotelli has struggled for a first-team place after several poor performances for Liverpool . The Italian striker has scored just four goals for Liverpool since his summer move from AC Milan . 5 - MAURO ZARATE . Velez Sarsfield to West Ham United . The prerequisite to any signing is that they’re capable of buying into whatever ethos that club’s manager has. In this case Sam Allardyce makes his players do a bit of running. Zarate doesn’t do running. He clearly has the ability required to be a success in the division - the Argentine was hugely impressive on his debut away at Crystal Palace - but he doesn’t appear willing to work on his fitness. Just ask QPR, who contemplated sending the forward back to the Hammers after landing him on loan in January. Mauro Zarate has made just 11 Premier League appearances for West Ham and QPR . The Argentine forward was hugely impressive on his debut away at Crystal Palace last August . 4 - RADAMEL FALCAO . Monaco to Manchester United (loan) Remember the fuss that was made when Manchester United swooped on deadline day for the Colombian? Seems a long time ago now. It is absurd to think that Van Gaal could even contemplate making the loan move permanent at the end of the season. Just four goals for a man heralded as one of the best finishers in the business has meant Falcao even got a run out for the Under 21 side a few weeks ago. Does not justify the astronomical wages United pay him. Colombian striker Radamel Falcao has endured a terrible season at Old Trafford, scoring just four goals . Red Devils boss Louis van Gaal (right) looks likely to end Falcao's loan spell at the end of the season . 3 - RIO FERDINAND . Free agent to QPR . Another one for the QPR conveyor belt of wasted money. The club’s transfer policy of bringing in ‘experienced’ professionals on high wages was perhaps unfortunate when they suffered relegation from the Premier League two years ago, but this time it was downright foolish and has left them in serious financial trouble. Even Clint Hill - he of crouching on his haunches fame - is preferred to Ferdinand, who has looked anything but match fit and failed the basics. That tells the whole story, and this looks to being a desperately sad way to end a stellar career. Rio Ferdinand hasn't been able to find his feet during a relegation battle with Queens Park Rangers . 2 - ELIAQUIM MANGALA . Porto to Manchester City . Abysmal. To think Manchester City paid £32m for the central defender beggars belief, and heads will undoubtedly role from a recruitment point of view. Hasn’t been helped by the continuing slide of Vincent Kompany, but Mangala is supposed to be a big imposing brute of an enforcer and there can be no excuses for a rank average first season in the Premier League. Eliaquim Mangala (left) cost Manuel Pellegrini's side £32million, but has failed to live up to the price . Rolando Aarons beats Mangala for pace before scoring for Newcastle against City in October, 2014 . 1 - EMMANUEL RIVIERE . Monaco to Newcastle . He didn’t come cheap, costing more than £5m from Monaco, and for what? Poor misses, the inability to shake off markers and a source of constant frustration for supporters who want their team to attack with gumption.

"Angel di Maria says Manchester United are '100 per cent confident' that they will cement a top four place come the end of the season.

"This time last season there was sudden hope for Manchester United, too. From the mist of poor football and modest results emerged a 3-0 home win against Olympiacos in the Champions League. Glimpses of what we presumed was the real United were seen once more. A win at West Ham followed in the Barclays Premier League but then the opposition hardened. Manchester City arrived at Old Trafford and took another huge chunk out of United’s credibility. It was a crushing loss for United from which they, and manager David Moyes, never recovered. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal pictured during his press conference on Friday . Van Gaal recognises the rivalry between United and Liverpool is among the most fierce in football . Once again this weekend, United will attempt to build on something they hope will prove to be of substance. Last weekend’s surprising 3-0 dismantling of Tottenham Hotspur has lifted spirits for Louis van Gaal and his team, but once again opposition of real calibre threatens to cast a shadow across United’s new dawn. And this time it is the greatest foe of all. Liverpool. The very mention of their name is enough to harden a Mancunian stare. ‘They will always be our greatest rivals,’ Sir Alex Ferguson used to say. At Anfield on Sunday, Liverpool and United begin in earnest a fight not for a League title or European eminence but for respectability. A scuffle for a top-four place is one motivated certainly by money but more by old-fashioned pride. For United, to finish outside the Champions League places once again is unthinkable. If they really are to find the form they will need to see them through an uncomfortable run of fixtures between now and the season’s end, one feels it really needs to start here. Wayne Rooney (centre) and his United team-mates train ahead of the trip to Liverpool on Sunday . Van Gaal revealed that the United team chef has been helping his side prepare for their Premier League clash . Antonio Valencia and Radamel Falcao battle for the ball during training on Friday ahead of Liverpool . ‘The win (against Tottenham) means nothing if you lose the next one and Liverpool is not a ground where this club has won a lot,’ said Van Gaal. ‘If we show that form again in Liverpool then we are little bit further along. For our fans, it’s the enemy and it’s very important. ‘But the last time they lost in the league was against us. It was a long time ago so this will be very difficult.’ Liverpool have issues of their own to deal with between now and mid-May. Raheem Sterling’s contract stand-off will worry them while Steven Gerrard’s farewell from the club this summer needs to be handled properly. On the field, though, Liverpool have the better form. Monday night’s win at Swansea was a little fortuitous but Liverpool are now unbeaten in 21 domestic matches and if that’s not daunting enough, they play exactly the kind of football the modern United hate. ‘I have played their system,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It’s not new.’ Juan Mata scores against Liverpool during their 3-0 pummelling at Old Trafford in December .

Mata (from left to right), Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney celebrate during their 3-0 win over Liverpool . Van Persie celebrates scoring against Liverpool and United will hope they can do the same at Anfield . Nevertheless, while his own side currently tends to play football by numbers — methodical and at times predictable — Liverpool are more instinctive. Ironically, that was evident the last time Liverpool lost in the league, at Old Trafford back in December. The score was 3-0 to United that day but it was totally unrepresentative of the match pattern as their opponents began to use a three-man defensive line which manager Brendan Rodgers has stuck with ever since. ‘I was impressed that day,’ said Rodgers. ‘The result wasn’t great and we had criticism because we lost but I was pleased with how dynamic the team looked. ‘We looked fast again. That gave me the real confidence. I knew I needed to be radical because we were so far off from where we wanted to be. It’s about putting in place something the players can fully believe in.’ United manager Van Gaal will have to be on guard against an in-form Liverpool unbeaten in 2015 in the league . Liverpool play quickly and love to go on the counter-attack, which Van Gaal will have to prepare his team for . Liverpool, as we know, play quickly, love to counter and have the kind of midfield runners who trouble earnest but limited defensive midfield players such as United’s Daley Blind. If United are to profit on Sunday they must hope to take their opportunities and defend resolutely. It can be done, of course. For all Liverpool’s attacking prowess, they can have days when they hit brick walls, days when the timing is out. Rodgers still has not fathomed a Plan B and it’s worth noting that for all the plaudits which followed Liverpool’s recent win at home to Manchester City, both goals came from distance. United do generally defend well and their goalkeeper remains on form. The save David de Gea produced from Santi Cazorla towards the end of United’s FA Cup defeat at home to Arsenal 11 days ago was testimony to that. United goalkeeper David de Gea has been in fine form for Van Gaal in the Premier League this year . Liverpool must find their way past an in-form De Gea if they are to get revenge for their 3-0 defeat . A year ago, good goalkeeping was not enough to help United mask their deficiencies. As it turned out, their victory over Olympiacos was little more than a shaft of light during a season that resembled a nine-month eclipse. This time we still don’t know which way they are heading. On Friday night, Van Gaal suggested Sunday will not be definitive. ‘The fight will last until the end,’ he said. If it does, given their fixture list, the United manager will have done very well indeed.","Manchester United face Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday .

"Sat inside a crammed central London sandwich shop, Pele flashes those world-renowned pearly whites. After the week Lionel Messi’s had, football’s greatest ever knew exactly what was coming. ‘I never saw myself play, but I think I was the better player,’ the 74-year-old tells Sportsmail, complete with beaming grin. As Thierry Henry said of Messi on Wednesday, you don’t get to be this good without having a bit of an ego. A beaming Pele prepares to take a bite from a footlong as former Liverpool striker  Fowler looks on . The Brazilian great was in good form ahead of Sunday's mouthwatering match on Merseyside . Three months after leaving a Brazilian hospital following a urinary tract infection and now with a clean bill of health, Pele has plenty to tell. Much more than playfully scoring points against the magician who mesmerised Manchester City on Wednesday night. He explains Steven Gerrard’s decision to jet off to America this summer as one taken to wind down, relax and retire, while he considers Liverpool’s clash against Manchester United to be matched only by El Clasico in terms of global appeal. Contrary to hysteria, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with English football, he continues, despite a fortnight which may end up serving as a nadir for the game in this country. And he cites the reason for a lack of success internationally as being largely down to our best players finding themselves ‘too comfortable’ in the British bubble and unwilling to move abroad at their peak. But it is when the names Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned that Pele truly comes alive. They are the pair who rival him - he of three World Cup-winners’ medals - Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff as the all-time genuine superstars. The eyes widen, hands coming up to articulate his point. There is a sense that these two are the only men to really excite a man who has seen it all. Fowler, Pele and Steve McManaman show off a Liverpool top with the famous Brazilian's No 10 on the back . Fowler and Pele pose with the shirt behind the counter at a Subway outlet in London on Friday afternoon . Cristiano Ronaldo is a man who scores goals, but Pele reckons he falls behind Lionel Messi . Messi gets Pele's vote as the best player of the modern era after his consistent displays of the past decade . Not shy, he is more than happy to settle debates which have raged in pubs and on concourses across Europe for the best part of a decade. ‘The two best at the moment are obviously Ronaldo and Messi,’ he says. ‘Which is the best one? Messi has been the best player of the last 10 years. ‘That level, the player who played at the same level for 10 years. It’s massive. He never plays badly and is a very quiet guy. ‘Ronaldo is that striker who scores goals, but Messi does that and helps with assists.’ So, Messi is top dog; how does the Argentine compare to the original luminary? The grin emerges. ‘I think I was a little better in the air,’ he adds. ‘I used to kick it with both feet.’ Fowler, Pele and McManaman laugh at the counter as the Brazilian adds another shirt to his collection . Pele makes his point as our man speaks to the greatest footballer of all time about a smorgasbord of subjects . There are more serious matters at hand for the Premier League at present. This campaign has been hellish, our elite embarrassed and all dumped out of continental competition by Easter. That matters little to a scorer of 650 league career goals. ‘Oh yes, definitely’ he says when asked if the Premier League remained the best division in the world. ‘It pains me as a Brazilian, but I have to say that. Even after the struggles in Europe this week. Remember, losing is part of the game. But there is no doubt that it’s the top league. ‘I don’t think there’s anything wrong - it’s something you can’t explain. ‘Use this as an example. It isn’t the same, but similar. Brazil have won five World Cups, but the two we played in Brazil we lost. You can’t explain that. ‘I was nine years old for my first World Cup watching. We played Uruguay in the final at the Maracana - I was with my father - and we lost. I said “what happened?” My father cried and he said “Brazil have lost it”. ‘We’ve won five now - I was lucky enough to win three. But now the World Cup in Brazil... we lost! It’s the same with the football in England. They have good teams, good players. Pele, real name Edison Arantes do Nascimento, was just 17 when he helped Brazil to their first World Cup . Pele was captain of the great 1970 Brazilian side which won their third Jules Rimet trophy in five World Cups . ‘One thing I would say about English players is that they don’t have experience of playing abroad. You don’t see them playing in South America or Japan. The English players should be playing outside, but it’s too comfortable to play here. ‘To play in South America is more complicated - they need that experience. That’s the only thing you can say about England.’ Two Englishmen who will ply their trade elsewhere come next season are Gerrard and Frank Lampard, both set for the MLS with LA Galaxy and New York City FC respectively. It is 40 years since Pele was in America’s cultural hub  with a Cosmos team  including Franz Beckenbauer and Carlos Alberto. Only now is the perception of the country’s major division changing, although the Brazilian says stars still head stateside to unwind. ‘I like Gerrard very much. If I could pick a team, he would be in it. I don’t know how he feels. He’s chosen to go to the MLS, the same as Kaka. ‘If you want to rest and retire, the competition there isn’t as big as it is over here. Maybe he wants to relax a little bit. ‘During my time we had Beckenbauer, George Best, Zico and Carlos Alberto. But people don’t realise that the United States has a good level of football.’ Steven Gerrard guided Liverpool to their fifth European Cup  on that unforgettable night in Istanbul . Pele, Franz Beckenbauer (second right), Giorgio Chinaglia (right), his wife and Mrs Beckenbauer (left) Pele places Gerrard on a pedestal with the great Beckenbauer, both making his World XI. Asked where the Liverpool skipper would rank among the best midfielders of all time, he compares him with Germany’s biggest ever star. ‘Maybe people don’t remember, but Beckenbauer had the same style,’ he adds. ‘I like Gerrard, he is a similar intelligent player. There is no doubt they’d both make my team.’ As for the rumble on Merseyside this weekend – it will be the sixth time Pele has visited Anfield – there is a simple message: the North West has the exact same appeal of El Clasico. ‘They are very, very similar games. It’s one of the best in today’s game. I always look forward to going to Anfield. I love to see good football. ‘Barcelona have excellent players. It’s not only Lionel Messi, but Xavi and Neymar. Maybe they have more individuals, but as a team Liverpool are the same.’ Subway Famous Fan Pele visted a London Subway store to discuss football, nutrition and training in the run up to the Liverpool v Manchester United football match on Sunday March 22 .","The greatest footballer of all time weighed in to the Lionel Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo debate .

"Emre Can was bemused. Brendan Rodgers had been at his most effusive, purring about the German's ability, but his words were unwittingly lost in translation. Eager to promote the giant strides Can had made, Rodgers delved into his lexicon and likened Liverpool's new No 23 to a Rolls-Royce, following a series of effortlessly smooth performances. When his manager's words were relayed, however, there was nothing more than a quizzical look. 'We wouldn't use that expression in Germany, we wouldn't say something like that,' says Can, taking up the story. 'I know a Rolls Royce is a big, luxurious car so I associated it with a positive comment, but I didn't know exactly what it meant. I hadn't heard the comparison before. Liverpool's Emre Can (left) was among an influx of new players brought to Anfield last summer . Can, pictured heading the ball during Liverpool's training session on Friday, has found form in 2015 . Can (right) runs with Steven Gerrard during  training ahead of Liverpool's match with Manchester United . 'Then again, I had a feeling it couldn't be so bad if the manager was saying something like that.' This is the first time Can has faced the English media since his £10million arrival from Bayer Leverkusen and he smiles as he relays the anecdote. Initially, Can is withdrawn and lacking confidence but eventually, with the help of an interpreter, he emerges from his shell. In some ways, this interview is a microcosm of how his Liverpool career has been to date. As part of the huge influx of new players last summer, Can failed to make an instant impact and in the early months of the campaign, he did nothing but float on the periphery. Since Christmas, though, the landscape has changed dramatically, both for him and Liverpool. Playing on the right side of a three-man defence, Can has not looked back since his introduction as a half-time substitute at Burnley on Boxing Day. 'I was injured at the beginning of the season and then played against Chelsea (in November),' says Can, referring to a 2-1 defeat in which he scored Liverpool's goal. 'Then I was out of the team until December when I came on (at half-time) against Burnley. Can has faced the English media for the first time since his £10million move from Bayer Leverkusen . Can pictured tackling Wayne Routledge during Liverpool's 1-0 win over Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium . Can has drawn midfield comparisons with Germans Michael Ballack (left) and Bastian Schweinsteiger (right) 'My attitude was not to moan or make a big fuss about it but to keep calm and work hard so that when I got the chance against Burnley I could break into the side. I feel very good feel I have the trust of the manager. I believe I'm doing a good job and that is why I am playing. I'm happy.' Powerful and imposing, Can has a defender's physique but his qualities as a midfielder have drawn comparisons with Michael Ballack and Bastian Schweinsteiger. Given how he has been performing, it seems remarkable Bayern Munich allowed him to move on. Bayern had an option to buy back their Academy graduate from Leverkusen but were content to let Liverpool have him. There are certainly no arguments about that decision at Anfield. Rodgers, for one, believes Can has the ability to 'play for any side in the world'. Can, clearly, is going to be an important figure and an idea of how much the 21-year-old has backed himself to succeed is by the fact he asked to take over the 23 jersey that had been vacant since Jamie Carragher departed in May 2013. Can has looked a different player since Christmas as he continues to thrive under Liverpool boss Rodgers . Can will be among those hoping Liverpool can get revenge over Manchester United on Sunday at Anfield . 'I did want the 23 because there was a high importance here, and I knew about it before I came,' he says. 'It is a big honour to wear it after Carragher retired but I don't feel any extra pressure because of it.' So on to Sunday and the battle with Manchester United. Had things worked out differently, he could have been lining up against Liverpool, as the David Moyes regime scouted Can twice last season but, instead, he will be aiming to derail their top four ambitions. 'I am well aware United will be a tough game and I know about the rivalry,' says Can. 'We have a very young team and need to keep improving. But if we do, there will be good years. I am playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. I have no regrets about coming here.'","Emre Can was among an influx of new players that signed in the summer .

"Marouane Fellaini has endured a lot since swapping Merseyside for Manchester. Derided as a symbol of the David Moyes regime, ridiculed by his own fans and, lately, held responsible for Louis van Gaal’s occasional lurch towards route-one football, the big Belgian has had more weighing on his shoulders than that trademark mass of curly hair. So the standing ovation he received from the majority of Manchester United supporters when he came off against Tottenham at Old Trafford last weekend will have been music to his ears. Marouane Fellaini fires Manchester United into the lead against Spurs, a reminder of his footballing ability . The Belgian trains ahead of United's crucial clash with Liverpool on Sunday, where he is sure to be involved . Fellaini has grown from a bit-part player last season to become a vital member of Louis van Gaal's squad . A well-taken opening goal with his left foot served as a reminder that Fellaini’s attributes are not just sandwiched between his chest and his head. There are those who will never accept that he is a true United player, who believe his very presence encourages United to play other than the United way. But as he prepares to make his first appearance on Merseyside since moving from Everton when Van Gaal’s side take on Liverpool on Sunday, the 6ft 4in midfielder has every right to feel that things are looking up. The £27.5million white elephant of Old Trafford has been reinvented as United’s not-so-secret weapon. The advanced role that Van Gaal has given to Fellaini led Sam Allardyce, of all people, to label his opponents ‘Long Ball United’ after the 27-year-old’s introduction off the bench helped salvage a 1-1 draw at West Ham last month. Fellaini starred in the 3-0 win over Liverpool at Old Trafford in December, and offers Van Gaal an alternative . Wayne Rooney celebrates with the big Belgian, who has scored five times for United this season . Fellaini was tainted, somewhat unfairly, by being the only signing made during David Moyes' summer in charge . Van Gaal doesn’t care. ‘Fellaini is a player that, when we cannot beat the pressure with quality, we can always beat with pressure — that is a quality,’ says the Dutchman. The transition from defensive midfielder, who first impressed Moyes playing for Standard Liege against Liverpool in the Champions League in 2008, to target man worked particularly well for Everton. But, unlike Van Gaal, Moyes did not feel comfortable deploying Fellaini in a similar role at Old Trafford, having drawn enough criticism merely for signing him when Cesc Fabregas was his priority in the summer of 2013. Disastrously, Fellaini ended up as United’s only signing and Moyes knew that he risked being accused of turning the Premier League champions into a poor imitation of Everton. The player was said to be ecstatic at signing for United, if a little overawed at the scale of the club. He struck up an immediate bond with fellow Belgian Adnan Januzaj and, later, Juan Mata, when the Spaniard joined the following January. By then it had all started to go wrong, a combination of injuries and sub-standard performances in a more defensive position confirming the fears of many United supporters. Last April, the now-defunct fanzine Red Issue mocked up an advert of his afro hair as a toilet brush with the slogan: ‘Flush a fortune down the pan’. Since the arrival of Van Gaal, the midfielder has been used as an outlet and a way of breaking teams down . The Belgian was given a rousing applause when he was replaced after a good performance against Tottenham . Fellaini was said to be devastated by it all, and even more so when Moyes was sacked later that month. He felt isolated and has since claimed that he was made a scapegoat for the club’s decline. One thing that never waned, however, was Fellaini’s determination to salvage his dream. When he returned from the World Cup last summer he held talks with Van Gaal, who reassured him that he would not be sold despite talk of a move to Napoli. The message had not reached United fans, some of whom sarcastically applauded Fellaini’s every touch in Van Gaal’s first home game against Valencia right up until the moment he scored a last-minute winner. Even then, it was assumed that his first goal for United would be his last. Five more have followed this season. Fellaini came off the bench at half-time to turn the game at West Brom in October and again at QPR in January. In between, he started in six successive wins before Christmas, ending with a comprehensive 3-0 win over Liverpool when he destroyed his old Merseyside rivals. While Moyes seemed loathe to play Fellaini off the striker, Van Gaal has returned him to his best role . Fellaini may suit slightly more 'long ball' football, but has shown he can be mighty effective for United . Now Fellaini is set to face them again on Sunday having won over at least some of his critics, much to the admiration of Phil Neville, his former Everton team-mate and United’s first-team coach under Moyes. ‘Last season Fellaini was getting ridiculed and the way he has come back from that has been fantastic,’ said Neville. ‘He’s won people over by being brave about the stick he was getting and never going missing in games, even when things were not working for him. ‘You also have to give Louis van Gaal credit. He has not been afraid of playing to Fellaini’s strengths despite being criticised for doing so. I think he has come up trumps.’","Marouane Fellaini endured a torrid season after joining Manchester United .

"Bafetimbi Gomis may not score often in the Premier League, but his goals tend to leave a lasting impression. They come late, they decide matches, and they present the opposition with questions to ponder. Gomis, playing his second match since collapsing at White Hart Lane, struck three minutes from time at Villa Park to prick the bubble blown by Tim Sherwood. This was the second time in his short tenure Aston Villa have lost at home to a goal in the closing stages. It keeps Villa within the pull of the relegation zone when it had looked, after consecutive wins and reaching Wembley, an upward trajectory was gathering. For Gomis, it was a third goal of the Premier League campaign. His first came 12 minutes from time to beat Arsenal in November, bringing scrutiny on Arsene Wenger.

His second felled Manchester United in the 73rd minute of their February encounter, casting doubt on the Louis Van Gaal philosophy. This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with £28million going the other way. At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes. On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish. Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass. The rapid winger, on as a substitute, hit top gear to race past Leandro Bacuna and crossed with the outside of his right boot. Despite being tugged back by Ciaran Clark, Gomis connected to plant a firm shot past Brad Guzan. Sherwood, who saw his side lose to Stoke in injury time of his Villa debut, was in terse mood afterwards. Defeat hurts him deeply.

Swansea winger Wayne Routeldge (right) skips past the challenge of Villa full back Alan Hutton in the first half . Sherwood yells out instructions to his Villa charges as they try to break the deadlock against Garry Monk's men . 'That's the second time it's happened now,' he said. 'There comes a time in a game when if you're looking like not winning it you make sure you don't lose it. We have to try and address that.' It was a close match. Swansea bossed the first half, Villa shaded the second. In the 57th minute Gabby Agbonlahor thought he had scored when Christian Benteke's header fell his way four yards out. But Neil Taylor blocked brilliantly. Scott Sinclair and Fabian Delph both sent good openings wide and Sinclair almost found an equaliser in added time when volleying inches over the bar. By now Benteke had gone off because of a niggling hip problem and Swansea could have extended their winning margin when Routledge ran free close to the end. But Guzan saved well. In the first half the American goalkeeper twice denied Gomis, who should have scored from Taylor's cross on six minutes. He also had a great chance 16 minutes from time after Monetro's ball but Clark diverted the shot away. Gomis was not to be denied, leaving Garry Monk delighted.

"Burnley striker Danny Ings will step out at Anfield on Wednesday looking to boost his side's Premier League survival hopes at the expense of the team he has been strongly linked with a move to at the end of the season. Brendan Rodgers has refused to be drawn on speculation suggesting that Ings, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign, will move to Liverpool. But if he does sign a contract at Anfield, will he be good enough to make the grade? Sportsmail's reporters give their verdict. Danny Ings (centre) has been Burnley's star player as they try to stay in the Premier League this season . DOMINIC KING . Yes, he is good enough to make the step up. It is no mean effort scoring nine goals in the Barclays Premier League for a side that has struggled to get results and Ings has never been found wanting at the biggest stadiums. He was outstanding in Burnley’s 3-1 loss at Old Trafford last month, his energy and intensity setting him apart that night. It was not a one-off because he has attracted positive reviews all season. Ings scored for Burnley against Manchester United in his side's 3-1 defeat and impressed with his display . Ings could replace Fabio Borini at Liverpool, with the Italian expected to depart at the end of the season . Ings has scored nine times for Burnley this season and will take on Liverpool on Wednesday . Read Dominic King's piece on why Danny Ings would flourish under the guidance of Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . Liverpool will overhaul their striking department in the summer, with potentially three players moving – Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and Mario Balotelli – and a move for Ings would make sense from both a playing style and an economic point of view. He will have to raise his game again should he eventually arrive at Anfield, but that won’t be a problem. Ings has been doing that for the last two years and he will welcome the challenge. JOE BERNSTEIN . Danny Ings is one of those players who doesn't have one quality that makes him stand out, but he doesn't have an obvious weakness either. He is an intelligent player and at 22 has the potential to get better. He is a good finisher but his tally of nine this season is unremarkable and five fewer than Charlie Austin at QPR for example. Ings watches on as his shot hits the back of the net for Burnley against Queens Park Rangers . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has refused to comment on the speculation linking the club with Ings . Ings can show he is capable of playing on the big stage when he plays for Burnley against Liverpool . Ings could make the step up to a big club but there is no guarantee. You suspect Liverpool's real interest in him is due to John W Henry's moneyball approach to the game. Why wouldn't you take a promising 22-year-old on a Bosman given you could sell him in two years for a handsome profit, even if he doesn't become a first-team regular? IAN LADYMAN . There was a moment when it became clear to me that Ings was good enough to make the grade at the very highest level and it came early in last month’s defeat at Manchester United. The way he showed Chris Smalling to the front post before checking back and heading in Burnley’s goal – by now unmarked – at the far post told you everything you need to know about his natural instincts as a goal scorer. It was high-class finishing. Ings' form has also led to talk that England manager Roy Hodgson (left) will include him in his next squad . Ings beats defender Martin Kelly and goalkeeper Julian Speroni to score against Crystal Palace . Earlier in the season – as he started the campaign slowly – I wasn’t sure but he has found his feet now and has emerged as a safe bet for the next England squad. On that note, I wrote a story last season saying that Ings was being watched by Roy Hodgson’s staff and was likely to figure in the national set-up during the Euro qualifiers. I remember one of my colleagues laughing. He isn’t laughing any more…. CHRIS WHEELER . There’s no doubting the drive and determination of a striker who was playing for Dorchester Town in the Conference South a little over four years ago, and Ings will be desperate to put on a performance at Anfield. Is he good enough to make the step up to Liverpool? Compared with the players Brendan Rodgers currently has at his disposal, you would have to say yes. Ings has scored nine goals in the Premier League for a Burnley side that has spent the entire season battling the odds – the same amount as Manchester City’s new £25m signing Wilfried Bony and Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud, and more than Liverpool forwards Daniel Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and Lazar Markovic put together. Ings has scored the same number of Premier League goals as Wilfried Bony and Olivier Giroud . Ings is only 22 and fits the profile of player that Liverpool often pursue in the transfer market . A player who scored 26 goals in the Championship last season has also hit four in seven appearances for England Under 21s to stake his claim for a senior international call-up, so there is little doubt that he is capable of rising to the challenge. Ings is not excessively tall or powerful, but he is quick and possesses great movement and anticipation in and around the penalty box. Most importantly of all, he has a goalscorer’s instinct. And at the age of 22, he is young enough to take his game to another level under a coach like Rodgers.","Danny Ings has scored nine times for Burnley in the Premier League .

"Referee Neil Swarbrick has apologised for wrongly sending off West Brom's Gareth McAuley during his side's 3-0 loss at Manchester City. McAuley was a victim of mistaken identity when he was shown a red card after Craig Dawson fouled Wilfried Bony in the second minute of the Barclays Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium. Swarbrick has now admitted to his error in a statement from Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, the organisation responsible for refereeing appointments. Referee Neil Swarbrick shows a red card to Gareth McAuley (right) during the second minute of West Brom's match at Manchester City. But it was Craig Dawson who committed the original foul on Wilfried Bony . West Brom defender Craig Dawson makes a challenge on Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony . The Ivorian striker tumbles to the ground under Dawson's challenge . BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . Bony continues but Gareth McAuley then comes in with a challenge of his own inside the area . Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge and the West Brom player is sent off . Bony heads to the Etihad Stadium turf after being challenged by McAuley . The West Brom players protest as McAuley is shown the red card by referee Swarbrick . 1 McAuley loses the ball inside his own half, with striker Wilfried Bony now bearing down on goal . 2 Craig Dawson comes across and makes the tackle, sending Bony crashing to the ground . 3 Referee Neil Swarbrick steps in, blowing his whistle to stop play . 4 But Bony has picked himself up quickly and continues to run with the ball into the penalty area, clearly not having heard the whistle . 5 McAuley then comes back to put in another tackle on the City striker . 6 Play finally stops and Swarbrick beckons a player across to him. Dawson does not move, however, putting his hands on his leg . 7 Instead, McAuley walks across to the referee and is then shown the red card . 8 McAuley can be seen saying 'it wasn't me' as players surround the referee. But their protests are to no avail . The statement read: 'In the second minute of Manchester City v West Bromwich Albion, referee Neil Swarbrick made a decision to send off Gareth McAuley for a 'denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity' offence. 'The referee has confirmed the offence was caused by a different player, which should be addressed now as a case of mistaken identity. The referee has apologised for his error.' Swarbrick left the West Brom players stunned and manager Tony Pulis livid after showing McAuley a straight red card when Dawson had committed the original offence. McAuley's sending off left West Brom with 88 minutes to hold out against City with just 10 men . McAuley was seen mouthing the words 'it's not me' to referee Swarbrick but it wasn't enough to change the decision. At half-time, Swarbrick admitted to BT Sport that the first number he saw after the incident was McAuley's No 23, leading to the case of mistaken identity. Speaking on BT Sport at half-time, pundit Steve McManaman said: 'It's just a simple case of mistaken identity. The decision is right, Wilfried Bony is through and he's denied a goalscoring opportunity. It's a red card. The two players mistaken by referee Swarbrick - McAuley (left) and Dawson (right) McAuley walks past his manager Tony Pulis as he leaves the field . 'It's a simple thing for the referee, Neil Swarbrick, he's just sent the wrong man off. He's sent McAuley off, he should have sent Dawson off. One's No 25, the other's No 23. Easy enough.' Owen Hargreaves added: 'Dawson's head is down initially because he think he's getting sent off. He just calls the players over, he doesn't call anybody specific. 'In the end, McAuley comes over rather than Dawson. In that situation, Dawson should be holding his hands up. It's a case of mistaken identity. It's a shame really because it's killed the game.' Because Wes Brown's sending off in Sunderland match at Old Trafford three weeks ago was a case of mistaken identity, both he and John O'Shea got away with bans. When asked whether the challenge warranted a red card, David James said: 'Absolutely, he's the last defender. Bony is through one-on-one with the referee, it's definitely a red card.' The red card was shown just 89 seconds into the match at the Etihad Stadium, leaving West Brom with a mountain to climb against the defending champions. Roger East sent off Sunderland's Wes Brown instead of  John O'Shea after a foul on Radamel Falcao. Baggies players Darren Fletcher, James Morrison and Craig Gardner were seen protesting to Swarbrick as the players left the field for half-time, but to no avail. With 88 minutes to hold out with 10 men, the Baggies lasted 25 until Bony spun inside the box and fired home his first for the club. Fernando doubled their advantage five minutes before the break, smashing home after West Brom failed to clear a corner. And David Silva made absolutely sure 13 minutes from the end, turning home Stevan Jovetic's shot with a faint touch. Brown is given his marching orders during the match at Old Trafford despite the fact it was O'Shea . The former Liverpool player and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher wrote on Kicca: 'Another case of mistaken identity in a sending off in today's game at the Etihad. Referees need help! 'We need technology in the biggest sport in the world!! How long do we have to wait? 'Goal line technology has helped the game but came too late. I would start with mistaken identity for red/yellow cards a monitor for the fourth official or the match assessor upstairs to help one of their colleagues. 'The referee must know from the players reaction he's made a mistake but can't be seen to change his decision that must surely affect the rest of his performance? Last season Andre Marriner wrongly showed Kieran Gibbs a red card when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handled . Gibbs is sent off by referee Marriner during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Arsenal . 'We can then see how far we can take technology but we have to start somewhere. West Brom won't have anyone suspended now either!' It is the second such incident in Manchester in the space of three weeks. On February 28, referee Roger East mistakenly sent off Sunderland's Wes Brown rather than John O'Shea after a foul on Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao. And last season, Andre Marriner wrongly showed Kieran Gibbs a red card when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handled on the line in Arsenal's 6-0 defeat at Chelsea. Gibbs appeals to Marriner after receiving a red card during the  match at Stamford Bridge .","Neil Swarbrick has issued an apology after making the error .

"Even if you read this in a fairytale book, you would still think it was far-fetched but Harry Kane does not want this story to end. A hat-trick just three days after your first ever England call-up? You simply could not write it. But Kane is composing his own scripts at the moment. His dream season continued on Saturday as he fired Tottenham to a hard-fought victory. All this in front of England manager Roy Hodgson. Kane will surely make his England debut in either Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or the friendly against Italy a few days later after taking his season tally of goals to 29. Harry Kane put Tottenham 3-2 ahead form the penalty spot after Danny Rose was fouled in the box as the 21-year-old completed his hat-trick . Kane holds three fingers up as he celebrates after scoring from the spot to score his first Premier League hat-trick . The strike was Kane's 29th goal of the season and the 19th in the Premier League as he overtook Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa . Tottenham were awarded the spot kick when Danny Rose was bundled over by David Nugent's clumsy challenge . England manager Roy Hodgson was watching form the stands as Kane became the Premier League's leading goalscorer . Kane applauds the Tottenham supporters as he takes the match ball after the final whistle at White Hart Lane . Tottenham: Lloris 5 (Vorm 4, 5); Walker 5, Dier 5, Vertonghen 5, Rose 6; Mason 7 (Dembele 87), Bentaleb 7.5; Townsend 6 (Paulinho 58, 6.5), Eriksen 7, Chadli 6; Kane 8.5 .

Referee: Mike Dean 6 . Harry Kane made it 2-0 with a deflected shot. Click here for more from MATCH ZONE . ‘It’s true he’s in a very good moment in career. He’s at the top,’ said Mauricio Pochettino. Tottenham’s victory came at a cost, though, with Hugo Lloris taken to hospital on Saturday after suffering a nasty gash to his knee in a collision with team-mate Kyle Walker and Jamie Vardy in the first minute. You could sense the worry in White Hart Lane as the Frenchman received lengthy treatment before being replaced by Michel Vorm. The mood picked up, though, as Spurs took a fifth-minute lead. No prizes for guessing who scored. Eric Dier’s flick from Christian Eriksen’s corner was parried by Leicester goal keeper Kasper Schmeichel and the rebound fell to Kane who tapped home. It was one of the simplest goals he’ll score — not that Kane cared an iota as he wheeled off in celebration. Jeff Schlupp scored an unfortunate own goal after Kasper Schmeichel's save rebounded off his chest and into the net to make it 4-2 . David Nugent reduced the deficit back to one in the 90th minute but Tottenham hung on to claim the three points . Leicester captain Wes Morgan thumps a powerful header past Michel Vorm to draw the visitors level after a Matty James corner . Morgan roars with celebration as he rushes towards the travelling Leicester supporters after equalising for Nigel Pearson's side . Jamie Vardy sucks his thumb in celebration after pulling a goal back for Leicester after 38 minutes at White Hart Lane on Saturday . David Nugent’s audacious attempt to catch Vorm off his line in the 10th minute nearly pulled the visitors level before Kane notched again in the 12th minute after a huge piece of fortune. Walker and Andros Townsend combined brilliantly down the right to fire a low cross into the area. Robert Huth’s attempted clearance fell to Kane, whose first-time strike took a big deflection off the German before bouncing past the luckless Schmeichel. Leicester did not deserve to be on the receiving end of this clinical Kane show after a promising start. It was nearly game over in the 22nd minute as Eriksen struck Schmeichel’s far post before Nacer Chadli wasted the rebound. Pochettino was looking to his bench again six minutes later after Dier was caught by Vardy’s arm. The England Under 21 defender carried on, albeit with a painful lump on his right cheek. But while Dier was showing great heart, the same couldn’t be said of his team-mate Chadli, who was booked for diving after falling in the box under pressure from Wes Morgan in the 36th minute. Two minutes later Leicester worked themselves a deserved lifeline as Nugent sprung through Tottenham’s left-side before providing an inch perfect cross for Vardy, who cooly fired home with an excellent one-touch finish. Vardy slides in to finish past Vorm from close range after a wonderful ball in from David Nugent as Leicester halved the deficit . Kane's deflected shot deceives Kasper Schmeichel and flies into the top corner as Tottenham raced into a two-goal lead after 13 minutes . Kane finds the net fro his 28th goal of the season just two days after he was named in Roy Hodgson's England squad for the first time . Kane gave Spurs an early lead when he tapped home from close range after Schmeichel could only parry Eric Dier's flick . The visitors could easily have pulled themselves level before the break, Nugent and Leonard Ulloa wasting good chances. Pochettino was desperate to get his team into the dressing room, but his half-time talk made no difference as Leicester levelled five minutes after the restart — Morgan ghosting into the area undetected to head home Matty James’ corner. Ten minutes later Leicester should have been ahead when Huth was presented with a golden chance to redeem himself following his role in Spurs’ second goal. Somehow he didn’t take it, sending a free header from another James corner wide. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso could do nothing to stop Kane's effort from close range finding the back of the net . Kane leads the celebrations after opening the scoring for Mauricio Pochettino's side at White Hart Lane on Saturday . Tottenham were dealt an early blow when Hogo Lloris left the field on a stretcher after a second-minute collision with Kyle Walker . The France goalkeeper looks to be in severe pain as he is seen to by the Tottenham medic following the early clash with the Spurs right back . At the time it seemed a pivotal moment, and so it proved as Spurs were handed a contentious penalty in the 62nd minute. Nugent thought he had time in the box, but Danny Rose had other ideas, nipping in front of the forward. He clumsily collided with the Spurs defender, who fell to the ground. In fairness to Nugent, the defender looked to go down easily but Mike Dean pointed to the spot. Leicester coach Kevin Phillips was soon shaking his head at fourth official Darren Bond after racing down the tunnel to watch a replay. The commotion didn’t concern Kane, though, as England’s newest recruit sent Schmeichel the wrong way to complete his hat-trick. Spurs had their fourth in the 85th minute, the unlucky Jeff Schlupp diverting the ball into his own net after Schmeichel foiled Eriksen. That should had seen Spurs home without fuss but Nugent set up a nervy three minutes after some poor Jan Vertonghen defending, to score Leicester’s third.

"There were famous faces in the best seats in the house as optimism over a new era abounded. John Greig, officially the Greatest Ever Ranger, was by Dave King’s side in the director’s box in a highly symbolic return to Ibrox. He was joined by one of the club’s greatest ever managers, Walter Smith, and John Brown, who can lay claim to some of the greatest ever declamations against the ousted boardroom regime. Rangers midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, celebrates putting the home side ahead at Ibrox . Young Queen of the South striker Aidan Smith (centre) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller . The greatness, somewhat predictably, stopped at the white lines of the pitch. This ramshackle group of players looked like they might just let the feelgood factor flourish when Newcastle loanee Haris Vuckic put them ahead with 12 minutes remaining. There would not, however, be the delicious irony of one of Mike Ashley’s men allowing King and Co a victory to savour in their first home match since seizing control. All the failings that have left the Ibrox side in the midst of a Championship play-off scrap they may well not win came to the fore as 17-year-old Aidan Smith – making just his second senior appearance - equalised for Queens eight minutes later. In truth, it was a point they more than merited. Jeers rang out at the final whistle as supporters who flocked back to Ibrox to financially support the new board digested yet another on-field setback. The grim sequence of results now reads as just one win in their last seven outings. For King and his associates, the question of what can be done to lift a desperately flagging season remains highly pertinent. Discussions with caretaker manager Kenny McDowall will have to determine whether he continues or whether an alternative interim appointment is made for the remainder of the campaign. This was not the first time this season that Queens had found themselves featuring in a significant day in the Rangers saga. Back on December 12, their comprehensive 2-0 victory at Palmerston Park became almost an addendum to news that Ally McCoist had handed in his notice. For the visiting support inside the Dumfries ground, it was yet another bewildering development to try and digest. Rangers legend John Greig was in the stands at Ibrox for Tuesday night's Scottish Championship clash . Events tumbled even quicker from then, through McCoist’s gardening leave, an AGM, crisis loan offers and boardroom resignations, finally reaching the regime change arrived at with last Friday’s EGM. Somewhere in the middle of the jumble was the SFA’s refusal, on Christmas Eve of all days, to allow Ashley to increase his shareholding. It was one of several, crucial turning points on the exceptionally winding road towards a fresh start for a club bruised and battered over the previous four years. The desperation of supporters to grasp this moment, for those who stayed away to return to supporting their team, was palpable. Some had purchased half-season tickets in the wake of the EGM, despite some of the included matches having already passed. Last night, routes around Ibrox were congested in fashion often unfamiliar this season. The stadium wasn’t full, but the 35,018 here was still the highest crowd recorded since the opening day of the season. Anyone purchasing a programme on their way in was greeted by a cover showing King with his arms around John Gilligan and Paul Murray, happily posing within the trophy room. Enthusiasm was everywhere. The question, of course, was how long it would last when confronted by the paucity of the Rangers team. Given the boos that rang out at half-time, the answer could be given as approximately 45 minutes. Fresh from a dispiriting 0-0 draw with Cowdenbeath at the weekend, McDowall’s side had actually made a pretty positive start – as if feeding off the renewed energy. Nicky Law picked out Nicky Clark with a nice cutback and the striker drilled narrowly wide from the edge of the area. Not long after, Clark was unable to generate sufficient power or direction in a header. Yet their best chance of the opening period fell to the other front man in McDowall’s 4-4-2. It was woefully spurned. Vuckic fashioned the opportunity by cutting in field to hit a deflected drive that was pushed out by Zander Clark in the Queens goal. Daly looked odds-on to polish things off but spooned the rebound over the bar on the slide. Vuckic celebrates hos goal with substitute Bilel Mohsni (left), Nicky Clark and Darren McGregor . Queens had shown a nice degree of composure in midfield and steadily began to assert themselves. Slowly but surely, the atmosphere changed. When Law was robbed on the fringe of the area by Kevin Holt after 34 minutes, the first real roar of frustration arrived. By that point, the visitors could already have been ahead. Lee McCulloch missed a defensive header to allow Gavin Reilly in behind him. He picked out Michael Paton, whose neatly-struck effort beat Lee Robinson but rebounded off the goalkeeper’s right-hand post. Ibrox heaved a sigh of relief. But it was not the last first-half scare. When Robinson was forced into evasive action to deny a fine Iain Russell strike, the loose ball spun towards Reilly. He couldn’t adjust his body quickly enough to head below the bar from around six yards out. Daly looped one wide from a Lee Wallace cross after the restart but that wasn’t the signal for a Rangers bombardment. A change was needed if a resolute and sparky Queens side weren’t going to spoil the party. One finally arrived from McDowall in the 65th minute when young Andy Murdoch was replaced by the even younger Tom Walsh. The 18-year-old at least injected a little more pace and energy to proceedings. It seemed as though Rangers had finally sneaked a winner after 78 minutes. Vuckic got a touch to a ball delivered from the left before Clark practically stumbled into it. It broke back to the Newcastle loanee who calmly angled a shot into the far corner of the net. This is, however, a team riven with weaknesses. And they were exposed yet again when Queens claimed a leveller they deserved with just four minutes to play. Bilel Mohsni – just on four minutes earlier after Lee Wallace was hurt – was typically wayward with a bungled attempt at a clearance that looped to Daniel Carmichael. He delivered into the middle, where Robinson expertly saved from Paton. There was, though, to be no denying teenager Smith, who was left with a simple finish into an exposed net.","Haris Vuckic put Rangers ahead against Queen of the South on Tuesday .

Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge, leading to the dismissal of the West Brom player . He added that rather than criticise officials they should be given support and that technology needs to be introduced. 'It is no good moaning about referees,' Pulis said. 'We have to find a way to help referees out I would definitely call for managers to have two calls each and every game when there is 30 seconds and they can have a video link up with people upstairs who can watch it on video. 'The clubs can make money - there are people who will make money to have their names up on scoreboards. It will eradicate the major decisions referees are getting wrong that actually affect games of football and we have to work hard to do that in what is the greatest league in the world. The sooner that comes in the better.' BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . A difficult task turned into mission impossible following the red card and goals from Wilfried Bony, Fernando and David Silva wrapped up a comfortable victory for the home side who are, for now, three points behind leaders Chelsea who have two games in hand. City manager Manuel Pellegrini reflected on a morale-boosting performance after a difficult week which saw them lose at Burnley and then bow out of the Champions League at Barcelona. 'Of course it is always important to return to victory when you lost the last game,' he said. 'We lost the last two games in different competitions, Wednesday in Champions League and the last game against Burnley in Premier League. It is important to return to victory.' Fernando (centre) scored City's second of the match after Bony's opener and before David Silva added a third . The Chilean added that his side are only concentrating on themselves and not on Jose Mourinho's leaders. 'We are not thinking about that,' he said. 'I spoke with the players, we play now eight games more. We can win the eight games and if Chelsea doesn't drop points, we cannot win the title. The important thing is not to think about other teams, it is to think about our team, to improve and win the next game against Crystal Palace.'","Manchester City beat West Brom 3-0 in the Premier League on Saturday .

"It still clearly rankles with Steven Naismith that injury saw him miss out on a UEFA Cup final appearance with Rangers in what now seems like another dimension, never mind seven short years ago. But the Scotland star has revealed that it’s the memory of that heartbreaking episode which is spurring him on to reach this season’s Europa League showpiece with Everton. Roberto Martinez’s men host Dynamo Kiev tonight at Goodison Park in the first leg of their last-16 tie and the hosts are expected to progress against one of the competition’s lowest-ranked sides. Steven Naismith consoles Kevin Thompson after Rangers' defeat in the 2008 UEFA Cup final . Naismith is determined to make up for that defeat, and missing the final, with Everton this season . Britain’s last remaining representatives in the tournament will have their work cut out to go all the way, with the likes of Wolfsburg, Napoli, Roma and Zenit also still in contention. But Naismith is adamant they have what it takes to challenge for the club’s second continental honour after the Cup Winners’ Cup was claimed three decades ago - and are ready to go one step better than Rangers did in 2008 when they lost to Zenit St Petersburg in Manchester. In his first campaign at Ibrox after leaving Kilmarnock, Naismith appeared as a sub in a crucial 1-1 draw at Panathinaikos that gave Walter Smith’s side an away goals victory. He was also among the replacements at Werder Bremen and in both meetings with Sporting Lisbon as the Scots kept progressing. But four days before the first semi-final with Fiorentina, he suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in a last-four Scottish Cup tie with St Johnstone. Naismith, and his then manager Walter Smith, walk past the trophy in 2008 . The Everton forward (far left) trains with his team-mates ahead of their tie against Dinamo kiev . That ended Naismith’s quest for European glory. He was a spectator at the final and didn’t play again competitively for another nine months. ‘I played in Greece back then and was on the bench a couple of times afterwards but then I got injured at Hampden,’ recalled the 28-year-old. ‘I missed the semi-finals and the final and I remember watching the penalty shoot-out in Florence that took us through on TV and I didn’t feel 100 per cent part of it. It was a great feeling to see the team win but I hadn’t travelled and it wasn’ t great to feel I was missing out. ‘This is an opportunity to make up for that. There was still a great buzz from sitting watching the final from the sidelines in Manchester. It was fantastic but it also makes me think now I’d love to get that feeling again and hopefully go one better, play in the final and win it. That’s what drives me on. ‘It’s not just that I never got to play back then but also that I want to experience the feeling we had around the club from getting to the final in the first place. 'This season when we’ve been playing in Europe, it has crossed my mind that the experiences I had with Rangers can help me, especially at this stage in the tournament. The disappointment of seven years ago, and his failure to influence it, still haunts the Scotland striker . ‘We had to be very resilient and well organised in 2008. Teams found it difficult to break us down and we did well to counter and create chances that way. 'We rode our luck a bit as well and I look at that and think it was great we got so far. It’s something Everton can look to do now too and we’ve been similar. ‘In the group stage, things went flawlessly and we played every game perfectly. We were very solid in the last round against Young Boys as well. 'As things go on, we know it will get tougher and tougher but at this stage we feel we can go further and go as far as the final. We definitely believe that.’ While many English sides have looked upon the Europa League as a distraction from domestic matters in recent seasons, that hasn’t been the case at Everton. Martinez has purposely picked strong sides to keep his team’s run going, rather than sacrifice participation in the competition for the sake of concentrating more on the Premier League. Naismith wants to get his hands on the trophy he came so close to with his former club Rangers . That has impacted on the club’s domestic performance and they lie 14th in the top flight - but hopes remain high they can strike a balance on both fronts. Naismith added: ‘After working so hard last season and being so close to the top four in the league, this was our reward. I don’t think you can treat the Europa League as if it’s not worth going 100 per cent for - and the manager has shown that in his team selections. ‘Sometimes we have found it hard to deal with having games so close together and, with a few injuries, our squad has been a bit tight because of that. 'We’ve not had many players we can rotate but full credit to the manager for keeping a strong stance in Europe. That’s why we have done so well in the competition and he will want to keep doing the same.’ Kiev aren’t the same force they’ve been in the past but Naismith still rates them and is wary of the damage they can cause on Merseyside this evening. He remains confident, however, that if Everton perform the way they can, they will keep up their challenge for silverware. ‘Dynamo are a very good team. We’ve watched them on video and we’ ll continue to do so right up to the game. They don’t get as much air time as many other sides and they’re not seen to be as glamorous but they are dangerous with very good players. 'We will need to watch them and be at our best but we came through one of the toughest groups which included Lyon and Wolfsburg. ‘To have done that with the quality we have, I don’t think we will worry about any team. We believe in the way we play and if we are at our best, we can trouble anyone.’","Steven Naismith missed 2008 UEFA Cup final when a Rangers player .

"Ravel Morrison has been training with his new club Lazio as he moves on from being released from West Ham United. The Hammers terminated Morrison's contract early in February and he is set to begin a four-year deal with the Rome-based club in the summer after signing a pre-contract agreement earlier this year. While Morrison is unable to play for his new side until the 2015-16 season, manager Stefano Pioli has seen fit to introduce the 22-year-old to his training sessions in a bid to help the new signing get used to life in the Italian capital. Ravel Morrison is now training with Lazio ahead of joining the Italian club after leaving West Ham United . Morrison was pictured at the club's Formello training base getting into the groove of things having not made a first-team appearance since December 6 when he turned out for loan club Cardiff City against Rotherham. Morrison only made two appearances under Hammers boss Sam Allardyce this season; with his last outing coming in a 3-1 home defeat to Southampton back on August 31. A series of disciplinary problems had hampered his progress at Upton Park and he was loaned to Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City - with his three-month deal at the latter cut short earlier in December. However, the England Under 21 international will now look to resume his career in Italy next season. Morrison had personal troubles in England and was criticised by manager Sam Allardyce for his attitude .

"James Tomkins has undergone surgery on his dislocated shoulder, although West Ham hope the defender will be back before the end of the season. The 25-year-old, who recently signed a new, long-term contract with the Hammers, sustained the injury during a training session last week. Tomkins' presence was certainly missed in Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal, where midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate had to play at the heart of defence with Winston Reid also absent. West Ham defender James Tomkins has undergone surgery on a dislocated shoulder . Tomkins (left) celebrates with his team-mate Cheikhou Kouyate after his goal against Manchester United . Stijn Vandenbroucke, West Ham's head of medical and sports science, suggests the New Zealand defender is again unlikely to be available when Sunderland visit this weekend, while also confirming Tomkins and young defender Doneil Henry have gone under the knife . 'Unfortunately, we have had two setbacks in the defence,' he said. 'James Tomkins underwent successful surgery on his dislocated shoulder on Wednesday and will now commence his rehabilitation, with a view to him returning to fitness before the end of the season. 'Doneil Henry injured his hamstring during his loan spell with Blackburn Rovers and, after consulting with a specialist, he will have an operation at the end of the week. 'Winston Reid is recovering and rehabbing well from the hamstring injury he suffered against Chelsea on 4 March. He is working hard on his fitness and is getting closer to a return.' Tomkins celebrates with Andy Carroll after the striker found the net against Swansea back in December . Winston Reid (right) is edging closer to his return from a hamstring injury suffered against Chelsea . The trio form part of an injury list which still includes forwards Andy Carroll and Enner Valencia. Carroll's rehabilitation is going well, says Vandenbroucke, and the England forward 'no longer needs crutches to walk and now only has a brace on the knee'. Valencia is on schedule to return after the international break after cutting his toe on a broken mug, while fellow forward Carlton Cole is back in contention after recovering from the hamstring injury sustained at Tottenham last month. There is also positive news in regards to goalkeeper Adrian, who played the full 90 minutes against Arsenal despite dislocating his finger before the match. Goalkeeper Adrian, who dislocated his finger before the weekend's game with Arsenal, is still match fit . 'Although Adrian dislocated his finger in the warm-up ahead of the Arsenal game at the weekend, he had it put back in and taped up by physiotherapist Dominic Rogan before the game,' Vandenbroucke told the club's official website, www.whufc.com, . 'Adrian played through the pain, which is not to be underestimated, and he too will be available to face Sunderland. 'Adrian avoided a fracture and ligament damage, so he has been receiving treatment by wearing a brace during the night this week to ensure his finger remains pointing in the right direction! 'He was held out of one training session as a precaution but he will be ready to play on Saturday.'","The Hammers defender has had surgery on dislocated shoulder sustained in a training session last week .

"Arsene Wenger has promised to back FA chairman Greg Dyke’s attempts to clean up football’s image and revealed how he sometimes has to silence himself to stop his touchline rage. Dyke has this week promised action to stop the intimidation of officials which he claimed had become ‘pretty scary’ after seeing the images of Chelsea players surrounding Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers. ‘He has my complete support,’ said Arsenal boss Wenger. ‘We all have to respect the referee and make their jobs as easy as possible. It’s difficult enough for the referees — they are criticised a lot, and I include myself. I do remind my players but I don’t think we have a problem with that. Greg Dyke, pictured at the Mel Brooks BFI Fellowship Dinner on Friday, promised to take action to protect referees from hoards of players surrounding them . Arsene Wenger has promised to back the Football Association chairman over stopping ref intimidation . ‘We have never been reproached so on that front I don’t question myself too much. I question myself on my individual behaviour, that’s true.’ Wenger is often quick to let off steam at the fourth official and added: ‘Even sometimes at half-time I think, “Come on, stop that, my friend”, you know? And I think in the second half I will not say a word to him any more. ‘Sometimes it helps you to get your frustration out but I don’t think it is right, honestly. That doesn’t mean I don’t do it. I do. I’ve looked back on the tapes sometimes.’ Wenger, who admits he needs to rein in his criticism of referees, talks to the fourth official on Tuesday night . The Arsenal manager has word with the fourth official during the Champions League match against Monaco . Wenger also fears the officials are getting drawn into the thick of the action when they could be more peripheral. ‘I have spoken about this with referees,’ he said. ‘Maybe they are too close today because sometimes they are in the way of the pass. I can show you situations where they hide the vision of the pass. Because they are so directly involved they are surrounded sometimes when they should keep a bit of distance.’ Wenger admits there are times when managers like to see their players showing desire and unity but agrees with Dyke and UEFA president Michel Platini, who is also investigating ways to banish the problem in European games. Eight Chelsea players surround the referee as they try to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off for PSG . ‘We want everybody to be respected and the referees are part of everybody,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘What we have to do is respect the decisions. The referees know the worst offenders but I like to think it doesn’t work. Referees are prepared for that nowadays. They are warned and they can deal with it. ‘I agree completely that you want players to be ready to fight for each other. How far does that go? You have to draw a line somewhere. You cannot go after every decision of the referee. ‘In rugby it didn’t exist. Unfortunately since they have become professional I have seen signs of them starting to question the decisions of the referees. So it may be a result of the pressure of the professional game.’","FA chairman Greg Dyke promised action to stop the intimidation of officials .

"Joe Hart has declared that he totally respects the authority of Manuel Pellegrini, as the Manchester City boss comes under increased pressure at the Etihad Stadium following defeat to Barcelona. The goalkeeper was outstanding as City were beaten 3-1 on aggregate in the Champions League last-16, with only his string of saves over the two legs preventing Pellegrini's side from an even more embarrassing result. Hart was dropped by the Chilean following a poor run of form last season, but returned soon afterwards as Manchester City went on to win the Premier League title and the Capital One Cup. Joe Hart chats to David James for a special BT Sport interview set to air at 6.30pm on Friday night . The England goalkeeper was speaking to James during ‘David James meets Joe Hart’ Hart said that Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has his full backing despite a disappointing season . This season has been less straightforward so far, but Hart, speaking to David James during David James meets Joe Hart in a special programme which airs on BT Sport 1 at 6.30pm on Friday, is adamant the under-fire manager retains his total respect. 'It was bad because I never wanted to come out the team, but I had to - the manager made his decision,' said Hart. 'I thought he was fantastic with me how he was. 'As a manager, I totally respect his authority. He had a decision to make, he didn’t just flip a board and suddenly you’re not playing. 'I just wanted to use the time for the best, and when I did come in, I wanted it to feel natural. I just wanted to slot in. I didn’t want to come in and make a million saves. I didn’t want to come in and change a game. I just wanted to slot back in, that’s the way it should be, and carry on.'

Pellegrini gestures in frustration on the touchline during Manchester City's 1-0 defeat at Barcelona . His side were eventually beaten 3-1 on aggregate in the last-16 of the Champions League . For the second time, Manchester City have  struggled in the Premier League following a title-winning campaign, and Hart admits  his side haven't been good enough this year. 'We’ve definitely got the capabilities and we’ve got the team,' he continued. 'But that’s only half the battle in this league. It doesn’t matter how good you are, or how good you think you are. It’s what you do on the day and you can lose against anyone. 'I’ve only had two (titles) to defend. I can only speak from that experience and the first one we did find hard because we’d built on everything to get it. 'I think we would openly admit that the season afterwards we expected that we would do it, that we had cracked it and that we were going to be that team. 'But we weren’t. We had to fight tooth and nail. We had to change managers. We had to change players. We had to come against all odds to win the league again last season. So I think we are all well aware of how hard it is to win the league in the first place, let alone back to back. 'But like I say, with the team and set up that we’ve got, we’ve got everything in the right places. That said, to do it is another thing and at the moment it is proving difficult. But we are going to keep trying.' Hart has won the League Cup, FA Cup and Premier League with City, but still has designs on winning the Champions League, completing a medal haul never managed by an English goalkeeper in history. He added: '(My dream is) to keep winning those three (domestic titles) as many times as possible and to try and add the European Cup to it.' Ivan Rakitic (second left) scored the only goal of the game past Hart as Barcelona won 1-0 on Wednesday . But Hart was otherwise superb during the result, with the Spanish press calling him a 'phenomenon' Hart rates Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer as the best in the world in his position . The 27-year-old stopper received praise from all corners of Europe following his display at Barcelona, with some Spanish press even referring to him as a 'phenomenon'. But Hart still rates Germany and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer as the best in the world in his position. 'His style is something that I don’t think technically you can coach,' said Hart. 'People have got wrapped up in the whole flying out and tackling people and that side of it is not for me, to be honest. 'But Manuel in terms of dominating a game, being hard to beat, winning World Cups. I remember him right back from when we played him (I didn’t play – I’d got booked in the semi-final) in the under 21 tournaments, just seeing this colossal guy in goal. 'He has kept going and from a few times of meeting him, I like everything about him. I’ve heard some very important people in football say what an animal, and what an amazing talent he is.'

"Mark Hughes has accused Steve Bruce of trying to ‘defend the indefensible’ over Maynor Figueroa’s tackle on Stephen Ireland that left the Stoke City midfielder with a deep gash in his calf. The Hull City manager responded to Hughes’ anger at the incident by insisting Ireland should already have been sent off following ‘the worst challenge on the pitch’ on David Meyler at the Britannia Stadium. A picture of Ireland’s bloody leg was revealed in the aftermath of the match but Bruce said: ‘I could show you a picture of Figueroa's ankle, he had five stitches in it and carried on.’ Ireland (left) sustained a deep gash on his leg after a challenge from Hull's Maynor Figueroa . Referee Neil Swarbrick did not give a free kick for the challenge that left Ireland with a gash in his leg . The challenge left a  wound on Ireland's leg that Stoke boss Mark Hughes said  needed 12 to 15 stitches . That has angered Hughes, his former Manchester United team-mate. ‘Steve has fallen into the trap of trying to defend the indefensible,’ said Hughes. ‘Everyone has seen the two challenges and I don't think there is any sort of comparison whatsoever. ‘The outcome is there for everyone to see so I don't think Steve did himself too much credit with his observation. ‘It's fairly easily to defend things - and I do it too - but on this occasion it was not as if the lad would be suspended. So why did Steve not just say, “It was a terrible tackle”? 'We're trying to move on but Steve did not need to do that. He did not need to say that. To defend that is incorrect.’ Stoke boss Mark Hughes has accused Hull City counterpart Steve Bruce of trying to 'defend the indefensible' Hull boss Bruce queried why Stephen Ireland was on the pitch after his challenge on David Meyler . Hughes added: ‘It looks likely Stephen is unavailable for two to three weeks. ‘Most people now have seen the picture and he’s had internal stitches as well as external, so it takes a little bit longer than a straightforward gash. ‘I’m disappointed as he was doing really well, filling the gap for Bojan.’","Stephen Ireland forced off after Maynor Figueroa tackle on Saturday .

"Tottenham will target players aged 26 and under this summer in a move that rubber-stamps Mauricio Pochettino’s policy of giving youth a platform to shine. He and recently-appointed head of recruitment Paul Mitchell are devising a clear strategy ahead of the next transfer window. The Argentine wants players who have the energy and fitness levels to suit his high intensity style of play, and he feels younger players are a necessity. Mauricio Pochettino wants players who have the energy and fitness levels to suit his high-intensity style . The purchase of Roberto Soldado from Valencia has not worked out as either party would have liked . Having sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid, chairman Daniel Levy spent £68million on proven internationals in Erik Lamela, Roberto Soldado and Paulinho — but they have failed to impress, and the club are prepared for a major loss if they can offload Soldado and Paulinho in the summer. Pochettino has shown his penchant for signing hungry and unproven talent; the captures of Dele Alli, 18, Eric Dier, 21, and DeAndre Yedlin, 21, are testament to that. Erik Lamela has also been disappointing for the north London club having arrived from Roma . Tottenham already have a youthful look with Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb, Ryan Mason, Kyle Walker, Christian Eriksen and Danny Rose all under 26. Southampton trio Toby Alderweireld, 26, Morgan Schneiderlin, 25, and Jay Rodriguez, 25, are among the club’s targets, while Burnley’s Danny Ings and Cologne centre back Kevin Wimmer, both 22, are also on Pochettino’s radar.

"Being compared to a household utensil is probably not every Premier League footballer’s idea of a compliment, but when Tim Sherwood called Fabian Delph Aston Villa’s Hoover he meant it with affection Kim and Aggie would appreciate. You know, the pair from that show that used to be on Channel 4, How Clean is Your House? Never mind. Roy Hodgson is another who recognises the need for an instrument in his England machine capable of covering large ground to suck up danger. It is why Hodgson handed Delph his international debut last August and is liable to pick the 25-year-old again. Fabian Delph has been likened to a Hoover vacuum cleaner his ability to suck up balls by Tim Sherwood . Delph covers a huge amount of ground in midfield and has been brilliant in Aston Villa's recent resurgence . Tim Sherwood has helped to turn Villa - and particularly Delph - around and improve their form of late . Hodgson names his squad for the forthcoming matches against Lithuania and Italy on Thursday and has been given reason of late to select Delph. As Villa’s season drifted into the mire under Paul Lambert, Delph’s form was a concern. Unable to impact games in a meaningful fashion, a continuation of his England career following two months out after shoulder surgery seemed uncertain. Delph was not doing anything particularly wrong, just not much special. His last three games however, since Sherwood shook the club by its neck, have seen that spark return. He scored his first goal of the season with an arrowed finish against West Bromwich Albion in that FA Cup quarter-final, he assisted his second goal of the season with a cross for Scott Sinclair against Stoke, and he has driven Villa forward with regularity. Sherwood's arrival at the club in place of Paul Lambert has changed Delph from a concern to an asset . Delph scored his first goal of the season in Villa's FA Cup quarter-final win over West Bromwich Albion . Delph's sweet strike got one over Villa's local rivals in a high-intensity game that suited the midfielder . There were reasons Villa fans mobbed him so feverishly during the West Brom pitch invasion: a goal, a combative performance, a freshly-inked contract. In that moment he was the personification of hope for the season climax and beyond. Supporters wanted a piece (quite literally in some cases when kisses turned to bites). Delph is a willing runner – hitting an average 10.59km per game, second only to Ashley Westwood in the squad – but has undoubtedly benefitted from Sherwood’s front foot policy. Earlier this season Delph would emit energy largely across the width of the pitch, now it is up and down. Delph could end up back in Roy Hodgson's England squad after his recent resurgence in form . Touch maps supplied by Opta illustrate the point. In the 2-0 defeat to Hull, Lambert’s last match in charge, Delph was in possession 92 times, 46 in each half. In the 4-0 victory over Sunderland, he had 112 touches, 41 in his own half and 71 in the opposition’s. In the 2-0 defeat to Hull, Lambert’s last match in charge, Delph was in possession 92 times, 46 in each half (left), in the 4-0 victory over Sunderland, he had 112 touches, 41 in his own half and 71 in the opposition’s . Chicken and egg scenario, perhaps. Did Delph’s advanced role come because of the big win or cause it? Villa’s possession in both games was roughly the 60 per cent mark, slightly more at the KC Stadium in fact. So it is what Delph did with the ball that changed. ‘Obviously when a new manager comes in the boys are eager to impress but he’s been nothing but positive,’ said Delph after the FA Cup win. ‘You can see a bit more desire and fight in the boys.’ Fighting back from injuries is what got Delph picked by Hodgson. A positive campaign last season followed by a summer of hard work in the gym paid off with a first cap against Norway. Michael Carrick is fit again for Manchester United and looked imperious against Tottenham in midfield . Jordan Henderson is ruling the roost at Liverpool and has been labelled as England's best midfielder . Hodgson knows that Delph offers something different to his other midfielders and could pick him again . He then started the important qualifier against Switzerland, emerging with great credit. He began the win in Estonia too, before dislocating his shoulder, ruling him out of the November squad. Months have passed but the midfield landscape is not too different. Michael Carrick is fit again and looked imperious against Tottenham. Jordan Henderson is ruling the roost at Liverpool. But Delph offers something different. A bit of brawn, a bit of beauty, a lot of industry. He remains collected. ‘England? If it happens, it happens, happy days.’","Tim Sherwood referred to Fabian Delph as Aston Villa's midfield 'Hoover'

"Stevenage boss Graham Westley has revealed police are looking into an accusation from defender Ronnie Henry that he was bitten on the hand by Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie in their 1-0 home defeat on Saturday. Labadie served a 10-match ban and was fined £2,000 in March 2014 for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks in a League Two match while playing for Torquay - a charge which he denied. Westley claimed Henry was 'horrified' by Saturday's alleged incident which happened shortly before full-time and said: 'I think it has become a police matter and when it becomes a police matter anybody in a responsible position should let it be dealt with by the authorities. Stevenage's Ronnie Henry (in the white) accused Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie of biting him . 'So in passing comment, word is around the place that there's been an incident and the police are involved. He's (Henry) not in a good situation, he's in the treatment room and he's suffered quite a nasty injury. 'Ronnie was in a state of shock, you don't go on a football pitch expecting to lose your finger and Ronnie was horrified by what has gone on because it's a football match and he's nearly lost his finger.' The game had already threatened to boil over before Labadie and Henry's clash due to the nature of Dagenham's winning goal. Labadie was clearly offside when a long ball was played forwards in his direction yet he did not touch it, Christian Doidge took over and crossed for Dean Howell to score. But only after long consultation with his assistant did referee Dean Whitestone award the goal. Stevenage manager Graham Westley said that the alleged incident had become a 'police matter' In November 2010, Luis Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and a fine by his then-club Ajax for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal. Suarez then bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic - his second victim - and the FA charged the then-Liverpool striker with violent conduct. He received a 10-game ban and a fine from his club. Then, Suarez was found guilty of biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup. The Barcelona forward was banned from all 'football-related activities' for four months and received a nine international match suspension.

"The man accused of murdering teenager Masa Vukotic claims he threw a punch at Prime Minister Tony Abbott nearly a decade ago. Mr Abbott, who was Federal Health Minister at the time, visited the Thomas Embling Hospital  in Melbourne's inner-north on February 22, 2006 when he was reportedly hit in the face by a patient. The Victorian  hospital, which is located in Fairfield, provides advanced clinical treatment and programs for patients from the criminal justice or mental health systems. Before Sean Christian Price, 31, was charged with stabbing 17-year-old schoolgirl to death, he revealed to The Age that he was the patient who punched Mr Abbott nine years ago. Scroll down for video . Man accused of murdering Masa Vukotic claims he punched Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the face in 2006 . 'I hit him and he stepped back and shaped up like a boxer,' Mr Price told The Age. 'Then he dropped his hands and smiled, and said 'I've been hit harder than that on the football field'.' A spokeswoman for Mr Abbott at the time of the incident said one of the patients 'had a go at Tony' when he was visiting several mental health service providers in Melbourne. 'It was over in about three seconds. It was so not a big deal,' the spokeswoman told AAP. '(The patient) did take a swing. He did connect, but to say he punched him is overstating it. 'The quote from Tony is: 'It is a matter of complete inconsequence'.' Sean Price (centre) arrived at St Kilda Police Station in handcuffs, flanked by homicide detectives . Masa Vukotic, 17, was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path just metres from her home on Tuesday . The revelation comes after the 31-year-old fronted Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday after he was charged with murdering Masa in a Doncaster park near her home on Tuesday night. Masa was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve shortly before 7pm in what police believe was a 'random attack'. Mr Price was also charged with six other offences including one count of rape, two counts of robbery and three counts of common law assault including an attempted carjacking.

"Jeremy Menez scored twice to help beleaguered AC Milan beat Cagliari 3-1 in front of a sparse San Siro crowd on Saturday as fans responded to a request to boycott the match in protest at the club's leadership. The Curva Sud section, which usually hosts the hardcore supporters, was almost deserted while banners, written in English, read 'Game Over' and 'Insert Coin To Save AC Milan.' The Curva Sud had called on fans to stay away because the hierarchy, they say, have undermined coach Filippo Inzaghi with their rudderless leadership and confused transfer policy. Jeremy Menez (right) scored an impressive double at an empty San Siro to help AC Milan to victory . Menez put Milan ahead in the 21st minute with a curling shot from the edge of the penalty area. Diego Farias levelled for relegation candidates Cagliari two minutes after halftime but French defender Philippe Mexes volleyed Milan back in front almost immediately. Menez completed the win by converting a penalty, controversially awarded after Alessio Cerci appeared to fall under Luca Ceppitelli's sliding tackle just outside the area. AC Milan fans boycotted the game in protest over the leadership of the Serie A giants this season . The Frenchman took his tally to 15 this season, making him joint Serie A top scorer alongside Argentines Carlos Tevez of Juventus and Mauro Icardi of Inter Milan. It was only Milan's third victory since Christmas and all have been against teams in the bottom three. Milan moved up to seventh with 38 points from 28 games while Cagliari are joint 18th in the 20-team table. Earlier, Chievo eased relegation fears by beating Palermo 1-0 to climb to 15th, 11 points clear of the drop zone.

"Chris Coleman believes Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti needs to resolve the 'political' feud between Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo for the sake of their season.

Wales manager Chris Coleman has urged Real boss Carlo Ancelotti to solve the 'political' feud . And even last weekend's 2-0 win over Levante was marked by Ronaldo histrionics after Bale scored on the rebound from one of his shots. Coleman told the Sunday Mirror: 'I look at it as a Ronaldo v Bale thing because that is how it is being framed by some people over there. 'There are pictures of expressions Cristiano makes if Baley does not pass. I was there at the start of the season and I can tell you, hand on heart, there was no problem between the two of them.

"Jordan Henderson had never been beaten as Liverpool captain. He had won eight, drawn one, and lost none, yet Sod's law dictated that record had to be ended by their great rivals. Liverpool lacked a leader in the first half, prompting Brendan Rodgers to bring Steven Gerrard on at half-time, and Henderson handed him the armband, as per. No sooner had Gerrard put it on his left bicep than he had to give it back, as he was sent off after just 38 seconds, and his deputy led Liverpool in their first Barclays Premier League defeat of 2015. Jordan Henderson had a tough afternoon as captain as Manchester United inflicted his first defeat as skipper . Steven Gerrard receives a red card after just 38 seconds in the second half after coming off the bench . The sent off  Gerrard throws the captain's armband to Henderson after being sent off early in the second half . Henderson gets the armband back after relinquishing it to Gerrard for just 38 seconds of the second half . It was in June 2012 that Henderson received criticism, namely from Joey Barton, after being selected in England's squad in place of the injured Frank Lampard. 'If Henderson got in,' Barton wrote, 'any Englishman not currently in the squad has to feel aggrieved.' Sir Alex Ferguson echoed that in 2013, writing in his book that the midfielder ran from the knees. Henderson is a different animal these days, however. Thierry Henry deems his transformation 'truly unbelievable', while England manager Roy Hodgson calls it 'meteoric'. He has grown into a leader and was preferred in the starting XI to Gerrard - the man that scored twice and celebrated by kissing the camera at Old Trafford in March 2014. Yet that authority was absent amid a dire first 45 minutes. United, with Angel di Maria on the bench, were all over the team that had not been beaten in the Premier League since December 14. By the 20th minute, Liverpool had one shot to their name - an effort from Daniel Sturridge that never troubled David de Gea. The visitors had 64.8 per cent possession, too.

It wasn't working against Louis van Gaal's quite brilliant team, and a change was needed. Liverpool had lost the four previous games in the Premier League when trailing by half-time, and Gerrard emerged from the tunnel, kitted with the captain's armband already on. His stamp on Ander Herrera meant they would be the underdogs for some 44 minutes, and Henderson could sense his unbeaten record  was about to end. Liverpool, to their credit, battled like a team that had not been beaten since late 2014. Yet  it was too little, too late, even after Daniel Sturridge gave them a glimpse of hope. That goal in the 69th minute was their first shot on target, but they could not find a second.

"The Clasico will never be quite the same after Sunday night. Amid the flying challenges, the overload of passions, the bickering and the bad blood one man has kept his head while all those around him have been losing theirs – Xavi Hernandez. But after 750 games for Barcelona it looks almost certain that after what will be his final Barcelona vs Real Madrid on Sunday the World Cup winner and brain of the greatest Barca in history will confirm he is off at the end of the season to play in Qatar. Xavi has a contract until 2016 but could now play for Al-Sadd next season instead of the club he grew up supporting as a boy. The Al-Sadd offer includes a coaching role at Qatar’s Aspire Academy with the aim of playing a part in bringing through a bright generation of Qatar internationals. Xavi is approaching the end of his contract at Barcelona and will consider his future at the end of the season . The 34-year-old midfielder has been offered a coaching role with Qatar's Aspire Academy . However, newly formed MLS side New York City FC have also expressed an interest in signing the player . The football world has always speculated over how good Xavi would be as a coach and these could be his first steps in finding out. The director of the Aspire academy is former Spanish goalkeeper Roberto Olabe and Xavi, who has experience in organizing training camps in Spain, would work alongside him as well as continuing with his playing career. He also has an offer from Manchester City's New York franchise on the table and looks set to announce his decision after the Sunday's game. If Xavi plays a part in Sunday’s showdown it will be his 29th La Liga Clasico. He has 12 wins, seven draws and nine defeats in that time scoring four goals. He pulled the strings in midfield when Barcelona regularly got the better of Real Madrid both before and after the arrival of Jose Mourinho. He played in perhaps the greatest Clasico for Barcleona when they beat Real Madrid 6-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2008. And he was the epicenter of another devastating Barcelona display two years later when Mourinho lost his first Barca v Madrid 5-0 at the Nou Camp. It was during the Mourinho era that tensions between the two clubs really came to a head and as the captain and long time friend of Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas the two came together in reconciliation after a phone call from the goalkeeper to the midfielder that was not well received by Mourinho. Xavi celebrates after scoring one of his four career Clasico goals against at the Nou Camp in 2010 . Xavi's Barca team-mates swamp the passing maestro after his goal against Real Madrid . It was a lofted goal over Casillas's head in a Clasico in 2004 that was perhaps Xavi’s best individual moment from all his meetings with Real Madrid. That game was also his now boss Luis Enrique’s last Clasico. He was brought on in the second half at the Bernabeu with Real Madrid leading 1-0 and it was Xavi’s goal that won it for Barcelona four minutes from time from a move that he had started by playing a pass to Ronaldinho. When the Brazilian clipped it over the top of Real’s defence Xavi finished past his pal and Barca took the spoils. Regardless of who wins on Sunday, football will lose because, with an estimated television audience of 400m Xavi’s poise and perfect passing will be seen in the Clasico for the last time.","Xavi Hernandez will likely play his final Barcelona vs Real Madrid on Sunday .

"Monsoon-like conditions forced the abandonment of Sunday's A-League match between the Brisbane Roar and Wellington Phoenix - a decision that could have implications on the title race. After torrential rain had left the Lang Park pitch covered in large puddles, making even short passes difficult, referee Alan Milliner decided to bring things to a premature conclusion on 73 minutes. League leaders Phoenix were leading 2-1 at the time and move four points clear at the top of the table because the result was allowed to stand.

The officials explain their decision to call off the game with 17 minutes remaining . But Roar coach Frans Thijssen reacted angrily to the decision to call off the match despite the wild weather turning proceedings into a farce. Brisbane are in contention for the play-offs and Thijssen criticised the rule that states a replay is required if the match is abandoned before half-time but the result stands if it ends after the break. He said: 'Of course I'm disappointed because this is a crazy end. 'I've never seen this, because the choice is replay if it happens in the first-half, they're the normal rules, and if it happens in the second-half you have to play the second-half again.

'And we're in a competition to be in the play-offs, so of course it's disappointing. 'When we had a free-kick in a dangerous position where we could score, they just call off the game and they give three points to one team and no points to the other team, that's not an honest competition.' Brisbane led after five minutes through Andrija Kaluderovic before Michael McGlinchey equalised for the visitors 10 minutes later. Then, moments before the half-time whistle, Australia international Nathan Burns pounced to put Wellington ahead.

"Chelsea took another giant step towards the Premier League title by seeing odd a determined effort from Hull City at the KC Stadium. Jose Mourinho's men saw their 2-0 lead wiped out by Steve Bruce's side, but Loic Remy's winner moved the Blues six points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand.

The Hull goalkeeper had little chance with Chelsea's goals. MICHAEL DAWSON - 6.5 . He had a jittery opening but improved after the change in formation. Hull City defender Michael Dawson tries to charge down a shot from Diego Costa . ALEX BRUCE - 6 . Once he got to grips with Diego Costa he got better. PAUL McSHANE - 6.5 . An early switch to right back spared him. AHMED ELMOHAMADY - 7.5 . Scored a very nice goal and is one of the Premier League’s biggest secrets. Ahmed Elmohamady scores Hull's first goal in the 26th minute to bring them back into the game . GASTON RAMIREZ - 6.5 . The 24-year-old Uruguayan was diligent and energetic before he was eventually substituted. JAKE LIVERMORE - 6 . He seemed to be taken by surprise with pace of game but eventually improved. DAVID MEYLER - 6 . Always put his body on the line. A decent enough performance. Hull City midfielder David Meyler challenges Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic . ANDY ROBERTSON - 6.5 . He made a good run down the left for Elmohamady's goal. DAME N’DOYE - 6.5 . Provided a threat to the Chelsea defence, particularly in first half. ABEL HERNANDEZ - 7 . The 24-year-old striker was denied by Thibaut Courtois once, but not twice. Abel Hernandez celebrates after scoring Hull's equaliser at the KC Stadium . SUBSTITUTES - Stephen Quinn - 6 (Meyler 80): Hull were stretched to limit by time he came on. Sone Aluko - 6 (Robertson 81): Tough for him to get a chance once Chelsea tightened up. Robbie Brady -6 (Ramirez 80): Came on as a last throw of the dice. NOT USED: Stephen Harper, Liam Rosenior, Curtis Davies, Yannick Sagbo. MANAGER - STEVE BRUCE: 6.5 - A tactical switch at 2-0 down brought Hull back in to it. CHELSEA . THIBAUT COURTOIS - 6.5 . The Belgian thought he was 'sweeper keeper' Manuel Neuer for Hernandez's equaliser - he isn’t. A triple save spared Chelsea. Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois rises high to claim the ball as Dawson tries to win a header for Hull . BRANISLAV IVANOVIC - 6.5 . An awful backpass that led to Hernandez's goal, but the Serbian was better in the second half. GARY CAHILL - 6.5 . A sky high punt towards end of first half said it all, but he was much more composed in the second half. JOHN TERRY - 6.5 . The Chelsea captain lost composure and his usual excellent organisation in a mad five minutes. Chelsea captain John Terry celebrates a victory that moved his team a step closer to winning the league . FILIPE LUIS - 6 . The Brazilian full-back was terrorised throughout by Elmohamady. RAMIRES - 5 . He was awful and substituted. Bring back the old Ramires. Ramires, pictured being tackled by Andrew Robertson, had a day to forget and was substituted . NEMANJA MATIC - 5 . He used to boss the midfield, but is  now being bossed. WILLIAN - 6 . He made a couple of decent touches and put in some hard work, but seriously, is that it? CESC FABREGAS - 7 . Credit to this guy because he never stops running and was hugely influential in the second half. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas tires to win a header against Hull's Meyler . EDEN HAZARD - 7.5 . A magnificent strike after less than two minutes to give Chelsea the lead. DIEGO COSTA - 6.5 . A sweet strike to put Chelsea 2-0 up before he was substituted with a leg injury. Diego Costa was on the score sheet before he was forced off injured in the second half . SUBSTITUTES: Oscar - 6 (Ramires 61): A change that had to happen, although Oscar is out of touch too. Loic Remy - 7.5 (Costa 75): What an impact, he scored with his first touch. Remy came off the bench to score past Allan McGregor in the 77th minute to secure a Chelsea win . Kurt Zouma - 6.5 (Willian 80) Defensive substitution to tighten it up. NOT USED: Petr Cech, Juan Cuadrado, Cesar Azpilucueta, Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

"Jose Mourinho is on course to win trophy number 22 if his Chelsea side can stay at the summit of the Premier League but instead of keeping medals as a reminder of his success - he retires the watch he wore to triumph. The Blues boss has already added watch number 21 which was a, Hublot King Power Special One, this season after lifting the Capital One Cup last month. With his cabinet of watches filling up year-by-year, Mourinho knows he's just a few wins away from adding yet another timepiece to his ever growing collection. The Chelsea boss will be hoping he can put his current watch with his collection if he wins the title . He said: 'When I win titles the gifts I buy are for my wife, my daughter and my son. But I take my watch from my wrist and I keep it. Instead of medals, I keep a watch. 'When I finish a season with a trophy, that season is represented with a watch. They're in a safe box. In this moment, I have a sponsorship deal but, previously, they weren't a particular brand. 'Previously, it was just a watch that I could feel comfortable with, especially as I come from the time when not every stadium had a digital clock and even if some did they finished at 90 minutes. 'My favourite one is the last one, as I designed it with the company and the company did it for me according to my needs - to wear on the bench with the colours I want and material and size and weight. Jose Mourinho currently has 21 watches in his collection and is looking to make it 22 this season . 'I designed it with the company, it's blue, it's my watch.' Chelsea travel to Hull on Sunday with both sides needing the three points for very different reasons. Steve Bruce's side find themselves just three points above the relegation zone coming into the final leg of the Premier League season. Mourinho's side are locked in a battle for the top spot with Manchester City and with Arsenal creeping up into contention, the Blues know that they can't afford to slip up. Diego Costa (centre) will be hoping to keep his rich vein of goalscoring form going against Hull .","Jose Mourinho reveals he retires his current watch with every trophy .

"Jamie Carragher has hailed the impact of Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who put a first-half error behind him to help the Blues to victory against Hull City. Chelsea went 2-0 up through Eden Hazard and Diego Costa, but Hull pulled level after Courtois gifted possession to Abel Hernandez just before the half-hour mark. And Carragher, speaking on Sky Sports after the game, thinks that despite his error, there are few goalkeepers as good as the Chelsea man. Thibaut Courtois made an error in the first half to gift Hull their equalising goal against Chelsea . Courtois gave away possession under pressure from Gaston Ramirez to allow Abel Hernandez to score . 'He had a bit of a mix-up in the first half,' the Sportsmail pundit said. 'He's a world class goalkeeper to keep Petr Cech out and what he did last year for Atletico Madrid, getting to the Champions League final. 'He's a fantastic keeper and he's going to be one of the world's best for a decade or so.' Speaking alongside Carragher was former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, who was in agreement at Courtois' excellent game despite the high-profile error. 'Before the mistake, he made a couple of saves that kept Chelsea in the game,' Henry noted. 'But it's not about the mistake, it's about how you respond, and he responded well in the second half.' Chelsea's 3-2 win took them back to winning ways after a draw against Southampton last time out, and restored their six-point gap ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. Jamie Carragher (left) and Thierry Henry hailed Courtois' impact in the second half to save Chelsea . Courtois made a string of saves, including three in quick succession, to help Jose Mourinho's side to victory . Their win at Hull was far from convincing, but according to Henry, getting three points in the manner Chelsea did is a mark of their winning mentality. 'Big teams will do that to you,' he said. 'Three attempts on target, three goals. It sounds simple, but that's what Chelsea are about. 'Hull were unlucky in the second half on a couple of occasions, but that's what a big team does to you. They come here, they don't really perform well, they find themselves in a difficult situation, and they managed.' One negative for Mourinho will be the injury to Diego Costa, which forced him off with 15 minutes to play holding his hamstring. Carragher thinks Courtois (pictured) will be one of the world's best goalkeepers for a decade . Carragher and Henry also believe that Chelsea's title hopes will remain successful, even without Diego Costa . Chelsea's strike force is such that Costa's absence is unlikely to be a devastating blow, and the presence of Remy in the latter stages actually forced a winner for the league leaders. 'It looks like a hamstring injury and we know his history from the Champions League final,' Carragher said of Costa. 'If it is a hamstring injury, if Remy has to come in, he's come on there [against Hull] and he's made a difference. 'He scored in the Manchester City game as well. He's not what you'd call top level, he hasn't played that much, we know Jose just likes to play the same players. He's not at Costa's level, but he's enough to go up front and take them to the title. 'They've got that gap now, if they miss him for two or three games - depending on how bad the injury is - I think they'll be fine.'","Chelsea went 2-0 up against Hull but were pegged back to 2-2 .

"Italy boss Antonio Conte has suggested that he was Manchester United's prime target last year before they appointed Louis van Gaal as their new manager. The Red Devils were in search of a new man in the Old Trafford hotseat following the ill-fated reign of David Moyes and then Ryan Giggs' short stint as caretaker manager until the end of the season, once the former was sacked in April. Both Conte and Van Gaal were available to work elsewhere ahead of this campaign as the duo left Juventus and Holland respectively. Antonio Conte has suggested that Manchester United were keen for him to become their manager last year . Conte has hinted he was their prime target before the appointment of current Red Devils boss Louis van Gaal . 'The English team that looked for me ended up signing the Coach of a national team,' Conte told TV show Grand Hotel Chiambretti. 'But my challenge with the national team is personal. Becoming a Coach where usually the job is to select players, it is inspiring.' The 45-year-old subsequently was appointed the manager of his national side in August - where he has led Italy to five wins and one defeat in his first six games in charge.

"Juan Mata struck twice for Manchester United as Liverpool were dealt a major blow to their top-four hopes and captain Steven Gerrard was sensationally sent off within seconds of coming on. Ander Herrera's through ball found Mata on 14 minutes for the opener as Louis van Gaal's side got off to the perfect start. Brendan Rodgers brought on the experience and leadership of his captain Gerrard for the second half, but in less than a minute he was soon walking off in disgrace after a stamp on Ander Herrera. Star man Juan Mata celebrates his spectacular second goal in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Liverpool . Mata scored a brilliant second in the 59th minute as he met Angel di Maria's chip into the box with a horizontal volley perfectly buried at the far post, giving Simon Mignolet no chance. Daniel Sturridge weighed in with an opportunistic finish that gave Liverpool hope but wasn't enough to prevent United securing a five-point gap between the rivals either side of the Champions League qualification places. Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler was at Anfield to assess all the players' performances. Phil Jones posted a picture with Mata to Twitter and said: 'Great result today! This man was unbelievable!' LIVERPOOL (4-3-4) SIMON MIGNOLET - 6.5 . Unlucky not to keep out Mata’s first goal but had absolutely no chance with the second. Brilliant penalty save from Wayne Rooney in stoppage time. Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet almost saves Mata's right-footed strike that put the Reds behind 1-0 . EMRE CAN - 6 . Had his hands full with Fellaini in the first half. Guilty of bringing down Blind for the late penalty. MARTIN SKRTEL - 6 . Coped well with Rooney on the whole. Frustration got the better of him when he was involved in a tussle with De Gea at the final whistle. Emre Can (left) dealt with Marouane Fellaini in the first half but fouled Daley Blind (right) for the penalty . MAMADOU SAKHO - 6.5 . Not always the most composed of defenders, but fought until the end and gave very little away. ADAM LALLANA - 5 . Wasted Liverpool’s best chance of the match after being on the receiving end of a crunching challenge from Jones, and replaced by Gerrard at half-time. Liverpool's Adam Lallana fails to hit the target with his side's best first-half chance at Anfield . JOE ALLEN - 5 . Gave away possession cheaply on several occasions and was booked for trying to win it back from Herrera. JORDAN HENDERSON - 6.5 . Battled to keep his side in the game after Gerrard’s red card. Unlucky not to connect with Moreno’s cross in the first half. ALBERTO MORENO - 5 . Slack pass early on set the tone for his performance. Spaniard was caught out of position when Mata fired United ahead. Liverpool's stand-in captain Jordan Henderson holds off Fellaini during a spirited midfield battle . RAHEEM STERLING - 5 . Very subdued indeed. Much was expected of the England star but he failed to deliver after De Gea saved at his feet early on. DANIEL STURRIDGE - 6.5 . Took his chance well to bring Liverpool back into the game after swinging wildly at a volley when opportunity knocked in the first half. Subdued by his standards on Sunday, Raheem Sterling is pressured by Manchester United's Ashley Young . Daniel Sturridge buries this opportunistic chance with a deflection of Jones' foot to peg one back . PHILIPPE COUTINHO - 7 . Liverpool’s best player, always pushing and probing. No surprise that the goal came from his incisive pass to Sturridge. In-form Liverpool forward Philippe Coutinho was his side's standout player and set-up Sturridge's goal . MANAGER - BRENDAN RODGERS: 5 . Has to take responsibility for the fact Liverpool simply didn’t turn up in the first half and played so cautiously. Substitutes: . Steven Gerrard (for Lallana 46, 1), Balotelli (for Moreno 65, 4) Substitutes not used: Jones, Johnson, Toure, Lambert, Lucas . Gerrard clatters into Juan Mata in a crunching tackle moments before his sending off after 38 seconds . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-4-1) DAVID DE GEA - 6.5 . Showed great anticipation to snuff out the danger when Liverpool threatened. Will be annoyed to have been beaten by Sturridge at his near post. ANTONIO VALENCIA - 6.5 . Another rock-solid display from the Ecuadorian who hardly put a foot wrong after a brief stumble almost let in Liverpool early on. Manchester United keeper David de Gea saves at the feet of Sterling as he snuffs out another Liverpool attack . CHRIS SMALLING - 6.5 . One of his stronger performances. Mature and composed. The England defender even got forward on occasions. PHIL JONES - 6 . Floored Lallana with a full-blooded challenge in the first half and was fortunate to only get a yellow card for a wild tackle on Henderson in the second. DALEY BLIND - 7 . Made a couple of fine interception tackles early in the game and rarely looked troubled after that. Won the late penalty. United defender Phil Jones is lucky to only be booked after this reckless challenge on Henderson . Antonio Valencia protects the ball from Lallana as United hold out a late Liverpool resurgence . MICHAEL CARRICK - 6.5 . Kept United ticking over from the base of midfield but was guilty of being caught in possession for Liverpool’s goal. JUAN MATA - 8 . What a day for the little Spaniard. He produced a composed finish to put United ahead and a spectacular one for the decisive second goal. Man-of-the-match Juan Mata spectacularly volleys from a horizontal position for what would be the winner . ANDER HERRERA - 7 . Wonderful defence-splitting pass to set up the first goal. Another impressive display but booked over the incident that saw Gerrard sent off. MAROUANE FELLAINI - 7 . Did what he does best, getting on the end of long balls and scrapping for everything. Particularly effective in the first half. Marouane Fellaini towers over Liverpool's Joe Allen as the Belgian scraps for everything for United . ASHLEY YOUNG 5.5 . A peripheral figure on the left and replaced by Di Maria less than 10 minutes into the second half. WAYNE ROONEY 6 . Anfield has never been his happiest hunting ground and was a little disappointing again, seeing his injury-time penalty saved. Wayne Rooney was a little disappointing again at Anfield and had his penalty saved late on by Mignolet . MANAGER - LOUIS VAN GAAL: 7 . The Dutchman will remember his first game in charge at Anfield fondly. It could prove pivotal in qualifying for the Champions League. Substitutes: Rojo (for Blind 90+4), Di Maria (for Young 55, 7), Falcao (for Herrera 83, 6.5) Substitutes not used: Valdes, Rafael, Januzaj, Pereira . Referee: Martin Atkinson 7 . Got the big decisions right, sending off Steven Gerrard and awarding United a late penalty. Star man: Juan Mata .

"They say you should let sleeping dogs lie - advice that one driver in China paid the price for ignoring. He drove back to his home in Chongqing to find a stray dog lying in his favourite parking spot, so he got out and kicked it. However, as far as the dog was concerned, that was not the end of the matter. A driver in China had his car attacked by a stray dog he'd kicked the previous day . Ruff justice: The dog that was kicked brought reinforcements . It returned later on with some of its pals and proceeded to exact its revenge by chewing the bodywork and windscreen wipers of the car belonging to his attacker. The vandalism was photographed by a startled neighbour, who showed the driver the next morning the evidence that a series of dents and marks on his car were caused by a pack of hounds. Stray dogs in China are sometimes grabbed off the street and thrown into dog fights. China has no animal cruelty laws, and a person who damages a dog or another animal can only be prosecuted for damaging property if the animal belongs to somebody.

"Luis Suarez should have no concerns about returning to Anfield, and should expect a warm welcome from the fans according to Brendan Rodgers. The former Liverpool striker has agreed to take part in a charity match at his old stomping ground on March 29, which will also feature club captain Steven Gerrard and retired former vice-captain Jamie Carragher, who will captain the sides. 'It'll be great. We've kept in contact since he's been away. He's a top-class player. He loved his time here at Liverpool. He always wanted to come back,' said Rodgers. Luis Suarez is going to return to Liverpool on March 29 for a charity game following his move to Barcelona . Suarez will be joined by current club captain Steven Gerrard who leaves for the MLS at the end of the season . Jamie Carragher will captain one of the teams in the match organised by the Liverpool FC Foundation . 'He's got [commitments] internationally but he's making every effort off his own bat to come back. It'll be brilliant to see him and great for the supporters.' Suarez left the Merseyside club under a dark cloud, having been banned for four months after biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at last summer's World Cup in Brazil. As his switch to Barcelona was confirmed during the close season, the 2014 PFA Player's Player of the Year was unable to say farewell to his adoring fans at Anfield following a season that saw him eventually net an impressive 31 Premier League goals. However the Uruguay international will hope to get that chance later this month in the fixture organised by the Liverpool FC Foundation, depending on his international duties. Suarez left the Reds for Barcelona in the summer after a season that saw him score a total of 31 league goals . The Uruguay international left on somewhat unconventional terms during his ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini . The striker scored a brace on his return to England in Barca's Champions League win over Manchester City . 'He loved Liverpool while he was here. He's gone to another country, but he's certainly adored here. The supporters loved having him here. 'Every time he stepped on to a training pitch, he gave everything. He'll probably want to win this game as well.' The Reds host Blackburn in the FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday, and Rodgers has his eyes set firmly on the prize. 'We want to make the top four and win a trophy. The objective is clear: To arrive as high as we can, not just fourth, and to win a trophy. If we can do that, then that will be success.'","Luis Suarez will make an incredible return to Anfield in a charity match .

"Steven Gerrard's stunning red card during the 2-1 defeat by Manchester United was a 'moment of madness' borne out of 'frustration', according to former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher. Gerrard was sensationally sent off within 38 seconds of coming on the pitch at Anfield, after stamping on Manchester United's Ander Herrera. Brendan Rodgers left out Gerrard from the starting line-up but came on at the start of the second-half to rally the troops, however soon found himself walking back to the stands. Steven Gerrard is shown the red card by referee Martin Atkinson after just 38 seconds of the second-half . Gerrard can't believe it after being sent off for a reckless stamp on United's Ander Herrera at Anfield . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard spoke to Sky Sports after the match to apologise to team-mates and fans . 'There's no doubt that not playing at Swansea (in Liverpool's last game) and then not playing this game would be a frustration,' Carragher told Sky Sports. 'He's been at Liverpool 17, 18 years, he's always been the man, the captain, there's never been a case where he's been out of the team and as soon as he's fit he goes straight back in the team. 'This is the first time I think, last week at Swansea and today, that hasn't happened, so there'll be frustration there. 'Watching the first half from the bench he'd have been disappointed, Liverpool weren't playing well, they were losing 1-0. Juan Mata (top) was on the receiving end of Gerrard's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch . Here is the stamp from Gerrard on Herrera after both players had competed for the ball . 'But there would have been more frustration. I think he'd have been watching players in his position performing not great and thinking, 'Why am I not playing, why am I not on that pitch?' Carragher and his Sky Sports colleagues called for Gerrard to enter the fray at half-time and maintained it was the right call when he replaced Adam Lallana. 'Steven Gerrard is an emotional player. You see that in his career and it's taken teams I've played in into some unbelievable moments. 'Sometimes he hasn't played with his brain in terms of when he's done well, it's been his heart - the (FA) Cup final against West Ham, Istanbul (the Champions League final). That wasn't Steven Gerrard playing with a cold, calculated head, that was just playing from the heart. He can do special things like that,' added Carragher. Gerrard clearly puts all his downwards force into Herrera's right leg after the pair collided . Gerrard flings back the captain's armband towards his team-mates having been sent off at Anfield . A evidently devastated Steven Gerrard leaves the pitch after just 38 seconds having been sent off . 'But on the flip side of that, when he plays in games like this and he comes on maybe a bit frustrated - he's had seven red cards in his career, four of them have been Everton and Manchester United, two each now. An Everton one was coming off the bench, an Everton one was 15, 20 minutes into a game. I think the United other one was an FA Cup game in the first half and if I think right they were all straight reds. 'There's no doubt being a local player, the emotion of these occasions, the frustration coming into this game, has contributed to the moment of madness.' He added: 'It's a straight red there's no arguments with that. You can't do that on a football pitch, he's been rightly given his marching orders. Gerrard has scored the most goals in the history of Liverpool's matches against Manchester United . The 34-year-old has played 34 times against Manchester United during his prestigious career at Anfield . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers felt Gerrard could have been frustrated by his side's first-half show and acted accordingly. 'Steven gave an apology to the players and himself, it was probably frustration, he's an honest guy, very competitive and probably frustrated at the first half watching us,' he told Sky Sports. 'He's come on and unfortunately got sent off.' Asked if he accepted his captain's apology, Rodgers said: 'Yeah, he knows as well as anyone it's difficult to play big games with 10 men. He's a wonderful character.' Ahead of kick-off Carragher admitted he was not surprised by Brendan Rodgers' decision to name Steven Gerrard on the bench for Liverpool's crunch clash against Manchester United. A stunned Gerrard walks off the Anfield pitch having been shown a straight red card for a stamp on Herrera . Gerrard, who faced rivals United for the last time in a Liverpool shirt, had to make do with a place on the bench as Rodgers decided to go for a central midfield duo of Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen. And Carragher felt it was the right decision. Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of the Anfield battle, the former Liverpool defender said: 'No I'm not surprised. 'He's only played 20 minutes against Swansea recently because he's been injured. 'Is Steven Gerrard a better player than Joe Allen? Yes. But for Brendan Rodgers we've got to remember than Gerrard is leaving in the summer and Allen will be here next season. So although Rodgers is aiming for the top four that certainly comes into it.","Steven Gerrard was named on bench for his side's match against United .

"Super Saturday certainly lived up to its name as the final three games of the RBS 6 Nations served up a veritable try-fest in Rome, Edinburgh and London. Wales and England’s efforts proved in vain as Ireland claimed their second title in succession thanks to their 30-point drubbing of Scotland in Murrayfield. Following a frantic finale, Sportsmail’s Rory Keane points out six things we learned from this year’s championship. Ireland's players celebrate with the Six Nations trophy at Murrayfield after being crowned champions . Attitude is everything . After four rounds of claustrophobic, defence-orientated rugby – the floodgates opened up on the final day of the 2015 RBS 6 Nations. Plenty has been said in recent weeks about the state of the modern game. Kick-chasing, rush defences and negative tactics have led to some turgid contests in this season’s tournament. Tries and big points totals were the order of the day on Saturday, however, and what a difference it made to all three contests as Wales, Ireland and England threw everything into their late title bids. Running rugby, offloads and daring play were on display across Europe as Ireland did enough to claim the trophy. The game doesn’t need to change; it’s just a question of mindset. Ben Youngs goes over the line to give England an early lead in their Six Nations clash with France . England have the firepower to match anyone on their day . England relied on their forward power to dig themselves out of a hole against Wales in the opening round, but it was the backs who rescued the contest against France…and almost secured the championship. In a frantic game of rugby played at breakneck speed - the likes of Ben Youngs, Jonathan Joseph and Jack Nowell tore the French defence to shreds. George Ford, aged just 22, looks the real deal at fly half and is developing a world class half back pairing with Youngs. All Ford needs now is a foil at inside centre to add width and a kicking option to England’s attack. Exeter Chiefs playmaker Henry Slade could very well be the answer to that conundrum. Stuart Lancaster’s side are by no means the finished article but if they can fuse their monstrous pack, efficient set-piece and exciting wide men together, they could be serious contenders for the William Webb Ellis trophy. England's Jack Nowell dives over the line to score Stuart Lancaster's side's second try . France remain an enigma locked in a riddle . Phillipe Saint-Andre has overseen another disappointing tournament for Les Bleus, but his side showed at Twickenham that they can certainly play when the mood takes them. Following four rounds of stuttering attacking play, Scott Spedding, Maxime Mermoz and Noa Nakaitaci ran amok at Twickenham. Sweeping backline moves, offloads and counter-attacking ballast; where was this French team hiding? A special mention for monstrous loosehead prop Vincent Debaty who tracked Nakaitaci’s weaving run to touch down in the left corner. It summed up France’s attitude on the day. Interestingly, France arrived in London boasting the meanest defence in the tournament only to then leak a flurry of tries. France remain an enigma, but one thing is certain, Saint-Andre has plenty of work to do if his side are to make any impression when they return to England for the big one in September. Noa Nakaitaci touches down for France at Twickenham to score a controversial try . The Green Machine will be hard to stop . Ireland bounced back from their setback against Wales with a powerful performance against the Scots. Joe Schmidt’s side went back to basics with their intelligent kicking game complemented by a strong set-piece and canny power plays. But Ireland also showed thay can attack with ball in hand and expanded their game to allow the attacking talents of Robbie Henshaw, Jared Payne and Tommy Bowe to flourish in the wide open spaces of Murrayfield. Ireland will have their detractors but back-to-back Six Nations titles speak for themselves. If Schmidt’s side can add some extra guile to their attacking game in the coming months, they will be serious contenders for the forthcoming World Cup. Jared Payne (left) celebrates scoring his try with Tommy Bowe and fly half Johnny Sexton (right) No 3 is the No 1 issue for Wales . Wales finished the tournament like a runaway train but Warren Gatland will have nightmares about the mincing his side’s scrum took against Ireland and Italy. The Welsh have some of the most devastating strike runners in the game in the form of George North, Jonathan Davies and Jamie Roberts while Sam Warburton had one of his best tournaments to date. Having all that talent out wide counts for nothing, however, if a solid platform is missing. Samson Lee’s long-term injury at tighthead has created a huge void for Gatland. Veteran Adam Jones insists his Test days are over but, if Gatland wants Wales to mount a serious challenge at the World Cup, he may have to swallow his pride and give Jones a call. Samson Lee's absence through injury has left a huge void in the Wales side . Rome has fallen . Saturday’s contest in Rome served up yet another final day capitulation from the Azzurri. This is becoming quite the habit for the tournament whipping boys. Wales were impressive but some of the Italian defence was laughable at times. There is no question that Italy’s presence has benefited the tournament greatly, but big improvements are needed going forward. Sergio Parisse is unquestionably world class but the Stade Francais No 8 has been carrying the burden of a nation for long enough. There are some grounds for optimism for Italy though with the likes of Luca Morisi and Leonardo Sarto showing glimpses of attacking potential throughout the tournament. Sergio Parisse grimaces as he leaves the pitch during the Six Nations i match between Italy and France .","Ireland were crowned Six Nations champions after beating Scotland .

"Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson has revealed he wanted to protect his side's younger players when he decided to confront Chelsea striker Diego Costa during a Capital One Cup clash at Anfield. Henderson decided to square up to Costa during the encounter, which took place back in January, before confronting the Spain international inside the tunnel. The 24-year-old, speaking exclusively to the Sunday Telegraph, has stated why he decided to approach Costa. Liverpool ace Jordan Henderson (centre) confronted Diego Costa (right) during a Capital One Cup clash . Henderson was unhappy with the way Costa (far left) conducted himself during the match back in January . Henderson said: 'I didn't want to make any statement. It was just in that game, he was trying to intimidate some of our younger players, which I didn't really like. 'He's a fantastic player that any team would want because of that passion and aggression he's got. I just don't like the way he was doing things with our players.' Henderson, who is expected to start against Manchester United in his side's crunch clash at Anfield, has been tipped to replace Steven Gerrard as Liverpool captain at the end of the season - and the former Sunderland man is keen to take up the role. He added: 'It would be an absolute honour to be captain. I'd love it. At the same time, we have a lot of leaders and characters in the group that could do it as well.

"A broken neck would have put paid to most men's hopes of achieving anything in life, but instead it drove Warrick Brant on to becoming Australia's strongest man. Warrick, whose sister Lauren appeared in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here earlier this month, suffered the traumatic accident playing rugby union when he was only 20 years old. The future had initially looked bright for the young prop who presented Australia at under-19 and under-21 level in 1998 and 1999.

It was just one of those things – an unfortunate training accident,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I was in hospital for about a month and had two surgeries. I was in a neck brace for six months.’ The road to recovery was a long one. Just being able to drive his car again was a big ask, but it could have been worse. Fed up with bodybuilding he began competing in strongman events to better utilise his training . Warrick competes in the World's Strongest Man competition in Los Angeles last year. In this event he had to pull two trucks -the blue and maroon one behind are tied together - along a strip of road. Warrick holds his sister Lauren above his head at an event to raise funds for the McGrath Foundation in Brisbane. Lauren recently appeared in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . ‘When I first got injured I could not use my right arm at all because I’d lost all my feeling in it. I couldn’t even eat my dinner; I had to use my left hand all the time. It was a pretty tough time,’ he explained. The physical suffering he endured though was nothing compared to the mental anguish he went through at the time. ‘It’s not just the loss of a sport that you’ve loved all your life, but it’s the loss of a potential income as well,' Warrick told Daily Mail Australia. 'Professional rugby was thriving, especially in England, and I thought I was set for life. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. In this event at the World's Strongest Man competition in Los Angeles last year Warrick has to throw kegs of different weights over a bar five metres in the air . ‘I don’t think I’ve ever got over it. I wouldn’t say I’m bitter but I’m still disappointed. I’m now working flat out and struggling to pay bills, which is the complete opposite to what I would have had if I’d been a professional rugby player. ‘But I have to remind myself that it could have been much worse and I may not have been able to even walk, so I have to constantly remember that.’ Contact sport was now out for Warrick. He soon put on a huge amount of weight and didn’t know what to do with himself until a friend came up with an idea – why not try bodybuilding? After moving into powerlifting in 2005 he set an Australian record in the discipline . ‘I had become depressed and was eating everything in sight. My weight ballooned,’ he said. ‘But my friend got me back in the gym training again and a year later persuaded me to get on stage and compete in the Queensland Bodybuilding Championships. ‘It was the best thing I could have done and my confidence started coming back.’ But after a year of this Warrick realised that what he enjoyed was the strength side of training rather than the appearance. The Atlas Stones is one of strongman's signature events. Here Warrick raises one off the floor. The stones range in weight from 140-200 kilos. Instead of showing people his toned body he wanted to show them how strong he was. He did this by lifting massive weights in the gym to start with, before moving into powerlifting where in 2005 he set an Australian record in the discipline. It was a simple transition after that to start competing in strongman competitions. ‘I always watched them on TV growing up. It was great to watch because they were big and strong, but they were also amazing athletes,’ Warrick said. The fact that competitors were great athletes as well as being immensely strong was what attracted Warrick to taking part in the events . Warrick first competed in America’s Strongest Man in 2008 and 2009. The rest as they say is history. Last year he won the Southern Hemisphere’s Strongest Man title in Melbourne and Australia’s Strongest Man crown. He is also the only Australian to make the final of the World’s Strongest Man competition. Unfortunately a muscle tear will rule him out of the 36th year of the World’s Strongest Man competition later this month in Malaysia, but he has nothing to prove at this stage. He has pulled and lifted airplanes, trucks and buses over the years. But it's apparently easier than it sounds. Warrick puts much of his success down to his wife Bethany who also acts as his nutritionist and physiotherapist . ‘You can’t really train for it. You can’t go up to an airport and asked them to pull one of their planes. But funnily enough it’s not the hardest thing to do,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘It’s more like conditioning work. It’s like doing a high-rep squats session where you just keep your legs moving. It may look spectacular but in reality it isn’t.’ Not that being Australia’s Strongest Man makes him the most famous person in his family. His sister Lauren was a member of the Australian pop group Hi-5 and recently appeared on television in I’m A Celebrity Get me Out Of Here. Lauren Brant (left) keeps in shape by working out regularly in her brother's gym at the Gold Coast . Warrick's daughter Indiana was born seven weeks premature in December, but is now healthy and happy . Feeling the strain: A muscle tear has ruled Warrick out of the 36th World’s Strongest Man competition in Maylaysia . His well known sister trains at the gym Warrick runs in the Gold Coast. Generally she does her workouts with her fiancée Warren. ‘Lauren trains at my gym every day and is into general fitness. She trains there with Warren regularly. All my family is into sport in some way or another. We’ve got a very athletic background,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. The 35-year-old trains four times a week for three hours each session doing a variety of weights regimes that will depend on the kind of strongman competition he'll be competing in. Generally he weighs in at between 145-150 kilos. Warrick attributes much of his success to his wife Bethany who is a former bodybuilder too. She has travelled with him to strongman competitions across the globe. ‘She acts as my trainer, my nutritionist, and my physiotherapist. She always makes sure I’m in perfect condition for every event,’ he said. Warrick's story proves that with dedication and perseverance you can still achieve your goals . The couple had their first baby, a girl called Indiana, in December. And it sounds like she also has her father’s fighting spirit. ‘She was born premature and arrived seven weeks early. She was three weeks in hospital in the Intensive Care Unit, but she’s all healthy now and doing well,’ Warrick said.","Warrick Brant broke his neck while training with the Queensland Reds .

"Devon Still shared some amazing news about his daughter Leah on Tuesday. The Cincinnati Bengals star wrote that 4-year-old Leah, who has been bravely battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma for the past year, may finally be free of the disease. 'That moment you get the best news you've ever received and don't know what to do so you just flex!!' wrote Still on his Instagram page. 'We got Leah's MIBG Scans back tonight and the doctors told us they didn't see any active disease in her body!!!' Scroll down for video . Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Tuesday that his daughter Leah (above) may be cancer free . Leah has been been battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma since last June, and captured the hearts of millions as she fights the disease . Still shared the news of his Twitter and Instagram . He went on to say; 'We still have to wait for her MRI and bone biopsy results later this week. But the doctors feel very optimistic about them because of the results from today. So for now we celebrate!!' Leah's journey has been followed by millions since she first began receiving treatment last June at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In September she had a tumor removed from her abdomen, and last month received what could be her final round of chemotherapy. She has also stayed remarkably active, walking in the Levi's Kids fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February and appearing in a music video for the song Truly Brave, a mashup of the Sara Bareilles song Brave and the Cyndi Lauper classic True Colors that was commissioned by Today anchor Hoda Kotb to raise funds for pediatric cancer research. In addition, she and her father have written a children's book to help other kids that are going through cancer treatment. Leah and her dad have also written a book that aims to help children who are battling the disease . The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad during the preseason so he could spend time with his daughter and receive their medical insurance . Leah's MBIG scans showed no active disease in her body, though the family is still waiting on an MRI and bone biopsy results . Last November, the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Still jerseys. The team also honored Leah during a ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game since she had begun her treatment - and see her father play. The Bengals also helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. And they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage.","Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Tuesday that his daughter Leah may be cancer-free .

"Luis Suarez hailed his second-half winner against Real Madrid as 'the most important goal' of his Barcelona career. With 55 minutes on the clock and the scoreline locked at 1-1 after Cristiano Ronaldo had cancelled out Jeremy Mathieu's opener, the Uruguayan trapped a long punt forward by Dani Alves and then arrowed the ball past Iker Casillas to restore Barca's lead at the Nou Camp. Luis Enrique's side went on to dominate the remainder of the game and won 2-1, thus building a four-point advantage at the top of the Primera Division table.

Goalscoring hero Luis Suarez poses for a pic with fellow frontmen Messi and Neymar after the victory . Luis Suarez fires home the winner past Iker Casillas to send Barcelona on their way to victory . Suarez celebrates scoring the goal that sent Barcelona four points clear at the top of La Liga . The strike was Suarez's 14th in all competitions for Barcelona since he made his £75million move from Liverpool last summer. And the 28-year-old had no doubt this was his most crucial goal for his new club, ranking it above the two he netted against Manchester City in the Champions League last month. 'This is the most important goal I've scored for Barca and it has an extra significance because of the rival we were playing against,' Suarez told Barcelona's official television Channel. 'I just tried to take advantage of the space between defenders and be as fast as I could so I didn't give the centre-backs any time to recover. Luckily it went in. 'The dressing room is very happy, we knew this was a really important game if we wanted to stay top of the league and increase our advantage.' Barca coach Luis Enrique sang the striker's praises after the game, calling the goal 'an action that only few players are capable of'. 'We are very happy that he is a being decisive player for us and we are very happy with his attitude and what he brings to this team,' he said. 'He brings a lot to the team he is not just a classic centre forward, he also links up with his team-mates. He's a player that marvellously compliments the squad we have, and that's why we signed him.' Jeremy Mathieu headed home the opening goal for Barcelona in the first half . Cristiano Ronaldo equalised for Real Madrid but was unable to stamp his authority on the game . Madrid now have 10 weeks to catch up with Barcelona, who have won 19 of their 21 matches in 2015. Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti lamented the fact his side failed to keep a 'cool head' after the break, following their strong performance in the opening 45 minutes. 'We were playing very well until their second goal and from then on the game was very difficult for us,' said the Italian in his post-match press conference. 'Before that we were doing well, we pressed well and were solid at the back. We lacked a cool head to turn the game around, we kept playing long balls and trying to execute difficult passages of play.' This is Ancelotti's third defeat in four league games against Barcelona and, if his side cannot bridge the four-point gap with the Catalans, he will have failed to win the Spanish league title in his first two seasons with Madrid. However, the man who delivered Los Blancos their long awaited 10th European Cup last season dismissed the suggestion his side would now focus their attention on the Champions League, with a quarter-final tie against neighbours Atletico Madrid coming up next month. He said: 'The league is not over, they have the same points advantage that we had before but anything could happen. 'We're not going to give a priority to either competition, the priority for us is the league and the Champions League.'","Luis Suarez scored the winner as Barcelona beat Real Madrid .

"Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud is targeting a perfect finish to the season to pile the pressure on Barclays Premier League title contenders Chelsea and Manchester City. The Gunners kept up the heat on leaders Chelsea and second-placed City on Saturday evening following their hard-fought 2-1 victory at Newcastle. Two seasons ago, Arsene Wenger's men responded to their Champions League exit by putting together a run of eight wins and two draws in their final 10 league games and, having succumbed to Monaco last Tuesday evening, Giroud is looking for a similar surge towards the finishing line. Francis Coquelin (left) and Calum Chambers (right) congratulate Olivier Giroud after his second goal . He told the club's official website www.arsenal.com: 'It's nice for the team because we are on a really good run, even if we were disappointed about the Champions League. We want to finish really strongly and finish in the best position by winning every single game. 'There are still eight games to play, so we need to focus on our games and step by step we're going to see. First we need to win every single game and then after we need to see if City or Chelsea miss one of these steps. 'You never know, you have to believe in football and that's why we want to win every single game.' Olivier Giroud gives Arsenal the lead in the 28th minute at Newcastle, latching onto Danny Welbeck's header . The French striker celebrates his first goal of the game with team-mates Gabriel Paulista and Welbeck (right) Giroud holds off his marker to head Arsenal into a two-goal lead just four minutes after opening the scoring . The victory at St James' Park extended Arsenal's winning league run to six games and, while it looked as though it would arrive in routine style after Giroud's first-half double, they were ultimately grateful for the excellence of goalkeeper David Ospina, who produced a series of second-half saves to keep the resurgent Magpies at bay. Giroud opened the scoring with 24 minutes gone when he bundled home Danny Welbeck's flick-on from a Santi Cazorla free-kick and he extended the lead just four minutes later when he made the most of some insipid defending to head Cazorla's corner past Tim Krul. However, Moussa Sissoko reduced the deficit within three minutes of the restart when he swept home Remy Cabella's cross and, had Ospina not managed to beat away a Mike Williamson header and Ayoze Perez's deflected 87th-minute shot, the home side would have emerged with a point. Sissoko points to the sky as he celebrates scoring Newcastle's first Premier League goal since February 28 . Giroud, who now has nine goals in his last nine games in all competitions, salutes Arsenal's travelling fans . Arsenal look dejected during their disappointing performance against Monaco in the Champions League . Wenger said: 'I would say the spirit of the team and the quality of the players, the mental quality of the players - they are outstanding guys and it's a pleasure to see how they behave. It's a credit to the club as well to see that quality on the behavioural front and how much they want to do well. 'We are a stronger team today than we were in September - that's down to the focus of the whole club, of the whole staff and the quality of work the whole staff puts in. 'Let's hope we can go from strength to strength now until the end of the season.' There were positives too for Magpies coach John Carver, who was forced to field a makeshift defence as injury and suspension took their toll, despite the fact that former boss Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace leapfrogged his team as a result of their 2-1 win at Stoke. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger gives out instructions during his side's sixth successive Premier League victory . His concentration swiftly turned to the Wear-Tyne derby on April 5, a game he cannot afford to lose after four successive defeats by Sunderland, whose need is even more pressing as they find themselves entrenched in another fight for top-flight survival. Carver said: 'It's good to put in a good performance just before a derby game and we have already touched on it because our preparation starts now for it and we have got to get focused for it because we have not had a win against them for a while. 'It's very important that we are focused for it, and we will have a normal week. There is no time off this week, we will have a normal week - Monday, Tuesday, off Wednesday, in Thursday, Friday - so our preparation starts now and we know it's a big game.'","Arsenal beat Newcastle 2-1 on Saturday to keep up with the leaders .

"Paying a player northwards of £100,000 a week to be an occasional impact sub off the bench is an expensive business, even for a side who have Premier League title aspirations. And, judging by Arsene Wenger’s decision to leave him sat in his tracksuit throughout the entirety of the 2-1 victory over Newcastle United, Theo Walcott seems to have become just that at Arsenal. Indeed there was, for portions of this match, a sense that Olivier Giroud, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck could form a clinical strike force in the Premier League for years to come – while Walcott warmed up on the touchline. Yet, even in the second half when things were not going right for Arsenal and they needed a spark to reignite them, Wenger instead turned to Tomas Rosicky ahead of Walcott to give some added impetus. And, as much as Walcott will have enjoyed seeing his side keep the pressure up on second-placed Manchester City, you can’t help but feel the England forward must be contemplating lowering his reported wage demands if he wants to stay at the Emirates. Theo Walcott has stalled on talks over a new deal with the winger wanting wages of over £100,000 a week . The England international was left on the bench for the game against Newcastle and didn't feature . Wojciech Szczesny and Walcott have both found their chances limited this for Arsenal this season . Because, put simply, where do you fit him into this Gunners side? Giroud is on fire and is leading the line superbly – he has scored 11 goals in 12 Premier League starts this season after his two at St James’ – Welbeck caused problems all afternoon, contributing an assist for the first and he also should have netted at least twice, while Sanchez, although visibly tired, was still able to produce that little bit of magic to keep the Gunners on the front foot. Walcott is not an automatic selection anymore, and therefore he cannot be too ambitious with his wage demands. Arsenal’s form is superb – they have won 14 of 16 games since New Year’s Day – and they have achieved that largely without Walcott’s presence. The 26-year-old – yes, he is really still that young – has started just three top-flight games all season after returning from injury, and the Gunners haven’t exactly missed him. 2014/15 - All competitions . 11 appearances (5 starts), 3 goals . Overall - All competitions . 294 appearances (190 starts), 72 goals . Right now the Gunners are playing with pace and panache – displayed perfectly when Welbeck, Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey combined to take Arsenal from one side of the field to the other, only for Mike Williamson to make a timely interception. This was just one example of when Arsenal’s front men wreaked havoc in an awesome first-half display. Yet, despite that, their goals at St James’ Park came from a direct source. Giroud loves scoring against Newcastle anyway, and now has eight in seven against them, but the way he calmly kneed in his first after Welbeck’s flick-on highlights a player with confidence. His second was also a decent header, although he didn’t even have to jump off the ground so feeble was the challenge offered up by Williamson. Unfortunately for Walcott, height and an aerial presence will make Giroud first-choice centre forward every time. Alexis Sanchez (left) has been a revelation since signing for the club from Barcelona in the summer . Oliver Giroud (12) scored an impressive double at St James' Park to continue his excellent form . Despite returning from a serious injury, Walcott has struggled to earn a place in Wenger's starting 11 . Welbeck offers an abundance of pace and energy and can play anywhere across the front three, while Sanchez on his day is simply world class. They may not have been at their absolute best against Newcastle, but they got the job done. But on saying all of that, if Wenger does not offer Walcott a new deal then he risks losing a player with more than 200 games’ worth of Premier League experience and 47 strikes in England’s top flight to one of his rivals. Is he really willing to risk that? Perhaps though, given Walcott’s shocking injury record, Wenger thinks he has replaced one ‘W’ for another – with the £16million acquisition of Welbeck increasingly looking like a piece of shrewd business by the Frenchman. Will Walcott or Wenger blink first in this latest of many contract disputes the England winger seems to have had with the club?

"Saracens defeated defending champions Exeter 23-20 to claim the LV= Cup title at a sun-drenched Franklin's Gardens on Sunday. Rob Baxter's side could not follow up last season's success as they struggled to cope with a powerful Sarries outfit who were able to call upon the services of England internationals Alex Goode, George Kruis and David Strettle as well as Argentina centre Marcelo Bosch. Tries from Strettle (two) and Nick de Jager did the damage with Ben Spencer adding eight points from the boot. Maro Itoje (centre) lifts the LV= Cup title after Saracens beat Exeter 23-30 on Sunday . David Strettle led the way for Saracens with two tries against Exeter at Franklins Gardens . Strettle touches down his second try as for Saracens against Exeter in the final for his team . Exeter replied with a brace of tries from Max Bodilly with Ceri Sweeney kicking two penalties while replacement fly half Gareth Steenson kicked two conversions late on. Bodilly's early error handed Saracens an attacking scrum when the Exeter full back's long kick went dead in goal. The Sarries pack capitalised on their first set-piece and decimated the Chiefs pack allowing Ben Spencer to post the first points of the afternoon. The Chiefs responded immediately with winger Tom James making a scything run through the Sarries defence before he was hauled down inches short of the line. Sireli Naqelevuki, Jerry Sexton and Ben White carried on the attack before Brett Sturgess was held up over the line. Their efforts did not go unrewarded, however, as Sweeney kicked a three-pointer to level up the scores. Sarries were dealt a big blow just before the break when Spencer was sent the sin-bin for failing to roll away at the ruck following a powerful break from powerful Chiefs centre Hughes. Sweeney made no mistake from the tee to give his side a deserved lead heading into the break. Sarries began the second half a man down but it was the Chiefs who found themselves under pressure as Strettle intercepted White's wayward past to sprint over for the opening try of the game. Goode, who had replaced winger Mike Ellery late in the first half, could not add the extras from the touchline. Strettle soon has his second try as the Sarries winger pounced on Spencer's perfectly-weighted kick to touch down in the left corner. Goode failed with the extras once more but it mattered little as Saracens established a 13-6 lead. Saracens were in the ascendancy and, following a superb break from Spencer, flanker De Jager powered over from close range in the 62nd minute to further extend his side's lead. Max Bodilly (centre) spearheaded Exeter's response but his side were denied in the final minute . Saracens duo Juan Figallo (left) and Tim Streather celebrate with the trophy after the victory . But Exeter came roaring back into the contest as Bodilly went crashing over in the corner following a superb long pass from James. Steenson fired over the touchline conversion to make it a seven-point game with 10 minutes remaining. The Chiefs were playing with their tails up and monopolised possession in the closing stages and they soon had their crucial touchdown as Bodilly crashed over again. Steenson fired over the conversion to cap off a superb comeback from the Chiefs. Spencer had the final say, though, as he held his nerve to kick a last-minute penalty to break Chiefs' hearts and secure the title for Saracens.","David Strettle crossed the line twice for Saracens against Exeter .

"Joe Schmidt is hoping his champion Ireland team won’t get distracted by the massive World Cup hype now surrounding them after they clinched back-to-back Six Nations championships in the most dramatic fashion. Just 180 days away from kicking off their global campaign on September 19, Schmidt has finally admitted he is targeting a first semi-final spot in the tournament. However, he hopes the tide of optimism after a second successive title and a run of 11 wins in 12 matches won’t be too much of a burden for Ireland to carry in six months’ time. Joe Schmidt hopes his Ireland team won't be distracted by the World Cup hype now surrounding them . The Ireland players celebrate as they are crowned Six Nations champions in Edinburgh on Saturday . ‘Based on the comments of some people, including some of our own people, we’re not that much of a threat,’ said Schmidt. ‘Hopefully we can continue to stay a little bit under the radar, but I’m not sure if we can. Maybe we have blown that,’ he added when asked by Sportsmail what message was sent to the world by Ireland winning successive titles for the first time since 1949. ‘I just think it’s going to be an incredibly tough tournament. We’ve never made a semi and everybody knows that is where we’ve got to try to get to. ‘That is what we will work towards and probably the low-key approach. If we can take that into that challenge, it would be great because you can get distracted and that is always a risk. ‘The fact that we just managed to get the silverware is a testament to the group we’ve got.’ Paul O'Connell holds aloft the Six Nations trophy at Murrayfield after Ireland were crowned champions .

"Kelvin Davis had gone almost 15 months since his last appearance in the Barclays Premier League but Ronald Koeman thinks it was worth the wait. Part of a Southampton team boasting Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana, and managed by Mauricio Pochettino, Davis let in three against Chelsea that day in January 2014. Yet on Saturday, like a blast from the past, the 38-year-old goalkeeper became the fourth oldest player to feature this season. He did so with gusto, earning a round of applause from his team-mates as he entered the dressing room afterwards. 38-year-old veteran goalkeeper Kelvin Davis put in a confident display against Burnley on Saturday . Davis had come on as a substitute after first-choice Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was injured . Davis' assured performance earned him plenty of praise from his team-mates as Southampton won 2-0 . Southampton striker Shane Long scores his side's opening goal against Burnley at St Mary's on Saturday . Long runs to celebrate in front of the home fans as Southampton take the lead against Burnley . Southampton have benefited from more opposition own goals than any other Premier League team this season (5). His appearance came in unfortunate circumstances. An injury to Fraser Forster's left knee that will almost certainly rule the goalkeeper out of England's internationals this month called for Davis to wipe the dust off his gloves. There is no reason to panic as far as Koeman is concerned. He has a man he deems reliable and professional enough, both behind the scenes as club captain and on the pitch, to fill the void. Koeman was 51 on Saturday and, while Shane Long and an own goal from Burnley's Jason Shackell provided the victory, the Southampton manager's birthday gift was in no short part down to the man 13 years his junior. 'I was not surprised because we see Kelvin working every day in the training session,' Koeman said. 'That's important to have somebody when he has to play that he has some confidence. That he will not be nervous. 'His situation is clear. Fraser is first and Kelvin is the second goalkeeper. You need a lot of experience when you need to play and you have to show it. 'That's difficult but he showed his quality. He was looking very comfortable and that gave confidence to the rest of the team. He's not the youngest goalkeeper but still he's a very good goalkeeper. He's a very good professional.' Burnley's Jason Shackell (left) is put under pressure by Southampton forward Graziano Pelle on Saturday . Davis still has some way to go before catching Leicester City's 42-year-old reserve goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer but he made the most appearances for Southampton in League One four seasons ago, having joined the Saints in 2006, and rolled back the years on Saturday. Davis denied Sam Vokes and Danny Ings with full-length saves, and gave Koeman hope that losing Forster will not hamper the club that have conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League this season. Burnley tested them, but European football remains a possibility. Koeman was not oblivious to his former club Barcelona's win in the Champions League against Manchester City last week, yet he refuses to imagine himself taking Southampton to the Nou Camp. 'We don't think too much about the Champions League. We hope seventh place on the table means European football, and that will be fantastic for us,' said Koeman. 'The Champions League is amazing to play in and amazing to be involved in. We know our situation, we know our qualities. If it's Europa League, that will be great for us.' Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is hoping to finish in the top seven in the Premier League this season .

"Louis van Gaal described his victory as 'one of the most important moments in my career' as Manchester United moved five points clear of arch-rivals Liverpool in the race for a Champions League place. Van Gaal refused to write off Liverpool's chances of finishing in the top-four but could not under-estimate the value of a 2-1 victory after Juan Mata struck twice. It was Liverpool's first Premier League defeat in 13 games since they lost 3-0 at Old Trafford in December. 'We beat Liverpool again,' said Van Gaal. 'They were in fantastic shape and we beat them with the old weapons – with the pressure on the ball in the first half. David de Gea uploaded a dressing room photograph of Manchester United's post-match celebrations . Juan Mata scored twice to secure three important points for the Red Devils away at Anfield . 'Now we are five points ahead of Liverpool, and six ahead of Tottenham and Southampton. To win in this moment is very important – one of the most important moments in my career. 'But there are still eight matches to go. That's 24 points. Liverpool can still be champions. When you are a top manager, or player or club – and Liverpool are – you have to deal with defeats. 'We have also dealt with defeats. We lost at home to Arsenal and then we had to play against Tottenham and Liverpool, and you have to manage that. Liverpool can do that also because they have a great manager, great club, great fans.' Van Gaal claimed that United had 'played Liverpool off the pitch' in a one-sided first half, but struggled after Steven Gerrard was sent of seconds after coming off the bench. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney (second right) is congratulated by Louis van Gaal at full time . Van Gaal (centre) hailed his side's performance as they moved five points clear of Liverpool in the league . He added: 'It was the best first 45 minutes because in the second half we were not so good and that's a little bit amazing because we played 11 against 10. It should be easier than the first half but it was not. 'I know in a sense that Liverpool should press us and they did but we played them off the pitch in the first half and scored a fantastic goal and gave nothing away. 'I came in the dressing-room and gave all my compliments because I was so happy, but then in the second half everything changed because of the red card. Then we weren't playing like a team anymore. We were running with the ball and losing it unnecessarily. When we didn't have the ball we didn't press the opponent. That was different in the first half. 'Nevertheless, we didn't give many chances away. David de Gea has saved us a lot of times this season but I couldn't remember one save in this match.' Mata, scorer of both United goals, was happy with his performance after the game, and admitted that the last few months have been difficult. Mamadou Sakho (centre) also posted a picture to Twitter, alongside the caption: 'I'm obviously disappointed to have lost today but we gave our best especially in the second half' Steven Gerrard was sent off soon after coming on, but Van Gaal says it was harder to play against 10 men . 'I think it's my best game in a United shirt, yes. It's a massive game, probably the biggest in English football, so to score two goals is great for me,' Mata told Sky Sports. 'The second goal has to be up there with my best. After Steven Gerrard was sent off we needed a second goal because they pushed us to the end. 'It was important for me. The last few months I've not had the best moment. It is the manager who decides but I'm happy today.' Van Gaal was sufficiently impressed, but like Mourinho at Chelsea who preferred Oscar, Willian and Eden Hazard in the three creative positions behind the lone striker, said Mata did not always fit into his formation. 'Now he is playing as a false right winger and the communication with (Ander) Herrera and (Antonio) Valencia gives him more opportunities,' Van Gaal told reporters. 'I think he was one of my most consistent players. I am not amazed, but I am very happy for him.' Mata's second goal of the afternoon was a stunning bicycle kick to put United 2-0 up at Anfield . Brendan Rodgers struck on a new 4-3-3 formation when Liverpool lost at United, and Van Gaal revealed that he had given his players the option to change from 4-3-3 and revert to a three-man defence as well. He said: 'Liverpool changed their system against us in the home match and then we played with three defenders at that time. We won 3-0. The coach continued with this system and they have won everything. They never lost. And then we came again. We stayed with the system that we've had the last four or five weeks. 'We had to prove it against the system we usually play. I asked the players that we can play with three defenders or shall we continue with 4-3-3? But then you have to play like a team, and that I have seen in the first half. That was marvellous to see.'","Juan Mata scored twice as Manchester United beat Liverpool at Anfield .

"It was a case of Cristiano Ronaldo winning his battle with Lionel Messi but Barcelona emerging victors in the war with Real Madrid after El Clasico at the Nou Camp on Sunday in Spain. Goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Luis Suarez gave Barcelona a 2-1 win to move four points ahead of Madrid atop La Liga with 10 games remaining but it was only Ronaldo who got his name on the scoresheet, after a quieter display by Messi's imperious standards. Messi appeared relaxed in the tunnel, dabbling in conversation with his Barcelona team-mates, his fleece zipped up to his chin. Ronaldo stood poised, staring forward. The Nou Camp was an inferno, shrouded in gold, purple and blue with the 99,000 supporters in fearsome voice as the two superpowers of global football marched out on the pitch. Cristiano Ronaldo got on the scoresheet but it was Lionel Messi who was happiest after El Clasico . Messi (left) provided the assist for Barcelona's first goal in El Clasico from Jeremy Mathieu .

Cristiano Ronaldo (left) poked Real Madrid level after 31 minutes, completing a tremendous move . Ronaldo (second left) watches on as he brings Madrid level against arch rivals Barcelona . Ronaldo's first touch of the ball after 40 seconds was met with searing jeers by the Barcelona fans. He was eventually crowded out by Dani Alves and Ivan Rakitic and the dispossession of Madrid's talisman was met with emphatic cheers. Messi's start was subdued, the diminutive Argentina international lingering quietly in the centre of the pitch, exchanging the occasional pass with Andres Iniesta in the first five minutes. But he snapped into life in the sixth minute with a nutmeg on Madrid playmaker Toni Kroos. Six minutes later, the first clear chance of the game fell to Ronaldo, who escaped his defender on the back post but could only turn Karim Benzema's deft lob onto the crossbar with Claudio Bravo beaten. He should have scored and Barcelona were off the hook. Messi was still awaiting his first opportunity to get at Madrid's defence. Nutmeg aside, his first 15 was perhaps best summed up by Iniesta uncharacteristically hitting a looping pass over his team-mate, who had found space out on the right touchline. But two minutes later, Messi had the ball at his feet and he surged inside, picked out Neymar and burst into the area, where he met the cross with his head but sent it wide. Barcelona's breakthrough came on 19, and Messi had the assist. Suarez was fouled  on the left, Messi whipped a glorious ball into the area and Mathieu flicked it past Iker Casillas to give Luis Enrique's side the lead. It was Messi's 15th assist of the season and Ronaldo's miss after 12 minutes already appeared costly. The goal galvanised Barcelona and Suarez drew a foul from Pepe two minutes after the opener and Messi seized the ball again. This time he was central and 25 yards out but his effort was deflected out for a corner which came to nothing. Neymar missed a glorious chance for 2-0 on the half hour mark, meeting a ball across goal from Suarez six yards out, only to guide his effort safely into the hands of Casillas with the goal gaping.

Ronaldo hit the crossbar from close range with the scores goalless at the Nou Camp . It was a shocking miss and 30 seconds later, Madrid were level. Ronaldo led the surge forward and as Benzema collected possession on the right of the penalty area, the Portugal international continued his run through the centre. Benzema sensed his presence and picked out his run with a glorious swish of his heel. Ronaldo hit fifth gear to beat Bravo to the ball, poking it under the goalkeeper to haul Madrid level as the jeers spewed out at the Nou Camp. Eight minutes before half time, Ronaldo picked up the ball on the left and skipped past Alves but with Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique closing him down, Ronaldo went tumbling. Television replays showed that Pique momentarily left his boot dangling, perhaps to entice a Ronaldo fall but the referee's decision to book the Madrid man was correct. In the 40th minute, Ronaldo thought he had assisted a goal from Gareth Bale, who poked Ronaldo's header into the back of the net. Bale was definitely onside but Ronaldo was not and the goal was rightly ruled out. But the Madrid man was finishing the first half in scintillating form. A ferocious shot from 30 yards out was tipped over by Bravo and Bale skewed a shot wide from the corner. As the second half began, it seemed Messi was in the shadow of Ronaldo. Madrid undoubtedly ended the first period of play in the ascendency. Messi (left) of Barcelona closes down Madrid defender Pepe in the first half at the Nou Camp . Ronaldo (right) was booked for diving in the first half of El Clasico . Ronaldo was jeered by Barcelona's supporters every time he had possession for Madrid . Ronaldo (third right) had strayed offside before flicking the ball to Gareth Bale to score . And it was Ronaldo who was involved in the first incident of the second phase, returning the ball into Benzema in a probing attacking move, before Bravo dived to his left to beat out the France striker's clever shot across goal. Messi was drifting deep to find the ball, and Mascherano picked out his compatriot on the halfway line on 52 minutes. He turned and sprinted at the heart of Madrid's back line and Luka Modric reached for the ball with his leg but only managed to clip Messi's heels. The free kick failed to worry Madrid like Messi's sprint forward did. Four minutes later, Barcelona went ahead with a tremendous finish from Suarez. The Uruguay striker was found by a forensic pass by Alves, who spotted Suarez had escaped the attention of Pepe and had curved his run to stay on side. The ball was floated over, Suarez caressed it under control with the outside of his boot and threaded it across Casillas and into the far corner. Ronaldo might have been worried after a clash with Mascherano on the hour mark. He was flattened by the midfielder but appeared to retaliate, with Mascherano exaggerating the contact made by the Madrid attacker.

Ronaldo (second right) tries to block a clearance from Gerard Pique of Barcelona . But the referee was not fooled, only booking the Barcelona man for the initial foul. Tempers began to fray after the clash between the pair and it suited Messi's Barcelona side more as the clock ticked on. As 73 minutes passed, Messi went inches away from extending Barcelona's lead. Again out on the right, he ran inside and sprinted ominously through the centre before unleashing a fine strike from the edge of the area that went the wrong wide of the post with Casillas beaten. Barcelona manager Luis Enrique thought the shot was in and a minute later, he must have been certain his team were about to add to their advantage. Messi was again the engineer, perhaps buoyed by his attempt seconds earlier. With Suarez to his left and Neymar to his right, Messi played in the Brazil international, who blazed wide on an unusually wasteful night from the former Santos man. The pair combined again on 77, this time Messi shooting at goal but his low, right-footed strike was blocked and Madrid cleared. Benzema almost punished Barcelona and Messi for spurning their chances when his shot from 25 yards deflected wickedly off Mascherano, but Bravo managed to turn the ball away brilliantly.

Barcelona were pouring forward looked to extend their advantage. They did not manage to do so, but Messi's side held on.

Raffael  scored both goals for Monchengladbach but his first, in the 30th minute, was fortuitous.

"Jose Mourinho remains 'pretty confident' his Chelsea side will be crowned Barclays Premier League champions, but Diego Costa is an injury concern for their title run-in. The Blues restored their six-point lead over Manchester City with a 3-2 win over spirited Hull on Sunday and retain a game in hand against rock-bottom Leicester. That makes them heavy favourites to lift the trophy and Mourinho was happy to accept the role of front-runners after Loic Remy grabbed a 77th minute winner at the KC Stadium. Jose Mourinho is confident that his Chelsea side will be able to secure the Premier League title this season . Loic Remy came on as a substitute and scored the winning goal to secure three points for the Blues . 'I'm not pretty sure, I'm pretty confident. I believe in my players, I believe that we can do it but I know it's difficult,' he said. 'I keep thinking the same, the title race should be over. In normal conditions, Chelsea should have eight, 10, 12 points more than we have; title race over. 'But football is unpredictable and the reality is we have a six-point lead, one game in hand, which is our best situation for the whole season.' Costa's short-term involvement is an open question, though. The Spain striker claimed his 20th goal of the season with a wonderful curling effort to put Chelsea 2-0 up inside nine minutes, but hobbled off with a hamstring injury. One negative for Chelsea was the hamstring injury suffered by Diego Costa, which ended his involvement . Costa's replacement, Remy, scored the winning goal and Mourinho thinks he has sufficient replacements . His exit allowed for Remy's match-winning arrival, but whether he emerges from the imminent international break in match condition is uncertain. 'When a striker is playing, the team needs a goal to win the game and with 15 minutes to go the striker, a guy with a lot of experience of hamstring injuries, says ""it is over for me"", then it is over for him,' said Mourinho. 'He has this problem. He tried to play the Champions League final for Atletico (Madrid, last season) and was injured again and again and again. He has this fragility. 'We know his hamstring is not a strong one. He works hard through the week to compensate the weakness he has there but the injury can come. Remy (centre) celebrates scoring Chelsea's third goal against Hull at the KC Stadium . Mourinho watches on from the bench as his Chelsea side go six points clear of nearest rivals Manchester City . 'If he is injured then we have Remy, we have Drogba. We never cry about injured players.' Costa can at least expect to miss Spain's forthcoming games against Ukraine and Holland, but despite the added rehabilitation time, Mourinho would rather be pressing on with the domestic calendar. 'For Diego (the break) is good, because imagine we play three matches in one week, that's three matches he doesn't play. 'But in this moment we have nine matches to play and I would like to play every week, so it's not good for us.' Eden Hazard scored the first goal of the game inside two minutes to get Chelsea on track . Thibaut Courtois made an error to gift Hull their second, but later made amends with a string of saves . Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois gifted Abel Hernandez an equaliser just a minute after Ahmed Elmohamady made it 2-1, side-footing a back pass straight to the City striker. But Tigers boss Steve Bruce believes the Belgian's brilliance later in the piece was crucial to the outcome. Courtois produced a sensational triple save from Elmohamady, Jake Livermore and Gaston Ramirez in the 64th minute to keep the scores level. 'The big turning point in the game was where Courtois pulls off three saves which change the course of the game,' said Bruce, who was nevertheless delighted with his side's endeavour. 'That's as good as we've played for a long, long time, against the best team in England. 'We're obviously disappointed to lose the game because I don't think we deserved that. 'We gave Chelsea a hell of a run for their money and on another day it could have gone our way. 'I'm sure we've got enough and I'm convinced if we play like that, we're good enough to stay in this division.'","Chelsea went 2-0 up against Hull, but were pulled back to 2-2 .

They were taking part in a survival series called Dropped for French TV when the crash happened in a mountain range in the La Rioja province in north-west Argentina. Ten people died and there were no survivors. Their coffins, which each had a personalised silver plaque, were removed from the plane around 11am and will be buried at a different service. They were watched by French Sports Minister Patrick Kanner, the Argentine ambassador and Nonce Paolini, who heads the TF1 channel that was producing the television programme. The show, which was immediately cancelled after the crash, had planned to blindfold sports stars and take them into rugged environments, giving them 72 hours to get to a place where they could charge a mobile phone. After the crash a cattle farmer told how he rushed to one of the helicopters to try to rescue survivors - but he was beaten back by the heat and smoke. Olympic swimmer Camille Muffat, sailor Florence Arthaud and Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine died in the accident on the evening of March 9. They were repatriated alongside five other French nationals who were crew members . Officials arrive at Charles de Gaulle Airport (left) to pay their respects. The coffins, which each had a personalised silver plaque, were removed from the plane (right) and will be buried at a different service . The coffins were loaded carefully into vans in La Rioja, where the accident took place, on March 17 . A coffin plaque engraved with Camille-Marie Manuella Muffat lays on a bench alongside more plaques engraved with the names of other helicopter crash victims . David Ocampo said: 'One of the helicopters sounded as if it was firing off shots or experiencing small explosions that were completely out of place. 'There were about five metres between the two of them, but the one in front seemed to stop and that caught my attention. 'The other one smashed into it from behind with its propellor after trying to swerve to avoid it and fell to the ground and exploded. The earth shook when they fell. 'I rushed towards it to see if there were any survivors but it was just a ball of flame. The terrifying moment the two helicopters  smashed into each other before spiralling to the ground was caught on camera . There were no survivors in the crash, which claimed ten lives. Above, one of the helicopters is left in pieces on the dirt floor after the crash . The sports stars were taking part in a survival series called Dropped for French TV when the crash happened . 'I couldn't see anything really, just smoke and the tail of one of the two helicopters between the bushes.' Prosecutors in Paris opened a manslaughter inquiry after the incident. Initial investigations indicated the crash was caused by human error, officials said. The remaining victims were identified as Argentine pilots Juan Carlos Castillo and Roberto Abate. French President Francois Hollande said at the time: 'The brutal demise of our compatriots is an immense sadness.' Camille Muffat is an Olympic swimmer and former world record holder for the 400m women's freestyle from 2012 until 2013. She won gold during the 400m freestyle at London 2012, earned silver in the women's 200m freestyle and a bronze as a member of the women's 4×200m freestyle relay. She was the third Frenchwoman in history to earn three medals in a summer or winter Olympic Games and was named the 2012 French Sportswoman of the Year. She shocked the sporting world in June by announcing her sudden retirement at the age of 24, exhausted by the long hours of training in the pool. Alexis Vastine won bronze for boxing in the Light Welterweight category at the Beijing Olympics, and competed at London 2012, but was knocked out in the quarter finals. Florence Arthaud was regarded as one of the world's best sailors, and won the Route du Rhum, a transatlantic single-handed yacht race that takes place every four years. She took first place in 1990 with her boat Pierre 1er.","Two helicopters collided during filming for new show on March 9 .

"They stood alongside each other, peering anxiously towards The Kop. As a sea of red and white jerseys jostled and pointed fingers, Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Bobby Charlton never blinked. Then, as referee Martin Atkinson restored order, Ferguson cracked. Turning to see who was on the row behind him in Anfield’s Directors Box, Ferguson could not help himself. Suddenly he was beaming, his smile born of elation and contentment: victory had been confirmed. Winning at Anfield mattered more to Ferguson than anything else when he shaped Manchester United’s destiny and retirement hasn’t dulled the desire. That smile and subsequent tap on Charlton’s shoulder, told you everything about how he was feeling. Sir Alex Ferguson looked delighted by Manchester United's victory over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday . Sir Alex Ferguson acknowledges United supporters upon his arrival for the game against Liverpool . Sir Bobby Charlton (centre) and Ed Woodward (left) were also at Anfield to see United win . Ferguson takes his seat at Anfield before United's game against Liverpool in the Premier League . Mind you, he wasn’t alone. Crammed into the Anfield Road end, 3,000 United fans were exultant, noisily acclaiming the finest performance of the Louis Van Gaal era: their team had not played with such panache and arrogance here since the mid-1990s. They were going to enjoy this. ‘We played them off the pitch in the first half, I think,’ Van Gaal mused afterwards. ‘It was the best 45 minutes (of the season). We scored a fantastic goal, we gave nothing away. It really was a superb first half. In the dressing room, I gave the players all my compliments.’ Van Gaal might have been less than impressed by what he in the second half but do not doubt how much satisfaction this win provided. As he walked out of Anfield later to catch the team bus, he stopped and took look around the famous old stadium. His contentment was beyond question. As well it might have been. This was the afternoon when the Van Gaal masterplan started to come together. For all the Liverpool had shortcomings, the simple truth was that they couldn’t get near United and were lucky that only one goal separated them at the break. All over the pitch, United players stood out like beacons. Phil Jones, for starters, was terrific in the centre of defence, keeping Daniel Sturridge under wraps for much of the game; Antonio Valencia personified diligence at right back. It was in midfield, however, were United stamped their class. Maroune Fellaini dominated, setting an aggressive tone; Daley Blind was impressively solid while Ander Herrara passed the ball with purpose and precision, most devastatingly when he set Juan Mata free for the opening goal. Juan Mata (left) acrobatically scores United's second goal against Liverpool on Sunday . Mata (right) slots past Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to give United the lead in the first half . Mata (left) applauds the United supporters at Anfield after securing the three points over Liverpool . Ander Herrera provided a sublime assist for Mata's opener for United in the 14th minute at Anfield . Ah, Mata. For large parts of the 15 months he has been at Old Traffford, you have wondered why they spent £37million on him – then you see how he played here, like when scoring that glorious second, and can understand why Michael Carrick called Mata “Little Magician”. Ed Woodward, for one, was certainly impressed after he had exchanged passes with Angel Di Maria and capped the move with a bicycle kick that arrowed past Simon Mignolet. ‘What a goal!’ Woodward exclaimed, as he gave Charlton a hug. Mata, by contrast, was slightly more circumspect. ‘In the last few months I’ve not had the best moments but I am the same player that I was when I came to England,’ he said. ‘I have the same passion, the same illusion, but it is the manager who decides. But obviously I’m happy because we played well in a very difficult game.’ Much has been spoken about United this year, largely about how they are a pale shadow compared to what has gone before. In some respects that is absolutely right: how many of this starting line-up would have got into the treble winning side of 1999? Probably only Wayne Rooney. But time moves on and the 2014-15 squad are beginning to move in the right direction and what has been most impressive is the reaction they have produced since that chastening night against Arsenal two weeks ago when they were bounced out of the FA Cup. A 3-0 demolition of Tottenham Hotspur followed by a win against their most bitter rivals has made fourth place United’s to lose and that will ensure Van Gaal has achieved the objective that he was set by Ed Woodward when arriving last summer. ‘We are coming back and we beat Liverpool again,’ said van Gaal. ‘We beat them with their own weapons and pressure on the ball. Now the gap is five points ahead of Liverpool and six ahead of Tottenham and Southampton so the moment to win is one of the most important in my career.’ United manager Louis van Gaal (centre) described the win as one of the most important of his career . United's players applaud their supporters after their 2-1 win against arch rivals Liverpool . When he talks about points gaps, maybe Van Gaal should really be looking forward than studying what lurks behind. After all, they are only eight points behind league leaders Chelsea and there are still eight matches to play. Manchester United to be league champions? Perhaps not this year. But why can’t they finish runners-up? Should Van Gaal’s play as they did at Anfield on the run to the line, nobody will enjoy to facing them. And that, more than anything, will give Ferguson reason to smile again.","Manchester United moved five points above Liverpool with Anfield win .

"Catalans Dragons expect to be without star signing Todd Carney for three to four weeks with a broken rib. The 2010 international player of the year was taken to hospital for X-rays after being hurt during the Dragons' 40-40 draw with Salford in Perpignan on Saturday. It was only Carney's second appearance in Super League after joining the Catalans on a three-year contract. Catalan Dragons' Todd Carney is expected to be out of acton for three to four weeks with a broken rib . Carney was taken to hospital for X-rays after damaging his ribs during match against Salford . Referee Phil Bentham ruled that Salford forward Lama Tasi was committed to the tackle on the Australian stand-off but the incident infuriated Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous, who insists the Red Devils player should have been punished and expects him to be charged when the Rugby Football League's match-review panel study the incident on Monday. Frayssinous was fiercely critical earlier this season of what he claimed was a failure of referees to protect his playmakers and in particular full back Morgan Escare and expressed his fears that Carney would become a target. 'I said I was worried over the protection of my quality players and it has happened in only his second game,' Frayssinous said. 'I expect Tasi to be charged but I also thought he should have been shown a card.' Frayssinous was also angered by the decision of Bentham to penalise Escare in the closing moments for playing on after being tackled near his own line. That enabled Josh Griffin to draw the match but Frayssinous said his full-back should have been allowed to go back and play the ball and expects his critical post-match comments, in which he accused officials of double standards, to result in a fine. 'I hope that my £500 will help the referee to be better next week,' he said. The result at the Stade Gilbert Brutus set a new record for the highest scoring draw in the 20 years of Super League, beating the 36-36 draw between London Broncos and Leeds at The Stoop in 2004.","Todd Carney is expected to be out of action for three to four weeks .

"Amir Khan wants to fight Kell Brook within the next year, paving the way for a spectacular return to Wembley Stadium for British boxing. As recently as Monday Khan was talking down the chances of a grudge match between himself and Britain’s other leading welterweight, who has spent years calling out Khan. But now there appears to be a genuine chance of this fight happening, with Khan saying on Tuesday that a meeting is inevitable, either at the end of this year or in 2016. After Kell Brook's victory over Jo Jo Dan on Saturday, he called out Amir Khan in a post-match interview . Brook demolished Dan in Sheffield, beating him in just four rounds to retain his IBF World Welterweight title . The bargaining tool of Brook’s IBF world title remains a draw for the Bolton fighter, but a major factor has been the public pressure, which has grown enormously since Brook demolished his mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan on Saturday. With that in mind, it remains to be seen how much of what Khan is saying is lip service. Certainly, Brook’s team are waiting for formal talks to start before they get excited about a fight they have long craved and which would surely match Carl Froch’s 2014 rematch with George Groves at Wembley. Khan said: ‘I’d love to go in the ring and fight Kell Brook. It will happen within the next 12 months but I have already given my word to an opponent and I want to be a man of my word. ‘After watching his (Brook’s) last performance, I know I can do a deal, winner takes all. It shows it is not about the money, it is about the pride. It could be his last fight, I would give him that much of a beating.’ Brook, pictured celebrating his win over Dan on Saturday, appears to have got his wish to fight Khan . Khan's last fight came against Devon Alexander in December, whom he beat to take his record to 30-3 . Khan has previously refused a fight with Brook, but now promises it will take place within 12 months . He added: ‘It’s all about timing: if I’ve got a different route and I want to face the likes of the (Floyd) Mayweathers and (Manny) Pacquiaos out there, then Kell Brook will have to wait.’ Khan also tweeted: 'They doing a very good job making the public believe i don't want the fight, trust me i do! Keep building the hype cause winner takes all!' Any plans promoter Eddie Hearn had of staging the fight on June 13 - he has a provisional booking with Wembley - are scuppered by Khan’s claim to have promised a fight to a different opponent. He is expected to announce his next fight this week. Sportsmail understands Khan would have made £4.5million from a June date with Brook, but with the rivalry likely to rumble loudly into 2016 he could take up to £5m. Brook’s camp are in talks with Mexican legend Juan Manuel Marquez over a summer fight, while WBA regular champion Keith Thurman and Brandon Rios are also possibilities.","Kell Brook beat Jo Jo Dan with considerable ease at the weekend .

"Simona Halep secured the biggest title of her career as she battled back from the brink to beat Jelena Jankovic to the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells. The Romanian looked down and out on more than one occasion as she struggled with a foot problem and Jankovic gave her an almighty let-off when she passed up the chance to serve for a second Indian Wells title. But in the end the battling qualities of Halep, coupled with the instability of Jankovic who virtually went to pieces as the match went on, got the third seed over the line 2-6, 7-5, 6-4. 'I want to congratulate Jelena you were amazing,' a gracious Halep said afterwards. 'At my age you won this tournament so well done for a great week, a great job and an amazing final. Simona Halep clinched the BNP Paribas Open title with a win over Jelena Jankovic in the final . 'I am really happy I could win today. This tournament has been amazing, I thank all the Romanian people who come to support me everywhere. You make me want to fight until the end. 'I am really excited to win this, my biggest title, I will never forget it.' It had not looked like being a celebration for Halep early on as Serbian Jankovic dominated. She secured the first advantage, taking the last of five break points to come her way in the opening game when Halep slapped a forehand long, but she was immediately broken back. Serve held for two games after that, but Jankovic moved out in front again, turning a 30-0 deficit into a second break for 3-2. That would be the last of Halep in the set, as Jankovic served out two games and took another against the serve courtesy of a wild Halep forehand to take the set 6-2. The Romanian came from behind to win 2-6, 7-5, 6-4 in the Californian desert on Sunday . Halep paid tribute to her opponent Jankovic after winning the title in Indian Wells . Halep called for the trainer and appeared to have work done to her left foot during the rest, but looked fine as she returned to the court and took the first game of the second, ending a five-game streak against her. There was no question that she was in trouble, though, her discomfort obvious and the game her first since Wednesday owing to the fact her semi-final with Serena Williams was cancelled when the American pulled out injured. But despite being broken early in the set, she hit back by taking Jankovic's serve to love. She had little to do as Jankovic imploded, sending a two-hander long and then hitting a short backhand into the net. Halep drops her racket to celebrate after clinching the match and the title at Indian Wells . It appeared to be a momentary blip for Jankovic who broke straight back but three double faults when serving to go within a game of the title cost her and Halep nailed a backhand winner to level at 4-4. But the see-saw nature of the match ensured she took the next, again securing a break as she took the second of two points, planting an overhead winner to break down Halep. She had to call coach Chip Brooks to the chair in the break to calm her down, the pair having an emotional exchange, and tensions were higher at the end of the next game as she was broken again - a fifth game in a row - when she slapped a backhand into the net. Halep was buzzing now and took the next game, a rare hold of serve, and then broke Jankovic - now the player looking pained - to take it to a decider. Halep lost the first set 6-2 but was able to battle back and win in three in California . Jankovic threw all she had at the Romanian but came up agonisingly short in a long final . Jankovic got the first break of it, a huge slice of fortune falling her way as a backhand clipped the net and dropped over, leaping Halep stranded and a break down. It was soon 2-2, though, Jankovic raging as the chair umpire mistakenly called game on her serve only to rewind and call second serve, on which Halep took a break. There was no surprise at all that Jankovic responded by winning on Halep's serve, and even fewer raised eyebrows as another break followed, before Halep held it together on her own delivery to go 4-3 ahead. She then broke for what felt the countless time to go 5-3 up and on the brink of victory but in keeping with the match she coughed up her serve with a wild backhand before taking the title, fittingly, with a break as she came in short on a forehand and made no mistake.","Simona Halep beats Jelena Jankovic 2-6, 7-5, 6-4 in Indian Wells final .

"After Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2-1 in an entertaining El Clasico on Sunday night, RIK SHARMA reveals five things he learned from the Nou Camp. And it's not pretty reading for one Gareth Bale... Luis Suarez has settled perfectly at Barcelona . This was the evening that Luis Suarez forged his own place in the hearts of Barcelona supporters. He'd been chipping away at it before, with that fantastic scissors kick goal against Levante, with his slew of assists for Lionel Messi and Neymar. But to score the winner in a Clasico and with as much class as he did here, has written him into the history books. Having made his Barcelona debut in a disappointing defeat by Madrid, sinking his teeth into Los Blancos here was the perfect revenge for the Uruguayan. Barcelona's attack, with Messi and Suarez in their prime and Neymar growing into his, will be the one to beat for the years to come, unless Real Madrid shuffle theirs again in the summer. Luis Suarez will have forged a place in the hearts of Barcelona supporters after his winner in El Clasico . Gareth Bale continues to regress at Real Madrid . It would be unfair to suggest that Gareth Bale disappears in the big games. After all, he scored a brilliant Copa del Rey final winner against Barcelona last season, and capped it with the goal which won Real Madrid the Champions League against rivals Atletico Madrid. And it was hard not to feel sorry for him at Camp Nou, when his first-half strike was ruled out thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo being offside in the build up. However, the Welshman doesn't fit the profile of Real Madrid, when it comes to football. He is a great player, but one whose pace and power outstrips his technique and tactical acumen. Jordi Alba got the better of him and pressure continues to build on the Welshman. He was on the fringes of this clash and the thunderous challenge by Gerard Pique to end a Bale breakaway was his game in a microcosm. Gareth Bale doesn't fir the profile of Real Madrid - his pace and power outstrips his technique . Bale looks dejected as the Barcelona players celebrate following their 2-1 victory on Sunday night . Gerard Pique has turned things around spectacularly . The lowest point of Gerard Pique's season was probably when he was in hot water with Barcelona's police force and argued with them outside a casino in the early hours of the morning. Probably. Maybe it was at the Santiago Bernabeu, in the first Clasico, which Barcelona lost, when he was run ragged. There were other low moments. Despite this, in recent weeks he's build up his form and hit a high level. And on Sunday night he pushed that even higher, turning in a display of the highest quality. He is Barcelona's rock, once again. Gerard Pique has turned things round at Barcelona and was impressive at the Nou Camp . This could be Carlo Ancelotti and Xavi's final Clasico . A front cover of Barcelona newspaper Sport earlier this week claimed that Carlo Ancelotti could be sacked if Madrid suffered a painful defeat in the Clasico. He'll probably survive after this, but it's unlikely he'll be at the Santiago Bernabeu next season, if he doesn't turn things around in La Liga. That will be hard, given Barcelona now have a four-point lead on his Madrid side. The Champions League offers another avenue to a trophy, but blocking the way are Atletico Madrid, a side Real have failed to beat six times this season, losing four times and drawing twice. The walls are closing in on Carlo. A tip of the hat to Luis Enrique, meanwhile. While he's proved to be a gruff customer in press conferences, he showed his sentimental side by throwing Xavi on for a few minutes in what may be the midfielder's last Clasico, before a lucrative move to the USA or Qatar. It wasn't just for old time's sake though, as the veteran midfielder helped to stifle Madrid attacks by slowing the pace. Carlo Ancelotti could be let go at the end of the season if he doesn't turn things around in La Liga . Cristiano Ronaldo wins the battle but Lionel Messi wins the war . The tussle between these two footballing titans rages on. Cristiano Ronaldo scored, which means he'll be going home happy despite the defeat. That's his ninth goal in eight games at Camp Nou. Madrid and Ronaldo's overall form is still shaky, but this performance from both team and star player, were improvements on some previous outings. Messi meanwhile, while not his team's individually most impressive performer on this occasion, kept everything ticking over nicely. His early nutmeg on Toni Kroos was cheeky, his assist for Jeremy Mathieu's goal delightful. He dipped out of the game for a while but returned with a vengeance, creating several chances which the likes of Neymar should have taken. Personal glory for Ronaldo is all well and good, but Messi's contribution to the team helped made the difference. Cristiano Ronaldo equalised for Real Madrid against Barcelona and played well on a personal level . But Lionel Messi made his team tick on Sunday night and was a star once again for Barca .","Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2-1 in El Clasico at Nou Camp on Sunday .

"Barcelona ran out 2-1 winners against bitter rivals Real Madrid on Sunday night to move four points clear at the top of La Liga. Rik Sharma rates the players from both sides after an action-packed 90 minutes at the Nou Camp. BARCELONA . Claudio Bravo 8: Made two excellent saves, one from Cristiano Ronaldo's first-half piledriver, the second from a deflected Karim Benzema strike near the end. No chance with Ronaldo's goal. Dani Alves 6: Some shocking defending at times, but as we've come to expect, the Brazilian knows how to contribute in attack. His wonderful ball created Barcelona's second goal. Gerard Pique 9: This was a performance from the defender which some believed was beyond him after his fall from grace. Got his head to every ball when it mattered and executed some perfect tackles. After his impressive performance, Pique left the stadium with his pop star girlfriend Shakira . Gerard Pique was at his very best at the heart of the Barcelona defence against Real Madrid . Jeremy Mathieu 8.5: When the Frenchman was signed it turned a few heads. He used his own to send Barcelona 1-0 up and defended expertly after that. One scary moment, when he nodded inches wide of his own goal. Jordi Alba 6.5: Restrained himself going forward for the most part, but coped perfectly well with Gareth Bale down the wing. Fired a late chance wide after good work by Lionel Messi. Javier Mascherano 7: Tried to copy Sergio Busquets’ style of play, instead of rushing around in his usual bulldog style. Some unnecessary play-acting aside, a fine performance. Javier Mascherano was involved in some unnecessary play-acting but otherwise had a fine game . Ivan Rakitic 6.5: Not an indelible presence in this Barcelona side, but a useful one. The Croatian helped shuttle the ball forwards to the attackers nicely, but could have offered more with Barcelona under the cosh in the first half. Andres Iniesta 7: Captained Barcelona for the first time against Madrid and put in a mature display. Showed he can be a tough customer when he needs to be in a midfield battle, too. Lionel Messi 7.5: Nutmegged Toni Kroos early on, and set up Mathieu’s goal with a wicked free kick. Dropped out of the game for a while, but was running the show by the end. Lionel Messi set up Barcelona's opener and was a constant menace despite not being at his very best . Luis Suarez 8.5: Fought hard up front, in a long running battle with Pepe. Got the goal he deserved with a brilliant piece of control and an instinctive finish. Neymar 6: Missed a golden chance in the first half, after which Madrid broke away and equalised.

Dani Carvajal 6: Booked and was lucky not to be sent off when he tangled with Neymar. Otherwise a solid performance. Pepe 4: Booked for going through the back of Suarez, and done for pace by the Uruguayan for the second goal. Not his finest night, and it ended early when Ancelotti hooked him for Raphael Varane. Pepe struggled with the pace of Luis Suarez and was eventually replaced by Raphael Varane . Sergio Ramos 5: Caught out when Mathieu escaped his clutches and headed home the opener. Was too slow to react to Suarez for Barcelona’s second. Marcelo 7.5: The Brazilian was a lively attacking outlet down the left, combining with Benzema to set up Ronaldo, when he hit the bar. Toni Kroos 6.5: A strong first half, helping Madrid dominate proceedings. However, the midfielder has been tired in recent weeks and that took its toll in the second period, when he was quiet. Luka Modric 7: After a three-month injury lay-off, he’s slotted straight back into the side and it looks like he's never been away.

Luka Modric has slotted straight back into the Real Madrid side following a spell on the sidelines with injury . Isco 6: The Madrid press claim he’s a national treasure, and he’s been Real Madrid’s best player in recent weeks. However, he was quiet here, and outshone by Iniesta, the man he’s tipped to replace in Spain’s side. Gareth Bale 5.5: The Welshman nearly had the goal he dreamed of scoring, but his close-range effort was ruled out for Ronaldo being offside in the build-up. This was his chance to prove his doubters wrong, but was often on the fringes of the game, which won't ease the pressure on his back. Gareth Bale had a goal ruled out for offside and was something of a spectator for large parts of the game . Karim Benzema 8.5: Out of the six forwards, Benzema has the lowest X factor. However, he was arguably the most effective here, setting up Ronaldo with an impudent back-heel. Cristiano Ronaldo 7: Barcelona’s supporters whistled and screamed at him every time he touched the ball… but he’s used to that from the Bernabeu. Scored, as he tends to do, with a poacher’s finish.

"Steve Cotterill’s dapper cup final suit was ruined, drenched in the champagne poured over him by his elated players. But he didn’t care one bit. ‘They can tip champagne over me any day of the week if we win,’ laughed the thrilled Bristol City manager. After all, this is City’s season. They’re coasting to the League One title and, with a handsome piece of silverware already in the cabinet, the good times have returned to Ashton Gate. Steve Cotterill and Kieran Agard look delighted after winning the trophy and City could now clinch the double . Captain Wade Elliot (centre) lifts the Johnstone's Paint Trophy as his Bristol City team-mates celebrate . Mark Little (2) bundles home the second goal after a goal mouth scrambled left him a clear goal to aim at . The full back celebrates in front of the Bristol City fans after he doubled his side's lead . This was as straightforward as a Wembley final gets. They lifted the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy in front of 40,000 jubilant Bristolians after goals from Aden Flint and Mark Little saw off Walsall’s meek challenge. But this was merely a taste of things to come. With a 10-point advantage over their nearest league challengers Preston North End, City will surely also be lifting a trophy the next time they meet Walsall, in the last game of the season on May 3. Like so often during this campaign, they were in control from start to finish, showing the greater assurance in front of goal in a game of few chances. Now comes the task of crossing the finish line and completing a double but it would take a collapse of spectacular proportions to deny them a return to the Championship after two seasons away. ‘Hopefully this can push us on to finish the season off,’ said Cotterill, who also enjoyed Wembley success in the 1998 FA Trophy final with hometown club Cheltenham Town. ‘The one thing they have experienced today is that 30-40 minutes of euphoria and it’s really important to feel that early in your career. ‘We have a fixation now — we just want to win the league.' Aden Flint (left) scores the opening goal for Bristol City during the Johnstone's Paint Trophy Final . The big centre half runs away to celebrate his opening goal at Wembley Stadium for Bristol City . The 50-year-old appears to be on a mission to put the West Country on the footballing map, saying the area had been starved of success. ‘They play a lot of rugby at school, so for the football teams to achieve success is good for the kids in the area,’ he added in a cheeky dig at the real king of sports in the region. Days like this will certainly help inspire the next generation of City fans. Once the flames and pyrotechnics had faded at Wembley, the favourites immediately seized control. Their enormous following only had to wait 15 minutes for the breakthrough when Flint outmuscled his marker to head home Marlon Pack’s corner at the back post. It seemed a second City goal would settle a game lacking in entertainment and it duly arrived six minutes after the break. Luke Freeman’s dancing feet worked space for a cross down the left and though goalkeeper Richard O’Donnell blocked Little’s initial header, the right back bundled home with his knee. Both Freeman and Little were excellent, causing constant problems for the Walsall back line. That moment was a fitting reward for their efforts. Fans make thier way into the stadium prior to the cup final where City came away as winners . Derrick Williams is joined by his team-mates and goalscorers Aden Flint, and Mark Little to pose for a photo . Elliot lifts the trophy high towards the City fans after comfortably winning the competition at Wembley . Walsall were disappointing, but things might have turned out differently had Frank Fielding not turned Jordan Cook’s vicious cross on to the post moments after the second goal. ‘I just felt if we scored at any time it would have given us that lift,’ said Saddlers boss Dean Smith. ‘I’m proud of getting here but disappointed with the result.’ For Bristol City, you sense, this success was merely an appetiser for greater glories to come. OTHER THINGS THAT CAUGHT ME EYE . Proof, from the Championship, that referees can redeem themselves from cases of mistaken identity. When Fulham captain Shaun Hutchinson handled on the line at Huddersfield, official Richard Clark wrongly dismissed Cauley Woodrow. But after a consultation, he returned and made the correct decision. Cameron Jerome has been impressive all season but he excelled himself with an outrageous backheel finish during Norwich’s 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest. That was the former Stoke striker’s 19th goal of the campaign and helped Alex Neil’s team move within two points of the automatic promotion places.","Aden Flint gave Bristol City the lead at Wembley after 15 minutes with a towering header at the far post .

"Manny Pacquiao is not only one of the two greatest pound-for-pound boxers in the world but a master of understatement. Such is the modesty of the multi-tasking Filipino – he is also a congressman, the world's shortest professional basketball player, a singer, actor and philanthropist – that he describes the up-coming richest event in boxing history like this: . 'I can say this will be one of the most important fights in my career.' VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Manny Pacquiao says the fight with Floyd Mayweather will be one of the biggest in his career . Pacquiao spoke to CNN's Ivan Watson in an exclusive interview, where he spoke about the May 2 fight . Yes he could say that, since for their exploits in Las Vegas on May 2 he and Floyd Mayweather are expected to share a $300million (£218m) purse ($180m (£131m) to the Money Man, $120m (£87m) to the PacMan). Pacquaio, in an exclusive interview with CNN, also reveals that the eldest of his five children played a major part in urging him to keep pursuing Mayweather for the showdown which is expected to draw a record US pay-per-view audience of four to five million buys. 'My son and daughter really wanted this fight to happen and they will be in the front row,' he says of the $6,000-plus seats he has reserved for them and his wife Jinker at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

'It's been five years in the making…and finally it's happening. The fans deserve it.' Of his massive pay-day, the PacMan says: 'I feel blessed and I owe a lot to those fans. First to God but also the fans because of their support.' Pacquiao, who uploaded a photo of his daughter on Instagram two weeks ago, says his children wanted fight .

"Emmanuel Emenike stormed off the field after the Fenerbahce striker was the victim of alleged abuse from his own fans in Turkey. Soon after blowing a one on one chance with Besiktas' Tolga Zengin After a poor touch to control a long ball, Emenike was booed vociferously by his own fans, with allegations that some of the abuse was also racist.

Emenike makes for the touchline only to be forced back on by Fenerbahce's coaching staff on Sunday night . Emineke gesticulated wildly on his way off the pitch, showing his displeasure at the home fans' booing. But his coaches on the touchline ordered him to put his top back on and continue playing, pushing him back onto the pitch. Former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt had to calm the striker down as he continued playing, before he was eventually replaced at half time.

Emenike has endured a difficult time in front of goal this season, netting just four times in 22 appearances, and is not popular in the Turkish capital. Senegalese front-man Moussa Sow, meanwhile, scored a dramatic 91 minute winner to secure three points for Fenerbahce.

"Jonny Wilkinson has been linked with an England role in another World Cup campaign — 12 years after he kicked the team to glory in the 2003 tournament. The 35-year-old former Lions fly-half, who retired as a player at the end of last season, is destined to act as a kicking consultant for England, according to reports in France. However, Sportsmail has learned that such an arrangement is far from a foregone conclusion.

It is understood that the notion of Wilkinson working with England on an ad hoc basis has been discussed and considered, following his invitation into the training camp ahead of the autumn series at Twickenham last November. Indications on Sunday night were that the No 10 icon’s involvement with Stuart Lancaster’s squad is not entirely out of the question.

"Juventus moved closer to a fourth straight Serie A title with a 1-0 win over Genoa on Sunday. Carlos Tevez scored the only goal of the game after 25 minutes to secure a 20th win in 28 Serie A fixtures for Massimiliano Allegri's men. Their advantage at the top of the table is now such that they can plan on wrapping the title up even before the semi-finals of the Champions League, which they will reach if they can see off Monaco in the quarters.

Tevez (second left) leads the celebrations after the full time whistle for Serie A leaders Juventus . Roma kept pace, some 14 points back, as they saw off relegation-battling Cesena 1-0. Daniele De Rossi got the goal after 41 minutes, his first strike away from home in the league since August 2013. The victory kept Roma in second place but just one point clear of city rivals Lazio, who clinched their sixth straight victory with a 2-0 triumph over Hellas Verona. Lazio took the lead when Felipe Anderson scored his ninth goal of the campaign in the fourth minute. Not long after, Vangelis Moras nearly pulled the visitors level but he was denied by the post. After Lazio's Lucas Biglia hit the crossbar in the 27th minute, the hosts doubled their lead on the stroke of half-time when Antonio Candreva hit the back of the net with a free-kick . Sampdoria moved up to fourth and piled more pressure on their former hero Roberto Mancini, who saw his Inter Milan side slump to a sixth straight defeat in all competitions and further out of the European race with a 1-0 loss. A stunning strike from Eder, the Brazilian-born player just called up by Italy, midway through the second half was enough to make it four wins on the bounce for coach Sinisa Mihajlovic - the former Inter player who both played alongside and under Mancini. His side were deserving winners on the balance of play and the performance will bring more questions for Mancini, with the board demanding European qualification but 10 points separating them from the top five.

Sampdoria, on the other hand, are eyeing the Champions League places after climbing above Napoli, who were held 1-1 by Atalanta. They needed Duvan Zapata's 89th minute equaliser to even get a point after Mauricio Pinilla's 72nd minute goal for Atalanta, who were reduced to 10 men when Alejandro Gomez was sent off. Napoli coach Rafael Benitez also saw red, sent to the stands for dissent late on. Napoli remain a point above Fiorentina, who were held to a 2-2 draw at Udinese. The hosts took the lead through Molla Wague after 15 minutes, but two goals in four minutes from Mario Gomez early in the second half flipped the match on its head before Panagiotis Kone's 62nd minute leveller. Torino inflicted more misery on struggling Parma as they claimed a 2-0 win over the bankrupt club. Maxi Lopez and Migjen Basha scored for Torino while Parma were forced to play more than half of the match with 10 men after defender Alessandro Lucarelli was sent off in the 36th minute for his second bookable offence. The result saw Torino move up to seventh place while Parma, whose future remains unclear, stayed rock bottom of the overall standings with just nine points.

"Former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes believes failure in Europe has exposed declining standards in the Barclays Premier League. Moyes is manager of Spanish side Real Sociedad, a job he took up in November. He has been linked with a return to England with West Ham, where Sam Allardyce remains in charge, but appears comfortable in La Liga. Former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes says the Premier League isn't what it once was . Real Sociedad's Moyes says the Premier League now is 'probably the poorest I've seen in a long, long time' While Spanish sides have flourished in Europe this season their Premier League counterparts have struggled, with none left in the Champions League or Europa League after Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea and Everton bowed out this month. Moyes said on BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme: 'It's not been too long ago where we were looked at as probably having the best teams, and it does change. 'Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal are all exceptional teams in their own right and they'll be disappointed they went out, and maybe on another day they'd have gone through. 'It's just becoming a wee bit of a habit that we're not getting our teams quite as close to the final as we had in the past. Moyes shakes hands with Lionel Messi of Barcelona, one of the Spanish teams flourishing in Europe . He says Chelsea (here bowing out of the Champions League to PSG), along with Manchester City and Arsenal 'are all exceptional teams' but that the Premier League might be talked up more than it deserves to be . 'I think this year you'd have to say it's probably the poorest Premier League I've seen in a long, long time. 'Maybe we do go over the top and recently we have maybe talked up the Premier League more than what it's actually been. There's other leagues which are certainly now comparable.' Moyes expects to return to the Premier League, but not in the near future. 'I think someday I will,' he said. 'I've left when I didn't expect to be leaving but what I've taken on is a great job.

"Athlete Jimmy Thoronka, who went missing after Glasgow's Commonwealth Games last summer, is now applying for asylum in the UK after he was found sleeping rough on the streets of London. Sierra Leone's top sprinter disappeared at the end of the Games and failed to return to the Ebola-hit west African country. Already orphaned by the war in his homeland, he claims that his entire adopted family have been wiped out by the disease while he has been in the UK. Jimmy Thoronka, carrying the Commonwealth baton in Sierra Leone, has applied for asylum in Great Britian . He was arrested on Friday and quizzed by officers over whether he was carrying or using drugs, which he denied. He has since applied for asylum and has been released into Home Office accommodation. Thoronka, who said that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK so he could fulfill his dream of becoming a top athlete, now faces deportation. An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Mr Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 57,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £24,000 to help the young athlete.  Among the high profile names to support his plight are supermodel Lily Cole, and comedian Russell Brand. The Guardian said it had interviewed Thoronka before he was detained for overstaying his visa. He claimed there were no flights to Sierra Leone immediately after the Games and his team-mates all scattered, some staying with relatives and friends until they could return home. But he said his own bag -  containing his money and passport  - were stolen. His visa expired last September and after a brief stint with friends, he has been sleeping on the streets in parks and on buses ever since. An online petition  to let Mr Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 57,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £24,000 to help the young athlete . He today told the BBC's Sarah Montague that he wanted to claim asylum in the UK so he could fulfill his dream of becoming a top athlete.  Asylum is only granted to those who are in fear of persecution in their home country. He said of Sierra Leone: 'Nobody persecute me or anything, my problem is I don't have a family there to stay with. The person who would help me has passed by Ebola. If I go back i will not make it and I will kill myself, because i cannot pursue my dream. I want to be the fastest sprinter in the world.' When Thoronka, the country's No 1 100m sprinter, left Sierra Leone for Glasgow, some Ebola cases had been confirmed in a few of the villages surrounding Freetown, but the epidemic had not yet taken hold of the capital. The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The 100m sprinter, not pictured here, says he wants to stay in England to become a world class sprinter . The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country. But during the Games I got the terrible news that my uncle had died, probably from Ebola. 'I couldn't stop crying. It was difficult to continue with competing but I tried to carry on.' He is not working illegally, nor claiming benefits or housing, and understands the legal implications of remaining in the UK after his visa has expired, but said his situation is hopeless. After the Games, he stayed for a while with friends in Leicester - and found out that his entire immediate family had been killed by Ebola. Later he went to London and began sleeping in parks and on night buses and begging for £1 from passers-by to buy chips. 'Some days I get no food at all. I wash in public toilets and sleep in the park,' he said. 'I wake up around 4am and if I've got a bus pass I get on the night bus and sleep there until morning. Hampden Park in Glasgow was the venue for the track and field events during the Commonwealth Games . 'I met a man who sometimes lets me sleep at his house but I have to wait outside for him to come home at 10 or 11pm and I get very cold. 'We have a cold season in Sierra Leone but it is not cold like England. Some days I don't think I'm going to make it and just feel like killing myself. 'My dream is to become one of the best sprinters in the world but I don't see how that can happen now.'","Jimmy Thoronka remained in Britain after the 2014 Commonwealth Games .

A footballer fractured his skull, nose and both eye sockets after he fell face first into a barrier at the side of a pitch during a horror tackle. David Gibson, 28, was playing for Felixstowe Harpers against Ipswich Valley Rangers in the Bob Coleman Cup quarter final when he careered off the pitch on Saturday.

"The Yak is back and so is the question that used to annoy him but now just brings a smile. Age, for the striker who scored more Premier League goals than Cristiano Ronaldo and Fernando Torres, has always been more than a number. That is possibly because David Moyes once joked Yakubu Aiyegbeni was a ‘Nigerian 25’. And because Steve McClaren claimed the striker told him he was 25 when he signed for Middlesbrough 10 years ago. Reading striker Yakubu insists he has never been concerned with the questions marks over his age . So, how old is he? The profiles say 32; the sceptics are ruder. The big man among Reading’s big dreamers says he’s heard it all before. ‘It was always like this,’ he says. ‘But it does not bother me. Kanu has had it as well. 'I just laugh about it — people joke and that is it. If I was lying I don’t think I would be playing now. I would be retired.’ Thankfully for Reading and the FA Cup, the jibes have not got the better of him. Yakubu scored the goal that saw off Derby in the fifth round to set up the tie against Bradford, guaranteeing at least one side from outside the Premier League will be at Wembley in the semi-finals. For the neutrals, the hope is that League One Bradford can trip up another bigger club. For Yakubu, there is the hope that he can make it to Wembley for the first time after a mangled achilles tendon kept him out of Everton’s 2009 final defeat against Chelsea. The Nigerian striker scores Reading's second goal during the FA Cup fifth round defeat against Derby . Saturday (kick-off 12.45pm). TV: BT Sport 1 (from 12pm). If he does, it will complete a quite surreal journey that spans almost three years since he left Blackburn — ending 10 seasons in England — following relegation to the Championship. His absence has seen him scream at confused Chinese footballers and gain a sweaty taste of football in Qatar. ‘No regrets,’ as Yakubu says. And yet there were times in China, at Guangzhou R&F in the days before Sven Goran Eriksson rocked up, where he quite literally had no idea what was going on. ‘When I was there (after leaving Blackburn), we had a Brazilian coach (Sergio Farias) and he spoke in Portuguese,’ Yakubu says. ‘A guy that speaks English, he had to translate into English and then another guy had to translate from Portuguese to Chinese. The manager is supposed to speak for like five minutes but we are there for nine minutes. Yakubu, seen here celebrating a goal against Manchester City in 2004, scored 43 goals for Portsmouth . Yakubu made sure Reading reached the FA Cup quarter-finals with this goal against the Rams . Yakubu felt he was away from English football for too long and jumped at the chance to return . ‘It’s so difficult to speak with your team-mates. You don’t know how to tell him to pass. You just scream at him and when you scream, he knows that he has to give you the ball. ‘When you want to go shopping or to a restaurant, you have to have it written in your phone in Chinese and you have to show it. Everywhere you go, you have to take your phone and show it to the taxi driver. ‘But when Sven came in, it was great to work with him again. I worked with him at Leicester City. He is always really calm. He just wants you to enjoy the game. Yakubu has scored more Premier League goals than Cristiano Ronaldo (above) and Fernando Torres . The frontman also scored 35 goals in 103 games for Middlesbrough between 2005 and 2007 . ‘Sometimes when I played two or three games and didn’t score, he never said to me, “You didn’t score”. He’d just walk towards me and say, smiling: “It’s been a while since you scored”. Always calm.’ After 18 months in China, Yakubu wound up at Al Rayyan in Qatar last year. He is confident that despite having to train in the middle of the night, they can host a good World Cup. ‘I had a good offer in Qatar,’ he says. ‘It was another experience so no regrets. Believe me, they can get a good World Cup there. They have nice stadiums. But when it is hot, it is hot. We had to train at 9.30pm in summer. You finish training at about 12 and then go home at 12.30am and then bed at about 4am. You have to stay home all day because it is really, really hot. You can’t train when it’s 50 degrees, it is too much.’ The 32-year-old had offers from American, China and Qatar ahead of his move to Reading . He adds: ‘In winter it is good, we can train at 4pm. We played matches at 7.30pm or 8pm and they have to stop for water breaks once or twice.’ On deadline day last month he came back to the country where he first arrived in 2003, when Harry Redknapp took a punt on a striker playing in Israel. ‘Even when you play the big teams, Harry makes you believe,’ he says. ‘He’ll say, “The defence is not good. Come on, just kill him”. If you’re scared, like you’re going to play against Sol Campbell, he’d say, “Sol Campbell? He’s s***. Don’t worry”.’ The memories of his first English stint make him happy. Now his hope is to finally reach Wembley on his second chapter. ‘Every player wants that,’ he says. You’re never too old to dream.

"Tony Pulis believes Manuel Pellegrini’s job as Manchester City manager will be under threat if he fails to land a trophy this season. The West Bromwich Albion head coach insisted City must continue to be successful over the next five years to earn the global fan base of rival clubs. 'The pressure is he has to win, given the amount of money Man City have invested in players over the past years,’ said Pulis. ‘I don’t think it’s just at the top, it’s at the bottom. We’ve seen it with Gus (Poyet), there comes a tipping point. There is always a tipping point at the top and bottom. That’s the industry we’re in. Tony Pulis believes Manuel Pellegrini’s job as Man City manager will be under threat if he fails to land a trophy . 'They pay the money for results. It’s a results business.' He added: 'All over the world there are supporters following the Premier League. A lot of fair weather supporters. Of the new generation, 99.9 per cent will pick a team that’ s been successful. 'So Man City need to be successful over the next four or five years to get a generation of supporters, like Liverpool did, like Man United did. Those big clubs need that support, it’s money in the bank for them.' Pulis takes his side to the Etihad believing Pellegrini’s team will be at their most threatening, however, following their Champions League defeat to Barcelona. He thinks City can win all their remaining nine matches to mount a Premier League title challenge and that the only difference in the Nou Camp was Lionel Messi. Pellegrini is under pressure at the Etihad after City were knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona . Yaya Toure's Man City side struggled to impress as they crashed out of Europe on Wednesday . 'I think City now will be at their most dangerous,’ said Pulis. ‘Coming out of the Champions League I think they’ll really focus on their last nine games. The attitude at that football club will be: “Can we win nine?"" It’s up to us to go and give them a good game. 'You look at their squad, they have enough to win nine games. If they do, who knows? I’m sure they’re talking about it. They are that good a group. 'We talk about playing against Barcelona, they are one player short in that game: Messi. He was the difference. 'He's a game changer at the very highest level of his profession and that's the difference. I'm absolutely convinced if you put him in City's team they would be through now, not Barcelona.’ Pulis believes City could be at their most dangerous on Saturday after their midweek disappointment .","Manuel Pellegrini's job could soon be under threat, claims Tony Pulis .

"Champion golfer Alan Bannister, who swindled £26,000 in benefits - including a car which he used to drive to his club games - has been jailed . A champion golfer who swindled £26,000 in benefits - including a car which he used to drive to his club games - has been jailed. Alan Bannister, who played off a handicap of seven, claimed he was in too much pain to walk and was given the taxpayer funded mobility car to get around. But Cardiff Crown Court heard he was was in fact the 'club champion' at his local golf course and had won a number of tournament with his teammates the 'Sunday Swingers' and 'The Crazy Gang'  - despite claiming he could barely walk 50 yards at a time. Bannister, 56, from Barry, South Wales, was investigated by the Department of Work and Pensions who filmed him completing a 5,400 yard course in just four and a half hours. He was seen strolling unaided around the course on his daily round in the footage. They discovered he used his mobility car - intended for people 'virtually unable to walk' - to drive to the golf club to play withJudge Recorder David Miller said: 'It was a blatant fraud. 'Your grossly and dishonestly distorted your condition and your ability to walk. You said you could only walk 50 metres but you were an active memb er of your golf club with a handicap of seven.' He said Bannister was club champion in 2006 and also won competitions 'almost on annual basis' even when claiming benefits. Jailing him for six months he said: 'You were filmed effortlessly removing your golf trolley and clubs from your car and walking at a decent pace at the golf course. 'At time of national austerity, claiming benefits you are not entitled to is very serious. This benefit is for people virtually unable to walk.' Prosecutor Stuart McLeese said: 'Bannister made dishonest representations about the extent of his disabilities and needs and failed to notify the DWP about what his true care and mobility needs were. 'He didn't accurately record the affect his condition had on him and then didn't notify the DWP at any time that his abilities were greater than he indicated in those claim forms.' Bannister started claiming Disability Living Allowance in 2007 saying he had a form of arthritis called Ankylosing Spondylitis. Pictured are stills from undercover video of  Bannister playing golf while claiming benefits. He had claimed he was in too much pain to walk and was given the taxpayer funded mobility car . But an anonymous tipster called the DWP to tell that how Bannister was a keen golfer - who had played in five-day-long competitions . He filled in forms saying he needed help raising his arms, putting on his shirt and shoes and carrying saucepans. Bannister said he could only walk 50 yards before experiencing 'severe discomfort' and it would take him 10 to 15 minutes to cover this distance. Cardiff Crown Court heard how he also needed help making a meal or getting dressed. But an anonymous tipster called the DWP to tell that how Bannister was a keen golfer - who had played in five-day-long competitions. He was filmed in 2012 driving in his mobility car to St Andrews Major golf club near his home in Barry, South Wales, and completing the 5,400 yard course in just four and a half hours. Covert officers filmed him happily walking to the first tee with his clubs on a trolley and then teeing off before walking 400 yards down the fairway without a problem. Bannister, 56, from Barry, South Wales, was investigated by the Department of Work and Pensions who filmed him completing a 5,400 yard course in just four and a half hours . In interview Bannister said he still suffered 'flare ups' around six times a month and had to take strong medication in order to play golf . In interview with Department of Work and Pensions officers, Bannister admitted knowing that he should tell them if there was any improvement in his arthritis. He said: 'I have to do something if I am not working - I can't sit in the house and melt away. 'I have got to get out there and get on with my life. I have to be up two or three hours before I can play golf. 'My illness if there all the time. I never ever thought I wasn't entitled.' A DWP officer told Bannister: 'The fact you are getting on and fighting your illness is admirable but it doesn't mean the state has to pay for it.' In interview Bannister said he still suffered 'flare ups' around six times a month and had to take strong medication in order to play golf. The court was told Bannister dishonestly claimed £26,090.55 from 2007 until 2012 in Disability Living Allowance. Bannister denied committing fraud by false representation and dishonestly obtaining money transfers by deception but was found guilty by a jury after a four-day trial.","Alan Bannister, who played off handicap of seven, jailed for benefits fraud .

"As a public display of dissension in the ranks, it couldn't have been clearer. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop shook her head, rolled her eyes and finished off with a face palm as Treasurer Joe Hockey gave a bellicose defence of the late Malcolm Fraser's 'great initiative', the Expenditure Review Committee, otherwise known as the expenditure razor gang. He homed in on the former prime minister's initiative of the ERC, much to the disgust of his front-bench colleague and the mirth of others, including Education Minister Christopher Pyne. 'And of course he was the great initiator of, and we will be forever thankful, the expenditure review committee and that committee has endured much to the chagrin of my colleagues and it is one of his many last legacies,' Mr Hockey announced. But there was no hiding the Foreign Minister's disbelief. Scroll down for video . Can't quite believe what she is hearing.

The Foreign Minister rolls her eyes as Joe Hockey announces 'and of course he (Malcolm Fraser) was the great initiator of, and we will be forever thankful, the expenditure review committee' Julie Bishop (left) and Joe Hockey (standing) are believed to be at loggerheads once more over claims that the Treasurer has proposed cuts to foreign aid in the May budget . In just 13 seconds, Ms Bishop rolled her eyes, puffed out her cheeks, threw her head back and then shook her head. She then muttered a word before putting her head in her hand, shaking her head once more before finally raising her eyebrows. As she recoiled from Mr Hockey's speech, there was a mixed response from Coalition MPs - some laughed, others looked on incredulously - no doubt reacting to further angst in the ranks over proposed budget cuts. The federal Treasurer was praising Mr Fraser for being the 'great initiator' of what is commonly referred to as the government's razor gang. The cabinet committee is in charge of finding budget cuts across the government and has in the past taken a blade to the foreign aid budget. There are reports Ms Bishop is furious at plans by Mr Hockey to announce further cuts to the foreign aid budget in a bid to balance the books. Ms Bishop earlier said she was not aware of any more cuts and would take the matter up with Mr Hockey. 'I believe we have it about right,' she told reporters in Canberra on Monday. There have also been reports of concerns among some in the Liberal Party that cabinet members have been deliberately leaking against Ms Bishop to head off her leadership prospects. There are suggestions there will be a small cut to foreign aid in the May budget on top of the $140 million allotted to ""InnovationXchange"", a new project focusing on how Australia provides funds to disadvantaged countries, announced by the Foreign Minister. Treasurer Joe Hockey is set for a showdown with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop over proposed cuts to foreign aid in the May Budget . Of the late Malcolm Fraser, pictured in 1977 on the White House lawns, Joe Hockey stated: 'He was the great initiator of the expenditure review committee and that committee has endured much to the chagrin of my colleagues and it is one of his many last legacies' The foreign minister said she was not aware of any more budget cuts to foreign aid and would take the matter up with Mr Hockey. Ms Bishop said while the government's razor gang had not yet considered the $4 billion aid budget, she did not believe there was room for more savings. 'I believe we have it about right,' she told reporters in Canberra. Ms Bishop challenged opposition MPs to 'look into their hearts' and support the $5 billion in other budget cuts Labor had proposed in government but were now resisting.","More dissension in Liberal Party ranks as Julie Bishop reacts with disbelief over Joe Hockey's lauding of Malcolm Fraser's razor gang initiative .

"If you thought you had seen it all then prepare to be mistaken. Instagram personality Irina Goncharova has trained a slow loris to hold onto a metal pole and well... pole dance. Featured in a video, the slow loris swivels around the long pole in front of some rather fetching leopard print wallpaper. This slow loris is just the performer in a humorous video released on Instagram . The wide-eyed primate wears a cross between a nappy and a pair of shorts with what appears to have a fruit print on it. And actually picks up speed while spinning, becoming undoubtedly dizzy. Stopping to catch its breath, the primate then swivels back in the other direction before climbing further up the pole. The primate makes sure to keep a firm grip on the pole as it entertains its crowd . The video then switches to another shot of the slow loris pole dancing on a separate occasion. Still wearing its interesting underpants, the primate this time performs in front of a different wallpapered backdrop. Before showing off by turning upside down and continuing to spin. According to Ruptly, the slow loris has become increasingly popular as a pet among people who adore it for its cute behaviour and large eyes. The slow loris shows off a fancy pair of underpants in a separate performance . No stone is left unturned as the slow loris goes upside down to the delight of the filmmaker . But unfortunately this has caused many problems and is considered to be, alongside deforestation, the main threat to the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates well over half of the slow loris population is either endangered, at risk or vulnerable. The video of the pole dancing slow loris was captured in Perm, Russia.","The primate belongs to Instagram personality Irina Goncharova .

"A football fan is taking his later father's false teeth to his team's Wembley game tomorrow - as an unlikely lucky charm. Walsall FC supporter Jason Bailey has carried the dentures to every round of the Johnstone Paint Trophy and credits his lucky omen for the club's success this season. The club now find themselves at Wembley for the first time in their 127 year history and will play Bristol City tomorrow- a week after the 16th anniversary of the death of his father Christopher. Walsall FC supporter Jason Bailey has been taking his father's dentures to games since he believed they helped his club to victory at the League Two play-off final in 2001 . Jason said: 'This way part of him is there with me at Wembley and his teeth have always been my lucky charm. 'My dad took me my first Walsall game when I was just six-years-old. He was a massive fan but never got to see them achieve much. 'He had a ticket to all the games home and away and worked for them on security on match days. He would loved this moment. Mr Bailey, 44, began bringing the dentures to matches after he believed they helped his club to victory at the League Two play-off final in 2001. Christopher Bailey, pictured with his son in 1999, had taken Jason to his first ever Walsall game when he was just six-years-old . Mr Bailey, pictured with Christopher Snr (centre) and brother Christopher Jnr  in Walsall in 1978, said bringing the dentures was a way to keep a part of his father with him . The superstitious fan even kisses the teeth, wrapped his in his father's favourite handkerchief for good luck. 'It first came about at the play-off final in 2001 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff,' he added. 'We went 2-1 down in extra time so I got them out in the handkerchief he used to keep them in and gave them a rub and a bit of a kiss. We then went on and won the game 3-2 and I've never looked back. 'I've taken to them to every round of the cup this year - it's the first time I've done that and we're at Wembley for the first time in our history. 'I wish I'd done it sooner. It seems to bring them luck in big games . 'Previously I took them major games, such as the play-off final and other cup games against teams in other leagues. More often then not, we win when I've got them. 'I'll definitely give them a little rub and a kiss to help bring us good luck next week - I believe they will do the job and see us to victory.' Mr Bailey takes the false teeth wrapped his in his dad's favourite handkerchief to every game and  even kisses them for good luck . When they are not accompanying Mr Bailey to a football game, his late father's false teeth are kept inside his wife's jewellery box . Mr Bailey's father Christopher passed away on March 13, 1999 at the age of 49 after he fell into a coma during a triple bypass operation in hospital. Bus driver Mr Bailey decided to keep his false teeth as a memento because he used to love playing jokes on people in the pub with them. His father would either drop them in people's pints or put them in bags of pork scratchings as a way of playing pranks on his friends. 'I kept his teeth because they brought back happy memories for me. They were a big part of him,' added Mr Bailey, a father-of-two. 'He used to drop them in people's pints and we used to drink Bank's Mild - it was thick so people wouldn't find them until they got to the end of their pints. 'He would also put them in his pork scratchings and take them back to the bar and complain somebody had left their false teeth inside them. 'He was a bit of a joker to say the least. ' Mr Bailey, pictured outside  Banks Stadium, home of his beloved team Walsall FC,  in the West Midlands credits his the lucky dentures for the club's success this season . Jason lives in Walsall, West Midlands, with his wife Lisa, 40, and they have two children Jake, 15, and Keenan, 13. Jake's middle name is Saddler after Walsall's nickname The Saddlers and Keenan's is Ray Graydon, the manager who got them promoted in 2001. He added: 'The wife weren't too happy with the middle names - but it had to be done. 'She suggested I keep the teeth in her jewellery box as she knows how important they are to me. 'Everyone laughs and think it's a bit strange- but it's my way of saying thank you to him. ' Mrs Bailey, a housewife, added: 'I suggested he keep them in my jewellery box as they are the safest place for them. I know how important the teeth are to him. 'He has banned me from going to Wembley though as, unlike the false teeth, I'm bad luck. Whenever I have gone to watch Walsall, they have lost. 'At first he wanted to name our first born after the whole team. I said no to that. We found a compromise.'","Jason Bailey began taking his father's dentures to football games in 2001 .

"Christian Benteke is a doubt for Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifiers against Cyprus and Israel after limping out of Aston Villa's defeat to Swansea with a hip problem. The injury appears to be a recurrence of the one that kept Benteke out of the FA Cup victory over West Bromwich Albion. He took a tablet painkiller in the second-half after needing treatment following a fall and was replaced by Andi Weimann with 15 minutes left. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke could miss out on international duty with Belgium after being injured . He appears to have suffered from a recurring hip injury that previously sidelined him against West Brom . Tim Sherwood was unable to clarify how severe the injury might prove, with assessment taking place after the final whistle. The Villa manager was also concerned that Tom Cleverley was forced off after 25 minutes with an apparent groin problem. He already has an injury list that includes Ron Vlaar, Philippe Senderos, Nathan Baker, Kieran Richardson, Aly Cissokho, Matt Lowton, and Libor Kozak. On Benteke, Sherwood said: 'He's had a problem with his hip. In the end he had to come off because it was too sore to continue. I don't know how bad it is, he's being assessed now by the physios. It's a concern. 'But we've got two fit defenders in the whole club. Hopefully this two-week international break lets the phsyios work some magic.'

"Everyone has experienced the frustrated feeling of jabbing at an orange trying to get the peel off, only to be left with a sticky mess. Now a new method has revealed the quickest and easiest way to to do it - and it only involves three slices of a knife. Thanks to a new 'life hack' video from YouTube user Rumble Viral, an orange is opened up in a matter of seconds, and with minimal juice-loss and squashed segments. Method: Cut two opposite ends off the orange (left) and make an incision on one side (right) Easy peasy: Then cut into one side until reaching the centre (left) and pull the entire thing apart (right) The 39-second video shows exactly the best way to best open up the citrus fruit in simple steps. Firstly, you cut off the top and the bottom of the orange. Next,  you make a cut into the one side of the orange, until the knife reaches the fruit's centre. Then, it's just a case of spreading the skin open to reveal all the intact and neat segments. Peel and enjoy! The viral video has already racked up 420,000 views in a short time, and many commentators are raving about the simple yet innovative method. 'This is definitely gong to save me some time. It normally take me forever just to peel one,' says one commentator of the video. Another has commented: 'Good tip. Next time I don't have excuses to juice the oranges instead of eating them whole.' Oranges are a versatile fruit and can be eaten fresh, processed in a juice, or the fragrant peel can be added to dishes for flavouring. The citrus fruit is great as a quick snack, an excellent source of vitamin C and also has high antioxidant properties, so it's no wonder that quicker methods of access are being attempted. The only argument that people have against the three-slice method is that while it works swiftly in a kitchen environment, you're at a loss if you're lacking a knife and chopping board. One commentator questioned: 'What if you don't always carry a knife on you?' The method only takes 30 seconds and ensure minimal juice-loss or segment bruising .","YouTube user shares new trick to tackling citrus fruits .

"A cup of coffee is the perfect pick-me-up for many people around the world. But it’s not just human beings that require a caffeine fix anymore. Apparently our canine friends are also partial to the odd skinny latte from time-to-time. Or at least one dog named Apollo, whose hilarious reaction was filmed by his owners in Saint Catharines, Canada. Filmed in the lounge, German Shepherd is initially featured counting sheep while enjoying a lazy Saturday morning on the sofa. Appearing to address the camera, its owner is only able to utter the word ‘coffee’ before the dog’s ears stand on end and its head turns towards her attentively. The dog is initially filmed resting on a sofa and appears to be enjoying a relaxed Saturday morning . Listening as the woman continues to speak, the dog seems to wait for her to finish her sentence. But as she uses the word coffee again, it springs from its seat and makes its way around the table and towards her. Whining in excitement, the animated dog begins pacing in anticipation while its fellow pets in the house look on bemusedly.

"A young boy was in need of a fix that only his local pub could provide. Filmed at home in London, the 20-month-old boy named Max stands in front of his mother with tears streaming down his cheeks. He urges her and his father to take him to the local pub - where he usually receives sweets and hot chocolate - instead of the doctor's surgery. The youngster stands in front of his mother crying, clearly disappointed about having to see the doctor . After allowing him to catch his breath, his mother asks him to tell his father – who is presumably the recipient of the recording – why he is crying. Choosing to ignore her question, the youngster carries on snivelling, so his mother asks him: ‘Where do you want to go?’ The boy replies with the rather blunt and humorous answer, ‘Pub’, to which his mother retorts: ‘No, but we have to go to the doctors.’ Refusing to back down, Max continues to suggest the pair go the pub until his mother offers a compromise. When his mother asks Max where it is he wants to go he hilariously replies by saying 'pub' She says: ‘OK, you know what? When daddy gets home we will ask him. We will ask him if you can go to the pub later.’ Please with her response, although not entirely convinced, the youngster immediately reminds his mother to ask. According to Max’s father, Oliver Bath, he normally takes his son out of the house and down to the local pub  to give Max's mum some peace and quiet. He said: ‘I always get a beer and Max always gets his hot chocolate. ‘True to the principles of Pavlov’s dog Max now associates sweets and hot chocolate with the pub. ‘My guess as he gets older he'll feel the same but his choice of chocolate will move to his choice of cask ale.’","The 20-month-old named Max is relentless in his demands to visit the pub .

"They say don’t count your chickens, but you’d be excused for counting the legs on this chicken caught on tape in Thailand. The bizarre video features some bemused locals laughing while recording a four-legged chicken wandering around looking for food. Completely indifferent to the situation, the chicken’s two extra deformed legs trail behind it and drag along the floor as it walks. A woman picks up the chicken and brings it into better view of the camera and the bird seems perplexed by the attention it has gained. The video concludes with a close-up shot of the chicken minding its own business, seemingly content with its additional body parts. Surprisingly, four-legged chickens are not as uncommon as many people would think. The chicken appears completely indifferent to having two extra legs as it wanders around and drags them behind it . The video concludes with the filmmaker going in for a close-up shot of the chicken's extra legs . In 2005, a live chicken was found among 36,000 other birds at a farm in America. Named Henrietta, the bird managed to go unnoticed for 18 months at Brendle Farms in Somerset, Pennsylvania, before it discovered by a foreman. Farmer Mark Brendle's 13-year-old daughter Ashley named the chicken and asked to keep it as a family pet. The bird had two normal front legs but behind those were two more which were dragged behind when Henrietta walked, exactly like the chicken featured in this video. The condition called Polymelia is a birth defect that results in individuals having more limbs, which are usually shrunken or deformed. This can sometimes occur when an embryo begins to develop as conjoined twins. Before one twin stops growing, leaving the remaining developments – often limbs – of the undeveloped twin attached to the body of the live baby. The condition is a birth defect known as Polymelia and can sometimes occur when an embryo begins to develop as a conjoined twins .","The chicken is filmed wandering around dragging its extra limbs .

"An American filmmaker has attempted to recapture something that is inevitably lost with time – the ability to see the world through the eyes of a child. Attaching a GoPro camera to his son, the man from Denver, Colorado threw him in the air a number of times to record footage of his perspective. Explaining his idea at the start of the video, the dad says: ‘I was always curious what JJ saw when we threw him in the air. ‘So we are going to put the GoPro on the baby and throw him in the air, and then I’m going to let him see my side.’ The dad gets the experiment underway after counting down from three and the youngster begins laughing in excitement. The camera picks up the sense of speed as the baby is propelled from the father’s arms before stopping in the air and returning to him safely. After explaining his idea to the camera the dad prepares to throw his son into the air by counting down from three . Up, up and away!

"Two savvy parents have made more than $1 million in ad revenue from their family-friendly YouTube videos, which feature footage of their children playing with toys such as Thomas the Tank Engine. Mark and Rhea, who prefer not to share their last name, upload videos starring their five-year-old son Hulyan, their three-year-old daughter Maya and their five-month-old son Marxlen to their popular YouTube channel Hulyan Maya, which currently receives more than 3 million views daily. 'In 2014, our YouTube income skyrocketed dramatically,' Mark told Yahoo Parents. 'We've made more than a million [dollars] between 2010 to 2014.' Scroll down for video . Home movies: Mark and Rhea, who prefer not to share their last name, filmed their daughter Maya, three, opening a Thomas & Friends Sodor Fix-It Station for their popular YouTube channel Hulyan Maya . Innocent adventure: The family's YouTube channel receives more than 3 million views daily . The father-of-three noted that they started their channel in 2007, but said that most of the old videos that they posted 'were junk'. They didn't begin sharing their money-making toy videos until three years later. The couple's most popular video was made in 2013 and features Hulyan buying a Thomas & Friends Emergency Searchlight set; the eight-minute clip has thus far earned more than 15.5 million views. Mark and Rhea, who are projected to earn at least $1.5 million this year, have since quit their jobs running an employment agency in order to pursue their lucrative YouTube careers full time. These days, they dedicate their time to filming, producing and sharing a minimum of two videos a day, which typically run for at least 15 minutes each. According to the duo, they've made so much money from the ads that air before each clip that they were able to pay for their cars and their house in Southern California in cash. They have even made enough to send all three of their children to college. Completely focused: The couple's son Hulyan can be seen playing a computer game . Ancient artifacts: The five-year-old can be seen opening a toy set filled with dinosaurs . And things don't seem to be slowing down. During the week of March 6, Hulyan Maya was ranked the 42nd most viewed YouTube channel in the US, according to Tubefilter, while a 20 minute video showing Maya unboxing a Thomas & Friends Sodor Fix-It Station, has already earned nearly 400,000 views since it was published last month. Throughout the clip she and her father go through the toys various features while unwrapping each piece and putting them together. Most of the children’s biggest fans appear to be young children who are around the same age as Maya and her older brother Hulyan – and share the same keen interest in their toys. 'I love your videos they really cheer up my son,' one parent wrote. Another added: 'Seriously though! My son loves them too!' Family fun: Rhea held baby Marxlen as Hulyan and Maya enjoyed a train ride . Dedicated dad: Mark shared these photos of himself at the start of one of his popular videos . Mark and Rhea, who go by 'ilovemaythang' on their channel, moved from the Phillippines to the US in 2000 and 2006, respectively. Their children's love of toys, including Thomas the Tank Engine, is what first inspired Mark to make a channel dedicated to their home movies. But even Mark, who has been making video blogs since the early 1990s, admits he could not have predicted just how lucrative the family hobby would become. '[It] exceeded my expectations,' he told Yahoo Parents. 'I knew and believed that it would become somehow successful, but more than three million views in a day is simply amazing. I'm living a dream.' But their popularity shouldn't be that shocking - children's toy reviews have quickly become some of YouTube's most-watched videos. According to industry experts, children who review new toys on YouTube are wielding increasing influence over the industry because of their incredible viewing figures and ability to sell almost any toy around. Marc Rosenberg, a Chicago-based toy consultant explained to the Associated Press last November: 'Kids trust other kids more so than they would an adult.’","Mark and Rhea, who prefer to keep their last names private, are expected to earn $1.5 million dollars from ad revenue in 2015 alone .

"Yellowstone National Park attracts many tourists each year who come to enjoy its landscape and wildlife. But one couple got more than they bargained for when they came head to head with an American bison - also referred to as a buffalo - while on the road. In the clip the car can be seen waiting in anticipation – indicator sounding – as a herd of three bison come galloping slowly towards it. Getting closer and closer, the head bison shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper. Reacting, the filmmaker exclaims: ‘Don’t run into our car,’ just as the bison crashes into it – the impact sends the camera up and then down into his lap. Shocked, a lady in the car laughs as the man readjusts the camera and begins filming the two remaining bison, who look quite content standing sideways in the middle of the road. As the bison gets  closer it shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper . Speaking about the incident, the filmmaker said: ‘I thought the bison would simply run by our car at a full clip. 'Instead, at the last minute, the lead bison veers to his left and intentionally head-butts our car. There was nothing we could do to avoid being hit.’ He added: 'It was fortunate that the car was turned off, since a head-on collision with a 2,000 pound bison moving at 10mph  would  likely cause the airbags to deploy.' As the filmmaker calls for the bison not to run into the car it continues charging forward and makes contact with it . Readjusting the camera, which was thrown up and then down by the impact, the video maker captures the bison waking away . Yellowstone is the only place in America where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times and as a result the area is home to the nation’s largest bison population on public land. Known for being agile despite their size, as well as aggressive, Bison can charge at up to 35mph. The bison population in Yellowstone is estimated at 4,600 in two breeding herds. The other bison stay standing in the middle of the road as cars on the other side begin driving once more .","Herd of three bison can be seen charging at the car from a distance .

"In the Sixties, George Harrison penned 'Blue Jay Way' and experimented with LSD along with the other Beatles in the build-up to their 1967 Magical Mystery Tour album in his house in Esher Surrey. And now a six-bedroom mansion - built near to where Harrison's colourful bungalow 'Kinfauns' once stood – is on the market for almost £10million. While not a part of the 'Blue Jay' property, the words 'I love George', carved into a wooden gate in the driveway by an obsessed fan, are still visible today at the entrance. Harrison lived in the bungalow from 1964 to 1970 and felt so inspired by the book Tantrum Art that he painted the  outside  in psychedelic patterns with the help of his first wife Patti Boyd.

John Lennon and Yoko Ono retreated to Kinfauns during their first LSD trip in 1965 with Harrison and his first wife. The Beatles recorded a number of demos at the colourful bungalow after a stay at the Maharishi’s ashram in Rishikesh, India. These became known as the  Kinfauns Demos or Esher Demos and they feature a number of hits that  eventually made it onto the White Album. They also feature early versions of Paul McCartney's 'Junk', which would later appear on his 1970 solo record  and Lennon's 'Jealous Guy' (then called 'Child of Nature'), which was released on his 1971 album Imagine.

Harrison lived in the bungalow from 1964 to 1970 and felt so inspired by the book Tantrum Art that he painted the outside in psychedelic patterns with the help of his first wife Patti Boyd .

From luxury mansions in the English countryside to a sweeping ranch in Colorado, properties lived in by John, Paul, George and Ringo attract huge interest. But as well as the glamorous abodes, even their humble childhood homes manage to generate excitement among fans. Just weeks ago the Liverpool house where Sir Paul McCartney lived as a child sold in six minutes at auction to an anonymous local buyer for £150,000. The childhood home of Sir Paul McCartney (pictured centre) sold for £150,000 in just six minutes  - and for more than double the average price for a property on the road in the Speke area of Liverpool . The terraced home in Western Avenue, Speke, was where the musician lived with his parents from 1947 until the mid-1950s. In October, a home where George Harrison spent some of his youth - also in Speke - was snapped up at auction by a super fan. Beatles fanatic Jackie Holmes, from London, bought the Liverpool property for £156,000 at the auction which took place at Liverpool's Cavern Club. The property in Upton Green, was home to the musician during Beatle-mania and was a popular hang-out for the band during their early years. A year earlier, John Lennon's childhood home at 9 Newcastle Road in Wavertree, sold at auction for £480,000. In December, it was reported that Ringo Starr and his wife were trying to find a buyer for his $3.85million Colorado ranch (pictured) As Beatlemania took off, members of the Fab Four were soon seen in upmarket properties around the globe. And in recent years, luxury homes they have occupied have continued to hit the headlines. In December, it was reported that Ringo Starr and his wife had put his country estate in Surrey on the market for more than $20million - and that he was also trying to find a buyer for his $3.85million Colorado ranch. The ranch, located about 30 minutes outside Aspen in Woody Creek on 15.8 acres, sits on the banks of the Roaring Fork River and has three bedrooms, a living room that features vaulted ceilings, exposed wood beams and a neat rock fireplace. Last year a three-bedroom flat in Knightsbridge shared by George Harrison and Ringo Starr at the height of Beatlemania went on the market for £2.5million . The 17th-century Surrey estate sits on 200 acres of land, and was purchased for just $3.1million by Starr in 1999. Last year a three-bedroom flat shared by George Harrison and Ringo Starr at the height of Beatlemania went on the market for £2.5million. The musicians moved into the apartment in Knightsbridge in 1964 - the year of their first world tour. The pair - who shared with Harrison's then girlfriend, model Pattie Boyd - also briefly lived in two other flats in the central London apartment building.

"A single mother-of-four rejected by American Idol three times is now set to land a record deal after a DIY music video she made hit the web and went viral. Kimberly Henderson, 26, from Sunter, South Carolina, filmed herself singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her one-year-old daughter, Vaida, last December. The clip - which has since been viewed more than 2.6 million times - landed the full-time nurse an opportunity to record her own track and since then her phone has apparently been ringing off the hook. Scroll down for video . Lucky break: A single mother-of-four rejected by American Idol three times is now set to land a record deal after a DIY music video she made hit the web and went viral - above, seen in a new music video . Finding fame: Kimberly Henderson, 27, from Sunter, South Carolina, filmed herself singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her one-year-old daughter, Vaida, last December . Henderson told Fox News that she is being courted by four different record companies and she is working with a manager to negotiate a deal. She says she has been singing since the age of two and doing it full-time would be a dream come true. Currently Henderson - who has four children aged one to ten - works two jobs as a healthcare worker and receives help from relatives with child care. She says she barely gets time to stop but recently she took time out to go and record her own high-gloss music track in Los Angeles called Tiny Hearts. The beautiful ballad, which she penned in just 24 hours, focuses on her her experiences as a single parent. The first verse describes her earliest months as a young mother to her baby girl. Baby steps: The clip - which has since been viewed more than 2.6 million times - landed the full-time nurse an opportunity to record her own track and since then her phone has apparently been ringing off the hook . Working mom: She says she barely gets time to stop but recently she took time out to go and record her own music track in Los Angeles called Tiny Hearts . 'My friends are doing normal things like going to the movies and on dates and out on the weekends. And I’m at home,' she explains. 'I felt like I was missing out on something, but coming home to her and being with her gave my life more meaning.' The music-making trip of a lifetime was paid for by Cosco Kids, a company which makes baby products. Apparently the firm found out Henderson was in a bad car crash and a Cosco car seat saved her child’s life. Managers from the business then came up with a way to support her musical endeavors. Tiny Hearts was released in January and it jumped to number 53 in the charts. An accompanying music video captured Henderson in action with her children and singing at a recording studio. Candid footage also showed her getting a makeover with a stylist and make-up artist injecting some added star appeal. Henderson says getting rejected from American Idol will not stop her from doing what she loves. Rock-a-bye-baby: Henderson seen in her original DIY music video which went viral last December . Talent: The blonde says she's been singing since the age of two and it would be a dream to do it full-time . She concluded: 'They have good things to say. They just said, ""You have a really unique voice, we think you’re good, but it’s just not your time yet."" 'So I’m guessing maybe now it’s my time.' On a more personal level, Henderson hopes that fame might help her to reconnect her with her own mother, who disappeared from her life when she was 11 years old. 'I don't know where she is,' the singer told The Huffington Post, adding, 'But I keep thinking that maybe if she somehow sees my video or my new song, she'll come forward and try to reach out.' Henderson says her family are excited about her recent breakthrough. Along with Whitney Houston and Sam Smith, Christina Aguilera is another of the blonde's musical idols.","Kimberly Henderson, 26, from Sunter, South Carolina, filmed herself singing Sam Smith's version of the Whitney Houston track How Will I Know to her one-year-old daughter, Vaida, last December .

"A cupboard surfing canine got itself into a spot of bother after it jumped down from a door and broke it off it hinges. The hilarious footage captured in Borehamwood shows a Rottweiler named Dexter perched on top of a cupboard door looking out the window. Asking him what he is doing, the owner laughs at the sight of his large dog surfing on the open door while it seemingly considers diving out of the open window. Moving around on the door, the dog paws at the window sill and causes its owner to laugh even more hysterically. Catching his breath, the owner then calls for the Rottweiler to get down from the cupboard door. But the dog chooses to ignore him and instead continues to look longingly out of the window. Dexter the Rottweiler surfs the cupboard door in the kitchen while his owner films and laughs hysterically . On the third time of asking, Dexter reacts to his owner's command, but instead of jumping down looks about anxiously as if trying to work out how he is going to go about doing it. Manoeuvring himself to the right, the dog goes as if to jump but before he is able to do so the cupboard door comes off its hinges and crashes to the floor. Falling down alongside the door, the dog knocks a number of items off the adjacent counter. The dog falls from the cupboard door taking it with him after attempting to jump down on its owner's command . The dog lands, momentarily eyes up the damage it has caused and makes a quick get away. Staying silent for the rest of the clip, the owner films the broken door – one hinge still attached to it, the other attached to the frame. The video concludes on a shot of the dog looking guilty as it stands in the hallway. The owner who had been previously laughing films the broken cupboard door silently before turning his attention to the guilty looking dog .","Owner walks in to find his Rottweiler surfing the cupboard door .

"A wild giant panda has been spotted adhering to all the correct pedestrian rules as it walked a zebra crossing in south-west China. Giant pandas are usually only captured on wildlife cameras situated in remote bamboo forests, but this one was caught on CCTV as it crossed the road. The panda was captured by traffic monitors in Yingxiu township in  Sichuan province as it made its way across the quiet lane . Why did the panda: The wild giant panda bear was caught on CCTV as it crossed a road in south-west China . Out for a walk: The footage shows the rare bear correctly crossing the lane in Yingxiu township, Sichuan . Night-time stroll: The panda is believed to have left its natural forest habitat due to hunger or may have been forced by man-made activity or been scared by dogs . 'They almost never go into urban areas and prefer the safety of their forest habitat, so it's really unusual to catch one in town like this,' Yong Chen, panda expert at a breeding centre told local news. 'It looks pretty healthy as well, but as it's winter it was probably hungry and looking for something extra to eat.' He said the panda appears to be approximately two-years-old and in good health. Other experts however suggested that the panda may have been forced to leave its natural habitat either because of some man-made activity or possibly stray dogs, as food alone would not tempt it into town. The visit by the bear sparked a flood of panda-watchers to Yingxiu township, however there has been no second sighting of the  rare animal which appears to have returned to its regular habitat. Proper panda: The panda could be seen checking for traffic before crossing the road . Young un: An expert said the panda appears to be approximately two-years-old and in good health .

"England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton has denied that he has been contacted by Kevin Pietersen to discuss a potential return to the national team. Pietersen has become optimistic his England career could yet be revived and reports on Tuesday claimed that the 34-year-old had held conversations with intermediaries acting for the ECB. 'He hasn't asked me for a meeting,' said Downton. 'As far as the ECB is concerned no position has changed. We put out a statement last week.' Reports suggested that England outcast Kevin Pietersen had contacted the ECB over a return . Pietersen has not ruled out an England return after comments made by incoming chairman Colin Graves . Downton was one of the key figures in casting Pietersen out of the England set-up following last year's 5-0 Ashes whitewash and when asked if he would consider a meeting with the South Africa-born batman, he added: 'I don't know what to say to that to be honest. 'It's not something that is at the forefront of the selectors' minds now. We've got a group of players that we are working with and looking to progress the England team. 'Nothing has changed from where we were in the last year.' Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves kick-started Pietersen's hopes of a return a fortnight ago when he suggested he should play county cricket if he was serious about playing for England again. The ECB released a statement later that day to clarify Graves' comments which said 'nothing had changed' regarding Pietersen's England future. England were embarrassingly knocked out of the World Cup in the group stages after defeat by Bangladesh . The South African-born batsman was axed by England following the 2014 Ashes whitewash . Paul Downtown insists 'nothing has changed' Pietersen has nonetheless been impressed by Graves and on Tuesday morning backed the 67-year-old entrepreneur to make the changes to revitalise England in the wake of their early World Cup exit. Pietersen alluded to a recent relaxation in ECB policy to allow players to be available for the entire Indian Premier League as a positive step and that he suspected it was the start of a progressive period under Graves. Pietersen posted on Twitter: 'Quick note - ECB doesn't decide who gets to play in IPL/Big Bash. The franchises have to want them! Plenty have tried & failed to get a go! 'But, the encouraging news is that the new boss has the vision to look to open up a window to hopefully give players a better chance! 'I really do think changes are going to be made & positive things are going to start to happen for the good of English cricket...' England's World Cup embarrassment has given ammunition to those who believe it was a mistake to axe Pietersen and while Graves' comments have forced the ECB to reinforce their stance on a player who left Surrey last autumn, Downton said it has not caused him any discomfort. 'What Colin said was absolutely right,' he said. 'To be picked for England you have to be scoring an awful amount of runs in county cricket and you have to be perceived by the selectors as a positive influence on the side. 'Nothing has changed.'","Reports claimed Kevin Pietersen contacted the ECB over England return .

"South Africa have still never reached the final of an ICC Cricket World Cup after losing at the semi-final stage for the fourth time in a nail-biter with New Zealand, doing little end their tag as chokers. The Proteas won their first ever knock-out match in a World Cup against Sri Lanka for the chance to meet the Black Caps at Eden Park but fell in a thrilling match reduced to 43 overs each in Auckland. The set New Zealand 298 courtesy of 50s from AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis but had their hearts broken when Grant Elliott, who was born in Johannesburg, hit a six to win the match with a ball to spare.

When Brian Lara dragged West Indies to 264 with a classy 111 in a fast even for modern standards 94 ball, with help only from a young Shivnarine Chanderpaul with 56, it was a gettable total for the South Africa. And they looked to be making short work of it as they cruised to 118 for one at the halfway mark. However, a spectacular collapse sparked by Windies' left-arm spinner Jimmy Adams saw a very different story emerge. Opener Andrew Hudson went for 54 for the second wicket, Daryll Cullinan followed two runs later for 69. Captain Hansie Cronje showed some resistance with 40 before he became Adams' third scalp. Fellow spinner Roger Harper then took over in Karachi, ripping through the middle order of Jonty Rhodes, Brian McMillan and Shaun Pollock, and then knocked over one of their two proper tail-enders in Steven Palframanfor.

Lance Klusener appeared to be leading the Proteas to victory, smashing Damien Fleming for successive fours in the first two balls of the opening over to equal Australia's total. With four balls remaining, South Africa needed just a single. Alan Donald was almost run out by Darren Lehmann trying to back up too far at the non-striker's end. Then, farcically, with two balls remaining, Klusener hit a ball straight past the bowler and ran safely to the danger end. However, Donald stood his ground his ground and their near-certain win became another prematures World Cup exit as Adam Gilchrist whipped off the bails. South Africa's Lance Klusener, batting at an astonishing No 8, smashes 31 off just 16 balls against Australia .

South Africa should have been more than capable of chasing down New Zealand’s total of 221, and much like 1996 against the Windies were cruising to victory at 108 for two. But then came another collapse of monumental proportions. Jaques Kallis (47) was a big loss for the third wicket at 108-3, before spinning opener Nathan McCullum claimed JP Duminy and AB de Villiers was run out for the fourth and fifth wickets on 121. Faf du Plessis' attempt to lead them home ended on 36 as the ninth wicket fell for 172, their final score when Morne Morkel was dismissed by Luke Woodcock.

"It’s a common sight on the streets of China’s most populous city Shanghai. But the image of an incredibly overloaded delivery bike still manages to boggle the mind of anyone who sees it. Captured cycling through the streets of Shanghai, two men are shown carrying a ridiculously large load of seven huge boxes of paper. Parked, the two bikes are dwarfed under the load of the seven boxes that they each carry . Straining under the weight of the cargo the three-wheeled bikes can be heard groaning as the riders go about making their delivery. Despite being dwarfed by the extremely heavy load, the riders move relatively fast towards their destination. Filmed parked at the side of the road after arriving, one of the bikes is shown toppled backwards under the weight of the boxes. One of the bikes moves relatively quickly considering the size and weight of its load . The pair are then seen untying the rope around the boxes before offloading the paper onto the street. Pulling the rope from the top, one man manages to put his bike back on all three wheels before he attempts to remove the highest stacked box. Because of China’s huge population, many locals have adopted this means of transport as a way of getting around effectively. Pushbikes, motorbikes, mopeds and scooters are all used in place of transit vans and HGVs as a way of avoiding the congestion. One of the bikes in unable to sustain the weight of the load when stationery and topples onto its two back wheels .

"Mo Farah has had his nationality called into question by the Spaniard whose European half-marathon record he broke in Lisbon on Sunday. Fabian Roncero claimed he still considered himself the record holder because Farah set a new 'Somalian record'. Farah won the EDP Lisbon Half Marathon in 59 minutes 32 seconds to take 20 seconds off the mark set by Roncero 14 years ago. Mo Farah smashed the European record and completed thehalf-marathon in Lisbon in under 60 minutes . The GB Team runner takes a tumble after crossing the finish line and winning the half-marathon . In an interview with Spanish news agency EFE Roncero said 'what was broken in Lisbon was the Somalian record'. The double Olympic champion was born in Mogadishu in Somalia before moving to Britain as a child. Roncero's comments come in the wake of Farah's feud with compatriot Andy Vernon. Farah alleged his team-mate suggested he did not deserve the European 10,000 metres title he won last summer as he was not European, claims Vernon branded 'complete lies'. Fabian Roncero, pictured winning the Rotterdam Marathon in 1998, referred to Farah's time as a new 'Somalian record' Roncero, 44, added: 'For me, an athlete who was born in Kenya is Kenyan for life and one born in Somalia is Somalian forever.' Farah, who celebrated his 32nd birthday on Monday, has won five global titles in the colours of Great Britain to become arguably the country's greatest ever athlete. Farah has been involved in a social media feud with fellow runner Andy Vernon (left) Roncero also said: 'For me the 800m European record holder remains Sebastian Coe, the 1500m (holder) Fermin Cacho, the 5,000m (holder) Dieter Baumann and the 10,000m (holder) Antonio Pinto.' In fact Farah holds both the 1500m and 10,000m marks, while the 5,000m mark is held by Moroccan-born Belgian Mohammed Mourhit. Farah's camp declined to comment on Roncero's remarks when contacted.","Mo Farah broke the European half-marathon record in Lisbon on Sunday .

"Liverpool thrashed West Ham 5-0 on Friday night to keep up the pressure on Manchester United at the top of the Under 21 Premier League table. The Reds moved to within one point of their rivals as a double from Ryan McLaughlin and strikes from Kevin Stewart, Cameron Brannagan and Sergi Canos routed the Hammers at Chester's Deva Stadium. Unlike previous seasons there will be no end-of-season play-offs, meaning a straight shoot-out for the title. Liverpool's comprehensive win lifted them above Southampton and Tottenham into second and they still have a game in hand on United.

Having suffered a setback with defeat at Southampton on Monday, Liverpool were looking for a response against a West Ham team looking doomed to relegation to the second tier. And it didn't take them long to make the breakthrough. In the third minute, a throw-in by Brad Smith wasn't cleared and Stewart seized upon the loose ball. From the edge of the box, he flicked the ball to create some space and curled it into the top corner. A ssecond followed on six minutes when Harry Wilson's flick set Smith clear out wide. He crossed and Lewis Page's ineffective clearance fell straight to McLaughlin to fire home. The London side managed to stem the flow for a little while but further goals seemed inevitable and Liverpool duly extended their lead a minute before half-time. Canos broke clear down the left channel and squared to Brannagan to apply the finishing touch from close range.

"Mo Farah broke the European record on his way to an impressive victory at the EDP Lisbon Half Marathon on Sunday. The double Olympic champion sprinted clear of Kenyan rival Micah Kogo to cross the line in 59 minutes 32 seconds, taking 20 seconds off the mark set by Spain's Fabian Roncero 14 years ago. It was the first time a British athlete had run the 13.1 mile distance in under 60 minutes. Farah, who celebrates his 32nd birthday on Monday, has now set a world record and a European record in his two races so far this year. Mo Farah smashed the European record and completed the race in Lisbon Half Marathon in under 60 minutes . His only race of the indoor campaign, in Birmingham last month, resulted in a new world best time over two miles and this latest success on the road suggests he is in the best possible shape ahead of a season in which he will aim to retain his 5,000 and 10,000 metres titles at the World Championships in Beijing in August. 'It feels amazing, I got massive support from the crowd,' Farah said on www.iaaf.org. 'It wasn't easy, the race organisers put in a great field. To win here was hard, but it's my birthday tomorrow so It's a good birthday present. I feel so happy to break the British record and European record.' The GB Team runner takes a tumble after crossing the finish line and winning the Half Marathon . Farah finished a second ahead of Kogo after the pair had broken clear from another Kenyan, Stephen Kibet, who had to settle for third in 59:58. Farah was content to let the Kenyan pair set the pace before reeling them in with a couple of miles to go. Kibet fell back, but Kogo proved tougher to crack before Farah's superior finishing speed took him clear in the closing metres. The Briton tumbled to the ground after crossing the line, but reported no lasting damage. The runner was delighted with his performance as the outdoor seasons begins to get underway . He said: 'My legs were so tired. Normally when you cross the line you step over the tape, but I was so tired I couldn't lift my legs and tripped over it.' Farah's previous half marathon best was 60:00 at the Bupa Great North Run last September, but that was set on an overall downhill course rather than a looped route. The Lisbon course is flat and fast and was the setting for Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese's world record of 58:23 in 2010. Farah has now won four of the six half marathons he has raced, coming second in the other two.","Mo Farah smashed the European Half Marathon record by 20 seconds .

"On a damp day at White Hart Lane just over 50 years ago we gathered to report on Dave Mackay making his comeback from a broken leg. We were about to witness the amazing proof of what many us believed, that Mackay was the hardest man of all in an era of footballers who tackled like tanks. The short, stocky, powerful wing-half who is enshrined in Spurs folklore as ’the heartbeat’ of the first team to achieve the League championship and FA Cup double after the second world war had sustained a left leg fracture in a collision with Manchester United’s Noel Cantwell at Old Trafford.

Mackay runs up the stairs at White Hart Lane as he fights his way back from a double leg fracture . It was a serious, complex injury and it was nine months before his return, in a reserve match against Shrewsbury. Typically, Mackay went thundering in for the ball. To our horror there was a snapping sound. Still he got up but the trainer rushed on, took a quick look and heart-brokenly told him the leg had shattered again. The pain must have been excruciating but Mackay insisted on checking the diagnosis personally. He stamped his foot on the ground and only as the cracked bone stuck out through his bloodied sock did he accept that he could not play on. Even then he spurned the stretcher and walked off, trying not to limp. ‘Never show you’re hurt,’ he growled as they hurried him to hospital. It wasn’t the first time we heard him say that. It was his mantra. Mackay pitied the weak. As for divers, he despised them. ‘Get up and be a man,’ he used to bark at any opponent who made a meal of his tackling, which was an even more fearsome thing of which to be on the receiving end than it was to behold. But always, unfailingly honest. That was why he disliked that iconic photograph of him grabbing a startled Billy Bremner by his Leeds shirt neck at Wembley. He thought it portrayed him as a bully. ‘No-one who goes into a fair challenge with me has anything to fear,’ he used to say.

That repeat breakage of the same bone would have finished many a lesser man but Mackay came back again, to resume his midfield partnership with Danny Blanchflower which was the axis of manager Bill Nicholson’s great Tottenham team. A legend which might have ended that day was to grow even greater. Yet he regretted that the iron man image tended to obscure his remarkable ability. ‘I can pass the bloody ball, you know,’ he would rasp in that Scottish brogue brought down from Hearts. We did know. That was why we would elect him Footballer of the Year down here, to follow the same award won north of the border. Blanchflower, the thinking man’s footballer, was esteemed as the brains of the team but Mackay was very much more than the brawn. Blanchflower was the captain but Mackay was the spiritual leader on the pitch, the cement in their bond off it and their bridge to the fans. Beneath that fearsome demeanour in action, he was engaging, amusing and charming and those who jostled for the team’s company after matches at the pub near the ground, the Bell and Hare, enjoyed his generosity.

Sir Bobby Charlton and Mackay chat as they pose for pictures of their special stamps in 2013 . That strong personality carried over into management, most notably at Derby County where he picked up Brian Clough’s mantle and drove them to the League title. Conscious of his role as a Spurs figurehead Mackay always dressed ‘properly’ and his one sortie into commerce was to join his lifelong friend and Tottenham fan Jimmy Burton in a tie manufacturing business. Alzheimer’s was one of the ailments which afflicted his last years and in that sad sense we have been missing this great footballer and nice man for some time already. But none who saw him or knew him will ever forget Dave Mackay. And certainly not that day when he had to prove to himself that his leg was broken.","Mackay, Scottish enforcer of Spurs' 1961 Double winners, died aged 80 .
