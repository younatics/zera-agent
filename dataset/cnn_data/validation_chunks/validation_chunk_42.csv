"A transgender woman has spoken of her struggle to find work after she was sacked from her job in a factory for wearing too much make-up and then rejected by the boss of a cosmetics shop. Pammy Rose, who hit the headlines when she reached the final of a beauty contest without organisers realising she had been born a boy, says she has applied for hundreds of jobs but that no one wants to employ her. The 22-year-old, of Seaham, County Durham, who was born Paul Witten, has now been left with anxiety and depression due to the stress of job hunting. Scroll down for video . Transgender beauty queen Pammy Rose chose her name after hearing a joke likening her to Baywatch beauty Pamela Anderson. The 22-year-old has spoken out about her difficulty in trying to find work . She said: 'I tell people I am transgender as I am not going to hide who I really am. I have tried so hard to get a job but I feel like I am being discriminated against because people do not see me as a woman. 'When I went for an interview at a beauty shop the man interviewing me said he liked me and could see me working there. 'When I told him I was transgender his face dropped and I didn't hear from him again. 'I have applied to work in other shops where I live but I never hear anything back. I know it is because I am transgender. 'I have been trying to get a job for years now. I have sent out so many CVs but nobody replies to me.' The blonde first hit the headlines when she made it to the final of a beauty pageant without revealing that she has been born a boy . Pammy, who was born Paul, started bleaching her hair, wearing makeup and a girls' uniform by the age of 14. She become Pammy Rose officially at the age of 18 . Pammy first told her mother, Julie, 49, that she did not want to be in her male body at the age of four. As a young boy called Paul, Pammy would dance and play with barbies and hated the idea of mud or football. The blonde said: 'When I was younger I was very feminine.I would wear heels and run around the house with a t-shirt on my head pretending it was hair. 'I would tell my mam I'm a girl and I don't belong in this body. I think she thought I was just going to be gay.' Pammy Rose was born Paul Witton and knew she didn't wanted to be male aged four. She embraced her femininity aged 14 and is currently on an NHS waiting list for gender reassignment surgery . Paul would tell his mum he was a girl, play with barbies and hated the idea of mud or football . During secondary school Pammy was singled out and targeted by bullies. She said: 'I was a tranny, puff, sick, a freak, they would call me all sorts of names. I was threatened and humiliated so much that I was scared to leave the house. 'I would never say anything back. I felt like a freak as nobody understood me.' But at the age of 14, Pammy decided to embrace who she really was. She started growing and bleaching her hair, wearing make-up full time and wearing the girls' uniform instead of the boys. Pammy said: 'I would constantly be upset and tell my mum I was trapped in the wrong body. 'Once I came out and told everyone I was a woman, everything became a lot easier.' Over the next three years Pammy travelled with her mother and stepfather Ray to London and later Leeds for monthly meetings with psychologists and doctors. A joke about her looking like Pamela Anderson soon led to her officially changing her name and at the age of 18 she became Pammy Rose. The following year, at the age of 19, she started taking hormones. In spring 2013 when she was 20-years-old she was entered into a local beauty contest - The Face of Sunderland - by a friend and made it to the final without the organisers realising she was transgender. Pammy said:'Until I told them in my interview, the organisers said they didn't even know I was transgender. 'I felt like I had to tell them because I really wanted to promote different people entering the competition.' Pammy has spent years looking for a job and after countless rejections finally got a role working in a food factory in January 2014. She said: 'In the interview I told them I was transgender and needed to wear make up to feel confident. 'I agreed to tone it down because of hygiene rules and they were fine with it.' But after ten months of working there Pammy was outraged to receive a phone call from the company telling her they were letting her go as she wore too much make up. The beauty queen was fired from her food factory job because the amount of make-up she wore was 'unhygienic'. She says she has sent out hundreds of CVs but that people don't want to employ a transgender . She said: 'I had toned my make-up down quite a bit, but not wearing any at all is just not an option for me. I am unable to feel confident without it.They told me it was unhygienic. 'I was devastated. I felt I was good at it. I couldn't understand why they had let me go. The factory hadn't mentioned my make-up was a problem prior to this.' Pammy used her jobseekers allowance to help her apply to many sales assistant posts and admin jobs but did not hear anything back. When Pammy was given an interview for a make-up store in August 2014 she was excited at the possibility of being employed. But when she was unsuccessful in her application she was diagnosed with depression by her GP. Today Pammy is on an NHS waiting list for gender reassignment surgery and hopeful that she might be featuring in Big Brother 2015. She said: 'I hope one day I will find a job and an employer who will accept me for being me.'","Pammy Rose, 22, was born a boy called Paul Witten .

"He is the latest object of female lust from Caithness to Cornwall — a heartbroken hero who is all brooding desire and smouldering good looks. And Aidan Turner, the new Ross Poldark, certainly has plenty of tumultuous romantic experiences to draw on. Perhaps, given his good looks, a rather swashbuckling love life is to be expected: gossips in Dublin insist that he was once — when between serious girlfriends — seen leaving a nightclub in the city with no fewer than three attentive females in tow. Scroll down for video . Aidan Turner is seen here with girlfriend of three years, Sarah Greene, who is also an actress and starred in Adam Jones with Bradley Cooper last year . He has had four serious romances to date, breaking the heart of one gorgeous actress and being thrown over by another. His first girlfriend was actress India Whisker, a pretty blonde whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in Dublin. She was followed by another actress, brunette Charlene McKenna. They lived together in Camden, North London, from 2007 to 2009. She told an interviewer how happy they were together. But within a few weeks they split, and she was apparently devastated. Turner then fell for Lenora Crichlow, his co-star in the TV series Being Human — from 2009 he played a vampire and she a ghost. Then in 2011, he and Lenora parted ways and he decided to quit the series while she stayed on. It seems that this was a source of great heartbreak for him. He said this week: ‘I don’t know anyone on this planet who hasn’t had their heart broken. It’s happened to me. Love is love, it’s the purest and rawest thing we have in life.’ Aidan Turner was also romantically involved with Charlene McKenna (pictured). They shared a flat together in Camden, North London from 2007 to 2009 . The following year he started to date the Irish actress Sarah Greene. She was nominated for a Tony award for her performance on Broadway opposite Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Inishmaan, and last year starred in the film Adam Jones with Bradley Cooper. Their romance is still going strong after three years, but Turner admits that they are often separated by work. He spent 18 months making The Hobbit films in New Zealand early on in their liaison. He explained of the periods of separation: ‘It’s all we’ve ever known [as a couple] and it makes for good times when we meet up again and maybe have a month straight when we’re both unemployed and watching movies every day. It’s fun to laze around and do normal things.’ Aidan Turner (left) also dated Lenora Crichlow (right) from 2009 to 2011, after they met on the TV series Being Human. He later decided to quit the series while she stayed on . Aidan is quietly bowled over by his sudden fame. Asked how it feels to be an overnight sex symbol, he chuckles. ‘Ah, I wouldn’t say that,’ he demurred yesterday. ‘Not at all. But it is nice that the show has gone down quite well and people are positive about it.’ Understatement must be as much a part of his make-up as the kind of looks which have reduced the female half of the country to jelly. In the show, Turner is British Army officer Ross Poldark, who returns to Cornwall following the American War of Independence to find his father dead, the family’s tin mine in ruins and his sweetheart, Elizabeth, engaged to his cousin. Aidan Turner (left) is seen with ex-girlfriend actress India Whisker (right) whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in Dublin . Since the opening episode on Sunday, there has been praise for the ensemble acting and the script — but mostly for how dishy the lead looks in a pair of britches. Even his mother, Eileen, is being stopped in the street and asked how it feels to have a sex-symbol son. ‘That is very funny,’ Aidan told me this week. ‘I’ve definitely never had that before. I can’t believe it, really.’ I can reveal that Turner is contracted to be in a further five series of Poldark, should the BBC make the obvious decision to make more. In the meantime, he is staying with his mum in South Dublin, although he is hoping to go away on holiday soon with girlfriend Sarah. Aidan Turner (pictured as Ross Poldark) has been bowled over by his sudden rise to fame and definitely doesn't consider himself a sex symbol . One of those watching Poldark on Sunday was his old drama teacher Patrick Sutton, director of Dublin’s Gaiety School of Acting, who told me: ‘I settled down in front of the telly like a child waiting to meet Father Christmas. And then he comes on, all brooding and bubbling and seething, and I said to myself: “Well, that’s a grand day out.” I could not be prouder of him.’ Mr Sutton, who counts Hollywood star Colin Farrell among his previous students, puts Aidan’s success down to talent, hard work and good manners — all three of which Gaiety School students are taught. The son of Eileen, an accountant at a local carpet store, and Pat, an electrician, there is no acting background in Aidan’s family — he hadn’t even been to a play before he went to drama college. He was raised in Clondalkin, just west of Dublin, and went to St MacDara’s Community College in Templeogue. One of two brothers, he recalls having been a bit of a tearaway as a schoolboy. He told one interviewer: ‘I remember my mum getting called up a lot.’ Smouldering: Aiden Turner with co-star Eleanor Tomlinson in Poldark . Dumped: In the BBC series, Poldark (Turner) is dumped by his former love Elizabeth (Heida Reed) His great talent at that age was ballroom dancing, and he even represented his country. He travelled around Ireland and internationally, competing in ballroom and Latin for around ten years. Tommy Shaughnessy, president of DanceSport Federation of Ireland, told me: ‘I used to teach Aidan. He danced for years. But after I told his mother the cost of making it in international ballroom dancing, she said they couldn’t afford it and told me that he might go into acting. ‘This surprised me as he was very shy. Anyway, he joined the Gaiety School and the rest is history.’ While at drama school, he did put his old skills to use, doing a dance for a fundraiser with his then girlfriend India Whisker. Turner had no idea what he wanted to do after school. After a stint working with his dad as an apprentice, he toyed with the idea of becoming a professional snooker player before spotted an advert for the Gaiety School of Acting. ‘I didn’t know anything about this world at all,’ said Aidan. ‘I felt intimidated from the get-go, but thought: “That’s just right for me.” The sense of potential failure is a buzz. ‘Being around committed people there was very inspiring.’ Before he started acting, Turner (pictured with Eleanor Tomlinson in Poldark), represented Ireland in ballroom dancing competitions across the country and internationally . He graduated in 2004, and had various theatre roles before getting a break in an Irish television medical drama, The Clinic, in 2008. The following year came Being Human. This attracted an excitable group of young fans whom he calls ‘the posse’, and who have followed his every move ever since. He gained more fans playing Kili, a heartthrob of the dwarf world in Peter Jackson’s Hobbit films. But his biggest break was Poldark. Earlier this year he said: ‘The offer came in and I said: “What the hell’s Poldark?” I had to Google it. ‘Then I called my mum. She said: “You’d better not mess this up!” ’ Don't mess this up! Turner hadn't heard of Poldark but was warned not to mess the job up by his mother . Perhaps we can forgive his ignorance as, since he’s still only 31, he wasn’t even born when the original Seventies TV version aired. One wonders if either he or girlfriend Sarah are ready for the attention which has just exploded, even more of which will no doubt follow with the promise of a buff and shirtless Poldark in future episodes. Sarah said in an interview last year that she had been outraged when some fans took pictures of him when he was asleep on the London Underground. But he says of the ardent kerfuffle: ‘I don’t think she’ll be bothered, no. We’re both actors, we understand that it is part of our job.’ In Aidan’s case, the ‘job’ seems to be the play the role of newly minted national sex symbol — and he’s doing it to perfection.","Aidan Turner plays Ross Poldark in a BBC remake of the Seventies series .

"Cinderella's wardrobe may be brimming with ornate glass slippers but it's her classic hour-glass figure women are lusting after. The new Disney film, starring British actress Lily James in the title role, has helped spur on a revival of the shape-shifting garment according to The Sunday Times. The new trailer for the rags-to-riches fairy tale sees 25-year-old Lily flaunt an enviably tiny waist thanks to the help of an icy-blue corset dress complete with floor-skimming puffball skirt. British actress Lily James dons Cinderella's iconic icy-blue dress in the latest Disney movie . One leading retailer of the traditional, steel-boned women's corsets, What Katie Did, has seen sales of the garment grow by 50 per cent in the past three months. While online auction website eBay has reported sales of the more modern corset rise by 54 per cent since December. Esher-born Lily, who is dating former Doctor Who star Matt Smith, 32, recently hit back at claims that movie makers had digitally altered her figure. She says her minuscule waist is achieved by wearing an ultra-constricting corset and by consuming a liquid diet. Models stormed the catwalk at Alexander Wang (left) in simplistic corset waist bands while tight-fitting prom dresses ruled the runway at Stella McCartney (right) last month . Lily told E! News: 'When [the corset] was on we would be on continuous days, so we wouldn't stop for lunch or a lovely tea —you'd be sort of eating on the move. 'In that case, I couldn't untie the corset. So if you ate food it didn't really digest properly and I'd be burping all afternoon in and it was just really sort of unpleasant. 'I'd have soup so that I could still eat but it wouldn't get stuck.' But it's not just on the big screen where corsets are making a comeback. The restricting bodice, which helps boost breasts, banish muffin top and slim the tum, has featured on the catwalks of Stella McCartney and Alexander Wang this season. Madonna (left) steps out in a risque custom-made Givenchy corset at The Grammy Awards last month, while Kylie Minogue (right) stuns in a scarlet bodice during a performance in Australia last night . Meanwhile, Madonna turned heads in a risque custom-made Givenchy corset at The Grammy Awards last month. Fellow singer Kylie Minogue has been stunning onstage in a scarlet bodice during her current Kiss Me Once tour, which touched down in Perth, Australia last night. Founder of What Katie Did, Katie Thomas, told The Sunday Times that the corset revival is all about female empowerment. 'It's more about being confident, powerful and being in control while looking good as well,' she said. 'It has absolutely nothing to do with men at all.' Katie, whose clients include the supermodel Kate Moss, says the Jessica Rabbit-type body shape is back in fashion.'Suddenly we've got Kim Kardashian on the scene with her tiny waist and big hips - it's amazing to have someone with that kind of figure be popular again - she's allowing us girls with curves to get back in there a bit.' Never ones to miss a trend, Kardashian sisters Kim, Kourtney and Khloe have all turned to corsets in order to slim down. Kim Kardashian shared this image on her Instagram page of her wearing a waist-training corset before a shoot . Apprentice runner-up Luisa Zissman (left) and Khloe Kardashian (right) have both tried out the celebrity-approved slimming craze . The celebrity-approved craze is known as waist training and involves completely modifying your figure and posture by restricting it. Trim-tum seekers must wear the corset for short periods of time, gradually increasing use to achieve desired results. Some people even sleep in it. However, health experts have warned of the dangers. Mary Jane Minkin, clinical professor of ob-gyn at Yale School of Medicine, told Women's Health: . 'Medically, it doesn’t make sense that cinching your waist tightly will make it permanently smaller. 'Once you take the garment off, your body will return to its usual shape. 'It’s also uncomfortable, restricts your movements, and if you wear it really tight, it can even make it difficult to breathe and theoretically could cause rib damage.'","Steel-boned corsets shop What Katie Did has seen sales rise by 50 per cent .

"A young mother  choked to death on her  vomit after eating a Kinder Beuno while drowsy on painkillers, an inquest has heard. Candice Campbell, 25, who had taken the medicine to help her post-natal stomach pain, drifted off to sleep while eating the chocolate bar. Miss Campbell, mother to one-year-old son Harrison, then choked as she was sleeping beside her fiancé on the couple's sofa in Hull. Doting: Mother-of-one Candice Campbell, 25 (pictured left and right with partner Geoffrey Burns), choked to death on her own vomit after eating a Kinder Bueno before falling asleep on the sofa, an inquest has heard . Her husband-to-be Geoffrey Burns, who had also fallen asleep, woke up to find his partner's lifeless body slumped onto his knee. Despite him desperately giving  CPR to Miss Campbell, she could not be saved. Miss Campbell, who did not drink alcohol, had been taking a variety of prescribed medication to ease abdominal pain which she had suffered after giving birth in October 2013. At an inquest into her death, Mr Burns told the hearing how he had warned Miss Campbell not to eat the bar, incase she fell asleep. He told how the pair had both fallen asleep while watching a film, but that he had woken up around 5.30am to find Miss Campbell unresponsive. He said: 'Candice was eating a stick of Kinder Bueno and I told her not to eat chocolate in case she fell asleep because her medication makes her drowsy. I was worried that she may fall asleep eating it. 'I must have been tired because I fell asleep. I woke up to the dogs barking and Candice's head was on my lap. The first thing I remember saying to her was, ""Wake up, let's go upstairs"". 'I noticed her lips were blue and there was a white foam coming from her nose and food particles at her mouth.' Mr Burns said when he realised she was not responsive, he began CPR. An inquest heard how Miss Campbell was watching a film with her partner at their home in Hull when the pair both drifted off to sleep. Mr Burns told the inquest that he had warned her not to eat the bar (pictured) He said: 'I gave her mouth to mouth and pressed down on her chest as I was taught at first aid. 'I continued to scoop out food from her mouth and I saw there was the Kinder Bueno she was eating before I fell asleep. 'I tried to resuscitate her. I blew twice into her mouth and did 32 compressions.' The inquest heard how Mr Burns then ran 12 doors down the street to Miss Campbell's parents' house to get help. Her father, Ian Gibson, also attempted CPR before they called for an ambulance. Dr Ian Scott, consultant neuropathologist at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham, carried out the post-mortem examination. He said toxicology tests revealed Miss Campbell had taken several different drugs, including diazepam, tramadol, pregabalin and 'possibly' dihydrocodeine. He said that although Miss Campbell had not taken a 'fatal' amount of each drug, the combination had been enough to depress the central nervous system, which left her unable to clear her airways if she vomited. Dr Scott said: 'I found debris impacted in the trachea and material similar to that which is found in the stomach. 'Where a patient may vomit and then inhale what's been in the stomach it causes asphyxia. The cause of death is asphyxiation due to aspiration of gastric contents. There is no suggestion that this was a deliberate overdose.' During the hearing, Mr Gibson paid tribute to his daughter. He told the court: 'She was a good mum and would have done anything for Harrison. She doted on him. 'She loved being around people, she had a lot of friends, She was also a real family girl who enjoyed spending time with them.' Senior coroner Professor Paul Marks recorded a verdict of accidental death, calling it a 'tragic case'. He said: 'This is a very tragic case where a young mother had been enjoying an evening with her partner and fell asleep. 'She vomited but was unable to clear her airways. There is not a shred of evidence to suggest Candice took more medication than she should have.'","Candice Campbell, 25, had taken medicine to help  post-natal stomach pain .

"A veteran has finally received his Second World War medals - at the age of 95. Former army cook Harry Weston mistakenly believed he had left it too late to request them after  finishing his military service in 1946. But nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, a local historian applied on his behalf, and he was finally awarded them. War veteran Harry Weston, 95,  pictured with his wife Margaret, after finally receiving his  medals . Mr Weston enlisted in the Army Catering Corps cook in 1940 and served in Scotland until 1946. During his time in the army, he and four other cooks prepared meals three times a day for a battalion of over 700 soldiers. He was based in Shetland and Orkney during the war and after completing his service returned home to Greetham, Rutland. David Bland was researching Mr Weston's history when he discovered that he had never received his gongs and wrote to the Ministry of Defence last month. Just a few days later  shiny Defence Medal and War Medal arrived at the home Mr Weston shares with his wife Margaret. David Bland and his son Paul are writing a village history book called Greetham and the Great War. Paul Bland said: 'Harry was a bit surprised, but delighted to get his medals. He was really pleased. 'I imagine even 10 years after the war he might have thought it was too late. 'Harry had just got on with his life and had forgotten about it. We thought it was time to put it right.' Greetham and the Great War will be released in e-book form later this year. Mr Weston, pictured with his wife, as a young solider.

"A Florida woman is facing drug charges after trying to bring marijuana into a police car after an officer offered her a safe ride home. The officer responded to a possible domestic abuse call at about 10.40pm in Orange City on Wednesday, where he found Michelle Sanford, 36, 'extremely intoxicated', according to the police report. Once it was determined that Sanford had not been struck by her boyfriend, Thomas Laudenslager, 46, the officer asked her if she had somewhere to stay and offered to drive her. Michelle Sanford, 36, was arrested on Wednesday night after asking a police officer if she could bring marijuana into a patrol car after she was offered a safe ride home . Sanford first brought clothes and an open beer to the patrol car, but the officer advised that she put the beer down, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. As that point, Laudenslager asked Sanford, 'Why don't you take your weed with you?' reports said. Sanford then turned to the officer and asked if she could take her marijuana with her in the car and smoke a joint at her father's house, according to the report. Sanford was arrested in Orange City (police department pictured) and ten to the Volusia County Jail. She is now out on bond . Laudenslager questioned by Sanford would say something that could send her to jail, to which she responded, 'It's just weed and he might be cool with it,' the police report said. After showing the marijuana to the officer, Sanford was arrested and charged with possession of paraphernalia and a misdemeanor drug offense. The officer also reportedly saw marijuana in the home's living room, according to Fox Orlando.

"Home buyers can breathe a sign of relief as the price growth of homes that have previously seen record breaking auction reserves smashed, will slow down for 2015. Although its seeing less than half of it's price growth of last year, Sydney will continue to thrash the rest of the country in house costs with an eight percent rise, compared to a national growth of around five percent. According to the Domain Group's latest figures, Brisbane will surprisingly outperform the other capital cities as well with a rise of 6 percent, whilst Melbourne sits lower on a moderate four to five percent growth. Scroll down for video . This property is for sale in Pymble, 16 kilometres north-west of Sydney CBD which retains a house price rise of eight percent, much lower than 2014's 12.2% . The grand estate at 42 Telegraph Road, Pymble boasts six bedrooms, five bathrooms and three car spots and a deluxe marble kitchen . Cascading lawns engulf the property, containing a tennis court and swimming pool all privately set on 3389sqm in Pymble . Additional features of the property include a formal lounge, dining room, billiard room, wine cellar, fireplaces and parquetry floors . Hornsby will see a rise in popularity this year with homes like this one going on the market . This home contains five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a sun-filled conservatory, a stone atrium and a double automatic garage . 'Hornsby is having a good run but further North on the Central Coast hasn't really got the employment growth,' said Angie Zigomanis from BIS Shrapnel . Although record low interest rates are showing a climb in property competition, first home buyers and those looking to upgrade will still have trouble. Sydney's north western, upper north and inner-west suburbs will show the most price growth with an expected 10 percent rise. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics however, this is still less than Sydney's 12.2 percent rise from last year. 'Sydney's resilience is largely driven by its property shortages,' Domain senior economist Andrew Wilson told The Australian Financial Review. 'However, investor activity remains at record levels and this is another key driver of the price growth being seen.' Last year we saw the top performing suburbs demonstrating the best growth in the last 12 months actually occurred far from the nation's CBDs. Angie Zigomanis from BIS Shrapnel told Daily Mail Australia that whilst exact suburbs cannot be determined this early on, We are definitely seeing a ripple effect. 'In Sydney the middle to outer Western suburbs will experience growth in popularity,' he said. 'Hornsby is having a good run but further North on the Central Coast hasn't really got the employment growth.' This home at 19 Ormadale Road Yeronga, seven kilometres south of Brisbane CBD is located in the area that has seen a six percent rise in home pricing . The picturesque home is located on 2725 square metres of riverfront property incredibly close to Brisbane's CBD . The home is built over three levels and contains marble sourced from around the world and custom bespoke designed wool carpets . There are six bedrooms, five bathrooms and six garage spaces as well as a huge cellar, spa and steam room . Mr Zigomanis says Melbourne will be somewhat similar with the Western suburbs and even slightly East gaining popularity. 'It changes every year, often you refer to the median prices,' he said. 'But Brisbane's inner to middle is starting to rise at a stronger rate.' The other cities are not expected to fare as well, with properties in the outer north-west of Melbourne will only be up by two percent whereas inner-Melbourne suburbs will be up by four to five percent. 'The Melbourne housing market weakened over 2014, dragged down by an under performing of local economy,' Mr. Wilson said. The Bureau of statistics documented that Melbourne saw a four and a half percent growth in 2014, much lower than its whopping 10 percent in 2013. Although Melbourne's property price growth has lessened, sitting on around 5 percent, areas like the Docklands is where the rise remains . This property at 40 South Wharf Drive in the Docklands Melbourne, is for sale and boasts four bedrooms, five bathrooms and four car spaces . It's feature include panoramically proportioned glass walls, a lap-pool, a private boat mooring, home cinema, gym, steam room and cellar . Brisbane has seen an improvement in its price growth of homes since its interest cuts in 2012-13 and is now coasting along. Adelaide and Hobart are expected to have a moderate growth this year with both seeing between 3 percent and five percent growth. Perth, Darwin and Canberra are nearly breaking even with a rise of only two percent.","The growth of Australian housing prices is slowing down for 2015 with a national growth of only around five percent .

"Two suspected Al-Qaeda terrorists were today identified as the ringleaders of the murderous attack in Tunisia in which British people were caught up. They were named as Yassine Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui, both Tunisian in their 20s, who were themselves gunned down by police commandoes after killing 19 people, and wounding 44. Both had spent 'a great deal of time' in Kasserine, the western province which is considered a stronghold of a jihadi group linked to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Scroll down for video . Running for their lives: Tourists and visitors to the Bardo museum are seen evacuated from the area by security forces during yesterday's sickening terror attack . At least six others were wounded in the attack. Tunisian authorities are now hunting several men believed to have helped carry out the massacre . 'The young men had boasted of their links with AQIM,' said a Tunisian Interior Ministry source. 'One was living permanently in Tunis, while another was still based in Kasserine. 'AQIM is well established in the region, and anti-terrorist operations are currently underway there in connection with yesterday's attack'. It came as the British foreign office confirmed that two Britons were 'caught up' in the shootings at the Bardo National Museum, next door to the Tunisian Parliament, in Tunis. Kalashnikovs and grenades were used by Abidi and Khachnaoui during an onslaught which lasted four hours. They are thought to have had accomplices, and a nationwide hunt was today underway to try and find them. Their victims were mainly tourists from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Spain, Australia, Poland and France, said Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid. Many were on a Costa cruise ship, which was moored in the Goulette port in Tunis. A spokesman for Coast Cruises said: 'The captain says fourteen passangers are missing. We can't say at this stage if they were among the victims.' A wounded victim of the attack is evacuated by rescue workers outside the museum yesterday . Pictures from French TV show people fleeing from the museum with armed security services providing cover as they run up the steps . A British Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm that two British nationals were caught up in the shootings in Tunis on Wednesday and that we are providing consular assistance. 'We are working with the Tunisian authorities as well as with contacts in the tourist industry to establish if any further British nationals have been affected. 'Through our travel advice, we are urging people to exercise caution and follow the instructions of the local authorities.' Forty-four people were injured in the attack, including 13 Italians, seven French, four Japanese, two South Africans, one Pole, one Russian and six Tunisians. Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: 'Appalled by sickening terrorist attack in Tunis - my thoughts are with those affected. UK stands ready to support Tunisia.' British tour operators confirmed that while thousands of customers are believed to be in the country, very few were in the capital where the attack was carried out. Tunisians gather at Avenue Habib Bourguiba in Tunis to show solidarity with the victims of the attack . Tunisians light candles outside the National Bardo Museum where scores of people were killed . Approximately 1,000 Tunisians were seen demonstrating in Tunis against terrorism, following the attack . Witnesses have described how the police told them to 'run, run, run' after the terrorists started firing at them as they got off coaches in the Bardo car park. 'We heard a bang, and then realised it was not firecrackers but terrorists shooting at everyone,' said one, a French woman who would only give her name as Marie. 'They then entered the museum and began shooting at everything that moved. 'We were in the top floor of the museum. Initially we thought a statue had crashed on to the floor. There was a couple with four children. 'We sat on the floor for an hour without moving. We were in the mosaics room. Then we were told to run, run, run. We went through an exit and were taken to a military barracks.' A source from the Parliament building said: 'There was absolute panic when the shots were heard.' MP Sayida Ounissi confirmed that the 'Minister of Justice, judges and army officers' were all taking part in a debate about terrorism at the time.","Suspects named as Yassine Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui, both in their 20s .

"Shana Mooyman turned her back on a glamorous life as a model and swapped it for a job in the iron ore mines of Western Australia, which has earned her enough money to buy her three investment properties. The 25-year-old started modelling from a young age and often saw her face plastered on promotional nightclub and festival posters. Ms Mooyman, from Bunbury in Western Australia, made the unusual career switch at the age of 19 when she became a mobile plant operator at a mineral sands mine in Cataby. Shana Mooyman used to be a promotional model but now she drives heavy machinery in the mines . After six years behind the wheel of heavy machinery, Ms Mooyman, who is now a fully qualified operator, is adamant she can hold her own - despite working in such a predominately male industry. 'I was a little nervous first coming into this work, being so isolated from everyone into such a small area grouped together with mainly blokes around,' she said. 'But I survived my first couple of shifts and an older lady took me under her wing. 'We started having after work drinks with my crew and that's when the potty mouth started. 'They converted me. I was now just one of the guys holding my ground not taking any of their nonsense. 'You just need to learn to speak up and don't take their jibes seriously and you'll be fine.' At 19, she decided to leave the modelling industry (right) behind and head to the mines at Cataby in Western Australia (left) She is now a fully qualified mobile plant operator at a mineral sands mine because she wanted to do something new and exciting . Ms Mooyman said she wanted to move into the mining industry as it was 'something so new and exciting' with 'heaps to be learnt'. 'Once I started I was earning more than I ever did locally and loved being outdoors all day. I couldn't imagine doing anything else,' she said. 'It's definitely not for all men and women as there are so many downsides to being away.' Ms Mooyman said she left the modelling industry because she needed a more stable profession. 'I started modelling at a young age but it was never serious enough for me to take it up further,' she said. 'When I was 18 years old I did a lot of promotional modelling night clubs, festivals and concerts in the Perth area. Ms Mooyman (pictured left and right) said she earned more working at the mines than she ever did locally . 'This involved photo shoots for particular venues to use for advertising purposes so I was plastered on posters for events also wearing certain outfits. 'But I was paying off loans and needed a change of job so a friend helped me out.' Now Shana has three investment properties and is hoping her successful stint at the mine will help her set-up a life with her partner. She said she was grateful for the opportunities given to her, but she realised it was not for everyone. Now Shana has three investment properties and is hoping her successful stint at the mine will help her set-up a life with her partner . 'In no time I'd developed skills to operate a large variety of machines such as excavators, loaders, dump trucks, water carts, tractors and forklifts - you name it, I've driven it,' she said. 'I've been contracted to work on a variety of sites including Gin Gin, Eneabba and local areas around Perth. 'These would be a few weeks at a time working solo to get a job complete so I was stuck at the mines for long periods at a time. 'It can be very isolating. Being stuck in a tiny bedroom isn't for everyone.

"A severe solar storm has smacked Earth with a surprisingly big geomagnetic jolt, potentially affecting power grids and GPS tracking while pushing the colorful northern lights farther south, federal forecasters said. So far no damage has been reported. Two blasts of magnetic plasma left the sun on Sunday, combined and arrived on Earth about 15 hours earlier and much stronger than expected, said Thomas Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. Scroll down for video . Where the Aurora could be seen: Forecasters said early Tuesday, before sunrise, auroras were already seen in the northern tier of the U.S., such as Washington state, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Aurora Borealis or northern lights that usually can be viewed only in the far north will dip south as a result of the storm, so more people should be able to enjoy the colorful sky show. Forecasters were not sure just how far south it would be visible. Forecasters said early Tuesday, before sunrise, auroras were already seen in the northern tier of the U.S., such as Washington state, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. They said there is 'very strong possibility' that the northern lights could be seen as far south as the middle United States, even Tennessee and Oklahoma . This storm ranks a 4, called severe, on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 1-to-5 scale for geomagnetic effects. It is the strongest solar storm to blast Earth since the fall of 2013. It's been nearly a decade since a level 5 storm, termed extreme, has hit Earth. Forecasters figured it would come late Tuesday night into Wednesday morning; instead, it arrived just before 10 a.m. EDT. They had forecast it to be a level 1. 'It's significantly stronger than expected,' Berger said. Forecasters had predicted a glancing blow instead of dead-on hit. Another theory is that the combination of the two storms made it worse, but it's too early to tell if that's so, he said. The storm seemed to be weakening slightly, but that may not continue, and it could last all day, officials said. It has the potential to disrupt power grids but only temporarily. It also could cause degradation of the global positioning system, so tracking maps and locators may not be as precise as normal. Often these types of storms come with bursts of radiation that can affect satellite operations, but this one has not, Berger said. But the most noticeable effect is usually considered a positive. The Aurora Borealis or northern lights that usually can be viewed only in the far north will dip south, so more people should be able to enjoy the colorful sky show.

Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. Forecasters said early Tuesday, before sunrise, auroras were already seen in the northern tier of the U.S., such as Washington state, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Space Weather branch chief Brent Gordon said if the storm effects continued through Tuesday evening, there was a 'very strong possibility' that the northern lights could be seen as far south as the middle United States, even Tennessee and Oklahoma. That also means much of Russia and northern Europe, as far south as central Germany and Poland, had the potential for the sky show. The sky has to be clear of clouds but the crescent moon will appear small enough it shouldn't interfere with viewing of the aurora is in the sky, Gordon said.

"The Swedish driver's licence examiner has come under fire after asking students if it is 'a mitigating circumstance' if a woman is drunk during sexual assault. Learner drivers undergoing a compulsory theory course on drink-driving have been invited to discuss several rape scenarios where alcohol is involved. The organisation behind the material has defended the use of questions involving rape, saying it is intended to inspire discussion about using alcohol 'as an excuse when you do something stupid'. Anger: Sweden's driver's licence examiner asked learner drivers to discuss if it is 'an aggravating or mitigating circumstance' if a woman is drunk during a sexual assault (stock image) The theory booklet is used across Sweden for compulsory risk-assessment courses as part of the drivers licence theory exam, which mostly undertaken by 16 to 18-year-olds. Learner drivers are asked to discuss several scenarios where alcohol and drugs are involved, including two about rape with no relation to traffic or driving. The book asks: 'An intoxicated woman is raped by a man. When he is punished, is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated?' It also described a similar rape-scenario where the male perpetrator is 'intoxicated' and whether that would be 'an aggravating or mitigating circumstance' in court. Linnea Risinger, 32, from Falun, Dalarna, spotted the questions during her course, and posted a picture of it on her Facebook. The two questions read: 'An intoxicated woman is raped by a man. When he is punished is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated?,' and similarly 'An intoxicated man rapes a woman' Unrelated question: The questions were asked during a compulsory course which all learner drivers in Sweden must undergo in order to get their licence (stock image) The picture caused heated reactions, with many asking what the rape scenarios had to do with getting a driver's licence. Ms Risinger said she had been surprised to see the questions, especially as there could be victims of sexual assault forced to take part in discussions about rape in a context where they could not be expected to be prepared for them. 'Rape has nothing to do with a driver's licence,' Ms Risinger, a spokesperson for the local Green Party, told Aftonbladet. 'It is not okay that you should be forced to discuss during a compulsory course to get your licence. 'It is highly likely that there are boys and girls who take part in this course who are victims. They are there to get a driver's licence, not go to therapy.' However, The Swedish National Organisation for Driving Schools (Sveriges trafikskolors riksförbund) defends the use of the rape scenarios, saying it shines a light on the fact that alcohol is often used as an excuse when 'doing something stupid'. 'We want a discussion about taking responsibility for your actions, and that is the reason the questions are in there,' a representative told newspaper ETC.","Swedish learner drivers asked about rape during compulsory course .

"An oil painting has been proven to be one of Claude Monet's - after scientists discovered the artist painted over his own signature. The 1891 painting, titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun', was largely unknown and its origin had never been verified. But a team of researchers from the University of Jyväskylä in Finland painstakingly  unearthed the signature. Scroll down for video . An 1891 oil painting - titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun' - has been proven to be one of Claude Monet's despite the artist painting over his own signature . The painting has been owned by the Gösta Serlachius Fine Arts Foundation, also in Finland, for more than 50 years. It is thought to be part of a wider series by Monet with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season. The painting was verified after a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work. This allowed researchers to see different layers  including a previous signature by  Monet. It is thought to be part of a wider series by Monet (above) with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season . Ilkka Pölönen, a researcher, said the camera scans one 'line' at a time. He told ArtDaily: 'When the camera is moved using the scanner an image of the whole picture can be obtained.' The Fine Arts Foundation said the artwork  is the first Monet painting to be held in a Finnish public collection. The other paintings from the series are held at various galleries including the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Scotland and the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a non-destructive technique, which can identify the presence of certain pigments. It was first used in the 1940s and applied to paintings in the 1950s. The technique involves bombarding the artwork with x-rays so powerful that they cause atoms in the picture’s layers to emit ‘florescent’ x-rays of their own. XRF can be used to identify the colours of hidden paintings or to see earlier versions of famous pieces. By mapping the x-rays of copper, for blue and green, iron, for yellow, orange and brown, and mercury, for red, scientists can see full-colour 'maps' of previous versions. In this case a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work. This allowed researchers to see different layers  including a previous signature - verifying that the painting was by Monet.","Oil-painting titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun' is from 1891 .

"It is one of those stressful moments, just before a holiday, when you realise you have packed so much you can't close your suitcase. And even if you manage to successfully perch on top and close the zip, who knows what state your summer wardrobe will emerge in when you arrive at your destination. Which is perhaps why there are such things as 'professional packers'. Ivica Tot-Genz, from Berlin's Hotel de Rome, is one such professional and is full of handy hints and tips to transport your worldly goods without the stress. Packing can seem like a chore, but there are ways to make it less painful and more efficient . In fact, he is so good at his job, he can pack up the perfect suitcase in 15 minutes flat. Mr Tot-Genz learned his skills as a parachute packer in the army and states that anyone can use his tricks at home. 'Trousers should be rolled up with tissue paper,' he said. 'If you are on holiday and have to take party clothes, a dress or suit, just use paper towels from the kitchen.' He stuffs the arms of suit jackets with tissue paper to avoid creases and uses cardboard to easily fold shirts and help them keep their shape. 'You can do these tricks at home, it's done in a certain order,' he said. Roll your items to make best use of the space in your suitcase. There will also be less creases in your clothes . 1. Use buttons to transport earrings . 2. To avoid creases, pack your clothes in plastic wrappings . 3. To avoid your shoe soles touching your clothes, place them in shower caps . 4. Stuff your shoes with socks, underwear or other small items to make the most of the space and to help them keep their shape . 5. To avoid shampoos leaking in your bag, unscrew the lid and place a small circle of cling film, or plastic wrap over the hole. Screw the lid back on to hold it in place, and eliminate all worries about bursting liquids . 6. Wrap breakables, such as perfume bottles, or a teacup if you are Miranda Kerr, in socks to protect them . 7. Keep freebie shampoos and cosmetics from hotels so you don't have to lug big bottles . 8. Alternatively store face cream and small lotions in contact lens containers to save space . 9. Wrap your belts round the outside of the suitcase, around your clothes to make use of the outside corner space . 10. Place a dryer sheet in your case, or in the shoe shower cap to prevent odours transferring to your clothes . 11. Apply a bull clip to razors that have lost their safety lid to prevent tearing of clothes . The roll vs the layer . Heathrow Airport has produced a video with tips on how to pack, advocating the layer method. This works on larger items such as dresses and trousers being laid flat on top of the case. The packer continues to layer clothes up with the lengths poking out either side of the suitcase, until all clothes are stacked. You then individually fold the clothes back in on themselves for minimal creases. Professional packer Ivica Tot-Genz uses plastic tissue between layers to prevent creasing. If you do not have any to hand, paper towel works just as well . Elika Gibbs, of of wardrobe organisers Practical Princess, is also an advocate of layering. In previous advice to the MailOnline, she advised: 'Make sure everything is clean and pressed before you begin packing. Pack things flat to stop them creasing during the journey. Jackets are the most awkward: either wear one, pack it at the bottom or, if it's a business trip, use a suit carrier. 'The next layer is your cocktail dresses then your tops and bottoms. Turn delicates and things whose colours might run, such as suede, inside out. 'Separate your clothes from items that might damage them, such as sequins, by using tissue paper. 'Use your underwear to fill in the gaps and put your shoes on the top, in either shoe bags or plastic bags.' The roll method is favoured by many, with creases minimised and space maximised. Fans of this packing technique advise placing your shoes and heavy objects in the bag first. You then need to fill in all the space around them with your rolled up items, and fit your small accessories in the gap between clothes. If using a smaller bag for things like swimming costumes or underwear, roll the bag as well once you are ready to pack it. While packing a suitcase the correct way is all-important for squeezing all those essentials in, hand luggage is just as important. Globetrotting models and celebrities love nothing more than posting pictures of their jetset lifestyles and what better to pick up a few travel tips than by checking out their Instagram posts? While Rosie Huntington-Whiteley loved comfortable leggings and a cosy cashmere sweater, model Karlie Kloss swears by good reading materials for the flight and a pair of rose-gold Frends headphones. Model Karlie Kloss shared a snap on Instagram showing exactly what she carries in her hand luggage . Taylor Swift's best friend shared a snap of her must-haves while passing through security. Among them were the latest issue of The Economist, Vanity Fair and The Wall Street Journal (clearly the model is well-read), as well as stylish Nike trainers and two smartphones: an iPhone and a Blackberry. She also showed off a chic monogrammed passport wallet from Louis Vuitton and a sleek Canon digital camera.","Professional packer Ivica Tot-Genz advises paper towel can be used to avoid creases if you have no access to tissue paper or plastic wrapping .

"Could you work with your mother every day? One Exeter University student did just that - ditching a degree in German and Philosophy to come and work in his mum's cafe. Rowan Joyce, 52, runs the South Street Coffee and Ice Cream Shop in Isleworth, Middlesex, with her son Tom. Tom, 24, started working at the business while on a summer holiday from Exeter University and enjoyed the role so much that he packed in his course and became joint manager of the store, taking control of the ice cream-making side of the business. Rowan Joyce (left) displays some of her home baked cakes, while Tom shows off his ice cream (right) Rowan tells FEMAIL in her own words why she thinks her son made the right decision and explains how they haven't looked back since... She says: Every middle class Mum wants her child to go to university and when Tom got a place to read German and Philosophy at Exeter I was thrilled. 'I've got two degrees myself and though they haven't done me a bit of good in the workplace I had fun getting them and the one I got from the OU while I was at home bringing up the kids kept me sane and my brain ticking over when I was immersed in child rearing. 'My jobs have always been low pay and hands on practical, mostly retail management and estate agency. Tom and Rowan . 'I figured with Tom if the worst came to the worst the language would always come in useful and he could get a job as an air steward! (Yes, I had a brief spell as an air hostess myself) 'We opened South Street on an absolute shoe string and as Tom was home for Easter from Exeter I employed him to help scrub floors, scrape walls, paint, paper and clean. 'It was hard, boring, work and Tom was not the best employee, he tended to get bored easily or give up if things got difficult. 'I was paying him a wage so technically he should have done as he was told but if it's your kid it's not always as easy as all that: you have to maintain the relationship no matter what and you can't sack them! 'A year on and the business was going well, having worked in retail management I was used to handling staff but I was surprised to find that staffing was turning into my biggest headache. 'Maybe I'm naive and too willing to trust but I found myself being ripped off, cheated and lied to. 'I was paying above minimum wage, providing paid sickness and holidays, treating my staff with consideration and respect. 'But I was discovering that they were opening late and closing early when I wasn't there, claiming for hours they hadn't worked, taking days off sick when they were perfectly well and sitting around on their phones or the work laptop when I was paying them to work. 'By August of that summer it was time to bite the bullet and sack my only full time member of staff. 'He was claiming to be ill, I was paying him sickness benefit and working seven days a week to provide cover and I discovered he wasn't actually ill at all, he just didn't fancy coming into work. 'The afternoon I finally got up the courage to sack him I was upset and worried, another staffing disaster, who could I turn to now? Who could I trust to love and understand my business as I did? Tom is very creative with his ice cream flavours . 'South street demands a very personal touch, it's all about word of mouth, friendships, trust and kindness. 'I always tell my staff the only thing you can do wrong here (apart from stealing of course!) is be rude to a customer. 'There is very little footfall here and we rely on repeat business and word of mouth. 'It's hands-on hard work, you have to be smiley and polite all the time and we provide a lot of bereavement counselling and childcare advice. 'We find people jobs and nannies, locate lost pets and impart cooking tips and marriage guidance. 'Tom and I were doing American night that night: every so often we pick a food theme and sell 20 tickets to an evening meal. This one involved bbq and homemeade baked beans, cornbread and 'slaw. Rowan behind the counter at the shop . 'We were in the backyard lighting the bbq when he told me that I didn't need to worry too much about finding another full timer: he was planning on giving up Uni and working for me full time. 'Actually I was delighted, relieved and delighted, then I felt guilty. Surely I should be putting his education before my business? 'I knew his father (we're divorced) would be furious. 'I knew he wasn't happy at Exeter, the course wasn't really what he'd hoped, he was a bit older than his classmates (he'd done a gap year in Germany) and the next year would bring another year in Germany which he really didn't want to do. 'He was ready to settle down into a proper job in one place and put down some roots. He also wanted to be part of building the business. 'I'm very keen to get my other two children into the business but they are resisting for some reason! 'It's funny to think now but Tom has always been a home bird. Tom selling his ice cream on a summer afternoon . 'He absolutely hated leaving me to go to nursery and although he got on well at school and had a lovely girlfriend for years he was never one for going out and socialising much, he just always liked being at home. 'I guess South Street is an extension of that, it is very cosy and homely! 'Tom took over the ice cream making which was a massive relief for me as it is very sticky, hard work and labour intensive. 'He soon displayed a real genius for it. its quite technical as you have to get the right balance of fat and sugar and its something that demands a lot of expertise and know how. 'If you come up with a flavour he will know how to turn it into ice cream! 'I'm quite good at coming up with flavours, I'm a cook and I know food and what works with what, and I listen to my customers and what they'd like to try. Tom is brilliant at translating those ideas into ice cream. 'I know I can trust him 100 per cent -  he has bought shares in the business and although I am technically the boss (I am his mum!) we have equal shares. South Street Coffee and Ice Cream Shop in Isleworth, Middlesex . 'He is as passionate about making South Street work as I am, he loves our customers and our product as much as I do, we are family! 'I know our customers really identify with us as a family business, they love the way we interact - although I was once accused of having an incestuous relationship with him! 'It does have its down side! If I get angry with him I get FURIOUS, and he is the same, we are both pretty volatile and he always knows how to drive me nuts. 'I have to be really careful about respecting boundaries also, allowing him to have proper time off and not ask him to do more than a regular employee. 'I'm also aware that sometimes I make excuses for him, cut him too much slack and let him get away with things I shouldn't. 'He is always going to be my baby boy: even though he's over six foot with a big beard!' We both like looking after people, I think that's why we work so well together. I still get a rush when I enter the front of house and every seat is taken, each table filled with people happy to be eating delicious, home-made food and fresh gelato. We both take a great joy in providing a service that is becoming rarer to find nowadays: a friendly, independent place to be; not only existing within the local community but comprising a major part of it. The fact that Mum loves to cook makes us a good team. It means that she can stay in the kitchen, cook three cakes and a quiche and knock out lunches at> the same time (seriously, she is that quick and organised,) and I can look after the front of house, making coffee and serving ice cream and cake. We're an efficient machine because we know where each other's strengths lie. Of course, that also means I get tetchy when I see her making coffee: I'm a perfectionist with more experience behind the machine, but you try telling your mum she's not making that latte the correct way. Why would I give up a university degree to work with my mum? Let's be honest, what's the job market like for graduates nowadays? Not great. I was halfway through a four year degree and I knew that the situation wasn't likely to improve. This was a chance to become part of something huge, and the company needed me. I had gradually usurped the role of ice cream maker from mum (to be honest, I think she was secretly glad) and had got to the point where I could tell the temperature of the gelato in the machine by sound alone. I believed in the product 100 per cent and still do: no one else is doing innovative, artisan gelato the way we do it, and our business growth speaks for itself: We now have a dedicated factory, as well as an art gallery/gift shop. I love working with my hands, directly contributing to the success of our own endeavour. And even though I know I'm an equal shareholder, I still get surprised when mum asks me what I think we should do in a certain situation. It's really cool owning an ice cream company.","Rowan Joyce, 52, runs South Street Coffee Shop in Isleworth, Middlesex .

"The mother of a young woman killed in a car crash caused by boy racers went to confront the driver in jail to hear him apologise in person. Kate Morgan said she felt 'numb' when she came face-to-face with Ian Edwards, who was responsible for the death of her 22-year-old daughter Lona Wyn Jones. But the prison meeting allowed her to recover from the trauma of losing her daughter, and to have a good night's sleep for the first time in two years. Confrontation: Kate Morgan, left, had a meeting in prison with killer driver Ian Edwards, right, after her daughter Lona died in a high-speed crash . Affection: Ms Morgan pictured with Lona, who was killed in May 2012 while being driven in North Wales . Lona was killed in a crash in North Wales in May 2012, when a car she was travelling in span out of control during an 80mph race with another vehicle. Edwards, 25, was jailed for three years and nine months after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving, but Ms Morgan, 45, was haunted by the crash afterwards. 'After Lona's death I felt like I was living in a bubble,' she said. 'I was completely numb for a long time. I did want Ian to get some punishment, but it wasn't particularly important to me whether he was jailed. Five minutes or 1,000 years in jail wasn't going to bring Lona back. 'Months later, when life without Lona wasn't getting any easier, I realised that I had questions only Ian could answer. When the family liaison officers were with me one day, I suddenly asked out of the blue if I could go and meet him in prison.' After Edwards agreed to the hour-long meeting, Ms Morgan travelled with a friend to Risley prison in Warrington, Cheshire to meet the driver, who was accompanied by his father. Family: Ms Morgan with Lona and her younger daughter Ella, who is now 12 years old . Sisters: Lona and Ella pictured together on holiday in Spain in 2009, three years before Lona's death . 'I was apprehensive on the morning of the visit, but it was something I needed to do,' she said. 'I wanted the crash explained to me, to know whether it had happened the way I'd been told. And I wanted to look him in the face and see how it had affected him. 'I went to see Ian because I needed answers. I had to know exactly how Lona had been killed, before I could even try to move on. When I first saw him I felt numb. I can remember looking at him and thinking, you b******. 'In that situation you're only allowed to ask three questions, but I only wanted to ask the one. He could tell that was the real reason I was there, so he talked me through the crash. He admitted he and another driver had been speeding, racing each other. 'The other car had pulled back into his lane, he said, which had made him swerve and mount the grass verge. I could see how sorry he was and he apologised repeatedly. 'I told him I accepted his apology but I didn't forgive him and hoped to never see him again. That night, I slept properly for the first time in two years. 'Afterwards, I felt instantly more at ease because I no longer had the ""not knowing"" feeling. I finally had closure - there were no more secrets.' Portrait: The family posing for a photograph when Lona was 13 and Ella was 11 months old . Tragic: Lona pictured aged 11, left, and 14, right; she had recently moved to her own house before she died . Lona, a carer from Dolgellau, had started renting her own house near her mother and 12-year-old sister Ella shortly before the fatal crash. Edwards was said by eyewitnesses to have been 'driving like a lunatic' in his Ford Fiesta as Lona sat in the back seat, before he lost control and flipped the car over. Lona died at the scene from head injuries. Ms Morgan said: 'Lona had come to see me in the afternoon. She was still all excited about her cottage - she'd just got a new fridge freezer and had stocked it up, so I joked that she'd have to invite me and Ella round for tea at the weekend. 'She was going to her dad's that evening. He lived about 20 miles away so her best friend Fay and another friend Ian, who I'd not met before, were going to give her a lift. 'They arrived at about 5.30. Ian had a silver Ford Fiesta and I waved them off, giving Lona a big hug before she went. She'd always been so independent and mature, we felt like friends rather than mum and daughter. 'Two hours later, a neighbour knocked at the door to tell me there'd been a crash and Lona was involved. I left Ella with another neighbour and rushed out in the car. The drive passed in a blur. I hit a long queue of traffic so I got out of the car and just started running. 'When I got to the crash scene there was a car on its side, covered in a tarpaulin. A police officer I recognised came over. I asked her if it was Lona under there and she just nodded. I was shocked.' As well as his jail sentence, Edwards was banned from driving for four years after he appeared at Caernarfon Crown Court in August 2013. Ms Morgan said: 'In lots of ways I have been able to try and move on, but there is a massive hole in my life. My best friend is gone. Birthdays and Christmases are never the same. 'Ella has since started high school and she was sad that her sister wouldn't be able to see her in her big school uniform. Every day we can feel it - it is a life sentence.'","Lona Wyn Jones, 22, died while travelling in car driven by Ian Edwards .

"Just when we thought the Darwin awards could take no more nominees, meet the people posing with the largest and most dangerous reptile in the world, all for a selfie. Photos and video have appeared on social media of two young women smiling, posing and snapping photos with large crocodiles at Darwin's Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve. In the video, a woman can be seen to be unfazed by the beast and takes nonchalant snaps mere metres from it's jaws. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Flirting with danger, the woman places a vodka bottle in front of the large croc and snaps a photo . A selfie posted on Instagram shows a young women a mere metre from a crocodile at Fogg Dam in Darwin . At one point the woman even places a Crystal Head Vodka bottle just centimetres from the distressed crocodile before he lunges into the air, to which she just laughs. In another case, on Instagram, a woman poses with another large crocodile for a selfie, captioning the image by stating she did not want to get much closer, even though she was just over a metre from its claws. The Northern Territory is littered with signs to warn people of the dangers of crocodiles . The Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory have issued a direct warning to those wanting to snap a selfie with a crocodile. They have warned the public to be 'crocwise' and keep a safe distance of at least 15 metres. The Northern Territory is notorious for its freshwater and saltwater crocodile population, with certain areas averaging 15 crocodiles per kilometre. Salt water crocodiles can grow to five metres in length, weigh 450 kilograms and last year killed more people than any other year with the 'freshies' remaining more timid and fearful. However, this does not rule out the possibility of an attack by a freshwater crocodile, especially with passerby's getting too close for comfort. Just last January, a 12-year-old boy was taken by a crocodile while swimming with friends in a river in Kakadu. As more and more people arrive to take photos, the distressed crocodile wanders back down the bank . And in June a 62-year-old man was taken, also in Kakadu, whilst he was fishing in his boat when a five-metre salt water crocodile launched itself into the boat, grabbing him and dragging him under the water while his distressed family watched from the river bank. Even though the state is riddled with recognisable crocodile warning signs, tourists and locals seem to be downplaying the dangers for that next level selfie.","Selfies have appeared online with young girls posing with huge crocodiles .

"They are the brands that Britain grew up with but 53 of the top 100 are losing sales – many despite slashing prices. Famous names like Silver Spoon sugar, Cadbury, Whiskas, Heinz and Kingsmill are suffering sales falls of more than 10per cent as shoppers switch to budget chains. The nation’s fastest growing stores, Aldi and Lidl, effectively ban many of the top brands from their shelves. Scroll down for video . Famous names like Heinz (pictured left), Kingsmill and Whiskas are suffering sales falls. Silver Spoon is by far the biggest casualty of the backlash against sugar and its links to obesity . At the same time, the big four stores – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have cut the shelf space given to brands, while pushing their own label alternatives. Changes in eating habits, concerns about sugar consumption and a decision to cut back on carbs, particularly bread are also playing a part. The supermarkets have also been very clever at launching copycat products which ape the household names but have a lower price. The figures were compiled by retail analysts Nielsen and The Grocer magazine which said the proportion of the 100 brands that are losing sales rose from 26 in 2013 to 34 in 2014 and it is now 53. As a result, the total annual sales of the top 100 is down by some £146.4m to £20.5billion. Kingsmill has fallen victim to declining volume sales in the sliced bread market and a bread price war . Tesco has decided to take the Kingsmill loaves off its shelves, while pushing its own label alternatives . Silver Spoon, the British granulated sugar brand is by far the biggest casualty of the backlash against sugar and its links to obesity. The Grocer said: ‘A year ago, it was Britain’s 68th biggest grocery brand, but it has fallen out of the rankings with a staggering loss of £62.6m in sales – 47.1per cent – thanks partly to the sugar debate.’ It added: ‘The opprobrium surrounding the sugar levels in many grocery products has hit some players hard.’ The Cadbury brand – apart from Dairy Milk – has also suffered with sales down by 15.2per cent - £34.8m – in a year. The giant has come under fire since a take-over by American food giant Kraft with concerns the new owners have failed to honour its British heritage. It reneged on a promise to keep open a British factory, while consumers have complained about products being shrunk or changes to the chocolate used in products, such as the coating to its famous crème egg. In the same category, Mars is down by 10.5per cent, while Kitkat has fallen some 7.6per cent. Just last week, the Mail revealed how its Kitkat chunky is less chunky after being cut from 48g to 40g without a corresponding fall in the price. The Cadbury brand, apart from Dairy Milk (pictured), has also suffered with sales down by £34.8m in a year . The manufacturer, Nestle, claimed this was partly because of rising costs and partly because of a desire to help customers lose weight, which did not go down well. Innocent smoothies have been caught up in the backlash against sugary drinks with sales down 10.8per cent in a year. The Grocer said: ‘In the anti-sugar witch hunt Innocent is guilty as charged, say health lobbyists. And their increasingly alarmist proclamations have hit sales hard.’ Kingsmill has suffered badly from the nation’s efforts to cut back on carbs, particularly white sliced bread, with sales down by 11.6per cent. The Grocer said: ‘Kingsmill has fallen victim to a double whammy of declining volume sales in the sliced bread market and a bread price war that has driven a 5.6per cent decline in the average price.’ Such is the decline that Tesco has decided to take the brand’s loaves off its shelves. Other big bread brands have also in decline, including Warburtons, which is down 4.1per cent, and Hovis by 4.8per cent. Heinz has been part of kitchen life for more than 100 years, however the study found both its soups and baked beans are less popular. Sales of Heinz soups are down by 10.2per cent in a year, hit hard by the fact Britain enjoyed a relatively mild winter, while the number of cans of beans going through tills fell 3.5per cent. The nation’s fastest growing stores, Aldi and Lidl, effectively ban many of the top brands from their shelves . There are suggestions that shoppers may be looking for something a bit more upmarket and exotic. As a result, Heinz has responded by launching Fajita pinto and Tuscan cannellini to its ‘Five Beanz’ range. Other famous names to lose more than 10per cent in sales in just one year include WeightWatchers, which is down 21.6per cent, Tetley tea, Tate & Lyle, Flora, Whiskas cat food, Special K, Rowntrees, Princes and Activia. The Grocer said: ‘Britain’s biggest grocery brands are playing a dangerous game. With the discounters advancing and prices being cut across the board, many are starting to look like pawns in the battle between grocery’s grandmasters. ‘Deflation reigns. The average price of 42 of the 100 biggest brands has fallen in the past year.’ Some brands, such as Coca-Cola, are trying to woo Aldi and Lidl in order to cash in on their growth. Others are targeting the pound stores by launching products that are shrunk or changed to meet the £1 price point.","More than half of top 100 brands that Britain grew up with are losing sales .

"The stepmother of a young boy who died lied about his whereabouts to police. Analize Osceola of Hollywood, Florida, called police on Thursday to say that Ahizya Osceola, 3, was missing.

Child Protective Services documents obtained by NBC 6 state that Analize woke up at around 4am last Thursday and, according to her claims, she heard the young boy moaning. She then went over and found he was very cold, but still warm, so she gave him CPR. With his pulse weak, she then claims she went to get him some Pedialyte, then decided it was best to try and make him vomit. The boy, she claims, died soon after, and she waited until the other adults were out of the house and then stuffed the boy's dead body in a trash bag and hid it in the laundry room. Throughout this all, Analize's mother had been in the house, who is a nurse. She never told her mother anything about what happened or asked her to help when the boy was in distress. Police, suspicious of the woman, went to the house and found the body. Soon after she changed her story with police she checked herself into a mental hospital.

"A mother has given up work to  gain an international following for her making videos of the addictive block-building game Minecraft. Staci Northfield, 27, from Cambridge, says she earns more from narrating her digital adventures on the hugely popular game than she did as a full-time supermarket cashier. As her online alter ego, Salem's Lady, she has amassed 111,000 subscribers on YouTube and even meets her eager fans at special conventions. 'It's like a double life' - Staci has found it strange to consolidate both her real life as a parent and also her life and work as a gamer in Minecraft . The mother-of-two uses Twitter to keep in contact with her 34,000 followers and - while she won't reveal her new earnings - says she makes almost as much as her partner Jonathan Brown, 33, who is a full-time chef at a university in Cambridge. She said: 'I got started when one of my friends told me it was a really great game to play. It looked really boring but she showed me a guy doing videos and he made it a bit more interesting. 'I started off building a house, which turned into a castle, then a castle with a railway, and from then on it was; ""I love this game, it's endless"". You can build anything. 'I never thought it would be possible playing games for a living, and now there are children who want me to sign things for them.' Even Staci is surprised by her own success, saying: 'I hate the sound of my own voice, and I thought they were going to hate it, but a lot of the audience are in America, and they seem to love the British accent. 'I love this game, it's endless' - Former supermarket cashier, Staci, has an online alter-ego called Salem's Lady, which she takes on adventures in the block-building video game . 'There have been a few people around from the start and I always try to make a little more effort for them but sometimes it's hard because you can't speak to everybody.' Staci gave up her Sainsbury's job to look after her two daughters Holly, six, and Rachel, eight, but struggled for money two years ago and decided to go back to work. But while she was looking for jobs online she became hooked on the addictive block-building game so much she began making the videos. Despite YouTubing as a hobby she soon realised she could make some serious cash and gave up the job hunt altogether. Staci spends two or three hours in the morning making the videos before she edits them in the afternoon and helps other players with any queries. She spent last weekend at a gaming convention in London and has had to get used to meeting her excited fans in the flesh. Staci added: 'My youngest daughter just doesn't understand it, she just likes being in the videos. 'But my eldest loves it, her friends are fans and when she goes to school they all know who I am. 'It's been steadily growing over the past two years and then it's really snowballed recently, I can't believe it. 'I earn enough to get by so I don't have to go to work and can pay my bills, and if I am needing to go to school I can do that. 'I am always available if someone needs me, it's a real perk. 'It's really, really strange, I have to switch off from the gaming world and be a parent again, but I can go to my children's school and none of the parents know who I am. 'It's like a double life.'

"A post-mortem examination found shop worker Miss Pollock, 41, died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck . A 52-year-old builder has been charged with murder following the discovery of a woman's body at a flat. Officers found the body of Sarah Pollock, 41, in her flat in the Springbourne area of Bournemouth, Dorset, at 3.26pm on March 25. Her colleagues raised the alarm when she failed to open the shop she was working for at the Dolphin Centre in Poole. A post-mortem examination found Miss Pollock died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck. Builder Colin Dymond, 52, from Bournemouth, who was known to Miss Pollock, was today charged with her murder. He will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court tomorrow. Detective Inspector Mark Samuel, of Dorset Police, said: 'Family liaison officers have updated Sarah's family with this development and the thoughts of the investigation team are with her loved ones. 'Clearly this is a very difficult time for the whole family and they have requested privacy. 'I would also like to thank local people who have been patient and assisted police, particularly some of the residents of Avon Close who have been temporarily relocated. 'Their understanding and co-operation has helped us conduct a thorough investigation into this tragic matter as swiftly as possible.' At 3.26pm on Wednesday, March 25, Dorset police found the body of the 41-year-old in her flat in Avon Close in the Springbourne area after concerns were raised that she had not arrived at work as expected . Miss Pollock's body was formally identified by family members, who are being supported by police family liaison officers. Mr Samuel appealed for the public's help to trace the movements of a Peugeot 308 estate hire care with the registration HN14 HWC. 'Although we have charged a man with murder we still want to hear from members of the public if they have any information that could help with the investigation into Sarah's death,' he said. 'We have now recovered the Peugeot hire car from the London area and I am interested if anyone saw it being driven or parked in Dorset or Hampshire between 4pm on Tuesday 24 March and 10pm on Wednesday 25 March 2015. If so, please call Dorset Police urgently. 'We are still building a picture of exactly what happened to Sarah. If anyone saw or heard anything suspicious in the Avon Close area of Bournemouth or has any other information that could be useful, I would urge them to please get in touch.' In a statement, Miss Pollock's family said: 'We have lost an important part of our lives; a kind, caring, honest, outgoing and ultimately indescribable daughter, sister and auntie from our close-knit family. 'She was unforgettable and she will always remain in our hearts and minds, although she should not be gone. 'We respectfully ask that we are left to grieve without intrusion and want to thank Dorset Police for their hard work so far in helping our distraught family.'

"He may be king of the jungle but these hilarious photographs show he would be lion if he said he was in charge of this relationship. The astonishing pictures show humans are not the only couples capable of having lover's tiffs with this lion pair having a particularly vicious-looking argument. The lion was busy trying to show off his alpha male credentials by baring his teeth in an attempt to attract the female but she appeared to take offence, lashing out with her sharp claws and swiping at his face. Lunge: This is the moment lioness shows just how annoyed she is with her other half, who sits there without reacting to her bite . What did I say? The lioness launches towards the astonished male who just stands there and braves the ferocious attack . Fearsome: The situation seems to escalate when she takes a swipe at him while continuing to growl and show her teeth to the poor male .

Keen snapper Massimo Mei, 53, captured the human-like moment on a trip to the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya last month. Mr Mei, from Rome, Italy, said: 'I was surprised at the scene and their behaviour. It really looked like human expressions - although maybe towards the end of a relationship not at the beginning. 'The expressions of the male were funny and I struggled not to laugh while I took pictures. It was a shock when the female turned and attacked him I wasn't expecting this.' Not impressed: The grumpy lioness swishes her tail and shows her sharp teeth to the large male who looks bemused at why she is so upset . Not so toothless: He finally snaps back by growling and showing a glimpse of his gnashers during the lovers tiff captured by a photographer . Fortunately the pair appeared to make up shortly afterwards after spending some time cooling off from their antics in the Africa sun. 'He was trying to show his teeth and convince the female he is a good powerful male, an alpha male,' said Mr Mei. 'But she tested him almost like she was annoyed.' Stalking: The fight seemed to start after the lion was seen following the female, causing her to react and fend off his advances . Nervous: He looks unsure of his next move as she lies low in the grass ready to pounce if he comes too close at the nature reserve in Kenya . Lovers and haters: His persistence seems to pay off as the couple are pictured lying together looking far happier just moments later . Far more relaxed: The lioness looks sleepy as she uses her paw to rub her eye now shortly after swiping it at the male lion . Who me? The duo look like they are talking over their differences with the male getting more of a say now things have cooled down .","Big cats show their human side as they embark on row that shows female is anything but a pussy cat .

"The soaring Sydney property market will achieve growth of 20 per cent over two years to send the median house price above $1 million, new research suggests. Prices are also set to take off in Brisbane, but growth will be much more subdued in Melbourne and Adelaide, and prices will fall in Perth, according to forecasts from BIS Shrapnel. The economic analysts say there are housing shortages in Sydney and southeast Queensland, and while housing construction activity has lifted, there is limited scope for a long run of growth in construction. Sydney house prices have grown by almost 14 per cent in the year to February, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, and BIS Shrapnel expects annual growth of 13 per cent for the 2014/15 financial year. Scroll down for video . The soaring Sydney property market will achieve growth of 20 per cent over two years. Pictured is a house for sale in Paddington . This three-bedroom, two-bathroom property at 106 Boundary Street in Paddington, in the city's inner-east, will go to auction in April . A further seven per cent rise is forecast for 2015/16, which would take the median price to $980,000 and could see it rise above $1 million by 2017. BIS Shrapnel senior manager of residential property Angie Zigomanis said the prices would rise due to interest rate cuts and undersupply. 'There's strong investor demand in Sydney, and in our view we still think there's an undersupply of dwellings,' Mr Zigomanis told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's also probably just an element of FOMO [fear of missing out] there. 'Buyers are worried the market will run ahead of them and they won't be able to get what they want in the area they want.' Brisbane prices are expected to post 14 per cent growth over two years, taking the median price to $540,000 . This property is for sale at at 82 Brimblecombe Circuit in Pullenvale, to the west of Brisbane's central business district . The house  has four bedrooms, two bathrooms, two parking spaces, a large casual living area and a swimming pool . SYDNEY . Up 20 per cent to $980,000 . BRISBANE . Up 14 per cent to $540,000 . MELBOURNE . Up five per cent to $685,000 . ADELAIDE . Up three per cent to $435,000 . PERTH . Down three per cent to $530,000 . * figures for June 2014 - June 2016, BIS Shrapnel Economic Outlook Report . Brisbane prices are expected to post 14 per cent growth over two years - six per cent growth in the current financial year and eight per cent growth in 2015/16 - which would take the median price to $540,000. Mr Zigomanis said the populations of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth were being affected by fewer arrivals and more departures. But he said this change would not hit Brisbane house prices, as construction has been weak and has fallen behind population growth. BIS Shrapnel is tipping Melbourne to post a slow price growth of three per cent in 2014/15, and just two per cent in the following 12 months, which would see the median house price at $685,000 in June 2016. 'It comes down to demand and supply - Melbourne has had extended periods of strong [housing] supply,' Mr Zigomanis said. '[The market] is imbalanced, and slowly tipping to oversupply. And there are still a lot of new construction projects so supply will remain high.' Mr Zigomanis said declines in mining investment would contribute to falls in Perth house prices, with BIS Shrapnel forecasting a one per cent drop this year and a two per cent fall in 2015/16 to see the media house price hit $530,000. 'Perth's had a very strong surge in building, but vacancy rates are rising as people [in the mining industry] leave to go back overseas or back to their home states.' Adelaide's market is also set to slow, with growth of one per cent in the current financial year and two per cent in 2015/16. Median house prices are predicted to get to $435,000 in June 2016. Melbourne is tipped to post a slow price growth of three per cent in 2014/15, and just two per cent in the following 12 months . This house is for sale at 51 Stokes Street in Port Melbourne, a bayside suburb south-west of Melbourne's central business district . The house has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, parking, high ceilings with rafters and timber flooring . BIS Shrapnel said falling interest rates were unlikely to affect house prices as much as housing construction activity. 'For many prospective borrowers the decision on whether to enter the property market or not has already been made and an additional 0.25 per cent off their mortgage will not be enough to change their behaviour,' it said. 'It will probably encourage some purchasers around the fringes, providing a mild boost to the market. 'Activity has already found a momentum of its own which is set to continue for another two years.' Declines in mining investment will contribute to falls in Perth prices, with BIS Shrapnel forecasting a three per cent drop by June 2016 . This house is for sale at 15 Hamilton Street in Bayswater, a north-eastern suburb of Perth .","Property market in Sydney and Brisbane set to take off, but Melbourne will post slow  growth and Perth will fall .

"Hollywood actor Martin Freeman is today unveiled by Labour as the first big celebrity endorsement of the election campaign. The star of the Hobbit, Sherlock and The Office is to appear in a party political broadcast in which he contrasts the 'choice' between Labour and the Tories. But in a surprise move, the video lasting almost three minutes has no mention of Labour's leader Ed Miliband. Scroll down for video . Martin Freeman, the star of the Hobbit, Sherlock and The Office, is to appear in a party political broadcast in which he contrasts the 'choice' between Labour and the Tories . Freeman appears against a white backdrop talking directly to the camera about the choice the country faces on May 7 . Recruiting Freeman to the Labour cause is a coup for the party which has in recent years relied on comedian Eddie Izzard and actor Richard Wilson to bring some celebrity stardust. In the video, due to be aired on television tomorrow night, he appears against a white backdrop talking directly to the camera about the choice the country faces on May 7. 'Now we are in the run-up to a General Election and over that time you're going to hear loads of claims from people on the Left, on the Right, all over the place. I . 'It's going to drive you mad. It'll probably drive me mad but don't switch off yet,' he says. The 44-year-old says the election will focus on a 'choice about what kind of country we want to live in'. He adds: 'I don't know about you, but my values are about community, compassion, decency; that's how I was brought up.' He claims the Tories will take the country on a 'rollercoaster of cuts' while Labour will 'make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few, like me, but it's not just about that'. The 44-year-old says the election will focus on a 'choice about what kind of country we want to live in' Labour leader Ed Miliband is not mentioned in the broadcast, as polls suggest the Labour party is more popular than its leader . Not every celebrity has been supportive of Ed Miliband's Labour party, not least his plans to impose a levy on homes worth £2million. Singer Myleene Klass on Labour's mansion tax: 'When you do look at the people who are going to be suffering this tax, it's true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time.' Actor Maureen Lipman: 'The Chuka Harman Burnham Hunt Balls brigade? I can't, in all seriousness, go into a booth and put my mark on any one of them. For the first time in five decades, I shall not be voting Labour.' Presenters Ant and Dec on Labour and Miliband: Ant McPartlin: I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.' Declan Donnelly: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Miliband] as prime minister.' Singer Cheryl Fernandez-Versini: Said the mansion tax would 'f*** me over', adding: 'I've always been Labour all my life but I want to hear what they've got to say for myself.' Presenter Bill Oddie: 'I hereby confess that I am one of the Mansion owning North London set that are apparently staunch Labour. Not this time. I shall vote GREEN.' The actor claims the Tories 'don't believe in the NHS' and 'have got sod all to offer the young'. 'But, real though all that stuff is and important though it is if you're young in this country, or broke in this country, or if you're unwell in this country - and let's face it we all need the NHS at some point - or if you are just plain working hard and finding life tough, there is a choice of two parts. 'The bottom line is what values are we choosing, because in the end this choice we make really does matter.' Freeman claims Labour 'start from the right place - community, compassion, fairness - I think all the best things about this country'. 'I love this country so much and I love the people in it, and I think you do too, but really, for me, there's only one choice; and I choose Labour.' But Mr Miliband does not get a mention, perhaps an acknowledgement of polling which shows Labour is more popular than its leader. Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Labour is trying to whitewash Ed Miliband from their campaign - his MPs don't want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast doesn't even mention him. 'He's a weak leader who doesn't have the confidence of his party. Just imagine the chaos he would cause for Britain.' A new ComRes poll for the Daily Mail shows 1 in 5 Labour voters think David Cameron would make a better Prime Minister than Mr Miliband. Overall, 41 per cent of people would prefer a Labour-led government compared to 42 per cent who would like a Conservative-led administration. The survey puts the Tories four points ahead of Labour on 36 per cent to 32 per cent, with Ukip on 12 per cent and Lib Dems 9 per cent. Politics is often called showbusiness for ugly people, but celebrities have often been used to bring glitz to party election campaigns. Broadchurch star and former Doctor Who David Tennant provided the voiceover for one of Labour's election broadcasts in 2010 and was pictured with Sarah Brown, wife of then prime minister Gordon Brown.

Take That singer and former X-Factor judge Gary Barlow appeared with David Cameron at the last election to back the idea of a UK-wide school talent contest. The Lib Dems received backing from Hollywood actors Colin Firth and Daniel Radcliffe. The Harry Potter star told US Vogue he would pick Nick Clegg's party 'without a shadow of a doubt'. It is not always clear if celebrity endorsements help parties. Monty Python star John Cleese filmed a three-minute monologue for the Liberal Democrats in 1992, but the party's share of the vote fell by five per cent. After Labour's landslide victory in 1997, Tony Blair invited dozens of celebrities to Downing Street for a 'Cool Britannia' party. Actors Daniel Radcliffe and Colin Firth backed the Lib Dems in 2010, but have rowed back on the idea since the party entered coalition . But guests including Noel Gallagher of Oasis later said they regretted going. He said: 'A lot of us got carried away with the New Labour thing, me included. 'When Tony Blair was courting the music business idiots like me thought we could have a say, but it became a publicity stunt on his behalf.' Sir Sean Connery has been a long-time supporter of the SNP. He described former first minister Alex Salmond as 'the best leader Scotland has ever had'. Ukip's celebrity backers have included astronomer Sir Patrick Moore, who filmed a promotional video for the party.","EXCLUSIVE: Hollywood star is first big celebrity endorsement of election .

"A group of pranksters managed to trick more than a dozen art lovers into thinking that a cheap print from IKEA was a valuable work of modern art. Dutch YouTube jokers lifehunterstv took a £7(10 euro) print and placed it in an art museum in Arnhem, and asked visitors what they thought of the 'painting' and how much it could be worth. Several art fans praised the IKEA print, with some valuing it to £1.8million(2.5million euro), before being told of the hoax. Funny guys: A group of Dutch YouTube jokers took a £7 print from IKEA and placed it in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem . The team from lifehunterstv placed the cheap canvas on display in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem, and asked art lovers for an appraisal. They told visitors the painting was done by famous Swedish artist 'IKE Andrews', and, according to the pranksters, all of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie. The video shows presenter Boris Lange talking about the painting to a number of visitors, who call the cheap print 'modern' and 'shocking'. One man praises the print for its 'constructiveness of things on top of each other, inside each other'. Another  visitor, a man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism', adding that the artist has a 'beautiful spirit'. Joke: Presenter Boris Lange told visitors the 'painting' was done by famous Swedish artist 'IKE Andrews' and say everyone of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie . A man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism' When asked how much they believe the artwork to be worth, one guesses 'over 1,000 euro', while another says: 'If you could buy this for 2.5million euros, I'd do it.' 'The whole day everyone thought our ""painting"" amazing,' the team behind the prank says. 'When the people talked about that this image is a symbol of the painters spirit, and that it could be worth a 200,000 euros or even 2.5million euros it made us laugh inside!' When the pranksters told the art fans about their IKEA hoax, a majority saw the funny side, but, lifehunterstv reveals, not all were pleased about being duped. 'The last two guys couldn't even say one word as a reaction and just walked away with red cheeks. We could feel the awkwardness'. Taking it well: When the pranksters told the art fans about their IKEA hoax, a majority saw the funny side . Hit a nerve? Two men who had praised the painting were so offended when told that it was a cheap IKEA print that they left without a word . This comes just days after IKEA customers in the Netherlands were stopped from organising a mass-game of hide and seek. A whopping 19,000 people signed up to a Facebook group promoting a game at IKEA's Amsterdam branch next month, and another 13,000 signed up for a game in the Ikea store in the city of Utrecht. But the Swedish retail giant has bad news for folks wanting to hide among its room-like furniture displays: The numbers signing up are getting out of hand and the events have been blocked. 'We have contacted these pages on social media and humbly asked them to have their hide and seek games somewhere else,' IKEA spokeswoman Martina Smedberg said Tuesday. Ms Smedberg added that IKEA does not want to be a spoilsport, but safety comes first.","YouTube pranksters tricked Dutch artlovers into praising cheap print .

"A Pennsylvania man turned his mother's day care center into a heroin den once the kids left for the day, according to police. Ryan Varano told authorities he and another man, Christian Kehler, would use Jesus' Lil Helpers Daycare to sell and use heroin on nights and weekends, The Shamokin News Item reported. Police told the newspaper the men used children's tables, chairs and cabinets at the Shamokin day care center to package heroin and load syringes.

Varano, Kehler and Frederick Russo were charged Saturday after someone at the daycare building called police to report an overdose, the Shamokin News Item reported. Citing court documents, the newspaper reported that police and emergency workers revived 37-year-old Kehler with CPR and naloxone. Varano, Kehler and Russo are reportedly facing criminal conspiracy, possession of an illegal substance, and possession with intent to deliver charges. Police told the Shamokin News Item that Russo was not there when Kehler overdosed. Online court records didn't include information on lawyers to comment on the charges. Police have said children's tables, chairs and cabinets at the Shamokin day care center were used to package heroin and load syringes . District Attorney Ann Targonski told the newspaper 'It's upsetting to realize that heroin is being dealt in the same places where we send our children to be safe while we work. 'This particular instance occurred during hours when the day care was not in operation. 'However, the idea that people are doing drugs and selling drugs in what we would consider a safe haven for children is concerning.' Varano's mother Kelly L. Ebersole has told the Shamokin News Item she is going to press charges against Varano and Kehler. '(Varano) had no right to be in here,' she told the newspaper.

"A prototype toilet that generates 'everlasting' electricity from urine has been launched near a university bar. The scientists behind the 'pee-power' toilet hope it can be used by aid agencies in disaster zones to supply much-needed electricity to refugee camps. The technology uses microbial fuel stacks in the toilets, which feed on urine, creating biochemical energy  that can be turned into electricity. Scroll down for video . A prototype toilet that generates 'everlasting' electricity from urine has been launched near at a university bar (stock image used). The scientists behind the 'pee-power' toilet hope it can be used by aid agencies in disaster zones to supply much-needed electricity to refugee camps . The urinal is the result of a partnership between researchers at the University of the West of England in Bristol and Oxfam. The units contain bacteria that breaks down the chemicals in urine, in the process releasing energy in the form of electricity which is stored on a capacitor within a fuel cell. 'The microbial fuel cells (MFC) work by employing live microbes which feed on urine for their own growth and maintenance,' explained Professor Ioannis  Ieropoulos. 'The MFC is, in effect, a system which taps a portion of that biochemical energy. 'This technology is about as green as it gets, as we do not need to utilise fossil fuels and we are effectively using a waste product that will be in plentiful supply.' It is located near the students' union at the university's Frenchay campus and researchers will be hoping for brisk business at closing time. Students and staff are being asked to use the urinal to donate pee to fuel the microbial fuel cell stacks that generate electricity to power indoor lighting. The research team is led by Professor Ioannis Ieropoulos, of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory at UWE Bristol, who is an expert at harnessing power from unusual sources using microbial fuel cells. 'We have already proved that this way of generating electricity works,' the professor said. 'Work by the Bristol BioEnergy Centre hit the headlines in 2013 when the team demonstrated that electricity generated by microbial fuel cell stacks could power a mobile phone. 'This exciting project with Oxfam could have a huge impact in refugee camps. 'The microbial fuel cells work by employing live microbes which feed on urine for their own growth and maintenance. 'The microbial fuel cell is in effect a system which taps a portion of that biochemical energy used for microbial growth, and converts that directly into electricity - what we are calling urine-tricity or pee power. 'This technology is about as green as it gets, as we do not need to utilise fossil fuels and we are effectively using a waste product that will be in plentiful supply.' The urinal on the university campus resembles toilets used in refugee camps by Oxfam to make the trial as realistic as possible. The technology that converts the urine in to power sits underneath the urinal and can be viewed through a clear screen. The toilet is located near the students' union at Bristol university's Frenchay campus and researchers will be hoping for brisk business at closing time.Students and staff are being asked to use the urinal to donate pee to fuel the microbial fuel cell stacks that generate electricity to power indoor lighting . Andy Bastable, head of water and sanitation at Oxfam, said: 'Oxfam is an expert at providing sanitation in disaster zones, and it is always a challenge to light inaccessible areas far from a power supply. 'This technology is a huge step forward. Living in a refugee camp is hard enough without the added threat of being assaulted in dark places at night. The potential of this invention is huge.' They hope the abundant, free supply of urine will make the device practical for aid agencies to use in the field. Prof Ieropoulos added: 'One microbial fuel cell costs about £1 ($1.5) to make, and we think that a small unit like the demo we have mocked up for this experiment could cost as little as £600 ($900) to set up, which is a significant bonus as this technology is in theory everlasting.'","Scientists say toilet can be used to supply electricity in disaster zones .

"A 23-year-old man set fire to his house - killing a cat - and overturned his car before knocking on doors with his pants down in search of 'his wife', police have said. Alex Chambrello, who is covered in religious tattoos, identified himself as 'Lucifer' when police in Wolcott, Connecticut found him flashing homeowners his tattooed behind on Thursday morning. Earlier that day, authorities had been alerted to a fire in a home's basement just before 8am and it took firefighters 15 minutes to bring the flames under control, NBC reported. Scroll down for video . Alex Chambrello, who has multiple religious tattoos, told police he was Lucifer when he was arrested for setting his home on fire before banging on the doors of an apartment complex and threatening a woman . Minutes later, they received a report of a car that had rolled over about a mile and a half away. As the police chief, who was nearby, headed to the scene, another call came in reporting that a half-naked man was banging on doors of an apartment complex asking to see his wife, WTNH reported. It is not known if Chambrello is married. A woman told police that he threatened to punch her if she didn't let him into her home. The police chief, Edward Stephens, said he arrived in time to witness some of the bizarre behavior. 'I pulled into the complex and sure enough there was a gentleman there who we later arrested,' he said. 'His pants were down, his exposed buttocks covered with tattoos, banging on doors.' Scene: He allegedly set fire to the basement of his family's home (pictured) and killed a cat, police said . Crash: Minutes after responding to the fire, police received a call that he had crashed his car a mile away . Final stop: He then headed to these condos where he allegedly banged on doors and threatened a woman . Chambrello, who is tattooed with depictions of Jesus and Virgin Mary as well as phrases reading 'Conquer All Evil' and 'This Too Shall Pass', said he was called Lucifer, according to police. 'He said he was Lucifer from Hell the Inferno and he's talking all kinds of gibberish,' Stephens said. Chambrello told officers his address, which was the same place where the fire had unfolded. None of his family were home at the time of the fire, but a cat was killed. Another cat was also missing but was later found with cuts to its face. Images also show that his car's windscreen was left shattered by the accident. Chambrello has been charged with arson, cruelty to an animal and breach of peace and is being held on $100,000 bond.

"Rima Karak has won wide-spread support after defending herself against Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i . A female Lebanese TV host has won wide-spread support after standing her ground against an Islamist scholar following his sexist comments live on air. Rima Karaki was conducting an interview with London-based Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i for Lebanon's Al Jadeed on the weekend of International Women’s Day, discussing reports of Christians joining Islamic groups such as ISIS in the Middle East when the scholar went off on a historical tangent. In the footage, Karaki urges Sheik Al-Seba'i to get back to the issues being faced in the present day, and asks him another question, a request which sparks a heated argument. 'It was at its peak during the 1970s, with the leftist revolutionary movement,' he says. 'Back then, we saw leftist organisation like the Red Brigades in Italy, the Red Army in Germany, the Baader Meinhof Group ...' Karaki tries to get Al-Seba'i back on topic, asking him to 'focus on the present'. She asks: 'At present, what slogans are used to attract (Christians) to these groups?' But Dr Al Seba’i becomes angry and abruptly replies: 'Listen, don't cut me off. I will answer as I please.' He then raises his voice, adding: 'I will not answer the way you like, because I’m here to serve the idea in which I believe.' Karaki politely explains that they have limited time on the show, but Al-Seba'i refuses to listen, telling the TV host he would not be interrupted and that he will answer as he pleases. Lebanese TV host Rima Karaki is being praised on social media for her cool reaction to sexist comments made by Sheik Al-Seba'i on a live interview . The host then lets the scholar know exactly who's in charge. 'In this studio, I run the show,' Karaki says. It provokes an angry reaction from Al-Seba'i. 'Are you done?' he says. 'Shut up so I can talk. 'It's beneath me to be interviewed by you. You are a woman who...' 'If you are going to elaborate so much, we won’t have time for other questions. 'Now, it’s up to you. If we have time, you will answer all the questions,' she says. Dr Al Seba'i replies: “You can decide as much as you like, but I will do whatever I want.' Rima Karaki asserts her authority over the situation as Sheik Al-Seba'i starts to get worked up . London-based Sheik Al-Seba'i then rudely tells the TV host to shut up as he carries on talking over her . With her palm facing the Sheikh, Karaki then delivers the ultimate end to the conversation. 'How can a respected Sheik like yourself tell a TV host to shut up?' she asks. 'Either there is mutual respect or the conversation is over.' The studio cameras then switch back to the studio leaving the Sheik in the dark. Karaki later posted a video of the conversation on her Twitter feed, which has gone viral and received widespread support. It has had 2.3million views on YouTube. Ania Sowinski tweeted: 'The awesome and beautiful Rima Karaki. A great role model for young women #respect.' Raji Abi Rached added: 'Good job on putting disrespectful people in their place #WomensDay.' The Sheik then delivers the now infamous jibe that it is 'beneath' him to be interviewed by her . Rima Karaki is astounded that a respected Sheik would tell a TV host to shut up live on air . Rima Karaki is a TV anchor and university professor, who started her career in 1998 as one of the main hosts of the Arab world's most imitated morning programme Alam al Sabah. After 10 years on the show, Karaki moved on to co-host and produce Personal Matters, that dealt with Arab viewers' intimate issues. In 2010, Karaki hosted celebrity-themed show Ana Wiyyak (You And I). Her first book Tonight I will Confess has received critical acclaim in literary circles and she is now the host for Bidoun Zaal, where she interviews public figures and discusses issues related to society, politics and religion. London-based Sheik Hani Al-Siba'i is Director of London's Al-Maqreze Centre for Historical Studies Hani Sibai. He has previously claimed that ‘anyone who is not a Muslim is a criminal’ and is seen as a controversial figure who has often made offensive comments in interviews. Speaking to Al-Jazeera TV on July 8, 2005, the Sheik caused great outrage by saying that the London bombings were a victory: ‘If Al-Qaeda indeed carried out this act [of the bombings], it is a great victory for it. It rubbed the noses of the world's eight most powerful countries in the mud.’ The row comes as global views on women’s rights face more scrutiny than ever before. Last month, a manifesto - reportedly written by an all-women Islamic State militia - advised that nine is a good age to consider marriage for girls, who should have husbands by 16. It also said women must stay behind closed doors, be veiled and only leave the house in exceptional circumstances. While in India, a documentary caused outrage last week in which convicted rapist Mukesh Singh blamed his victim Jyoti Singh for the attack. The news anchor won support on social media, with many defending her reaction .","TV host Rima Karaki was interviewing  Islamist Hani Al-Seba'i .

The medieval village is situated on a high hill which cascades into the Mediterranean, which is where the man washed up on Saturday. The medieval village of Eze is situated on a high hill which cascades into the Mediterranean, which is where the man washed up on Saturday . ‘His bike was found nearby, but the reason for his death remains a mystery,’ said a source from the local prosecutors’ office. They have opened a preliminary investigation, with judicial police interviewing the fishermen and searching for forensics. The source said an autopsy will be held later this week so as to determine the exact cause of death. No theory for the death – which range from a cycling accident to murder and suicide – has yet been ruled out, the source added. Eze is well known for its sea views, and beautiful gardens, and has become a home to numerous celebrities. Those with a home there include members of the rock band, U2. The area is always packed with cyclists, including many from the UK who are attracted by the long seaside routes, and the mild climate.

"Sickening: More than 2,000 indecent images were found when police raided the home of Mike Davies, pictured, in Llantrisant, South Wales, last June . A former council worker who was caught with more than 2,000 indecent images of children received a  redundancy payout worth an estimated £30,000 after keeping his arrest secret from bosses. A sickening collection of pictures of children as young as five being sexually abused was discovered when police raided the home of Mike Davies, in Llantrisant, South Wales, last June. But the 52-year-old failed to tell his then-employers, Cardiff City Council, about the criminal investigation and continued in his post until it was 'deleted' as part of budget savings this year. Davies, a long-serving council employee, admitted to possessing the images and videos, including sexual pictures involving animals, when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court on Wednesday. He was handed a three-year community sentence and ordered to undertake a three-year therapy course to cure his 'weird obsessions'. He will also be on the Sex Offenders' Register for five years. The explicit material, which included sexual images involving animals, were found on Davies' computer when police searched the home he shared with his partner and four-year-old child. He has recently been living at an address in Caerphilly, South Wales. Today it emerged that senior council officials were only made aware of the proceedings after the conviction and that Davies received a severance package from the council as recently as last month. Davies, who held a number of roles at the council, is likely to have received a payout of around £30,000 - the maximum amount available to an officer of his age, according to Wales Online. The council is now taking legal advise on the matter and is 'considering what steps it can take going forward'. A Cardiff City Council spokesman said: 'Mr Davies' post was deleted as part of this year's budget savings. 'We want to reiterate in the strongest terms that senior management was unaware of any criminal proceedings against him until the day of his conviction. 'The organisation is appalled that Mr Davies failed to reveal the criminal investigation to the council at any point. Sentenced: Davies, a long-serving council employee, admitted to possessing the images and videos, including sexual pictures involving animals, when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, on Wednesday . 'The City of Cardiff Council is taking legal advice on this matter and considering what steps it can take going forward.' Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis said: 'South Wales Police is required to comply with existing data protection legislation when it investigates any case and is not allowed to disclose to an employer when a person has been arrested or charged with a criminal offence. 'The exception is if the role is a notifiable occupation, which it wasn't in this case. 'While South Wales Police is committed to protecting its communities from sex offenders the force also has to adhere to its legal obligations under the existing legislation. 'This was a particularly unpleasant case which was thoroughly investi-gated by South Wales Police, resulting in Mr Davies appearing before the courts. 'Cases of this nature are extremely serious and for every child abuse image there is a victim.'","Mike Davies was caught with sickening collection of images last June .

"It seemed like a major coup for Ed Miliband. Martin Freeman, one of Britain’s most bankable Hollywood stars, was last night unveiled as the first big celebrity backer of Labour’s 2015 general election campaign. The millionaire actor, who has enjoyed a dizzying rise to international superstardom with the Hobbit trilogy, was the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insisted Mr Miliband’s party would ‘make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few’. Millionaire actor Martin Freeman (pictured) is the focus of a glossy three-minute film in which he insists Mr Miliband’s party would ‘make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few’ But last night, the Labour leader faced embarrassment after it emerged that Freeman is a former supporter of Arthur Scargill’s far-left socialist party which openly refused to vote Labour at the 2005 general election. Freeman himself also faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported that he sends his son to a £12,000-a-year private school. Not only that, but his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid £120,000 tax bill – despite Freeman having an estimated fortune of £10million. In last night’s three-minute broadcast, Freeman, who found fame in the satirical British sitcom The Office, said: ‘I don’t know about you, but my values are about community, compassion, decency; that’s how I was brought up.’ Freeman with his partner Amanda Abbington (pictured) who declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid £120,000 tax bill, despite living with Freeman, who is worth more than £10million . In an address straight to the camera, the 43-year-old, who also stars in Sherlock, claimed the Tories would take the country on a ‘rollercoaster of cuts’ while Labour would ‘make sure the economy works for all of us, not just the privileged few, like me’. The actor also insisted the Tories ‘don’t believe in the NHS’ and added: ‘For me, there’s only one choice – and I choose Labour.’ At first glance, it appeared to represent a much needed boost for Mr Miliband as Freeman is a good deal more famous than some of Labour’s other celebrity backers – such as Baldrick actor Tony Robinson. But last night it emerged that Mr Freeman spent years supporting a far-left Socialist Labour Party that was set up by the militant miners’ union boss Arthur Scargill in protest at New Labour. In an interview with the Guardian ahead of the 2005 election, Freeman declared that he voted for the party in 2001 and would not back Tony Blair. Asked how he would vote that year, he replied: ‘Not Labour’. The Socialist Labour Party, which is now almost defunct, campaigns for the ‘abolition of capitalism’ and the nationalisation of virtually every industry. Freeman faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported he sends his son to a private school . The Conservatives said Freeman’s decision to switch his support to Labour showed how far Mr Miliband had dragged the party to the Left. Tory MP Nigel Adams said: ‘Even Bilbo Baggins has recognised how far Labour has lurched to the left, imagine the chaos Red Ed would cause across Britain and the Shire.’ Labour was also facing potential embarrassment over revelations about Freeman’s personal life. Despite his socialist outlook, Freeman is reported to send his son to a school which charges up to £12,669 a year. A spokesman for the actor was asked to comment, but did not respond. It was a major coup for Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured) but he faces embarrassment after it emerged Freeman is a former Scargill supporter . The star also hit the headlines two years ago after it emerged his long-term partner Amanda Abbington had declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid £120,000 tax bill, despite living with Freeman, who is worth more than £10million. Miss Abbington, who also appears in Sherlock, had been with Freeman for 11 years at the time. The couple have two children. The revelations sparked an outpouring of bad publicity for the couple, prompting Miss Abbington to settle her debts. She told the Radio Times later in 2013: ‘It’s fine, it’s being sorted out. It was a big mistake and I’m sorting it out right now. ‘It’s being paid off now. I would never want to go through this again. But I’m paying it off.’ Freeman’s decision to back Labour appeared to win the enthusiastic backing of Miss Abbington, who posted a message on Twitter saying: ‘F*** the Tories.’ Labour said the party election broadcast had received ‘unprecedented’ interest on the internet, with hundreds of thousands of people choosing to watch. The actor appears in front of a plain white background and, despite encouraging voters to put Labour in power, makes no mention of Mr Miliband or the prospect of him becoming the next prime minister. Instead, he focuses on contrasting Labour’s ‘values’ with those of the Tories, who he claims ‘have got sod all to offer the young’. Tory MP Nigel Adams said: ‘Labour is trying to whitewash Ed Miliband from their campaign – his MPs don’t want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast doesn’t even mention him.'","Hollywood actor Martin Freeman was last night unveiled as Labour's first big celebrity backer of their 2015 general election campaign .

"Downing Street was last night claiming victory in the battle over the Election TV debates after Ed Miliband was forced to line up with the minnow parties on a ‘night of the non-entities’. Labour reacted with fury when the broadcasters announced – after weeks of wrangling – that neither David Cameron nor Nick Clegg would be invited to the second debate on April 16. Only the non-governing parties will feature, meaning Mr Miliband will appear with the leaders of Ukip, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. David Cameron will only appear in one full debate, hosted by ITV on Thursday, April 2, with the six other party leaders . Ed Miliband will have to line up with the minnow parties on a ‘night of the non-entities’ because neither David Cameron nor Nick Clegg will be invited to the second debate on April 16 . Mr Clegg’s absence means that Mr Miliband will not be able to accuse Mr Cameron of being ‘chicken’ by avoiding the exchange, or force the broadcasters to ‘empty chair’ the Prime Minister. No10 has also successfully killed the idea of a direct head-to-head debate between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband. The two men will instead join Mr Clegg in making individual appearances in front of a studio audience for a BBC Question Time special. It means that Mr Cameron will only appear in one full debate, hosted by ITV on Thursday, April 2, with the six other party leaders. The announcement of the broadcasters’ final plans represents a triumph for Downing Street strategists, who did not want the Election campaign to be dominated by the debates, as it was in 2010, on the grounds that Mr Miliband’s stock is already so low with the public he had the least to lose. But the Lib Dems have described the final arrangements as a ‘farce’. And Labour issued an angry statement accusing the broadcasters of reneging on a commitment to proceed with the head-to-head debate programme after ‘weeks of pressure from the Conservative Party’, insisting that the ‘cowardice’ of Mr Cameron had thwarted the head-to-head encounter. Labour also claimed that Mr Clegg had been excluded from the April 16 debate ‘at the Conservative Party’s insistence’ to provide cover for the PM’s absence. Labour has claimed that Nick Clegg (pictured) had been excluded from the April 16 debate ‘at the Conservative Party’s insistence’ to provide cover for the PM’s absence . Ukip leader Nigel Farage areacted angrily, saying TV debates were now 'so far from the original proposals' A Labour spokesman said: ‘The whole country will understand the reasons for this: the Prime Minister wants to minimise the scope of televised debates between himself and Ed Miliband. ‘We hope that even at this late stage David Cameron will rethink his decision not to take part on April 16. ‘The Prime Minister’s repeated attempts to dictate the abandonment of these TV programmes to independent broadcasters is deeply worrying.’ The spokesman added that after the Election Labour would seek to put future debate programmes on a statutory footing. Ukip leader Nigel Farage also reacted angrily, saying: ‘TV debates are now so far from the original proposals. Broadcasters should be ashamed. They’ve kow-towed to manipulation from Downing Street.’ In a joint statement, the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 said: ‘We’re delighted there will be a debate with all the party leaders during the campaign. The debate on April 2 will build on the success of the 2010 TV debates so valued by viewers.’ A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘If it was down to us, we would be in every TV debate. But the politicians and broadcasters have ducked and dived on this long enough and need to get on with it. Frankly this is all a farce’. A No10 spokesman said: ‘We have agreed to the broadcasters’ proposal.’","Only non-governing parties to feature in second televised debate in April .

"Two drivers were injured when a massive freight train derailed in northern Greece and crumpled into a pile of twisted metal. A 'slight landslide' forced it off the tracks as it passed through the tiny Gefyra settlement en route to Hungary, local website News 247 has reported. 15 of its 30 carriages derailed in the horrific accident which has now blocked the track linking Greece's second largest city Thessaloniki and Belgrade in Serbia 'indefinitely'. The local people inspecting the wreckage are completely dwarfed by the enormity of the train's containers. Wreck: A 'slight landslide' near the Greek settlement Gefyra has forced a massive freight train to derail .

Crash: 15 of the huge freight train's 30 carriages came off the tracks and crumpled into a heap of twisted metal . The train was carrying electronic equipment from the Greek port city of Konya although it is unclear who the goods belonged to. Initial reports suggest heavy rains caused the train to derail following a slight landslide near the settlement where it crashed. Just last month in Greece, four people died when a passenger train struck a truck at a rail crossing in the country's north. At least seven of the 30 people injured in that crash were in a serious condition, the local fire brigade said. Fire Chief Andreas Kois said: 'We fear that many more are trapped under the four wagons. We cannot say what condition they are in.

"Parliament ended with the most tremendous, tetchy – tearful! – squabble: should Speaker Bercow's future be decided by secret ballot? It became a day of wondrous hysteria, tantrums, moist hankies and (for the time being) survival for this stinker of a Speaker. Labour MPs and a handful of men on the Weirdo Right insisted that a secret ballot would be 'undemocratic'. Moderate Tories and Lib Dems argued that MPs openly voting against Bercow feared the Squeaker's tyrannical vengeance crashing about their ears. Scroll down for video . Speaker John Bercow (pictured) fought back tears as a motion to vote on a secret ballot to unseat him was defeated 228 to 202 . Good grief, you mean an allegedly impartial Speaker might hold grudges? You mean this shouty, sarcastic, balled fist of a Speaker might nurse resentments and use his privileged position to queer the Commons? Labour and its Cameron-haters on the Right – unhappy creatures such as Edward Leigh and David Davis – narrowly won the day. By the end, Bercow was blubbing with relief, while his friend (and possible successor) Charles Walker was wailing that some beastly, beastly men had not been entirely clear with him beforehand. Boo hoo! Mr Walker is so widely seen as a Bercow stooge, it may not be surprising that he was kept out of the loop by Bercow's enemies. His chin-crumpling speech, in which he said he preferred to be thought an honest fool than a clever schemer, was greeted with frenetic clapping from Labour. It was soon being compared to the Gettysburg Address, Churchill's 'fight them on the beaches' speech, the Sermon on the Mount. Labour MPs and Bercow's Tory nutjobs waved their Order Papers and accused Commons Leader William Hague of being a Soviet Union dictator. Bercowites leapt in the air, brandishing their pleasure and accusing the secret ballot crowd of being 'grubby' and 'partisan'. Bercow supporters had been taken by surprise on Wednesday evening by a cunning ploy from Westminster's very own Baldrick, Government Chief Whip Michael Gove. A secret ballot may have looked harmless. We all have one in the coming general election. 'Labour MPs and Bercow's Tory nutjobs waved their Order Papers and accused Commons Leader William Hague (pictured) of being a Soviet Union dictator' But Labour – which regards Bercow as a client Speaker – saw that a secret ballot would give its own MPs the cloak of anonymity. That would make them impossible to Whip. Labour MPs were therefore hauled back from the furthest ends of the kingdom to save the Speaker for socialism. At this point you will say 'well, naturally Bercow must have let one of his deputies chair the debate, as it would have been improper for him to supervise it himself'. You do not know this man. Of course he chaired it! And he did so in the most hilariously biased fashion, calling a succession of his mates. Labour delayed the debate, thus allowing its troops to get back from their constituencies. How did they do this? By asking the Speaker to give them Urgent Questions. Three, to be precise. He granted them all. Each of these devices use up precious time and made Bercow's survival more likely. A Tory moderate, Greg Barker (Bexhill & Battle), muttered 'oh, rubbish' while one of Mr Bercow's supporters was speaking. A smiling Bercow snarled at Mr Barker that 'it is better to remain silent and look a fool than to remove any doubt'. This was an authentic Bercow moment – that combination of sneer and fake amusement catching his character perfectly. Sir Gerald Kaufman (Lab, Gorton), in a Prince of Wales-check suit that will have made TV screens wobble, made a pro-Bercow speech of such acidity, it must have corroded the pinky gums at the bottom of his ancient, yellowing fangs. Sir Gerald is likely to be the next Father of the House and will therefore be in charge of the House when it has a chance to approve Bercow's continued existence in the Chair. How convenient! Was yesterday's plot driven by partisanship? It was certainly driven by hatred of Bercow, who was elected in 2009 amid sly partisanship by Labour. The once great Chair of our elected Legislature has never looked so tawdry. The Tories should run a candidate against Bercow in Buckingham.

"This is the moment a group of thrill-seeking skydivers were given the unforgettable opportunity to jump from the bomb bay doors of a military aeroplane. Arranged by Chicagoland Skydiving Center, the special event was enjoyed by 10 people who dropped from the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in the skies over Rochelle, Illinois. Exiting the aircraft from 5,000ft, the skydivers each made a donation of $500 (£340) to the Collings Foundation – the non-profit organisation that operates the plane – in order to take part in the jump. One of the skydivers jumps out of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress through its bomb bay doors . Each skydiver made a donation of $500 (£340) to the Collings Foundation to take part in the jump . Filmed on GoPro cameras attached to helmets, the video begins with the skydivers boarding the heavy bomber aircraft at an airport in Rockford, Illinois. Developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Corps, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine heavy bomber aircraft. The prototype B-17 was designed and built at Boeing’s own expense by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and Edward Curtis Wells. Boeing chief test-pilot Leslie Tower was at the controls of the Model 299 when it made its maiden flight on July 28, 1935. The name Flying Fortress was used to describe the aircraft because the Model 299 included multiple machine gun installations. The B-17 served numerous USAAF units in combat throughout World War II and was even used by the RAF in non-bomber roles. The B-17 Flying Fortress has become a symbol of power and the America Air Force. Capturing the closed bay doors from the inside of the plane, the video switches to show the aircraft's large propellers starting up before the B-17 leaves the runway. In the air, one of the skydivers checks out the numerous guns attached to the aircraft as well as the two pilots driving it from the cockpit. Before long the B-17 is cruising at around 5,000ft and the bay doors can be seen opening via a camera mounted to the bottom on the plane. Inside the skydivers stand over the opening floor and hold on to the railings on either side as Northern Illinois comes into view below. Waiting for the right moment, the skydivers then begin dropping from the plane at different times – as the camera underneath picks up their rapid exits. The video concludes with footage recorded from a GoPro, which shows the plane moving further away as the skydiver gets closer to the ground. Mike Wood, Chief Operations Officer at Chicagoland Skydiving Center and one of the jumpers in the video, spoke enthusiastically about the experience. One of the skydivers said jumping out of the bay doors was one of the most incredible experiences of his life . The special event was enjoyed by 10 people who dropped from the plane in the skies over Rochelle, Illinois . He told Newsflare: ‘I've been skydiving for more than 30 years and a pilot for more than 20, and the B-17 jump was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. ‘As a pilot and a jumper, it's a privilege to have had a ride in this plane. 'Watching the bomb bay doors open below my feet was a sight I will never forget.’ The Chicagoland Skydiving Center conduct numerous skydives every year with specialty aircraft being brought to its drop zone in Illinois. The Collings Foundation raises money to cover maintenance costs by bringing war planes to air shows across the US.

"Tributes have poured in for a 29-year-old Australian woman who died during a 'simple' medical procedure in Mexico, as a close friend remembers her as a kind, generous and loving young woman. Evita Nicole Sarmonikas, 29, was admitted to a hospital in Mexicali, the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California, on March 20 while on holiday with her boyfriend. She died on the same day, after reportedly suffering a heart attack. A close friend of Ms Sarmonkias has shared a heartbreaking tribute to the young woman, as her devastated family struggle to raise funds to have her body flown home, despite the hospital offering to cremate her. Tributes have poured in for Evita Nicole Sarmonikas (right, pictured with friend Sherri Burton) after her death in a Mexican hospital last week . 'Eva my heart, my love, my joy. Where are you? I need you. We were meant to grow old together and still be conquering life hand in hand as sisters. I'm still not understanding. I haven't been able to sleep,' Sherri Burton wrote. Ms Burton recalled the last time the pair spoke, and the final day they spent together before Ms Sarmonkias went overseas. 'The last thing you wrote to me, about 7 hours before you went to be with our Heavenly Father, was ""wish you were here with me"". You always thought about me when you were having fun and wanted me to experience it. 'It has been 7 days since you were physically with me in this very room I’m typing in. Sitting on this very chair,' the tribute continued. 'Eva… There are not enough words to express how I feel about you. Thank you for loving me. I am honoured to have received such love. I am honoured to call you my sister. 'I am honoured to have been there through the good and the bad. I am honoured to have been let into the most intimate parts of your heart,' Ms Burton also wrote. Family and friends have flooded social media with tributes for the 'bright, beautiful' young woman . 'The last thing you wrote to me, about 7 hours before you went to be with our Heavenly Father, was ""wish you were here with me"", close friend Ms Burton revealed . Ms Sarmonkias worked as a receptionist at LJ Hooker in Surfer's Paradise, and her former colleagues have remembered her as bubbly, bright and beautiful young woman. Ms Sarmonkias worked as a receptionist at LJ Hooker in Surfer's Paradise . 'The LJ Hooker Surfers Paradise Network is deeply saddened to hear of the sudden passing of one of our past employees Eva Sarmonikas,' a statement read. 'She was rightly positioned as our receptionist and the role suited her to a T. 'With the bubbliest and brightest personality anyone could ever imagine it was a pleasure to hear her wonderful voice at the other end of the line. 'This photo was taken last year at the LJ Hooker Annual Night Of The Stars Awards and how stunning she looked,' the post continued, referring to an image of the 29-year-old beaming at the camera. 'We will all miss her very much, Rest In Peace beautiful girl xx.' Ms Sarmonkias's distraught family remain at a loss to understand why she could not be saved. They have highlighted how Australian Medical advice shows that 'even in the case of cardiac arrest a healthy young body can often be brought back to life when surrounded by a fully equipped hospital and a competent medical team'. Ms Sarmonikas's family has set up a Facebook page in tribute to the 'perfect and whole soul' and to also help fundraise up to $30,000, which is needed to bring her body back home to Australia. A GoFundMe page has been established as the young woman's sister and mother battle to get to Mexico to bring 'Eva' home. Her former colleagues have remembered her as bubbly, bright and beautiful young woman . Tributes have also poured in from friends and family, vowing to remember her as a happy woman . The Mexican government have offered to cremate her body, according to the family, but the Australian have strongly advised against it and suggested an independent autopsy be carried out. 'The Australian Embassy has been clear on not allowing her body to leave Mexicali, or allowing her little body to be cremated before an independent autopsy and external opinion is sought,' a statement from the family said. They have also urged other women not to 'risk death to improve on perfection'. 'The autopsy showed Eva went into cardiac arrest following surgery. The hospitals' only response was to cling to their waiver, removing themselves from any liability,' a family member wrote on the Facebook group. 'There have been no answers and their only offer of 'cooperation' was an urgency to return her to us in the form of ashes. The Australian Embassy has strongly advised we do not allow this to happen.' Ms Sarmonikas's family have been advised to travel to Mexico as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy – not carried out by the hospital where she died – and to bring her home. They say she 'did not have travel insurance and we were never prepared for a situation of this magnitude'. A Facebook tribute page has been set up for Evita to share advice and support and to help fundraise to bring her body home to Australia . One friend on Facebook described Eva as a 'shining light in the dark and unforgiving world' 'Evita as we knew her on earth would be devastated at the amount of attention she is receiving at the moment, as she was extremely private and worked very hard to never be a burden on anybody,' her family wrote. 'However the abundance of love that we all hold for her is propelling the action that needs to be taken before she be laid to rest, and she deserves that.' Her family are also asking for help in gaining legal and medical representation as advised by The Australian Embassy. Ms Sarmonikas's family have not said what procedure Evita was undergoing before she died but they explained: 'As beautiful as Evita was inside and out. She was still filled with certain inadequacies. As almost every woman on earth does.' 'Her perfect and whole soul was not strong enough in light of a world that constantly bombarded her with an urgency to demand more from herself and her body,' they explained. 'She never demanded anything from anybody, but was always out giving her people. These near perfect graphic comparisons our young women are bombarded with from get go are too much for innocent hearts to battle, and the consequences are fatal when not conducted by adequate professionals. Ms Sarmonikas's family have been advised to travel to Mexico as soon as possible to request an independent autopsy . 'These doctors promised her more perfection to fill an emptiness that began developing early in our childhood. This emptiness further expanded with traumatic experiences in her adult life and the constant social boarding of a false beauty illusion,' they Facebook post continued. Her sister Andrea has urged others not too risk their lives in the pursuit of what they perceive as beauty. 'This was not the way to go home, no woman should risk death to improve on perfection,' they said. 'Tomorrow morning when you look in the mirror say to yourself 'I am enough, I am worthy, I am perfect just the way I am'. 'Don't listen to a world that is hungry to fill your insecurities with poison. Stop feeding an industry that hates humans, especially women in the natural state and their perfect birth bodies. Do it for Eva, do it for you.' Tributes have poured in for the 29-year-old. One friend wrote 'she was such a gorgeous girl physically and emotionally' Friends have promised to help bring Evita,  'a truly beautiful soul', home anyway they can . There has been an outpouring of love and messages of condolences on the page set up to remember Ms Sarmonikas. Ashleigh Carvell said: 'So sad she was such a gorgeous girl physically and emotionally. She seemed to be so confident in herself. Such a sad thing to happen my heart aches for u all. My deepest condolences.' Sugah Kimba wrote: 'She is a beautiful soul!!! Eva is the type of person to make the world a little more beautiful!!!! That's just who she was!!!' Sasha RPaki said: 'How do you improve on perfection? Eva was perfect, just as God made her and no man should ever have adulterated His masterpiece. The world is poorer for having lost her.' 'This news is devastating! All my memories of Eva, Sarah and I as little girls playing in the street have flooded back! I remember bumping into her a few years back and was amazed by her beauty.. Inside and out! I'm so sorry for your loss, it's always the good ones that are taken too soon!,' Elise O'Donnell wrote. Helen Pearce added: 'Eva was a shining light in this dark and unforgiving world. Beautiful inside and out, gracious, sensitive, caring and giving, who lived by her moto of laugh, live, love. Eva you will be so sadly missed.'","Evita Nicole Sarmonikas, 29, died on March 20 in Mexicali, Mexico .

"According to the fashion world, the Seventies are back — and there’s no one happier about it than me, as someone who lived and breathed every second of it. Designers such as Prada, Tom Ford and Gucci showered catwalks last year in flares, jumpsuits, wide-brimmed hats and wild prints. But the retro revival doesn’t stop at the ankles; summer stilettos have been ditched in favour of towering platforms on almost every High Street in the country. As a top model during the Seventies, I lived in platforms. Bigger was always better, especially because — at 5 ft 8 in — I was a little on the short side for the fashion world. Scroll down for video . As a top model during the Seventies, Jilly Johnson (pictured in early Seventies) spent a lot of time wearing platform shoes . I had to bluff my way through shoots with billowing bell-bottoms and chunky shoes that looked fun, flirty and fabulous. But now, aged 61 and with 11 grandchildren, I’m not sure I can carry them off with such aplomb. Surely thin, slimming lines and elegant shapes are what I’m after rather than weighty clodhoppers? To find out if they can ever be flattering, I put eight pairs through their paces. Kurt Geiger, £130 . Shoes: www.kurtgeiger.com . Completely inappropriate — but I think these are divine. I had a pair of red snakeprint platforms by Terry de Havilland like these more than 40 years ago. Sadly, those days are gone. No one over 30 should attempt these now. At 6 in, they are impossible to walk in, though the colour is fabulous. I’d call these ankle breakers. Height: 6 in . Wearability: 3/10 . Clarks, £150 . Shoes: www.clarks.co.uk . Help! These look like dumb-bells stuck to my feet. They are out of proportion with my legs. I look absurd. Not even wearing these shoes with a delicate dress saves them. No thank you. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 0/10 . Next, £35 . Shoes: www.next.co.uk . These work because the straps are thin and dainty and the heel is not a thick wedge. They would jazz up a tailored suit or little black dress perfectly. I’d buy them in a heartbeat. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 9/10 . Russell & Bromley, £125 . Shoes: www.russellandbromley.co.uk . These are reminiscent of my Seventies ‘peace, love and brown rice’ days. The clog style is not sophisticated enough for a lady in her 60s. I clumped about as though walking on stilts. Height: 5 in .

"Tens of thousands of curious visitors have crowded historic Mont Saint-Michel and other beauty spots along the French coastline with the promise of a ‘tide of the century’, but it may not have lived up to everyone's expectations. Anticipating a wall of water that could equal the height of a four-storey building, tourists and locals staked out positions around the picturesque landmark last night and again today, including the partially-washed out causeway as the tide retreated. They travelled to France’s northern coast for the first giant tide of the millennium, with experts predicting that it could reach as high as 46ft - 18ft above normal - thanks to the effects from yesterday’s spectacular solar eclipse. Scroll down for video . Tens of thousands of people are visiting the Atlantic coastline in France, including Mont Saint-Michel, for the 'supertide' Tidal specialist Nicolas Pouvreau told French media that the surge was a few inches short of expectations . French officials said the supertide would be a major opportunity for tourism in Brittany, including the walled port city of Saint-Malo . Large waves crash over the crowded waterfront - leaving spectators soaking wet - during the incoming tide in Saint-Malo, France . But tidal specialist Nicolas Pouvreau told France 24 the surge was a few inches short of expectations. Mont Saint-Michel was briefly turned into an island at high tide, but low tide provided an opportunity for people to walk on the expansive flat seabed. Although it is dubbed the ‘tide of the century’, the ‘supertide’ phenomenon occurs once every 18 years when a rare alignment of the sun, moon and Earth create a massive gravitational pull on the sea. On each occasion, Mont Saint-Michel provides a stunning setting for those looking to watch the phenomenon.

Experts said the last 'tide of the century' occurred on March 10, 1997 and people will have to wait until March 2033 for the next one . This morning's high tide was close to peak levels as the sea rushed in from over eight miles out, but calm weather diminished the risk of flooding and let down some of the visitors who travelled from afar. Tourist Jean-Bernard Delamarche, who visited Saint-Malo, said: 'For the ""tide of the century"" I am a bit disappointed. We came one year, we were staying at the hotel Ibis and we could not get out of the hotel because the street was flooded. But it's true that it is impressive.' US student Noah Feingold added: 'It's almost more spectacular at low tide in the end because you will be able to walk kilometres and see some little secret beaches that will only be revealed at this moment.' High tides triggered by the eclipse saw water flooding over the banks of the River Thames today as alerts remained in place for parts of the UK. The Thames Barrier has closed for the 175th time today in its 30 year lifespan, the first operational closure of 2015 and the first of the 2014 to 2015 winter season. As the moment of high tide approached, the river flooded on to the path in Barrier Gardens. Flood alerts were also issued for parts of Teddington and Twickenham. High tides were reported in Greenwich, Putney Embankment, Chiswick Mall and Strand-on-the Green in Chiswick. The ‘supertide’ phenomenon occurs once every 18 years when a rare alignment of the sun, moon and Earth create a massive gravitational pull on the sea.

"Islamic State is clamping down on Caesarean operations in the latest attack on what it perceives to be decadent Western practices. Doctors working for ISIS have been ordered to charge 15,000 Syrian pounds for a Caesarean childbirth operation, the equivalent of two months salary for the average Syrian worker. Under the harsh new rules enforced by the terror group, doctors who carry out the operations without charging the fee will now face unspecified punishments. The Islamic State order stipulates that the new charges are aimed at deterring hospitals from carrying out routine Caesareans. Jihadi brides like these, posing with a BMW in Syria, won't be allowed a Caesarean operation if they need one to give birth unless they can afford 15,000 Syrian pounds - two months salary for the average worker . A surgical team performing a Caesarean. Some clerics consider the procedure too Western and decadent . But the high fees will force women who can't afford the operations to endure painful childbirth. A written order published in the northern Syrian province of Deir az-Zor states: 'in order to assist the believers from the sons of Islam who are working in the medical corps to support their brothers from the poor and others besides them from the Muslim populace, and with the desire to keep the course of medical work removed from arbitrary whim.' It adds: 'This is to be considered as tantamount to a written order and all who contravene it will be held accountable in the Dar al-Qaḍa [IS judiciary] with attendant consequence.' There is growing opposition among Islamic clerics to Western trends in gynaecology developments and in particular to mothers who wish to have a pain-free childbirth sometimes referred to as 'too posh to push'. One scholar has recently claimed that the rise in Caesarean operations in the Middle East is part of a plot against Muslim mothers. The wives of ISIS fighters like these will struggle to get pregnant again if they have a Caesarean, according to one cleric who calls the procedure a 'plot against Muslims' Sheikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al Uthaymeen has ruled that Muslim mothers shouldn't need any decadent pain-relieving assistance in the delivery of their babies. In his ruling published on an Islamic website he says: 'I would like to take this opportunity to point out a phenomenon that has been mentioned to us, which is that many obstetricians, male and female, in the hospitals are too keen for birth to take place by surgical means, which is known as a Caesarean. 'I am afraid that this may be a plot against the Muslims, because the more births take place in this manner, the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman, and she becomes unable to get pregnant.' He adds: 'Some of the people who work in private hospitals have told me that many women come to the hospitals and their specialists tell them that there is no alternative to a Caesarean, then they go to this private hospital and give birth naturally.' ISIS is trying to build a modern health service, reportedly with help from these nine British medical students who have apparently travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas . Leaders of the Islamic State have tried to build a modern health service and have appealed to doctors from all over the world to travel to Syria and Iraq to join their medical teams. Earlier this year the Islamic State announced the opening of the Faculty of Medicine in Raqqa, in northern Syria, where doctors are trained in just three years. IS took control of Raqqa more than one year ago, to become one of the group's main strongholds in the region, imposing a so-called 'Islamic curriculum' on educational facilities in the city. Many Western jihadists have based themselves in this part of the region. Last week it was reported that nine British medical students travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Four women and five men entered the country, keeping their plans secret from relatives until shortly before they crossed the border from Turkey.","Doctors ordered to charge 15,000 Syrian pounds for childbirth operation .

"He was sacked for punching a junior TV producer after not getting a hot dinner. And judging by the extensive list of backstage luxuries demanded by Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear Live co presenters, it seems a miracle he hadn’t previously lashed out. The three-page catalogue was revealed after BBC producer Oisin Tymon, who felt Clarkson’s wrath, said he did not want to press charges. Scroll down for video . Very specific requests include over 20 bottles of wine, such as Veuve Clicquot Champagne, Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc. Also required is Chateau Leoube rosé or equivalent which – at Clarkson’s insistence - must be ‘pale DRY… preferably southern France.’ In case that runs out, they ask for two dozen bottles of Peroni beer, Bombay Sapphire gin plus tonic, ice and lemon, all chilled in a fridge or cooler cabinet with at least four shelves. Their drinks must be served on linen covered tables, while a sofa must be provided with ‘enough room to seat six people, one of whom is 6ft 3in and likes to lie down’. The stars also insist on a Nespresso coffee machine with a milk frothing gadget, balsamic vinegar, Dove deodorant, hair wax, ‘nice rubbish bins’ and a coat stand – ‘NOT a rail!’ In all, there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May use to relax in during breaks from hosting the Top Gear Live events, which take place at arenas in the UK and abroad, and are separate from the BBC TV show. The rooms – often the size of a hotel suite – must be fitted with a rug if there are no carpets, soft lighting, a TV with good speaker system and Sky Sports and movies, an array of films on DVD and green plants - ideally bamboo. Smoker Clarkson insists on a carton of Marlboro Lights and as well as packets of Camels and Marlboro Menthol Lights. In all, there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May use to relax in during breaks from hosting the Top Gear Live events . And in a move which might have pre-empted the attack that ended Clarkson’s BBC career, the list also insists the green room must be located near a McDonald’s, stating: ‘THEY WILL ASK FOR THIS’. A source from Top Gear Live told the Mail: ‘All three presenters have their eclectic tastes and they certainly know what they want. ‘Jeremy is very into his rosé and very particular about getting exactly the right type of wine. ‘He also likes to be driven around in a Range Rover during these events. ‘It’s fair to say he can be a little bit of a Prima Donna at times.’ Clarkson is alleged to have been drinking Rose for three hours before he hit TV producer Oisin Tymon, who had told him that he wasn’t able to have steak and chips at Simonstone Hall in North Yorkshire following a day’s filming. Two planned Top Gear Live events for this weekend in Norway were postponed after the 54-year-old presenter was suspended and later fired over the fracas. Details of the stars’ demands come from a ‘green room rider’ list from 29 November 2014 – the date of the last Top Gear Live event in the Norwegian capital Oslo. Soft drinks on the list included 12 small bottles of ginger beer, a selection of Cokes and Red Bull, and still and sparkling bottled water. Food includes ‘lunch and evening meals and hot snacks, eg pies, jacket potatoes, pasta and prawn cocktail.’ Greek, chicken Caesar and Nicoise salads are requested as a ‘healthy option’ along with a daily fruit bowl. But there are also demands for sweets including jelly babies and minstrels and cheese and cracker boards. Marmite, honey, jam, peanut butter, HP Sauce, salt crackers and a bottle of balsamic vinegar are also listed. There is no direct mention of steak, but steak knives are included on the list. The rider states that trestle tables are expected ‘for the presentation of food and drink’ and ‘table linen for all tables not in good condition!’ Very specific requests from Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond include over 20 bottles of wine, such as Veuve Clicquot Champagne, Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc . The room also has to include a Sky TV connection or way to access live sports and films, Apple TV or Netflix and a selection of DVDs including James Bond films, Blood Diamond and motorbike movie Closer to the Edge. Other movies required on DVD include Hangover Part 3, Miami Vice and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It also lists a Playstation 3 with two controllers plus the Call of Duty game. The source added: ‘Some of the items are brought over by his team from venue to venue around the globe but others they get people on the ground to buy ready for their arrival. ‘They don’t always need everything or eat and drink everything on the list, but they like to have them there just in case.’ The green rooms vary in size depending on the venue, but are often the equivalent of a hotel suite. During most Top Gear Live events the presenters – and anyone they invite to join them – spend a few hours in the room during rehearsals on Friday and before and after shows on Saturday and Sundays. They usually stay in hotels or private houses overnight. The rider was put together by PR firm R:evolution Communications and Events, which worked on the Top Gear Live shows. One of the firm’s directors, Emma Stonier, was unavailable for comment, while another, Rebecca Banks, declined to answer questions at her Oxfordshire home when she was shown the document. But a former business associate of the pair, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘I know there were lists like this for Top Gear with very specific requests. It sounds about right.’ Oisin Tymon’s solicitor, Paul Daniels, indicated the producer wanted to draw a line under the affair. Mr Daniels said: ‘Mr Tymon doesn’t want to press charges. The matter has taken a great toll on Oisin, his family and his friends. ‘Quite simply, Mr Tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the BBC he loves, as soon as possible.’","Backstage luxuries demanded by Jeremy Clarkson and his co-presenters at Top Gear Live shows revealed .

"It is one of the most expensive cancer the NHS treats, yet receives only a fraction of cancer research funding. Every year in the UK, 10,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer, and of that half will die from the disease. But experts are today rallying behind a new campaign Shout Out About Bladder Cancer, to raise awareness and vital funds to develop research. It comes as researchers at the University of Birmingham believe a new and simple test could help determine how aggressive a patient's disease is, allowing doctors to tailor individual treatment plans. The scientists, who estimate treating the disease currently costs the NHS £65 million a year, found being able to reliably identify those patients with the most aggressive cancers early after diagnosis 'significantly improved outcomes'. They identified two biomarkers in the urine which they believe can predict a patient's prognosis. A new campaign has been launched to raise public awareness of bladder cancer - the seventh most common cancer in the UK and the form of the disease that costs the NHS most to treat at £65 million a year . Three charities, Action On Bladder Cancer, Fight Bladder Cancer and The Urology Foundation are leading the campaign. It aims to raise funds to invest in bladder cancer research . Dr Douglas Ward, from the University of Birmingham, said: 'There is an urgent need for prognostic biomarkers that could guide patient management. 'If such a test could be delivered, in a non-invasive way, it could make treatment much more efficient and that can only be a good thing.' The Shout Out About Bladder Cancer campaign has been launched by three charities, Action On Bladder Cancer, Fight Bladder Cancer and The Urology Foundation. It aims to raise public awareness of the 'Cinderella disease', in a bid to prevent thousands of 'unnecessary' deaths each year. Louise de Winter, chief executive of The Urology Foundation (TUF), said: 'At TUF we became very aware that bladder cancer is the Cinderella disease which people shy away from talking about. 'We were receiving fewer applications for research into bladder cancer and wanted to make a push to encourage people to do more research into this area. 'By working together with the other charities we believe we can create more awareness of the disease and hopefully provide more funding for research.' 'Progress is being made but we need it to be made faster,' she added. Her colleague in the fight against bladder cancer, Andrew Winterbottom, founder of Fight Bladder Cancer, and a patient of the disease himself, warned that the chances of surviving the disease are 'getting worse'. Smoking is known to be the biggest cause of bladder cancer. The most common symptoms are blood in your wee, frequently needing a wee, recurring urinary infections and abdominal or back pain . There are two main types of bladder cancer. Non-invasive bladder cancer is where the disease develops only in the inner lining of the bladder. Meanwhile invasive bladder cancer is where the cancer has spread into the deeper walls of the bladder. Of more than 200 known cancers, bladder cancer ranks fifth most common in the western world. It is a disease that affects people regardless of age and sex, although it is recognised the chances of developing the disease increase as a person gets older. What causes bladder cancer? Smoking is by far the largest preventable cause of bladder cancer. Other causes include exposure to specific industrial chemicals and dyes, as well as diesel fumes. Studies have also suggested a hereditary link to bladder cancer. However, in almost half of cases experts still do not know what causes the disease. It is one of the reasons the Shout Out About Bladder Cancer campaign team are attempting to raise more money to fund more extensive research. Currently just 0.6 per cent of cancer research is spent on bladder cancer. The result is that treatments for the disease are much the same as they were 35 years ago. A spokesman for the campaign said: 'Quite simply, the current treatments are not very good at preventing recurrence or stopping the cancer spreading and becoming fatal. 'That is why it is still the most expensive cancer for the NHS to treat and it has the highest recurrence rate of any cancer.' The most common symptoms are: . Source: Shout Out About Bladder Cancer . He said: 'People affected by this cancer feel that they are being ignored. 'There have not been any new treatments for more than 30 years. 'Despite being such a common cancer, so few people have ever heard of it, let alone know the causes or symptoms. 'This needs to change which is why one main aim of the campaign is to get as  many people as possible to start talking about bladder cancer.' Consultant urologist, Hugh Mostafid, chair of Action on Bladder Cancer, added: 'I see every day the huge difference it can make to diagnose bladder cancer early, when its curable. 'Anything that raises public awareness of bladder cancer and therefore makes people seek help earlier is to be welcomed and if we raise money to support research into better treatment at the same time then all the better.' Their quest comes as colleagues at Birmingham University publish their study in the British Journal of Cancer. They hope their findings will prove a vital step forward, paving the way for improved care for every bladder cancer patient. The researchers identified two markers in urine, by analysing  specimens provided by volunteers. Two prognostic urinary biomarkers were identified - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a protein, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). The scientists concluded therefore that measuring the biomarkers, could 'represent a simple and useful approach for fast-tracking the investigation and treatment of patients with the most aggressive bladder cancers'. They said the tests could prove useful for both newly-diagnosed patients as well as existing patients, who suffer a recurrence of the disease. In addition, by identifying patients with less aggressive forms of the disease, it may allow for fewer visits to specialists, and even discharging patients from specialist care sooner than expected.

It comes as researchers at the University of Birmingham have identified two biomarkers in simple urine tests that could help doctors determine a patient's prognosis, therefore helping to develop tailored treatment plans. The higher the number of biomarkers, the more aggressive a patient's disease, pictured, is . Rik Bryan, from the University of Birmingham, said: 'These biomarkers alone cannot be used to diagnose bladder cancer, but there is immense value in being able to easily and independently indicate the prognosis of the disease in order to guide treatment and decide whether more or less aggressive management is required.' Around 10,000 patients are diagnosed with bladder cancer every year, of which around half will die . Last week the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) published new guidelines to ensure bladder cancer patients receive the same level of treatment regardless of where they live. While it is thought to be one of the most expensive cancers to treat for the NHS, there is a wide variation in treatments offered across the country. The guidelines state information given to people diagnosed with the disease should be tailored to every individual's needs. Professor Mark Baker, director of the Centre for Clinical Practice, said: 'Bladder cancer is in the top 10 most common cancers in the UK. 'There are a number of treatments available, but for some people a diagnosis is only made when they are admitted to hospital in an emergency - in these cases the outlook can be poor. 'Bladder cancer can have a profound impact on someone's psychological wellbeing as well as their physical health. 'Both the tumours and the treatments can affect bowel, bladder and sexual function. 'This guideline aims to give people all the information they need about bladder cancer, to help them to make better decisions about their care, and improve their quality of life during and after treatment.'

"Found dead: Charles Terreni Jr has been named as the USC frat brother who died this week . This is the 18-year-old University of South Carolina freshman found dead in his frat house - apparently after a St Patrick's Day party. Charles Terreni Jr was found dead at the Pi Kappa Alpha house in Columbia, not far from campus, around 10:30am on Wednesday, the morning after the alleged celebration. Circumstances leading up to his death are not clear, but the house was draped in St Patrick's decorations and a beer keg could be seen outside. Terreni was named on Friday as the frat brother who had died by by a coroner, according to Fox Carolina. His body reportedly had no obvious signs of injury - but toxicology tests which could shed more light on the death are yet to be completed. Neither the fraternity nor the university has explained the situation in detail. However, USC suspended the fraternity in the wake of the death. On Thursday, neighbors told the Fox affiliate that the house threw a party the night before, and noted the leftover keg Wednesday morning. 'I would say there are three houses there, and I don't know who exactly lives in them, but there's always a frequency of parties going on,' neighbor Mehrdad Vejdani said. 'At times, there can be a hundred people in that place. Live band in the backyard, which is fine. I mean, some noise, but it doesn't bother us too much.' Scroll down for video . Suspended: The Pi Kappa Alpha house at the University of South Carolina has been suspended, after a brother was found dead in a house Wednesday morning . Rager? Neighbors said the house had a party the night before, on St Patrick's Day. On Wednesday, several stray cups and a keg were seen on the porch, as well as clover decorations . The Columbia Police Department and Richland County Coroner's Office have both labeled the death 'suspicious'. Responding the Terreni's death, the fraternity's national office released a statement saying the USC chapter had been placed on leave pending the investigation. It said: 'The fraternity’s thoughts and prayers are with the family of this young man and the brothers of Xi Chapter'. A spokesman for USC added: 'There are a lot of rumors out there about the circumstances surrounding the death but at this point the matter remains under investigation.' 'While we await further information we are focused on helping our community grieve and heal.' This is the second incident at the fraternity in a week. Last Friday, the University of Connecticut chapter lost recognition for hazing members, providing alcohol to underage students and harassing women. Pi Kappa Alpha was founded in 1868 at the University of Virginia and has now grown to include some 220 groups across the U.S. and Canada. The house has been plagued by controversy before. In November 2012, a 19-year-old student at Northern Illinois University died after a night of heavy drinking. Five frat members were charged with felonies for hazing and the chapter was suspended indefinitely. That same year, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville chapter was suspended indefinitely when a 20-year-old member was hospitalized for reportedly ingesting wine through his anus.","Charles Terreni, 18, was found dead Wednesday at frat house in Columbia .

"'Devastating' head injuries: Austen Harrison, four, had been playing with a heavy fitting-room mirror . A four-year-old boy died from ‘devastating’ head injuries when an unstable shop mirror fell on him, an inquest heard today. Austen Harrison, of Turners Hill, West Sussex, was playing with a heavy fitting-room mirror while his father tried on a suit at a Hugo Boss shop when it toppled over and crushed him. He underwent an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain following the incident in Oxfordshire, but died four days later in hospital after life-support was switched off. An inquest into his death at Oxford Coroner's Court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall and that its free-standing position meant it could easily overbalance. Austen was with his parents, Simon and Irina Harrison, when the incident happened at the Bicester outlet village at around 8.30pm on June 4, 2013. Mrs Harrison and her son met Mr Harrison after he finished work and had dinner at a Carluccio's restaurant before going to the Hugo Boss store. In evidence read to the jury of seven men and two women by Darren Salter, the senior coroner for Oxfordshire, Mr Harrison said the shop was not busy when they arrived and that he tried on a number of suits and jackets while his wife and son wandered around. As he tried on various suits Austen came in to the changing area and began looking at himself in a large mirror and playing with its large winged sections, attached to the main mirror with hinges. Mr Harrison, a mechanical aerospace engineering consultant, said he moved the mirror's wings himself as he looked at a suit, moving them out to an angle of about 45 degrees. Accident scene: An inquest at Oxford Coroner's Court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall of the Hugo Boss store in Bicester (above) and that its free-standing position meant it could easily overbalance . Giving evidence: Simon Harrison (left, today), the boy's father, said the shop was not busy when they arrived and that he tried on a number of suits and jackets. Pictured (right) is a closed sign following the incident . He said: ‘I didn't have any concerns because I assumed they would be fixed to the wall. I couldn't think of any reason why such a large mirror wouldn't be fixed to the wall.’ But as he tried on another suit and walked to his wife to try on a tie, they heard an extremely loud bang, ‘as if something had fallen over’, and someone gasp. He said: ‘I instantly knew Austen was lying underneath it, as it was not lying flat on the floor.’ Mr Harrison went straight over and lifted the mirror from his son, who was lying motionless. He said: ‘He was lying face up with his legs straight out and his arms by his side.’ Treatment: Austen was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) in Oxford, where he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain . Mr Harrison carried his son into the main part of the shop, where an off-duty doctor assisted, but after he was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain. Doctors told the family Austen would not recover from the ‘irreversible’ brain damage. Life support was switched off and he died at 5.45am on June 8. In his statement, Mr Harrison told the inquest that while his son was in hospital he went back to the shop and told managers he was in a critical condition. Mr Harrison said he asked the manager if he had viewed the CCTV footage, and was told it showed Austen pulling the mirror off the wall. The inquest continues.

"Target: Charles Dickens was the victim of an attempted attack on his carriage  in 1862 . Charles Dickens is today venerated as one of England's greatest ever literary heroes - but he was not always treated with such respect. Newly rediscovered records reveal that at the height of his fame, the celebrated novelist was targeted by thugs who tried to overturn his carriage on his journey home. Dickens also had hay stolen from his home at Gad's Hill Place near Rochester in Kent, and complained about rubbish from the local pub being thrown into his garden. His struggles with the neighbours came to light in a series of newspaper cuttings from the British Newspaper Archive which have been unearthed by Bygone Kent magazine. The author moved into Gad's Hill in 1856, using the money he had earned from novels such as Oliver Twist, A Chrismas Carol and David Copperfield. He used to take the train from London to Higham, the nearest station to his home, before getting in a horse-drawn carriage to take him the rest of the way. But in June 1862, his regular route almost got him in trouble - as reported by local paper the South Eastern Gazette, which wrote about a 'diabolical attempt to overturn Mr C. Dickens' carriage' by farm worker James Stedman. Dickens was supposed to arrive at Higham at 10.30pm to be met by his groom, James Marsh, but he missed the train and the groom returned to Gad's Hill. The newspaper reported: 'A little distance on he found two rollers lying across the road, which, had they not been perceived in time, would have caused serious mischief. 'James Munn, a fellow workman of the prisoner, had accompanied Stedman from Strood to Higham by the 9.30, and when passing through the village saw Mr Dickens' carriage drive down to the station. 'The prisoner immediately afterwards went into a field and drew the two rollers across the road to upset the carriage on its return. Munn at the time held the gate open for the prisoner.' Transport: Dickens pictured in a horse-drawn carriage with his wife and daughters . Home: Dickens moved in to Gad's Hill Place, near Rochester in Kent, in 1856 . After the incident, Stedman sought refuge in a pub across the road from Dickens' home, where he played skittle - but was soon caught by the police. He was charged at Rochester Magistrates' Court with 'placing a horse-roller, and also a hand roller, on the middle of the turnpike road, at a late hour on Saturday night, with the intention of upsetting the carriage of Mr C. Dickens, which was returning from the Higham railway station'. Stedman pleaded drunkenness as his excuse, but a month later it emerged that he had done the same thing on a different road in a bid to overturn someone else's carriage, and he was sentenced to two months' hard labour. In 1859, George Blackman was jailed for three days after he stole hay from Dickens' home, which was one of the grandest in the area. Rubbish dumping was also a concern for Dickens, as in 1858 he was forced to write to a local pub landlord who continuously left his property a mess. Family: Dickens reads to his daughters in the grounds of the home, which he bought at the height of his fame . Dickens wrote: 'Mr Charles Dickens begs Mr Strood to be so good as to give directions that no rubbish or refuse from the Falstaff to be thrown into the shrubbery of Gad's Hill Place. 'Mr Dickens also hopes that Mr Strood will advise his customers not to trespass on that ground, in going from the Falstaff to the village. 'He wishes very earnestly to live on good terms with his neighbours of all degrees and he hopes that they know it, and will not fee disinclined to respect his property. 'He is sure that Mr Strood can have no desire not to do what is obliging and right, he therefore addresses this note to Mr Strood in good will and good humour.' Station: The railway station at Higham, near Gad's Hill, where Dickens would get the train from London . Trouble: Dickens wrote a letter to the landlord of the Falstaff pub complaining about litter . It was reported on another occasion that Dickens was forced to add a padlock to his cellar after locals broke in and stole champagne for a party. The author died at Gad's Hill in 1870, at the age of 58. The home is now a private school. Andrew Rootes, editor of Bygone Kent, said: 'I was brought up in the village of Higham, near where Dickens lived, and have always been an admirer, so was delighted to alight upon this incident tucked away in the British Newspaper Archive. 'Stedman was a fairly hopeless type of criminal, nowhere as impressive as the list of malefactors in Dickens's novels, but worthy of a minor role.'","The great novelist was the subject of an attempted highway robbery in 1862 when a criminal tried to overturn his carriage .

"The group who got into a deadly gunfight with police in a Cottonwood, Arizona Walmart parking lot on Saturday have been identified as the eight members of a Christian family street band from Idaho. The Gaver family had allegedly been camping out in the parking lot for a few days when they had a confrontation with police which resulted in the death of Enoch Gaver. Ten-year Cottonwood Police veteran Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31, and suspect David Gaver were also shot in the attack and hospitalized. Meanwhile, the remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: The suspects who engaged in a shootout with police in a Cottonwood, Arizona Walmart parking lot on Saturday have been identified as eight members of a Idaho family band. Above, two of the suspects, currently jailed: Jeremiah Gaver, 28 (left), and Nathaniel Gaver, 27 (right) Fighting cops: Police say the shootout was sparked by one of the Gavers pushing a Walmart store employee while trying to use the building's restroom. Above, suspects Ruth and Peter Gaver, 52 and 55 . Fatal: One member of the Gaver family was killed in the shootout, now identified as Enoch Gaver. When police arrived on the scene, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to the Arizona DPS . On duty: Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 (pictured), was shot in the leg during the attack but is expected to make a full recovery. One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen and remains hospitalized . The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked Saturday when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. DPS spokesman Bart Graves says when the police arrived, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to AZ Central. Witness Louie Solano told KPHO that the fight 'looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot'. 'Lots of screams. Just screeching noise, like unreal, unreal,' Solano said. 'During the course of the fight, we believe there was a struggle for the officer's gun,' Graves said. That's when three shots were fired, though it's not clear who had the gun at that point. The shots killed Enoch Gaver and injured relative David Gaver and Sgt Jeremy Daniels. Sgt Daniels was shot in the leg, while David Gaver was hit in the abdomen. A Walmart employee who came to the aid of police suffered a sprained arm and cuts in the fight. Other officers were treated for lacerations, bruises and a twisted ankle. Musical team: The Gavers were allegedly part of a band called Matthew 24 Now, which sometimes played outside a grocery store in Boise, Idaho. Above, a picture of the band from their Facebook page. Matthew 24 is a Bible verse dealing with the end of times . As of Tuesday, David Gaver was still hospitalized but once he is released he will be taken to jail to join four of his adult relatives. Jeremiah Gaver, 28, is currently jailed under suspicion of aggravated assault, Peter Gaver, 55, for hindering prosecution and resisting arrest, Nathaniel Gaver, 27, for assault on a law-enforcement officer and Ruth Gaver, 52 for the same charge. A boy and girl from the Gaver family are currently being held at the Prescott Juvenile Detention facility. Their identities have not been released. Dwight D'Evelyn of the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office says the Gavers are being held on bonds ranging from $25,000 to $75,000. Injuries: A Walmart store employee and other police officers were also injured in the incident, including lacerations and some broken bones . The Gavers are due in court for their first hearing on March 31. Graves says the family have not been cooperating with the DPS investigation. According to Facebook, the family is part of a band called 'Matthew 24 Now' (they are also go by 'Busking in the Son' back in Idaho). The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. In a message on the Facebook page, the family writes: 'We won't do any events where there's gonna be illegal drugs. Or any form of promiscuity.' A local Idaho station reported that the family sometimes played music outside an Albertson's grocery store in Boise.","Eight members of the Gaver family engaged in a shootout with police in a Cottonwood, Arizona Walmart parking lot on Saturday .

"A retired police officer stopped and held a man at gunpoint after witnessing him pull a knife on another man in Salt Lake City. The former officer, who gave his name only known as 'Nick', believed he was breaking up a serious fight, however it turned out the man with the knife had his bike stolen, and was trying to threaten the thug that had stolen it. Not knowing this, Nick pulled over and produced his weapon. 'I told him to lay down on the ground and he stayed there,' he told Fox 13 News. Scene: The retired officer, Nick (right), was driving by when he saw his man (left) threatening another with a knife, so he decided to produce his own gun . 911: While holding the suspect at gunpoint, Nick was able to call police and tell them the address . Back-up: Police arrived at the scene around two minutes after Nick called, and took over the situation . While some people stopped after seeing what was happening, Nick said no one helped him. Some started filming the scene, and one witness can be heard telling Nick to stop. 'He's not going to do nothing put the gun down, he's not going to do nothing, put the gun down,' the witness can be heard saying in the video. The witness added: 'At this point an accident could happen, he's on the floor, there's a bunch of us out here, there's no need for you to be pointing a gun to a man's back whose face is on the floor.' However Nick maintains he handled the situation correctly. 'It could have turned out ugly if I didn't have experience or I didn't have the training,' Nick said. 'Nobody called 911, nobody reported it, they are all worried about getting video so they could be famous or whatever they are.' Retired: Nick, a former police officer, said he was surprised that no one that stopped at the scene did not help him, even by calling 911 . At one point the suspect pleaded for his life. 'Don't shoot me,' the suspect is heard saying in the video, Fox 13 reported. 'I'm not gonna,' Nick is heard saying in response. 'You are too, get that gun off me,' the suspect added. Nick had the gun on the man for about two minutes before a police car arrived. It is unclear why the suspect was armed with a knife in the first place, however he told police that his bike had been stolen and he was trying to get it back. The suspect declined to press charges again Nick. Salt Lake City police recommended civilians avoid getting involved in altercations. They said being a good witness is calling police.","Nick, a retired police officer, was driving in Salt Lake City on March 17 .

"Marine Le Pen's hopes of becoming President of France suffered a huge blow tonight as her National Front was beaten into joint second place in regional elections. The far-right party was predicted to make massive gains, but early exit polls put Nicolas Sarkozy's conservatives out in front. It is a huge boost for the 60-year-old former President who - despite facing a string of corruption charges - is convinced he can become head of state again in 2017. Scroll down for video . Marine Le Pen gives a press conference after her hopes of becoming president of France suffered a huge blow in today's local elections . Guargaule's Mayor Charles Antoine Casanova counts votes during the first round of the French departments elections in Corsica . Election officials in Saint-Sebastien-sur-Loire count votes for the country's departments, or administrative regions . By 8pm, an hour after the last vote was cast, Ipsos put an alliance between Mr Sarkozy's UMP and the centrist UDI on 33 per cent, while the National Front (FN) was on 23.5 per cent, along with the ruling Socialists on the same figure. The figures made a mockery of Ms Le Pen's claims that her fiercely anti-immigration and anti-Europe party could mount a serious challenge for power. 'We'll get stuck into the regions and then we're off to invade the Elysee Palace,' the 46-year-old had said before the vote. At stake were 101 departments - or administrative regions - and 4,100 regional government seats. Ms Le Pen was certain that she could do better than the opposition conservatives and the ruling Socialists, who are performing appallingly because of the hapless government of President Francois Hollande. Ms Le Pen had positioned the National Front (FN) away from its overtly racist and anti-Semitic roots, and won 25 per cent of the vote at local and European elections last year. Sarkozy immediately ruled out any alliances between his party and FN candidates in next Sunday's second round. 'To those who voted National Front, we understand your frustrations,' the UMP chairman told supporters at party headquarters. 'But this party will not solve France's problems - it will only make them worse,' added the ex-president, who came out of retirement last year and hopes to secure the 2017 presidential ticket for his bitterly divided party in primaries next year. Manuel Valls, the Socialist Prime Minister, has also attacked the FN, claiming it is a huge danger to France. Conservative leader Nicolas Sarkozy delivers a speech after his party came first in the local body elections . 'I fear for my country, I fear it will split apart when confronted with the National Front. Its policies would be a disaster for the country,' said Mr Valls. 'Do you think a National Front scoring twenty five per cent in European elections, perhaps thirty per cent in local elections, and so on, cannot win the presidential election?' he asked. While the vote means she can no longer argue the FN is France's most popular party, Le Pen said the result was still a gain for a party almost totally absent from the departements at present, and a slap for Hollande's Prime Minister Manuel Valls. 'Manuel Valls must now hear the message of voters and have the decency to hand in his resignation to the president,' she told supporters of the centrist reformer, who Hollande already said will remain in post whatever the final vote outcome. Although Ms Le Pen was always unlikely to become president in 2017, it was thought she could come runner up, as her father Jean Marie Le Pen did in 2002. Le Pen senior's limited victory sent shockwaves round the world, even though he eventually lost to Jacques Chirac. French president Francois Hollande casts his vote in the elections for local councils across France . Hollande today acknowledged that the key issues of the elections would be abstention 'and the score of the National Front' Today, FN candidates were fielded in 1,909 out of a total of 2,054 constituencies for the first round of voting. The second round is next Sunday. For the first time, candidates appeared on ballots in pairs - one male, one female - to ensure that 50 percent of council members will be women. Those that voted today was estimated at just under 43 per cent of all those eligible - a figure which is up almost six points from the cantonal elections of 2011. The green vote also seemed to have collapsed in today's poll, with the environmentalists receiving just two per cent of the national poll, according to the Ipsos poll. Mr Sarkozy had a single term as president, between 2007 and 2012, but was defeated by Mr Hollande's Socialist Party. Within a week of Mr Sarkozy leaving office, the Paris home he shared with his third wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni, was raided by anti-corruption officers. Mr Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing, but is still facing a number of enquiries, including one into allegations that he received millions in illegal cash from the late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

"The Justice Department has indicted a former Ole Miss student on civil rights charges after he allegedly hung a noose on a statue of his university's first black student. Graeme Phillip Harris, 20, of Alpharetta, Georgia, has been indicted on one count of conspiracy to violate civil rights and one count of using a threat of force to intimidate African-American students. The indictment is connected to a February 2014 incident in which a noose and a former Georgia flag, prominently featuring the Confederate battle emblem, were placed on a statue of James Meredith. Scroll down for video . Graeme Phillip Harris, 20, of Alpharetta, Georgia, was indicted on  civil rights charges after allegedly putting a noose and Confederate symbols on a state of the first black student to go to Ole Miss . The student faces up to 11 years in prison for conspiracy to violate civil rights and using a threat of force to intimidate African-American students. He has reportedly transferred to a new school in Georgia . Harris, who is white, was an Ole Miss student when the noose was left on the statue. It wasn't immediately clear whether Harris had an attorney to contact for comment on his behalf. University spokesman Danny Blanton said Friday that Harris is no longer enrolled and that university officials turned the case over to federal prosecutors and deferred to their judgment.. Harris has transferred to University of North Georgia – Oconee Campus, according to the Daily Mississippian. He is free on bond, though his movement is restricted to areas of Georgia and Mississippi. James Meredith, who integrated the University of Mississippi under federal protection a half-century ago, says it's a shame that state authorities deferred to the federal government to bring charges. Mr Meredith, who is 81 and lives in Jackson, said state authorities should have pursed charges. 'What it is saying is that the only possible justice for a black in the state of Mississippi is the federal government and if there's anything that we don't need it's that being our only means of expecting justice,' Mr Meredith said in a phone interview Friday. 'I think Mississippi is better than that. If it's not better than that, it should be made better than that.' The Lafayette County district attorney said in 2014 that state charges wouldn't be filed because no state laws were broken. Mississippi's hate crime law requires an underlying crime for additional charges. Because the statute wasn't marred or broken, prosecutors said typical vandalism charges didn't apply. James Meredith (statue of him in center during anti-racism demonstration) said that state authorities should have filed charges rather than only the Justice Department . Mr Meredith (center) was the first black student to attend Ole Miss in 1962 but has said that the statue of him erected in 2006 should be taken down . The punishment for conspiracy to violate civil rights ranges to up to ten years in prison. Threat of force to intimidate is punishable by up to one year in prison. In 1962, anti-integration protests erupted into violence and Meredith had to be escorted by armed federal agents as he enrolled under court order as the first black student at the university. In announcing the indictment of Harris on Friday, Attorney General Eric Holder said of the noose incident:  'This shameful and ignorant act is an insult to all Americans and a violation of our most strongly-held values. 'No one should ever be made to feel threatened or intimidated because of what they look like or who they are,' Holder said in a news release. 'By taking appropriate action to hold wrongdoers accountable, the Department of Justice is sending a clear message that flagrant infringements of our historic civil rights will not go unnoticed or unpunished.' Hundreds of Ole Miss students attended a racial reconciliation rally on campus after the 2014 incident. The federal authorities' investigation into the incident, which involved two other freshmen students, is ongoing . The university, which replaced its Confederate officer mascot with a bear (pictured) in 2010, has had a string of racism-related incidents, including a protest on Barack Obama's reelection night with racist epithets . 'It has taken time, but the process has worked and I'm confident justice will be done,' Ole Miss Chancellor Dan Jones said in a statement Friday. 'I am thankful for the strong, united response of our university community to the desecration of the James Meredith statue last year, confirming our university values of civility and respect.' The national office of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity suspended its Ole Miss chapter after three of the chapter's members were accused of leaving the noose and flag on the Meredith statue. Names of the three white freshmen students from Georgia were not released at the time. Federal authorities' investigation into the incident is still ongoing. The recent indictment against Harris comes as another fraternity chapter, Sigma Alphia Epsilon at University of Oklahoma, was suspended after a video showed them singing a racist song about lynching on a bus. Members of the organization were found to have learned the chant informally at a national leadership cruise. Hundreds of students at Ole Miss attended a racial reconciliation rally after the incident at the beginning of last year . Mr Meredith said that his statue had been used as 'a public relations tool for the powers that be at Ole Miss,' which has continued to see racism (file photo, 2012) Other fraternities are currently being investigated for allegedly racist behavior. The Meredith statue was erected in 2006 near the main administrative building at Ole Miss, the Lyceum. In a 2012 autobiography, Mr Meredith said the university should destroy the statue because he said it trivialized his effort to destroy a system of white supremacy that had long dominated Mississippi, his native state. 'I have become a piece of art, a tourist attraction, a soothing image on the civil rights tour of the South, a public relations tool for the powers that be at Ole Miss, and feel-good icon of brotherly love and racial reconciliation, frozen in gentle docility,' Mr Meredith wrote. The university banned Confederate battle flags from football games in 2003 and changed its mascot, Confederate Colonel Reb, for a black bear in 2010. White students at Ole Miss in 2012 started a protest the night of President Barack Obama's reelection in which they burned his signs and racial epithets were heard being shouted.","Former student Graeme Phillip Harris indicted on civil rights charge .

"You can normally find him asleep in his basket under the vaulted splendour of his home, or washing his whiskers in the altar font. From time to time he will strut haughtily past a congregation at prayer, patrolling his territory on the lookout for mice. Louis the cat is so popular with folk at Wells Cathedral – home to the Bishop of Bath and Wells – that he has become the feline hero of a children's book, and even has his own merchandise stall in the cathedral shop. Louis the cat is often found sleeping by his favourite radiator in Wells cathedral in Somerset . Louis, the 17-year-old Wells cathedral cat, sits in his basket at the gift shop - but local owners have accused him of turning nasty and attacking dogs 'like a wild lion' The popular cat has been linked to at least three dogfights recently and locals fear there could be more . But yesterday the 17-year-old ginger tom's money-spinning empire was in danger of crumbling after he was accused of turning nasty – and attacking dogs 'like a wild lion'. He has been linked to at least three fights with dogs in recent weeks and locals fear there could be more. As news of the scandal spread, however, a 'Fans of Louis' group sprang to the moggy's defence. And cathedral staff suggested he could be a victim of mistaken identity, quickly issuing a statement which claimed there were 'at least two other ginger cats in the area who also enjoy strolling through the streets of Wells'. Louis became a regular sight at the cathedral after it adopted him as a stray ten years ago. His principal role was to rid the 12th century building of mice. Such was the esteem in which the rather solitary cat was held, the cathedral generated a regular fund-raising trade in Louis fridge magnets, pencils, mugs and other Louis-related trinkets, including an £8.99 paperweight and a £5.99 candle-snuffer. He would later star in a YouTube video narrated affectionately by the head verger. Louis is so popular in Wells that he has become the subject of a children's book, Louis the Cathedral Cat . But out there on the mean streets, it is alleged, he became a dangerous, feral beast. 'He pounced like a wild lion in the jungle on to my dog Millie's head,' said Mandie Stone-Outten, describing his alleged attack on her springer spaniel outside the Present Company gift shop in the nearby Market Place. 'We were just looking in the window of the shop and the cat was sitting outside. He walked towards us. He was staring at the dog, the dog was staring at the cat. 'Then suddenly, so quickly, it was attacking my dog's head. He turned into a cat about four times the size and he was waving his arms around. 'I tried to pull the lead back, but I went flying back and fell off the pavement into the gully. It had been raining and I was covered in mud. It hurt all down my right side, it was so painful. 'A couple of people told me it was Louis the cathedral cat and that he was semi-feral and he did sometimes go a bit crazy.' The 48-year-old, from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, added: 'I went back with my son and his girlfriend a couple of days later. We went into the cathedral and I saw the cat asleep in a basket sitting behind the till. 'We started stroking it and it was just like a little teddy bear. I couldn't believe that it was the same cat. 'That cat has serious issues. Be aware – this ball of fluff is not as cute and cuddly as he looks.' Louis quickly became a regular sight at the cathedral after it adopted him as a stray ten years ago . The Cathedral staff believe he is a victim of mistaken identity and is being unjustly persecuted . Debbie Sheppard, who works in the Present Company shop, overheard the commotion. 'The next thing I heard was this hissing,' she said. 'When I looked outside, Louis was walking up the street looking very subdued.' But she added: 'He's a very sweet cat and I certainly don't think he's suddenly turned nasty.' Attack number two also put Louis in the frame. Zoe Heath described how her brother's dog was set upon by a big ginger cat at the cathedral's magnificent west front, part of Louis's regular domain. 'His dog nearly lost an eye,' she said. 'We all assumed it was Louis.' The cathedral cat can regularly be spotted snoozing next to the radiator in Wells cathedral, Somerset . Attack number three is said to have been witnessed by town crier Len Sweales, although details remain inconclusive. Zoe said: 'He told me that Louis has a lookalike and he thinks it was the other ginger who would have launched the attack.' So does Louis have a Jekyll and Hyde personality? Or are there truly doppelganger moggies prowling the streets? Supporters said the cat had never shown any aggressive tendencies and was 'sweet natured if somewhat aloof'. One 'Fans of Louis' member, who has known the cat for five years, wrote of the attack allegations: 'For an old guy who spends most of his day sound asleep in a basket in the cathedral shop, it must have taken an event of magnitude to have caused such a reaction. Be honoured – we may not see such an event again in our lifetime.' The 17-year-old can normally be found fast asleep in a basket in the gift shop at Wells cathedral .","Louis the cat likes to sleep in a basket in the Wells cathedral gift shop .

Members of the public saluted the casket, which was covered in a flag, and shouted 'Lee Kuan Yew' Public warning sirens sounded across the country to mark a minute's silence, with buses and trains coming to a halt. Booms from a 21-gun salute reverberated around the city's business district as four F-16 fighter jets from the Black Knights aerobatic team flew overhead in a 'missing man' formation. The salute is normally reserved for sitting heads of state but an exception was made for Lee. Two navy ships near the marina also made an 'L' 'K' 'Y' signal with their flags. Singaporeans, many dressed in the mourning colours of black and white, waited for hours to watch the procession, shouting 'Lee Kuan Yew' as it passed. Others simply wept or threw flowers. Huang Jiancong was standing at the start of the route carrying a Singapore flag. Lee, who died aged 91 on Monday, was Singapore's first prime minister and is credited with transforming the country from a small, colonial British trading port into one of the world's wealthiest city states . His body was transferred atop a gun carriage and was followed by multiple vans, vehicles and motorbikes . Grieving residents even sat on the wet floor under umbrellas as they waited for the casket to pass them . Commercial activity in the country slowed for the ceremony as police tried to keep people off the roads . The 54-year-old said: 'His biggest achievement was to help elevate living standards.' Jennie Yeo, a teacher who arrived at 7am, said: 'He did everything for us Singaporeans regardless of race, language or religion. 'Education, housing, everything you can think of, he’s taken care of for us.' Singapore now has one of the world’s highest GDP per capita incomes at $56,284 (£37,839) in 2014, up from a mere $516 (£346) when it gained independence. Ninety per cent of Singaporeans own their homes, thanks to a public housing scheme launched by Lee, and the country enjoys one of the world’s lowest crime rates. Lee's influence on the international stage  was reflected in the funeral's turnout of serving and former leaders from across the globe.

The casket was surrounded by beautiful flowers . Vice President Li Yuanchao represented China while ex-secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a close friend of Lee's, came for the United States alongside Clinton. Lee's death was less than five months before the city-state's 50th anniversary of independence. Almost 500,000 went to see Lee lying in state over the past four days, many queuing in the tropical sun for up to 10 hours to pay their final respects. More than a million people have visited condolence sites set up at community centres across the country. Commercial activity in the country  slowed for the ceremony, with many shops and the country's two large casinos closing. Screens along Orchard Road, the main shopping street, all showed the ceremony. Hundreds of officials in white and black uniforms also marched alongside the casket despite getting soaking wet . As booms from a 21-gun salute reverberated, fighter jets flew overhead in a 'missing man' formation and two navy ships near the marina made an 'L' 'K' 'Y' signal with their flags .

I hope Singapore will carry on without Mr Lee.' London-based author Salil Tripathi, who was a foreign correspondent in Singapore in the 1990s, said: 'His sharp intellect gave him the aura of an elder statesman, allowing his admirers at home and abroad to overlook more complicated facts about him, including how political opponents were treated.' The sombre mood extended beyond Singapore, with India and New Zealand also observing an official day of mourning on Sunday. Lee's body will be cremated in a private ceremony for his family later today.","Crowds of people waving flags braved heavy rain to see 15km procession .

"Change of heart: Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart wrote a piece this week, criticizing the labeling of Michael Brown as a symbol of the Black Lives Matter movement . When Michael Brown was shot in the St Louis, Missouri suburb of Ferguson last summer, like many other African-Americans, Jonathan Capehart was incensed by the seemingly senseless death of another young black teen. But in a new column for the Washington Post, Capehart says he no longer believes Brown is an appropriate symbol for the renewed civil rights movement in the U.S. and that white police officer Darren Wilson was justified in the shooting. When Brown was shot dead on August 9, 2014, early reports said he was holding his hands in the air, surrendering, and asking  Wilson not to shoot. In the mass outrage that swept through the predominantly-black community following his death, many used 'hands up, don't shoot' as a rallying cry. Capehart says the release of federal investigations into the shooting, and the Ferguson Police Department in general, this month have forced him to re-evaluate Brown as a victim. The investigation revealed that Brown had not in fact had his arms up when he was shot, based on witness testimonies and autopsy results. That story line mainly stems from Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, who was walking with him the day he was shot. In his interview with the press, Johnson's details of the shooting continued to change. 'The DOJ report notes on page 44 that Johnson “made multiple statements to the media immediately following the incident that spawned the popular narrative that Wilson shot Brown execution-style as he held up his hands in surrender"" 'In one of those interviews, Johnson said that Brown was shot in the back by Wilson. It was then that Johnson said Brown stopped, turned around with his hands up and said, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!” And, like that, “hands up, don’t shoot” became the mantra of a movement. 'But it was wrong, built on a lie,' Capehart wrote. New evidence: Capehart said the new federal investigation results show that white police officer Darren Wilson (right) was justified in killing Brown (left) 'Based on a lie': In the aftermath of the shooting, Brown's friend and witness Dorian Johnson (center), said his hands were up in surrender when he was shot. But those statements were refuted in the official investigation, which reported that Brown was running towards Wilson when he was shot . Based on the investigation's damning results, Capehart says Brown is now an 'inappropriate symbol' for the Black Lives Matter movement. However, he says that the new information should not 'diminish the importance of the real issues' sparked by his death. In fact, Capehart said, the investigation into the Ferguson Police Department showed law enforcement in the community had been blatantly 'trampling' on the constitutional rights of residents who are mostly African American, which explains why the community 'exploded the moment Brown was killed.' Capehart said it's 'imperative that we continue marching for and giving voice to those killed in racially charged incidents at the hands of police and others.' Real issues: Capehart says that though Brown in an 'inappropriate symbol' of the Black Lives Matter movement, it shouldn't distract from the the very real issues that were sparked by his death . 'But we must never allow ourselves to march under the banner of a false narrative on behalf of someone who would otherwise offend our sense of right and wrong. And when we discover that we have, we must acknowledge it, admit our error and keep on marching. That’s what I’ve done here,' Capehart said. In the aftermath of the column, Capehart elicited a slew of negative comments from readers on Twitter, but he was also lauded by others for his bravery in reversing his opinion on the Ferguson shooting. Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly said on her show that she supported the column and Capehart for being 'brave enough to admit he was wrong'. On Twitter,Capehart described the column as 'the hardest piece I've ever had to write'.","Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart says new evidence shows Darren Wilson was justified in shooting Michael Brown .

"Fraud: Katie Ringer set up an account on an online fundraising page to ask members of the public to put money towards her fictional child's funeral . A 'wicked' internet troll who invented sob stories about a dead daughter to steal thousands of pounds in donations has been jailed for three years. Katie Ringer set up a fake account on an online fundraising page to ask kind-hearted members of the public to put money towards the fictional child's funeral costs. The 19-year-old, who carried out the fraud from her parents' home in Shoeburyness, Essex, also abused a number of victims over the internet, sending them 'vile' photos of dead relatives. Ringer, who has no children, stole photos of other people's children from Facebook to support her 'web of lies', the court heard. She was jailed for three years at Basildon Crown Court today. Judge Samantha Leigh said: 'You preyed on the generosity of the British public. 'We all know how generous the public can be and how vast amounts of money can be raised - you only have to look at Children In Need and last Friday's Comic Relief for examples. 'What you did only has one word and that is wicked. You spun a web of lies to draw these people in and played on their emotions to extort money they could ill-afford to donate.' The teenager constructed a 'web of lies', the court heard, that included claims she needed money for her child's funeral and to feed her young children who had specialist dietary requirements. Juliet Donovan, prosecuting, said: 'A fundraising page set up by Miss Ringer on YouCaring.com makes reference to the death of a child and requests donations for funeral arrangements. 'Five successful donations were made. All the pleas made for donations were found to be completely unfounded. 'The total value of the fraud was £3,000 including a number of unknown victims who donated.' Ringer also sent victims vile abuse over the internet and Blackberry mobile messaging. One victim was sent a picture of her own grandmother's gravestone with a caption: 'Burn in hell b***h. I hope you're raped by devils.' Another received an image of her dead daughter with the caption: 'daddy raped me'. Ringer left another victim terrified for their safety after threatening to firebomb their home. Mike Warren, mitigating, admitted his clients actions had been 'evil' and could not be justified. He said: 'This case has attracted quite a lot of attention. These were all evil offences committed from her own bedroom. 'Cowardly offences that she does accept caused much distress to individuals and their families.' The court heard how unemployed Ringer used an iPhone, iPad and laptop to create fake fundraising claims and spew vile abuse between August 2012 and January 2014. Ringer admitted 14 charges of fraudulently collecting money, eight charges of harassment and one of threatening to blow up a victim's house at a previous hearing. She was jailed for three years and was made the subject of a restraining order banning her from contacting any of her victims. The troll was forced to flee her home to Norwich, Norfolk, after angry victims mobbed her house. Speaking outside court today, victim Leah Cushion, 24, from Southend, Essex, described the anguish she suffered after receiving pictures of her dead baby with sick captions from Ringer. The mother-of-four said: 'My daughter passed away in 2009 due to cot death and it was very hard to cope with. Sentenced: The 'wicked' 19-year-old was jailed for three years at Basildon Crown Court, pictured, today . 'I started receiving pictures of my child saying ""my daddy raped me"" and other sick captions. 'No one can imagine how hard it is to receive that when you are still coming to terms with a death. 'I'm relieved this is all over with now but I feel she should have got a longer sentence. Three years does not reflect just how many lives she has ruined.' Leah's partner Ray Dadds , 27, a mechanic from Southend, added: 'Seeing it made me so angry but I knew I couldn't take it out on the girl as I would never hit a woman. 'I wouldn't wish what we went through on my worst enemy - not even Katie. She will get out of prison in 18 months but we will not have recovered from this by then.' After the trial, Senior District Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in the East of England, Punam Malhan said: 'Ringer fraudulently made more than £2,000 from people who believed her tragic stories about ill children, which were all untrue. 'She took advantage of their kind and generous nature, and gained financially by telling stories, for example of needing money for a dead daughter's funeral, among many other creative tales. 'Ringer also set up fake profiles on Facebook, using other people's pictures of their children in her scams and uploaded pictures with racist messages and comments. 'In one communication she also threatened to blow up one of her victims' homes. In this instance, these victims took these threats extremely seriously and feared for their lives. 'Ringer had no regard for the damage she caused and the untold effects her criminality has had on her victims - not just the financial loss but on their general well-being. 'She continually abused people via the wholly inappropriate use of social media outlets for her own gain. 'We hope the sentence handed down today shows how committed the CPS is to prosecuting cases of this nature and sends a message that malicious communications will not be tolerated.'","Katie Ringer set up fundraising page to ask for donations for child's funeral .

"John Moore has been awarded £400 after being put up in a Club 18-30 hotel by Thomas Cook . A Parish councillor  has won a £400 payout from Thomas Cook after booking what he thought was a 'relaxing holiday' to a Greek party island where he was housed with 'boozed up' youngsters at a Club 18-30 hotel. John Moore, 56, from Herne in Kent, planned to spend a week on the island of Zante with his partner Angela, 51, in September. Rather than the peaceful break they were hoping for, the couple, who run a sweet shop in Herne Bay, Kent,  were booked into Christina Studios in the resort of Laganas in Zante, advertised as an 18-30 clubbing destination. After spending two nights in the hotel where youngsters were 'banging on the walls and screaming and shouting', the couple abandoned the package holiday for something more quiet. They have since been awarded £400 in compensation by the holiday company. While being advertised by Club 18-30, Christina Studios is described on the Thomas Cook website as 'one of the best chill-out zones' in Zante. Upon their arrival however Mr Moore found 'boozed up' youngsters who 'didn't seem to sleep'. 'When we got there I asked the rep if he really thought I would book an 18-30 holiday,' the Parish councillor said. 'When I go on holiday I don't care really where it is, I want to just have a good time but it wasn't made obvious to me that it was a holiday for young people. 'It was an official 18-30 resort. It was packed with youngsters banging on the walls and screaming and shouting, so we decided to find somewhere else more to our liking.' After complaining to the Thomas Cook rep at the resort, the couple were told in order to be relocated they would have to pay extra on top of the £600 they had already spent. They would also have no other choice but to go to another Club 18-30, said Mr Moore. 'We were just speechless really, it wasn't what we wanted or what we were expecting and Angela was horrified.' While the couple were dismayed at having to share their accommodation with 'rowdy' youngsters, they were least impressed with the owner of the hotel's treatment towards them. 'The apartments didn't have hot water but when I complained the owner used very, very rude language.' At that Mr Moore and his partner packed their things immediately and, they say, waited outside the hotel for their rep to find them new accommodation. Eventually they decided to find themselves somewhere else to stay and filed a complaint with the company upon their return to the UK. Mr Moore decided to launch legal action when they failed to act, and was recently offered £400 after requesting a summons from a judge. The hotel where Mr Moore and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the Laganas strip (above), hailed as one of Zante's biggest nightlife spots . The 56-year-old Parish councillor said Christina Studios (above) where he was placed was 'packed with youngsters' who 'screamed and banged on walls' 'I'm not surprised at all (that they've offered me money), they didn't have a leg to stand on,' he said, speaking of the offer. 'They sent us to an 18-30s hotel having seen how old we looked.' Among reviews of the apartments online is one which warns: 'Don't bother if you are over thirty as it's too noisy.' The apartments are a five minute walk from the Laganas strip, described by Thomas Cook as Zante's 'party resort' whose nightlife is 'in the same league as Ibiza'. But Mr Moore claims he was sold a relaxing holiday, with the resort also described as suitable for family trips. Among TripAdvisor reviews of the hotel are some which describe it as 'filthy' and 'noisy'. One positive comment was left by a young woman who described it as the 'ultimate' place for a boys or girls' holiday. Thomas Cook apologised for the couple's experience in September. 'We would like to apologise to Mr Moore for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the Christina Studios in Zante with our Escapades brand in September 2014,' a spokesman said. 'It is never our intention to disappoint our customers and we are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to his satisfaction.' The accommodation is advertised as being provided by Club 18-30 on the Thomas Cook website (above)","John Moore, 56, booked himself and his partner a week-long holiday .

"An innocent man with severe mental disabilities was reportedly shot and left to die in the streets by ISIS police in Syria. Whilst passing through a checkpoint, an ISIS police officer began to interrogate the mentally disabled man. His rough treatment and apparent disregard for the man's health condition led to the IS militant being slapped on the face by the innocent man. Brutal regime: ISIS have become well known for their extreme use of violence in governing parts of Syria and Iraq. The brutal ISIS police officer pulled out his gun and shot the disabled man several times from close range. Nearby residents were prevented from coming to the dying man's aid, forced to watch as he was left to bleed to death on his own. The man's death was first reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London based human rights group focused on the conflict in Syria. The London based human rights group have reported that the atrocity happened in the eastern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor, renamed by ISIS as Al Kheir. Local sources confirmed that a young man, suffering from a debilitating mental illness had been murdered by ISIS. According to activists, the young man was targeted at a checkpoint inside the city of al-Mayadin. The Islamist group published photos showing a man being publicly whipped for drinking wine in Deir ezzor last week. ISIS's police force have a terrifying reputation for indiscriminate brutality, carrying out public executions, amputations and floggings in accordance with ISIS's radical interpretation of Shariah law. Local Kurdish photojournalist Jack Shahine reported that a 55 year old woman was allegedly burnt to death for not paying her taxes. The woman was allegedly named as Sanaa al-Shummari  but her death has not been independently verified.","The man was shot in the head after he reportedly slapped ISIS guard .

"Four lucky men who think their partners are out of their league have become the finalists in a 'Punching Above Your Weight' couple competition. Dave Scott and Sarah Oliver, Paula and Stephen Black, Liam and Victoria Barrett, and Lee Hodgson and Leanne Westlake are battling it out to become crowned the UK's most mismatched couple in a competition held by Newcastle's Metro Radio. The finalists beat hundreds of entrants to make it to the top four, and the winners of the tongue-in-cheek competition will win a luxury seven night holiday in a five-star resort in Corfu. Dave Scott, 22, and Sarah Oliver, 24, from Sunderland, have beaten hundreds of entrants to become finalists of the UK's 'Punching Above Your Weight' competition . Originally there were five finalists, but one couple were disqualified from the competition after producers discovered that Andrea Burlington, 36, of South Shields, had entered her deceased husband. Andrea explained that her husband Andrew Bedlington had sadly passed away in October 2013, but she still wanted to enter in tribute to her late husband as a way of keeping his memory alive: 'I felt like I was doing something with him again,' she says,'it was wonderful.' Andrea Burlington, 36, of South Shields, above, entered her husband Andrew in the competition as a way of keeping his memory alive . Andrew, who had two children with Andrea, sadly passed away in 2013 . 'It was my daughter who suggested I enter the competition, and as the conditions said nothing about the entrants being alive, I thought why not! Andrea brought Andrew's ashes into the studios in the urn usually kept next to her bed. Surprised station bosses checked with their legal team and despite her being selected as a finalist, the rules stipulated that the holiday must be awarded to a winning couple, whereas Andrea wanted to take her and Andrew's two children, Shannon, 18, and Chloe, 11. The Metro Radio team decided to treat Andrea and her children to another holiday anyway and an emotional Andrea said: 'I couldn't believe it. Andrew was the breadwinner and I was a stay at home mum, there would be no way I would have be able to take the kids anywhere in the foreseeable future.' Steve Furnell from the Steve & Karen Breakfast show who are holding the competition says: 'Andrea has been so fantastic. It's been an emotional roller coaster and we're so happy that we were able to give her and her girls the chance to go away too.

"It has barely taken any time at all for Chinese counterfeiters to rip-off Apple's latest creation. Fake versions of the Apple Watch can be bought for as little as £25 - despite the fact the real thing will set you back more than 10 times that. The flagship new product was only launched in San Francisco yesterday but knock-offs are already available in China. According to CNN Money, they can be found at Huaqiangbei electronics market in the southern city of Shenzhen, and others are being sold nationwide via popular e-commerce websites. Right down to the digital crown, the fakes mimic the design and style of Apple's new offering. Scroll down for video . For just £25 you can have yourself a Chinese counterfeit version of Apple's new flagship Watch . While the real thing (left) will set you back £299 in the UK, the D-Watch is a much more affordable £30 . They cost between 500 yuan (£50) and 250 yuan and have names like D-Watch and Ai Watch. They even have icons which look like Apple ones on the home screen, though most run a version of the Android operating system made to look like an Apple interface. They are certainly a lot cheaper than the real thing, which will set you back at least $349 in the US and £299 for the same Sport model in the UK. Chinese 'shanzhai', or counterfeiters, have even got their version onto the streets before the Apple Watch itself, as customers of the Cupertino company will have to wait until April 24 to get hold of an actual one. Laurent Le Pen, founder and CEO of Shenzen-based smartwatch maker Omate, told CNN: 'These guys are specialists. The knock-off versions even have icons which look like Apple ones on the home screen, though most run a version of the Android operating system made to look like an Apple interface . Chinese 'shanzhai', or counterfeiters, took barely a day to bring their products to market after Apple's launch . 'The speed at which they can bring copies on the market is amazing.' 'Sometimes need to be an expert to tell the difference between real and fake.' Sceptical social media users have taken the opportunity to mock the launch of Apple's new Watch with a selection of memes. Following yesterday's announcement of the device's details by the company, a collection of photos depicting homemade Apple Watches slowly started to appear. Some people attached iPhones to their wrists with elastic bands, another simply stuck a piece of fruit to their hand and a third made their own version with a regular watch and an Apple sticker. Since its unveiling in September the Watch has been shrouded in mystery, with Apple's boss Tim Cook teasing features at every available opportunity. However the features were fully released during a launch event in San Francisco on Monday.

"The case of the 'Gone Girl' physiotherapist and her boyfriend who were accused of staging her kidnapping has taken another strange twist – a group who are claiming to be the kidnappers have demanded an apology from the police. Densie Huskins, 29, was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on March 23, then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents' home. After her ‘release’ police accused them of staging the kidnapping – a claim they both strongly denied. Now the San Francisco Chronicle has received a string of anonymous emails from the apparent kidnappers in which they compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11 and claim they will strike again. Scroll down for video . The self-proclaimed kidnappers behind the Gone Girl abduction of Denise Huskins (second from right with her mother and two brothers) are demanding police apologize for calling the incident a hoax . In an email to the San Francisco Chronicle, the group threatens the Vallejo Police Department anbd spokesman Lt. Kenny Park (above) that they will 'cause harm' if Huskins faces criminal charges . They also say they monitored Huskins' boyfriend Aaron Quinn (above) after the kidnapping so he would not go to police, which is why he did not call authorities for 12 hours . In an email the kidnappers write; 'I/we may be the direct agent of harm. But it will be made crystal clear that the Vallejo Police Department, and you, Mr. [Kenny] Park, had every opportunity to stop it.' Last week Lt. Park, the spokesman for the Vallejo Police Department, said that the kidnapping of Huskins, which triggered a statewide search that involved 100 volunteers, 40 detectives and numerous FBI agents, was  an 'orchestrated event.' The letter to the Chronicle says authorities have until noon on Tuesday to apologize. It also demands that the police make clear that neither Huskins or her boyfriend Aaron Quinn - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges. As for the main reason behind the kidnapping, they write; 'The Mare Island kidnapping was a training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets.' They then compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11, the famous caper film that starred members of the Rat Pack when it premiered in 1960 and Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and George Clooney in the 2001 remake. It is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either, also reaching out to them on March 24 with an audio file of Huskins to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in Mare Island. She  eventually turned up in Huntington Beach, where both of her parents live, just a few hours later. This latest email, sent on Saturday from a dummy account, was 9,000 words long, and detailed why the group kidnapped Huskins, and how they went about taking her from her home. The group consists of three members, two with college educations, and they claim they are also behind a recent string of burglaries and car thefts in the area. They claim they drilled holes in the window of Huskins and Quinn's home to gain entry, and then used squirt guns with 'strobe flashlights and laser pointers' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms. They say they played 'calming music' as they went about the abduction, and put monitors on Quinn, 30, so they could make sure he did not go to police. They then say they put Huskins in the trunk of Quinn's car and drove off with her. The group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of Huskins and Quinn's home (above) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take Huskins . The kidnapping, which has been called an 'orchestrated event' by authorities, has drawn comparisons to the film Gone Girl (above) In the end however, they claim it was a case of mistaken identity, and they did not mean to take Huskins, thinking that someone else would be in the house. They say that is why they decided to drop her off in Huntington Beach and that they were 'horrified at what we had done.' As for the ransom they requested, what police believe to be a rather paltry $8,500, the group said; 'We chose $8,500 because it was below the $10,000 reporting threshold, and far enough below that it likely would not be flagged as part of a structured transaction under that prong of the reporting law.' Attorneys for both Quinn and Huskins claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email, and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth. Huskins' attorney, Doug Rappaport, said that the reason police called the incident a hoax is because the kidnappers used 'sophisticated computer skills' that neither they or the FBI could 'comprehend.' Lt. Park, the Vallejo Police Department and the FBI all have yet to comment on the emails.","Self-proclaimed kidnappers behind 'Gone Girl abduction' of Denise Huskins are demanding police apologize for calling the incident a hoax .

"Rather than just relying on expensive make-up and good lighting, A-list celebrities are trying out extreme procedures in their search for unblemished, wrinkle-free skin. In order to maintain his youthful glow, One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles reportedly goes books in for £325 sheep placenta facials at Dr Harold Lancer’s Beverly Hills clinic in LA. Hollywood dermatologist and 'aesthetician’ Louise Deschamps told Grazia the 21-year-old pop star comes to see her for the 90-minute treatment every six weeks. One Direction star Harry Styles is said to be a fan of £325 sheep placenta facials . She told the magazine: ‘He gets all clogged up - putting on make-up all the time and travelling a lot plays havoc with his skin. 'He takes care of himself and loves the facials, he likes to look good and have good skin.’ MailOnline has contacted Harry's representatives for a comment. The unusual treatment involves taking the placenta from prime New Zealand livestock - the stem cells, which are full of rich nutrients that fight free-radical skin damage, are extracted and then flash frozen. They are then mixed into a gel containing gold flecks which are slathered over the face after it has been exfoliated, exposed to steam and had pores opened by LED light from a handheld device. While it may sound like an intense treatment, the curly-haired star isn't the first to try out an experimental facial. Reality star Kim Kardashian tried out the vampire facial, which claims to boost collagen levels . Reality star Kim Kardashian hit the headlines in 2013 after posting a picture on Twitter of her face covered in blood. The 34-year-old had undergone a £600 vampire facial, which involves using the patient's own blood to make improvements to the skin. Blood is draw out of the arm using a needle before being spun in a machine to remove the platelets. Blood is splattered onto the patient's face using acupuncture-style needles . The remaining fluid is then splattered into the face using tiny acupuncture-style needles. The platelets are said to help stimulate collagen levels and elastin growth. Kanye West's wife revealed: 'I love trying anything that makes you look and feel youthful.' Other advocates of the therapy include British actress Anna Friel, Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Atomic Kitten star Kerry Katona. Another facial which isn't as frightful but is as equally as gruesome is the bird poo mask. Hollywood actor Tom Cruise unclogs his pores with bird poo face masks . This therapy involves mixing excrement from a nightingale, collected from the Japanese island of Kyushu, with rice bran and water which is then applied as a face mask. Tom Cruise, 52, is said to be a fan with insiders telling Now magazine: 'Tom doesn’t go in for Botox or surgery but he does pay close attention to all the new natural treatments.' 'He recently started experimenting with the nightingale poo facial after it was recommended by a Hollywood pal and the results have been fantastic.' The nightgale poo is said to act as an exfoliant which unclogs pores and aids shine. David and Victoria Beckham have tried the bizarre bird poo facial on Tom Cruise's recommendations . Victoria and David Beckham have reportedly given the £135 treatment a go too, as has Tom's ex wife Katie Holmes. Stepping away from bodily fluids, Sports Illustrated's Bar Refaeli maintains her supermodel glow with the the help of liquid gold. Leonardo DiCaprio's ex posted an picture of herself having the shimmery goo doused on her flawless face on her Twitter page. Supermodel Bar Refaeli gets the glow with £125 liquid-gold facials at a spa in California . The Caviar and Carat facial was created by aesthetician Bella Schneider. It helps uneven pigmentation, inflammation and bacteria, and improves elasticity. It isn't as expensive as the name would suggest, coming in at £125 at Schneider's LaBelle Day Spas & Salons in California. The facial relies on caviar ampule, honey, sea buckthorn, and gold to help combat the signs of aging and to brighten the skin. Jupiter Ascending actress Mila Kunis, 31, has followed Bar's lead, deciding to fight the signs of ageing with expensive jewels. Ashton Kutcher's partner Mila Kunis has forked out £4,200 for diamond and ruby facials . Accorfing to reports, Ashton Kutcher's partner booked in for a £4,200 diamond and ruby facial before the Golden Globes in 2014. Mila had the HD Diamond and Ruby Peel devised by aesthetican Scott-Vincent Borba. The procedure involves precious stones being rubbed over her skin. The jewels are said to act as antioxidants and leave the patient with a 'lustrous sheen'. Someone who is never afraid to try out the latest health and beauty fad is Gwyneth Paltrow. Gwyneth Paltrow banishes unwanted wrinkles with Thermage - nicknamed 'the ironing treatment' Chris Martin's ex wife, who runs the lifestyle blog Goop, wards off unwanted wrinkles with the help of Thermage - dubbed 'the ironing treatment'. The aim of Thermage, which will set you back £3,200, is to boost the levels of the collagen in the lower layers of the skin to create a tightening effect. It doesn't sound like the most relaxing of facials, with the 42-year-old admitting it's like 'being smacked in the face'. Unlike lasers and tools such as the Dermaroller (a roller with lots of little needles on it), Thermage aims only to 'damage' the lower levels of the skin, and not the top level, which it does by using radio waves that trigger the collagen production. Amanda Holden and Linda Evangelista are also reportedly fans of the non-invasive treatment.","One Direction singer maintains boyish good looks with a stem cell facial .

"They describe themselves as the ‘only gays in the village’. And civil partners Neil Berry and Wesley Shepherd have become embroiled in a bizarre spat that seems almost worthy of TV’s Little Britain. The couple have accused their neighbour, a parish council veteran, of triggering a vendetta against them over a parking space next to their £850,000 thatched cottage in the picturesque village of Upper Clatford. Scroll down for video . Civil partners Neil Berry and Wesley Shepherd (pictured) have accused their neighbour, Des Gale, of triggering a vendetta against them over a parking space in the picturesque village of Upper Clatford, in Hampshire . The parking space and disputed land (pictured) - Mr Gale says the parking encroaches on the village green . They have even called the police after videoing a ‘homophobic assault’ on them by a council contractor hired to erect a fence on the disputed land. In a further twist, their neighbour Des Gale admits creating a log bench for himself directly behind their house where he often sits facing their bedroom. But he told the Mail he has nothing against gay people, saying he is on chatting terms with a lesbian blacksmith and once went to parties at Mr Berry’s house featuring ‘butlers in the buff wearing nothing except little aprons and bow ties’. The colourful row has shattered the genteel tranquillity of the Hampshire village, with its medieval church and riverside green. Des Gale (pictured) denies being homophobic - but admits he built a bench directly behind their house . Neighbours at war: Mr Gale's house (pictured left) and Mr Shepherd and Mr Berry's house (right) Mr Berry, 53, moved in to his 18th-century cottage more than a decade ago, and later received planning permission to double its size. But over the years tensions developed between him and Mr Gale. The 66-year-old retired mechanical engineer, whose family has been in the village for generations, is said to have started a one-man campaign to convince Mr Berry and his partner their parking area was really part of the village green. The couple claim he prompted his ‘drinking buddies’ on the parish council to launch a ‘homophobic vendetta’ against them. They say the council has spent nearly £7,000 – 20 per cent of its annual budget – on a legal bid to take away part of their parking space. The row came to a head last week when police were called after a councillor turned up at their house with a contractor to erect a fence that would have reduced the size of the parking area. Mr Berry said: ‘When I told them they had no right to put the fence there the contractor shouted homophobic abuse at me and pushed me against a car, which Wesley managed to film. 'My glasses were broken and I was hurt and shocked. Mr Berry (left) moved in to the cottage more than a decade ago and later doubled it in size . The couple claim Mr Gale made his ‘drinking buddies’ on the parish council launch a ‘homophobic vendetta’ against them - and the council has spent 20 per cent of its  budget on a  bid to take away part of their parking . ‘The parish councillor just stood there. The police turned up and went away with the contractor to question him about my report of a homophobic assault.’ He added: ‘Mr Gale has complained about everything we’ve done – and drinking buddies on the council always back him up. ‘He’s also used a chainsaw to make himself a bench on the riverbank behind our garden, facing our bedroom, which seems a bit pervy and an invasion of our privacy.’ He said Mr Gale’s behaviour had left him and his partner feeling intimidated. ‘We’ve made a beautiful house in keeping with its 200 years of history,’ he added. ‘I don’t understand why there’s all this hatred. 'We think it can only be because we’re the only gays in the village.’ Mr Berry said the problem began when the parish council suddenly registered a new plan of its village green land, and began clearing an overgrown patch next to his garden – while claiming that he had unlawfully extended his boundary. ‘It was around that time that Mr Gale decided to go back on the parish council,’ he said. ‘They’ve since spent almost £7,000 in legal fees and other costs on trying to take a few feet of land off us. 'It’s a fifth of the council’s annual budget. They’ve taken down a fence we had up, although the land has been part of the cottage for decades with no complaints.’ But Mr Gale insisted that the council was right to take action over an attempt to ‘steal’ land from the green. And he said he had also phoned the police after Mr Berry called his wife a ‘witch’. The controversial log bench - Mr Berry said it 'seems a bit pervy and is an invasion of our privacy’ He told the Mail the trouble started when Mr Berry began extending his cottage, encroaching on public land. Threatening to sue over claims he is homophobic, Mr Gale said that he and his wife Margaret had welcomed Mr Berry to the village, adding: ‘He and his partner were guests at our daughter’s wedding. ‘And as he used to be married to a woman he has three children and we treated them like grandchildren, giving them presents and letting them play in our garden. 'We went to a number of parties at his house where 90 per cent of the guests were gay couples and butlers in the buff. 'It is incorrect to say I’m homophobic. There are other people in the village who are basically gay or homosexual or whatever you want to call it. 'I’m very friendly with a lesbian blacksmith. But he is basically stealing land from the parish, and that is not right.’ Mr Gale said he had resigned as a councillor after Mr Berry alleged that he was behind the boundary dispute with the parish, which he denies. He claimed his neighbour was ‘just crying homophobia because he’s not getting his own way’, adding: ‘He provoked the incident with the contractor, who I feel sorry for. And I had to call the police when he called my wife a witch.’ The contractor denies a homophobic assault on Mr Berry. Amy Taylor, the clerk of Upper Clatford Parish Council, said: ‘The council does have a boundary dispute, but it is in the hands of lawyers and we cannot openly discuss it. 'There is not, however, a homophobic vendetta against the couple involved, and the councillors are very upset at the suggestion’. A police spokesman said investigations were continuing. The ‘only gay in the village’ was a catchphrase used in BBC comedy Little Britain by Daffyd, a ‘committed homosexualist’ who pranced around a small Welsh town dressed in black rubber. Mr Berry (pictured right with his partner Wesley) said Mr Gale’s behaviour has left them feeling intimidated .","Civil partners in a sleepy village are embroiled in a spat with neighbour .

"Britain last night pledged to back the Saudi attacks on rebel positions in Yemen. Around 100 Saudi fighter jets bombed Iranian-backed Houthi fighters yesterday as fears grew of a proxy war in the Middle East between Sunni and Shia factions of Islam. Saudi Arabia is the main Sunni power, Iran its Shia counterpart. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain will provide technical help. Speaking in Washington, he said: ‘We will provide support to the Saudi operation in every way we can, but we’re clearly not going to get involved in military action itself.’ Mr Hammond said there were fears of a 'proxy' war developing in Yemen between Saudi Arabia, the leading Sunni power, and Iran, the leading Shia power. Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi arrived in Saudi capital Riyadh on Thursday night after leaving his refuge in Aden  as Houthi rebels advanced to within a few miles of the southern port city. Throughout Thursday, warplanes from Saudi Arabia and Arab allies struck at the Shiite Houthis and allied army units, who have taken over much of Yemen and seek to oust Hadi. Warplanes resumed bombing the Houthi-held capital Sanaa that evening, shaking whole neighbourhoods and terrifying residents. Up to 39 civilians have been reported killed in Sanaa.

Safety: Yemen's President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi (left) walks with Saudi Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman as he arrives in Riyadh on Thursday evening . Speaking in the US yesterday afternoon, the Foreign Secretary said: 'The Saudis are very exercised by the idea of an Iranian-backed regime in Yemen. 'They cannot accept the idea of an Iranian-backed regime in control of Yemen, which is why they felt compelled to intervene the way they have. 'We know there has been Iranian support for the Houthi and we are all concerned to avoid this becoming a proxy war.' MPs today said the escalation of the conflict, which threatens to engulf the entire region into a wider war, was 'heart-breaking' and said the British government could not stand by and see it 'burn'. MP Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, called for the UK to take immediate action to help stabilise the region-wide crisis. He said: 'The crisis before us is heartbreaking. We in the UK cannot just watch as another country burns in the Middle East, strengthening the forces of extremist and violence. 'The Houthi rebels have brought the country to its knees. Yemen is facing an economic and humanitarian catastrophe. We are witnessing an implosion in one of the most strategically vital countries in the world.'

Carnage: Yemeni men search for survivors in the rubble of buildings following airstrikes by the Saudi-led 10-member coalition of Gulf states . People search for survivors under the rubble of houses destroyed by Saudi airstrikes near Sanaa Airport . British elite soldiers – in Yemen to train government troops to fight Al Qaeda, which has established its most dangerous branch in the country – pulled out last Friday. This followed a decision by the US to evacuate their remaining military personnel as the country teetered on the brink of civil war between the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. Today Mr Vaz, former Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Yemen, added: 'While other countries are launching air strikes, for us to withdraw from the conflict is not the answer.' He called for the UK to call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council and to provide assistance to the government in Yemen. He warned: 'We in the West must realise that if Yemen falls, the rest of the Gulf will be in real danger. If we see that happen, it will be cities like London and Paris which will face the consequences.' In a dramatic escalation of the stakes, a Sunni coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Iran-backed Shia Houthi rebels. They have swept south through the country, forcing the UN-backed President to flee to Saudi.

A supporter of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa Islamic organization holds a banner in support of Saudi Arabia over its intervention in Yemen, during a demonstration in Islamabad, Pakistan . Saudi warplanes targeted Houthi forces controlling Yemen's capital and their northern heartland yesterday as Morocco joined in the fight along with a coalition of Sunni-led states. The airstrikes were condemned by Iran, which described the operation as an 'invasion' and a 'dangerous step' that will worsen the crisis. Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen, asked if the campaign would last days, weeks or more, told Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television: 'I expect that this operation will not go on for long, I think it will be days.' A full blown conflict in Yemen could plunge the entire region into turmoil and send the price of oil soaring. Western allies fear a Shiite takeover of the country will cause further instability in the region and could lead to either Al Qaeda or Islamic State seizing control of another weakened state. Al Qaeda has seized parts of the remote south and east, and stands to gain ground if the Yemeni military continues to split and surrender in its military campaign against it. The US was training Yemen's military to fight Al Qaeda but the withdrawal of troops from both the UK and the US amid deepening security chaos has called into question their counter-terrorism strategy. They have pledged their support to Saudi Arabia, with the US providing logistical and intelligence support. The UK has not ruled out support in the future.

Yesterday morning thousands of Houthi supporters gathered to condemn the air strikes at the gate to Sanaa's old city, waving Houthi banners and chanting 'Death to America!' Al-Arabiya said Saudi Arabia was contributing 100 warplanes to operation 'Storm of Resolve' and more than 85 were being provided by the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Morocco and Sudan. Egyptian air forces were participating and four naval ships headed to secure the Gulf of Aden. Turkey said it might provide logistical support. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said later Iran had been trying to dominate the Middle East. 'It is really not possible to tolerate this. Iran has to understand,' he said, adding Tehran should withdraw any forces it had in Yemen as well as from Syria and Iraq. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said any threat to Saudi Arabia would 'evoke a strong response' from Islamabad. Pakistan, which borders eastern Iran, said it was considering a Saudi request that it send troops to Yemen.","Philip Hammond says Britain will provide technical help to Saudi attacks .

"Amy Goldberg, 57, was charged with battery on a person 65 years or older after the incident . A Boca Raton woman is accused of smearing dog poop on her elderly neighbor's face to get revenge following argument. Amy Goldberg is accused of putting it on her 67-year-old neighbor's face and arms last week. Goldberg, 57, was charged with battery on a person 65 years or older. The smearing suspect's neighbor was walking her dog when the animal defecated on the lawn in front of Goldberg's home at the Woodfield Country Club in Boca Raton, according to an arrest report. The neighbor said Goldberg came running out of her house screaming and yelling, the Palm Beach Post reported. When Goldberg told her to clean it up, the neighbor, who already had a plastic baggie in her hand, allegedly fired back: 'You clean it up.' Goldberg allegedly grabbed the dog's mess in a bag and hurled it at her neighbor after a chase, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Goldberg then grabbed what was left of the pooch's poop and smeared it on her neighbor's arms and face. After police arrived, Goldberg told them she threw the fido feces in her neighbor's direction, but maintained that she never touched her. The 1,300 homes in the Woodfield community cost anywhere from $300,000 up to a few million dollars . Goldberg told officers the neighbor smeared the animal waste on herself to frame her for the attack because they had a long history of bad blood. She was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail and released. If convicted, Goldberg could be sentenced to a minimum of three years in prison and be forced to pay fines of up to $10,000.

"A corrupt policewoman who seized CCTV of a street fight in an attempt to blackmail footballer Steven Gerrard was jailed for 22 months today. Helen Jones, 32, a former Pc with Merseyside Police, took the footage by 'flashing her warrant card' to the manageress of a bank which was intended to be used to extort money from the Liverpool star. The film showed friends of Gerrard, the then-England captain, involved in a  bar brawl near his home in Formby, Merseyside, which spilled out on to the street. Jailed: Former WPC Helen Jones (pictured above), 32, was imprisoned for for 22 months today after seizing CCTV in the hope she could blackmail Steven Gerrard . Local businessman Paul Lloyd, 35, claimed the midfielder  'threw the first punch' but, at an earlier hearing, prosecutors said the Liverpool midfielder was acting as a peacemaker on the evening of August 4 2013. Jailing her today Judge Baker told the defendant: 'This was deliberate and calculated misconduct in a public office. 'You deliberately created a false impression in the mind of the bank manager that you were investigating a criminal offence. 'In fact you were on a mission to obtain that matter so that you could put it either directly or through an intermediary, who would use it for his own ends, which were nothing whatsover to do with a criminal investigation.' Judge Baker said while Jones may not have known who, eventually, the CCTV would be passed to or for what purpose, it had caused Liverpool's Gerrard and his friend Lee McPartland 'serious personal embarrassment', and damaged the reputation of Merseyside Police. Plot: PC Jones planned to use the CCTV to extort money from Mr Gerrard, pictured with his wife Alex, who was filmed acting as a peacemaker when friends got involved in a bar brawl . Jones made no reaction as she was jailed, though she had wept earlier when her lawyer recounted some of the 'trauma' she had faced while on duty as a police officer. Jones, formerly of Formby, now living in Chatham, Kent, did not deny improperly using her status as a police officer to get the CCTV and admitted misconduct in a public office but claimed she was doing a favour for a friend. But during a three day hearing, known as a trial of issue last November, Judge Stuart Baker said he found her account 'wholly implausible', ruling Jones acted for 'base motives' and described her as a 'practised and persistent liar'. He said the CCTV was secured to use it 'possibly as a lever to cause Mr Gerrard to pay money to suppress it or, at the very least, to use it in a way which would potentially cause embarrassment, as has in fact occurred'. Jones, who joined the police in 2005, was off-duty and on a career break when she went to the Lloyds branch in Formby and took the footage, which the prosecution claimed was for 'criminal purposes'. Earlier the court heard Jones got her hands on the CCTV to allow Mr Lloyd or another person, to use it as a 'lever' to cause Steven Gerrard to pay money to suppress it or use it in a way to cause him potential embarrassment. Crime scene: The Merseyside Police officer took the footage by 'flashing her warrant card' to the manageress of this Formby bank . Mr Lloyd claimed Gerrard and his friends assaulted him, and following the incident the footballer and his friend Mr McPartland, faced 'demands and threats' amid an atmosphere of 'unpleasantness' and 'menace' with claims of money being offered by the press for the footage. Gerrard was later named in legal papers lodged by Mr Lloyd at the High Court claiming damages following the disturbance. The civil case named Gerrard, his wife, Alex, and Mr McPartland, as defendants. But Richard Howarth, prosecuting, said Mr Lloyd, who gave evidence at the earlier hearing, was 'an untruthful witness who sought to exploit his involvement in this incident and he maintained his deceit in the witness box'. The prosecutor added: 'There is still no extant proceedings in the High Court, which given his performance in the witness box, is hardly surprising.' Mr Howarth said the actual CCTV, which has never been made public, was a 'side issue' in Jones' admitted offence of misconduct. Gerrard's lawyers and Liverpool FC became involved and police called in with their investigation leading to Jones's arrest and her resignation from the police. Roderick Jones, mitigating for Jones, said: 'We are dealing with a single event in which a serving police officer on a career break took a decision to essentially, catastrophically bend the rules to breaking point and in doing so, broke them. 'This is a shameful and criminal aberration.'","Helen Jones, 33, used her warrant card to get footage from a nearby bank .

"A Waitrose magazine showcasing the food of Israel has been hammered online for ignoring what activists regard to be the 'illegal occupation of Palestine'. The supermarket chain's monthly food magazine 'Waitrose Kitchen' contained a 32-page brochure called Taste of Israel. But the glossy advert, sponsored by Israel's Government Tourist Board, has sparked outrage among campaigners - with some claiming it ignores what they believe is an 'apartheid regime'. Scroll down for video . A 32-page brochure called Taste of Israel (pictured) within Waitrose Kitchen Magazine has been hammered on the internet . The Waitrose magazine features a glossy pull-out featuring recipe ideas and an 'A-Z food glossary' of Israeli ingredients and dishes . Others have posted harrowing images taken during last year's Gaza conflict. The travel and food pull-out, in the February edition, contains an 'A-Z food glossary' of Israeli ingredients and dishes as well as a guide of its 'Top 10 restaurants'. It also includes 'market tours' interviews with top Israeli chefs and an article explaining 'Why Israeli wine is winning awards, plus five wines to taste.' Recipes in the insert include shakshuka, white fish on vegetable ragu, endive salad, and 'instructions for creating the perfect falafel and hummus'. Backlash: The advert sparked anger online with some saying it ignored what campaigners described as an 'apartheid' Outrage: Some threatened to boycott the supermarket chain after learning of the contents of the magazine . Anger: One Twitter user accused Waitrose and the Israel Tourist Office of 'pushing Israeli propaganda' Criticism: Others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation . The Palestine Solidarity Campaign called the insert 'disgraceful' adding: 'The booklet is a prime example of Israeli government propaganda, highlighting its efforts to distract the public abroad from its brutal military occupation of Palestinian land by replacing the image of an apartheid regime with that of a tourist-friendly, culture-loving country.' Activisits took to Twitter with some vowing to boycott Waitrose - and encouraging others to follow suit. One user, Rory Evans, wrote: Nothing like the taste of falafel with a side-order of apartheid, is there @waitrose #tasteofisrael.' Another Twitter user, 'Paul in Brighton' said: 'Waitrose and Israel Tourist Office are pushing Israeli propaganda 'Taste of Israel' using @waitrose #tasteofIsrael.' One said that the magazine 'erases Palestinian history and culture' while others have asked why some of the foods in the magazine can be claimed by one nation. However, some hit back at criticism of Waitrose, with one urging activists to 'leave war and politics out of cooking.' A number of users posted pictures of the advert along with messages demanding an apology from Waitrose . Some Twitter users hit back at criticism of Waitrose, with one urging activists to 'leave war and politics out of cooking' Ilir Dema wrote: 'Perhaps @waitrose genuinely wants to promote cooking, why is that propaganda?'

"'Sadistic': Kindergarten teacher Frederick Mena, 25, is accused of digging his nails into a young student's skin in class because he wanted to see her cry . A kindergarten teacher from Miami has been charged with aggravated child abuse after police say he dug his nails into a girl's hand and leg just to see her cry. Frederick Mena, 25, was arrested earlier this month in connection to the sickening incident that allegedly took place March 5 at Silver Bluff Elementary School in Coconut Grove. According to an arrest report, Mena was teaching math to a kindergarten class when the victim, a young girl, became stymied by the material. In his frustration, according to the Miami Dade School Police, Mena dug his fingernails deeply into the child's hand and calf, breaking the skin and leaving marks. The reports states that Mena later admitted to the incident in a letter penned to the principal of the school. According to the 25-year-old's written confession, cited by NBC Miami, he injured his student because ‘for some reason,’ he had the urge to see her cry. He reportedly wrote that instead of resisting that violent urge, he decided to 'go with it.' Mena added that the child in question was too ‘sensitive,’ and he thought that inflicting pain on her might ‘toughen’ her up. Place of learning: On March 5, Mena was teaching math to a kindergarten class at Silver Bluff Elementary School in Coconut Grove, Florida, when he became frustrated that one of the students was not grasping the material . But in the end, he admitted that he hurt her to ‘plainly satisfy an ugly pleasure.’ Once the deed was done, the 25-year-old educator said he felt no emotion and no regret, reported WSVN. ‘Knowing myself and who I truly am deep down I’m just shocked thinking that I actually did this!’ he reportedly stated, according to Miami Herald. When questioned by police, Mena allegedly admitted that he wanted to take advantage of the kindergartner while she was at her lowest, and that he desired to 'punish her' and 'put her down further.' The Miami-Dade School District released a statement saying that Mena has been removed from the classroom, terminated and banned from ever working for the district again. Vicious: Mena confessed in a letter that he got the uncontrollable urge to see the child cry and put her down . Mena has been charged with felony aggravated child abuse with great bodily harm. He is being held on $10,000 bond. A judge has issued a stay away order to keep the disgraced teacher from the victim. In a social media post from 2014, Mena was described as a first-year teacher. According to his online presence, Mena has been splitting his time between teaching kindergarten and pursuing a career in hip hop.","Miami teacher Frederick Mena, 25, charged with aggravated child abuse .

"Troubled footballer Clarke Carlisle today apologised to the driver of the lorry which he jumped in front of in a desperate attempt to kill himself. The former Premier League defender said that he prays for the driver, Darren Pease, every day - but added that he has been unable to apologise in person because the haulier refuses to meet him. Mr Carlisle, 35, who has publicly stuggled with depression, also said that the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving. Apology: Clarke Carlisle today said that he felt sorry for the lorry driver he jumped in front of in December . Interview: The apology came as Mr Carlisle spoke to presenters Kate Garraway and Susanna Reid on ITV's Good Morning Britain today . The sportsman, dubbed 'Britain's brainiest footballer' after he appeared on Countdown in 2002, tried to kill himself in December, two days after he was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. He was left critically injured after jumping in front of Mr Pease's 12-ton lorry on the dual carriageway, and although he has made a full recovery his face is now covered in scars. Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain today, Mr Carlisle said he was 'so sorry' for putting Mr Pease through the ordeal of being involved in a near-fatal crash. 'I think about him and pray for him every day, I am so sorry to him,' he said. 'I am so sorry for what my actions would have done to him because it will be as equally a traumatic experience for him as it was for me and my family. Survivor: Mr Clarke, pictured outside the GMB studio today, says his facial scars remind him how lucky he is to be alive . 'I've tried to contact him and reach out in person but he doesn't want that to happen and I have to respect that. He needs to recover in the way that he sees fit and I apologise profusely for the impact I've had on his life.' Speaking earlier this month, Mr Pease, 53, said that he might never be able to drive a lorry again after hitting Mr Carlisle. 'I get depressed and I get mad and angry,' he told the Sunday Mirror. 'Physically I get knots in my stomach, I'm anxious. 'That feeling is indescribable - to think you are going to die. I don't think I'll ever be able to get behind the wheel of a lorry again. I can't see any way back for me at this point.' Mr Carlisle told Good Morning Britain that his severe depression had driven him to his 'lowest ebb', making him ignore his good fortune and loving family. 'It was the lowest place that you can possibly be,' he said. 'At 35 I’ve had experience in life, I’ve got three beautiful children, I was married, and you get something that comes over you that takes your eyes off all of that and actually rationalises the option of committing suicide. You know you must be at your lowest ebb and I was there.' Asked about the scars he suffered from his suicide attempt, Mr Carlisle said: 'They're a constant reminder. 'Today on a daily basis they remind me how blessed I am and they remind me that it could have been so different. I've been given another opportunity in life and I'm going to take it.' The former player addressed criticism from his former housemate, actor Ralf Little, who said that Mr Carlisle would 'get away with it again' after he spoke out about his depression. The two men are belived to have fallen out when Mr Carlisle took Mr Little's credit card and spent his money on alcohol, but today Mr Carlisle said he wished his old friend 'every blessing'. Family: Mr Carlisle pictured with his wife Gemma, with whom he has three children . Star: Mr Carlisle pictured playing for Burnley against Aston Villa in 2010, at the peak of his footballing career . He said: 'Ralf was a very good friend of mine and back in the day we lived together and because of my chaotic lifestyle, I hurt him and there are consequences to those actions. 'I'm not sat here asking for absolution of responsibility, there's just an element of understanding and awareness that I think needs to [be raised] in society about the illness. 'Ralf has every right to hold his opinions and I wish him every blessing.' Mr Carlisle also talked about recent comments by columnist Katie Hopkins, who described suicidal people as 'attention-seeking b******s' and suggested that exercise could cure depression. 'From those tweets you can see that Katie Hopkins clearly doesn't understand depression and hasn't grasped the fact that it's an illness,' he told Good Morning Britain. 'It's no more an option to not be depressed than it's an option to not have flu. It is an illness that is upon you and it needs diagnosing and treating - but there is an element of truth in what she says, physical exercise is scientifically proven to be a good remedy for mild to moderate depression and anxiety.' Mr Carlisle played for nine different clubs in his 16-year career, including five years at Burnley, and served as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association. Last week, he pleaded guilty to failing to provide a sample when he was stopped by police in December as his car was swerving around the road. He is set to be disqualified from driving when he is sentenced in May.

"Eurosceptic: Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash, who chairs the European Scrutiny Committee . The BBC has a ‘deeply concerning’ pro-European bias and has ‘fallen down severely’ in its obligation to provide impartial coverage of the issue, MPs say today. The European Scrutiny Committee says the corporation does not give enough airtime to those who believe Britain should leave the European Union or that there should be a referendum on membership. The MPs also criticised the BBC’s director-general, Lord Hall, for failing in his role as the corporation’s editor-in-chief, after he turned down an invitation to give evidence to the committee in Parliament four times. Lord Hall, who earns £450,000 a year of licence fee payers’ money, eventually relented after the committee told him to treat its invitation as a ‘formal summons’. Sir Bill Cash, the Eurosceptic who chairs the committee, said: ‘The BBC has fallen down severely on its obligations to viewers and listeners to give them a proper and balanced assessment of both sides of the argument. 'This is an issue that affects everybody’s lives. Who can say that the European question is not important?’ The Conservative MP argued that many of the BBC’s flagship shows, including Radio’s 4’s Today programme, are stuffed with commentators who talk about the economic and political dangers of Britain leaving the EU. But, he argued, they have far too few people on its shows to explain what the benefits might be. Sir Bill said: ‘There is a [line] of questioning which is quite clearly geared to elicit the answers, “I don’t want a referendum”, or “I don’t want Britain to leave the European Union.” 'There are two sides of the argument. Why don’t they have more people on so they can represent them? That [bias] is carried through an enormous amount of the BBC’s flagship programmes.’ It is not the first time the committee has called on the BBC to give more airtime to Eurosceptics. The cross-parliamentary group said in 2005 that the corporation should have to air a series of debates about Britain’s position in the EU, to help educate the public. MPs also criticised the BBC’s director-general, Lord Hall, above, for failing in his role as the corporation’s editor-in-chief, after he turned down an invitation to give evidence to the committee in Parliament four times . But in today’s report MPs say the BBC has done little to change things, and that they ‘remain deeply concerned about the manner’ in which the corporation tackles the subject of the EU. They were particularly angry with Lord Hall. ‘He is editor-in-chief,’ said Sir Bill. ‘He has responsibility for ensuring that the [BBC] Charter and Framework Agreement are complied with. The charter does not give them absolute editorial independence. They have to work within a framework.’ The committee had to write to the director-general five times over the course of a year before he agreed to appear before members. Even then, he only did so after the committee told him it was a ‘formal summons’ and accused him of hiding behind historic rules which would let him off the hook because of his peerage. Members of the Lords do have the right to decline invitations to appear before the Commons. Lord Hall has denied ever trying to take advantage of his peerage in this way. A BBC spokesman said: ‘As Lord Hall told the committee, we are and will be impartial in all matters concerning our coverage. ‘The BBC provides extensive coverage of both European and parliamentary issues and while we respect the committee’s role, it would be a breach of our independence if a committee of MPs were to instruct us how to cover an individual issue or story.’","BBC has 'concerning' pro-EU bias,  the European Scrutiny Committee said .

"Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured in Liverpool today, announced an extra £1.25 billion over the next five years, to help youngsters at risk of self-harming, depression and committing suicide . Three children in every classroom suffer from mental health problems, Nick Clegg warned today as he unveiled a massive new investment in tackling the national crisis. The Deputy Prime Minister announced an extra £1.25 billion over the next five years, to help youngsters at risk of self-harming, depression and committing suicide. Mr Clegg said the money would support an extra 110,000 children in England who have suffered 'institutionalised form of cruelty' by being denied the support they need. Among children aged 5-16, one in 10 have a diagnosable mental health disorder, equivalent to three in every class. As many as one in 12 deliberately self-harm and 80,000 children suffer from severe depression, including 8,000 under the age of 10. According to figures released by the Lib Dems, the number of children aged 15 and 16 with depression doubled between the 1980s and 2000s. The extra £250million-a-year in funding will be confirmed in next week's Budget, and is a fully-funded government policy, not just an ambition to be included in the Lib Dem manifesto. Mr Clegg made the announcement during a visit to Clock View Hospital in Liverpool, where he took part in a group therapy session. Mr Clegg said: 'I think it will have a huge impact. You have got, on average, three children in every classroom in our country who have got mental health problems and are not being properly catered for, not being properly identified, not being properly supported. 'This huge expansion - £1.25 billion over the course of the next parliament - will help around 110,000 children, children who at the moment are being let down by the system. 'It's an institutionalised form of cruelty, the way we allow vulnerable children with mental health problems to basically have to fend for themselves at the moment. 'This big announcement I'm making is going to seek to change that. It won't happen overnight, it will happen over the coming years.' He added: 'It's all part of a journey where we start, as a country, lifting the stigma that has surrounded mental health and making sure that we treat mental health in the same way as we do people with physical health problems.' The funding will also help improve support for new mothers, who had previously struggled with a 'second-class mental health service', Mr Clegg said. 'It is terrifying to think that in this day and age some new mothers are having to travel miles for treatment and others are even being separated from their newborn child This has to stop,' he said. 'This funding will make sure they get the treatment and support they need so they in turn can give their children the best possible start in life.' Mr Clegg, who also took part in phone canvassing to boost his party's support at the election, said mental health would be one of his top five priorities if the Lib Dems are returned to power . Mr Clegg said the money would support an extra 110,000 children in England who have suffered 'institutionalised form of cruelty' by being denied the support they need . Mr Clegg, who was in Liverpool for the Liberal Democrats' spring conference, blamed some local NHS commissioners for failing to pass on previous Government funding for children's mental health. 'Along with this extra money we are also saying, and NHS England is saying, to all local commissioners they have to give the right amount of money to mental health,' he said. 'We need to have central government, that's providing the money, working hand in glove with local decision-makers so that they don't short-change local mental health trusts. 'It is starting to change now, but I accept it is a big culture change because for far too long people in the NHS have not provided the amount of resources and support to mental health which it deserves.' The funding for children's mental health will help children with conditions such as self-harming, depression and those at risk of committing suicide. It will help pay for therapy sessions, family support work, better training for clinicians and the development of help via websites and online apps. Mr Clegg said: 'There would be an outcry if a child with diabetes was left to cope without support or treatment. But that's exactly what's been happening with young people's mental health services. 'I have heard, time and again, harrowing stories from young people and their families about how they suffered and their condition deteriorated waiting to get the right treatment for serious mental health problems. 'That's why I am determined to start a seismic shift to revolutionise children's mental healthcare and end this unacceptable injustice. 'By introducing waiting time standards and committing to talking therapies for children in every region, we are helping to build a fairer society where young people can get the right treatment and support they deserve to live a better life.' NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: 'Today our campaign for NHS mental health services gets an important boost. This much-needed investment will kick-start a multiyear upgrade in care for younger people and their families. NHS nurses, therapist and doctors will use this funding to benefit families in every part of the country.'","Deputy Prime Minister announced extra money to be spent over five years .

"It might seem strange, but more and more unusual ingredients have been making their way into culinary favourites. Horlicks makes it into more recipes than you might imagine, with Nigella Lawson including it in her Malteaser cake, and Jamie Oliver swearing by it for a killer hot chocolate. And while the inclusion of the malted milk powder in sweet dishes might be a tad obvious, it's also a key item in one chef's savoury crab cakes. The soft flavour of Horlicks works really well against the big Thai flavours of the crab and fish cakes . The Horlicks recommendation comes from Chef Paul Hartley, who's devised a whole world of drink based recipes in his Horlicks cookbook. Chef Harley explains that the soft flavour of the drink powder works really well against the big Thai flavours of the crab and fish cakes. And as well as being a Horlicks baking fan, Nigella is a dedicated user of Marmite in recipes. Coconut water for its high-quality hydrating benefits . Sun Chlorella 'A' algae tablets which contains amino acids and chlorophyll for energy . Acai powder, which contains high antioxidant levels . Camu Camu powder for a hit of vitamin C content for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body . Maca powder - a powerful adaptogen which helps the body handle physical stress . Raw honey for a fast-release sugar hit for energy burst as well as helping to support the immune system . Far from a rogue dollop of the yeast extract in a casserole, Marmite is the star of the show in her spaghetti dish as she says the product offers saltiness and savouriness the way a stock cube might. Marmite also makes a star appearance in mushrooms, and chocolate cupcakes (recipes below) proving that the love it or hate it condiment has a lot more to it than meets the eye. While porridge is a boring breakfast staple for most of us, this particular version (recipe below), created by 400m hurdler Ruben Tabares, is full of exotic foods from around the world including superfood Sun Chlorella, a nutritious single celled green algae. Want an excuse to eat more chocolate but think dinnertime could be a step too far? Not according to the Hairy Bikers. The bearded chefs say 'adding chocolate to Chilli con Carne, gives it a luxurious velvety sheen.' Be sure to opt for good quality dark chocolate to strengthen the flavours in this punchy dish. Britain's favourite savoury yeast spread has made the leap from the breakfast table and is now considered a serious kitchen ingredient . Yogurt (left)  which is usually used in savoury dishes lends much needed lightness to a sticky marmalade cake. Malted milk bedtime drink Horlicks (right) is the star in one chef's Thai-style crabcakes . And while it's not unusual to see yogurt featured in main courses and as an accompaniment, this recipe (see below), by Executive Chef Paul Collins at Yeo Valley HQ sees the creamy culture used as the main ingredient in marmalade cake. For those wanting to branch out and surprise their dinner party guests with a secret ingredient that can't be guessed, here are some recipes for dishes with a difference.

"A pair of protesters who came all the way from New Jersey to Des Moines, Iowa to lodge a protest against their state's governor, Chris Christie, were thrown out of Saturday's Iowa Ag Summit after they yelled that Christie hadn't done enough to help victims of Hurricane Sandy. Organizers of Saturday's Iowa Ag Summit warned audience members that they would be escorted out if they caused a scene. Police quickly tossed the pair, including Lisa Stevens, whose sign claimed 'thousands of families' were still displaced from their homes. Joe Mangino, a man standing with her, barked, 'I will NOT shut up!' Christie had told an activist in October at a Belmar, New Jersey town hall meeting about post-hurricane rebuilding to do just that. 'My people follow me everywhere,' Christie quipped to event organizer Bruce Rastetter as the protesters were marched to the exit and hundreds applauded. 'I'm magnetic, Bruce,' he said. 'They can't stay away from me.' Scroll down for video . DEFIANT: Chris Christie dismissed hecklers on Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa who came 1,000 miles to complain about families still displaced more than two years after Hurricane Sandy . EXIT, STAGE LEFT: Lisa Stevens held a sign reading 'Governor Christie: Thousands of families still not home after Sandy' before she and Joe Mangino were quickly escorted out . 'And I think you understand that I'll deal with you the same way here as I deal with you in New Jersey,' he told the protesters. As the pair left the auditorium, Christie said that 'it really is a wonderful country that people can do that.' Stevens' sign read, 'Governor Christie: Thousands of families still not home after Sandy.' Hurricane Sandy was an historic 2012 storm that ravaged America's mid-Atlantic coast, killing 12 in New Jersey and causing more than $20 billion in damage overall. Mangino said outside that Sandy's aftermath forced him to abandon his home, and that he and his family have moved three times since then. Tens of thousands in the Garden State were made homeless as 80-mph winds battered the coast and flattened houses, and soe advocates insist the governor hasn't done enough to help. 'I'm begging you,' one of the hecklers yelled as she was ejected. The two weren't the only ones to disrupt the morning's program. A lone, elderly man interrupted Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the event began, reading aloud from a sheet of paper a litany of complaints about 'corporate' agriculture. He too was shown the door to the sound of cheers and one audience member who yelled 'Get him out of here!' 'It's all about money,' the gray-haired activists had complained. 'There's too much corruption.' And then: 'We want clean water!' A group of about 50 protesters were gathered outside the Elwell Family Food Center near the Iowa State Fairgrounds, a mixture of organic-only food advocates, backers of 'small, family farms,' opponents of genetically modified food crops, and animal rights activists from PETA. Christie, the no-nonsense governor known for boisterous outbursts on the campaign trail, reserved his most emotional words for the Obama administration's fast-evolving policy on Cuba. The communist island nation, he complained bitterly, has been harboring since 1984 a fugitive who killed a New Jersey police officer in 1977. The ejected Christie heckler's sign identified her as a member of the New Jersey Organizing Project, a liberal group that is demanding more government funds to fix hurricane damage . POWER TO THE (OLD) PEOPLE! An elderly protester also interrupted Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad with a litany of complaints about 'corporate' agriculture . CIRCUS: Activists rallied outside the Iowa Ag Summit on March 7 as hundreds listened inside to a procession of Republican presidential hopefuls . 'You cannot start trading with a country that is promoting someone who is a cop-killer,' he said of JoAnne Chesimard, the 67-year-old former Black Liberation Army member who escaped from a New Jersey prison in 1979 and has been on the run ever since. CRAZIES: Animal liberation activists from PETA were on hand to complain about Iowa's thousands of pork farmers . 'If they're going to keep harboring fugitives,' he said, 'I have a problem with that ... The president doesn't know how to negotiate. You don't give away the idea of trading with America for nothing.' The Cuban government refused this week to extradite Chesimard, who has adopted the name Assata Olugbala Shakur, as part of trade negotiations designed to give Cuba access to U.S. markets after a half-century of political freeze. 'I can say it is off the table,' said Gustavo Machin, the deputy director for American affairs at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during a March 2 interview with Yahoo News. In December Josefina Vidal, Cuba’s Head Of North American Affairs, rejected a deal that would have returned Chesimard to the U.S. in exchange for 5 prisoners held in the U.S. 'Every nation has sovereign and legitimate rights to grant political asylum to people it considers to have been persecuted,' she told the Associated Press at the time. 'We’ve explained to the U.S. government in the past that there are some people living in Cuba to whom Cuba has legitimately granted political asylum.' Christie also attacked the White House on its economic record, hinting that he favors a wholesale rewrite of America's tax code. FUGITIVE: JoAnne Chesimard killed a New Jersey police officer, escaped from a New Jersey prison and fled justice in Cuba, where she still lives under the Raul Castro government's protection . 'We tax too much in this country already. We tax in a way that's too complicated,' he said. 'We tax that money at every step along the way. We tax it when you make it, we tax it when you invest it, and then we tax you when you die – and in some states, like mine, we tax your heirs who take it.' 'It's crazy,' Christie said. Those taxes, he added, hit Americans in concert with an economy that's growing too slow to be sustainable. 'This is the worst recovery in modern history [and] the president takes a victory lap,' he carped. And touting his own record conducting global trade missions for New Jersey businesses, Christie said the president's approach has been inadequate. 'I think any of us who have seen the president negotiate over the course of the last 6 years is concerned about the way the president negotiates,' he said.","'My people follow me everywhere ... I'm magnetic,' quipped the NJ governor .

"Apple has unveiled its Watch today in what is the company's first completely new product since the death of founder Steve Jobs. A press event held in San Francisco revealed the collection that will range in price from $349 to $17,000 (£299 to £13,500 in the UK). It comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. The devices are due to go on sale on April 24, but how do they compare to rivals' smartwatches? And can Apple crack the market that has only seen limited sales to date? Here MailOnline looks at its main competitors in the increasingly crowded market. Apple's Watch is available in three models: the Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition (shown) and all models will be sold in 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. Apple Watch is made of stainless steel, Sport is made of Aluminum and the premium Edition comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold . Moto 360 . The Moto 360 watch launched in September 2014 and won praise for its stylish, circular design that was seen as being a move away from the bulky and computerised-looking Pebble Steel, Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch. It features a 1.5in LCD touchscreen encircled by a thin metal band and is powered by Google's Android Wear operating system. The Moto 360 - which is available now in the US - is also $100 cheaper than the Apple Watch. Despite its impressive design and promises that the watch lasts for 24 hours, tests have shown this averages at around 12 - six hours less than the Apple Watch and almost two days shorter than the Samsung Gear S. Like with Apple's Watch, batter life depends on usage. The device reviews at the time of its launch were mixed. 'Like all other watches in this class, you'll have to get used to charging every night, and occasionally you'll need to top off during the day,' wrote Android Central. 'The display resolution isn't as good as other choices. And the Android Wear software itself is still is in its infancy.' The Moto 360 launched last year and is available for $250 in the US and £199 in the UK . Samsung Gear S . Samsung - the world's biggest smartphone manufacturer - was early to launch a range of smartphones to counter slow earnings in its mobile sector. This included the Samsung Galaxy Gear that was released in September 2013. Despite their early foray into the market, their appeal and functionality was limited and the Galaxy Gear was too big for even the largest wrists. The Samsung Gear S was unveiled in August 2014 . Its new watch is called the Gear S and has a larger curved AMOLED screen than its predecessors at two inches (5cm). It is designed to fit more comfortably on the wearer's wrist than its previous models. The watch is large enough so that users will be able to read messages and notifications at a glance. The screen can be customised – as well as the colour of the straps. It offers 3G, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, so that users can receive notifications from social networks, calendars and apps, without needing to use their smartphone. People wearing the device can reply to messages by using an onscreen keyboard or 'S voice functionality' so they can dictate a message. Engineer and tech expert Sami Mughal from OxGadgets told MailOnline: 'Apple are Marmite at the moment; you either love them or hate them. 'Most Android fans fall in the latter category, and they'll probably go straight for anything that comes with the Samsung badge on it.' The watch is the cheapest on the market at $199 and has an impressive battery life of two to three days, meaning users do not have to charge their watch every night. However, the watches run on Tizen OS, a fledgling mobile operating system, rather than Google's Android software. LG G watch R . LG joined Motorola as the latest manufacturer to release a smartwatch with a round face in September last year. It runs Android Wear, has a 1.3in diameter touchscreen and comes with 4GB of storage. As well as being waterproof, the watch features a heart-rate sensor on the rear, but doesn't have a GPS sensor. It connects to any Android phone running 4.3 or higher, via Bluetooth, and can also be controlled using voice commands. At $332 it is more expensive than the Moto 360 and the Samsung Gear S, but is still cheaper than the Apple Watch. 'Android Wear needs more work,' said John McCann at TechRadar. 'It feels odd talking to your wrist and the price tag is hard to swallow. The LG Watch R is available with a choice of two straps, the first is made from leather, while the second is a metallic-link strap . Huawei watch . The Huawei Watch is powered by Android Wear, has a 1.4-inch touchscreen and comes with a built-in heart rate monitor. The crown, frame and hinge are made of scratch-resistant stainless steel and there will be 40 watch faces to choose from when it launches later this year. The watch will be available later this year across Europe, Asia and the US although the exact date and price information has not been announced. The 1.4-inch display has a resolution of 400 x 400 pixels, giving it a 286 pixel-per-inch (PPI) density. By comparison, the Moto 360 which also has a circular screen has a PPI of 205. PPI is an indicator of image sharpness, clarity and colour and the higher the number, the better. The firm has not yet revealed battery life details but said it would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with the device. Last week, MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston tested the gadget at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. 'The screen is bright and clear, but its size and the fact it is predominantly used to show notifications means there is little added benefit to this,' she said. 'There will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and I can see it being popular with both sexes. Previous watches such as the Moto 360 feel more masculine, for example. 'Huawei would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success, but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch I’ve seen.' Huawei chief executive Richard Yu, pictured, unveiled the watch in Barcelona earlier this month .","Apple unveiled its Watch today in minute detail at event in San Francisco .

"The dogs taking part in the agility events at Crufts each year appear to have the time of their lives. And now you can live their moment with them thanks to a POV GoPro recording of two dogs taking part in the Flyball. In the video dog owners can be seen attaching cameras to the collars of a pair of excited pooches – a Border Collie and a Springer Spaniel. The owners attach GoPro cameras to the collars of the dogs before they take part in the Flyball . Barking in excitement, the Border Collie waits for its owner’s command to go and then springs into action jumping over the four gates and pouncing on the spring-loaded pad at the end. After catching the tennis ball the dog turns and makes its way back – the GoPro picking up the frenetic footage of the dog bounding happily towards its owner. Next is the turn of the Springer Spaniel who, if possible, appears to run even quicker. Hurdling the gates and collecting the ball, the dog runs back towards its owner and jumps up excitedly. Ready, steady, go: The Border Collie is held in place by its owner and waits for its command to go .

"A 13-year-old Missouri girl has been found 850 miles from home in New Mexico with a 55-year-old man who allegedly kidnapped her after she developed a relationship with him over Facebook. Hannah Kennish sneaked out of her mother's house in Montrose, Missouri, Sunday morning and met Raymond Vallia, a married grandfather who had driven up from Texas to pick her up, according to police. She was found safe Monday afternoon in Vallia's truck when New Mexico State Police troopers pulled them over on the highway outside Moriarty, New Mexico - about 40 miles from Albuquerque. She was nearly 850 miles from home. Hannah Kennish, 13, ran away from her home in the tiny town of Montrose, Missouri, and was kidnapped by a 55-year-old man she met online, police say . Raymond Vallia, a 55-year-old married grandfather, has been charged with her kidnapping after he carried on a relationship with Hannah for months, police say . Vallia lived in Texas with his wife (left) but kept an apartment in Albuquerque, according to police. He is awaiting extradition back to Missouri to face charges . Vallia, a Navy veteran who lives with his wife in Texas but keep an apartment in Albuquerque, has been charged with child kidnapping. He is being held in New Mexico while he awaits extradition back to Missouri. Her mother Amy Kennish says she awoke Sunday morning and discovered her daughter was not in her room an that the backdoor was open. After frantically searching her house and yard, she called police, she told the Kansas City Star. 'She just vanished,' Ms Kennish told the newspaper. An Amber Alert was issued.

"Two men have been jailed for smuggling 28 tonnes of cannabis into the UK - enough to get every person in the country stoned. Steven McDonald, 32, and John Wright, 66, were part of a crime network that trafficked drugs from the Netherlands on an 'industrial scale'. The cannabis they imported as part of the seven-year conspiracy would have had a street value in excess of £80million. Smugglers: Steven McDonald, 32, left, and John Wright, 66, right, were part of a crime network that trafficked drugs into the country on an 'industrial scale'.

The pair were caught when Border Force officers at Harwich International Port, Essex, intercepted a 300kg haul of cannabis - worth roughly £1million - that had been hidden in boxes of ceramic tiles. They replaced the drugs, which had been packed in concealed compartments, with a dummy load. An undercover police officer then drove the lorry to an address in Whetstone, London. There, McDonald loaded the drugs into a waiting van as Wright kept watch, the court was told. McDonald, from Chatham, Kent, and Wright, from Hounslow, north London, were arrested after they were seen unloading the delivery at an address in Wembley, London. Raids on their homes led police to recover drug-dealing ledgers and evidence of at least 20 trips to the Netherlands by the pair. The two men admitted conspiring to import class B drugs at a hearing at Luton Crown Court last October. Wright was sentenced on Friday to nine years and four months and McDonald was handed an eight-year sentence.

Detective Inspector Steve Miles said: 'These men were involved in drug smuggling on a truly industrial scale over a number of years. 'The potential street value of the cannabis imported as part of this conspiracy would have been in excess of £80 million. 'Using their contacts with criminal networks in the Netherlands they were able to set up elaborate fronts to cover their activities.

"Since giving birth to her daughter Arabella four months ago, Rebecca Ferguson has become the victim of cruel taunts about her size 12 post-pregnancy body. But the singer has now hit back at her critics and vowed to resist the pressure to slim down. Speaking to Fabulous magazine, the 28-year-old former X Factor star confessed that recent comments aimed at her weight, and questions about when she'll 'drop the post-baby pounds', have left her more determined than ever to stand up for herself. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Ferguson gave birth to gorgeous baby Arabella just four months ago, but has faced constant questions, even from those close to her, about how and when she'll lose her 'baby weight' The singer says even though she's only a size 12 following her third pregnancy, there has been a lot of pressure on her as a celebrity mum to 'snap back into shape' within a few weeks (Left: Rebecca during her third trimester and right: Rebecca in a bikini last month . She said 'There's this culture where we celebrate people snapping back into shape a week after the birth, but I don't want to be one of those people - I just want to enjoy Arabella.' Rebecca, who has never named the father of Arabella publicly, also has two other children called Lillie, aged 10, and Karl, nine, with her former boyfriend and teenage sweetheart Karl Dures, 29. And the singer now admits that she regrets not having had this empowering new mindset after she had her other kids. Describing how she felt as a new mum in previous years, the Get Happy singer said, 'When I look back, I think I should have just enjoyed my babies and not worried about my weight or being skinny. 'I'm curvy, I've got thighs, but I'm not big. I eat healthily and I'm breastfeeding, so I know the weight will come off naturally.' Rebecca pictured with her two older children Lillie 10, (left) and Karl, nine, (right) Currently promoting her new album Lady Sings The Blues, it would be easy for Rebecca to feel the need to slim down for upcoming photo shoots and interviews. But while some celebrities are famed for getting their impossibly taut figures back just weeks after giving birth, Rebecca says she's not feeling that pressure this time around. Instead, she's standing up for new mums everywhere, by taking aim at the critics who try to publicly shame women into losing weight. The former X Factor contestant has refused to name and shame her weight critics, but revealed some have been a lot closer to home than she ever imagined (Pictured left: In concert at the St James Theatre, London, last month, and right: on This Morning last week) She said: 'Women's bodies are amazing, what our bodies can do is incredible so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that, they're all distractions. 'They rob us of what we should be focusing on and that's sad.' Though the singer has refused to name and shame her own critics, she has revealed that they're a lot closer home than she ever imagined. 'I just want to enjoy Arabella,' said Rebecca, who previously worried about dropping post-baby pounds as quickly as possible (Rebecca pictured with her newborn) Rebecca also spoke of her toughest year yet during the interview, when her partner walked out after discovering she was pregnant with Arabella. She revealed that although it has been hard to live life as a single mother again, she is now moving forward and enjoying her life as a new mum. The star hasn't been left completely on her own though - her ex-partner Karl pops by regularly to help look after the children. And while Rebecca admits that many of their close friends and family would love to see them get back together, and she is open to the idea, she is enjoying being on her own for the time being. Rebecca flaunted her new curves on the red carpet at the Brit Awards last month and says she's proud of her womanly shape .","Critics have made cruel taunts about Rebecca Ferguson's post-baby body .

"A Chinese holidaymaker has been hit with a fine for washing her feet in a public bathroom on one of Thailand’s picturesque tourist islands. The woman was spotted washing her feet in a sink less than 30 minutes after island officials posted a ‘no foot washing’ sign in the loo. The warnings were posted in bathrooms on the island of Phi Phi Don a few days after a group of Chinese tourists upset locals by washing their feet and sandals in hand basins. A Chinese tourist was fined in Thailand for washing her feet in a public bathroom on Phi Phi Don island . Koh Phi Phi-Nopparathara National Park Chief Chaithat Boonphupantanti told the Phuket Gazette: ‘She didn’t pay any attention to the sign directly in front of her. ‘Our officers took photos of her breaking the law before informing her that she was committing a crime.’ She was fined 1,000 baht (£20 or $30) and her tour guide was informed of the incident, meaning she could face further discipline back home. Mr Boonphupantanti told the newspaper: ‘The sign is in English with clear pictures of what is prohibited. We will be looking to include Chinese-language warnings as well. The Chinese tourist washed her feet in a sink less than 30 minutes after these warnings were posted . ‘We were not rude or aggressive when we were dealing with the tourist. We are just trying to establish rules that will keep the place clean and beautiful.’ The relationship between Chinese tourists and Thai locals has become strained following a series of high-profile incidents that have led to stern warnings from the Chinese government and an etiquette guide being published by Thailand’s tourist board. Earlier this week, photos that showed Chinese visitors washing their feet and sandals in public sinks in Phi Phi led to outrage, with locals insisting that the holidaymakers committed a cultural faux pas. The signs went up in public bathrooms after a group of visitors washed their feet in sinks earlier this week . An island official told NetEase, a Chinese media agency, that the holidaymakers’ actions were ‘inappropriate’ and that notices would be posted in public bathrooms to discourage the behaviour. Thailand is a popular destination for about four million Chinese tourists every year, but locals have expressed frustration and outrage in response to the actions of a handful of visitors. Last month, Thailand’s tourist board announced that it would be handing out etiquette manuals to Chinese tourists who were visiting during the Chinese New Year. The relationship between Thais and Chinese tourists has been strained by a series of high-profile incidents . The manuals outlined how the holidaymakers are expected to behave while they visit Thailand. They were created after the Thai government received complaints from locals, who accused Chinese visitors of defecating in public, causing traffic accidents with reckless driving, and defacing tourist attractions. Chinese tourists were temporarily banned from even entering Wat Rong Khun, the Buddhist White Temple in Chiang Rai, after complaints that they had ruined the toilets.","Holidaymakers were photographed in bathroom on island of Phi Phi .

"Robert Durst's lawyer has dismissed his clients apparent confession during the final seconds of HBO's The Jinx docudrama and said the unguarded comments could be interpreted in a 100 different ways. The six part series concluded last Sunday with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. 'There it is. You're caught. Killed them all. Of course,' Durst was heard to mumble to himself. Scroll down for video . HBO's six part docudrama concluded last Sunday with eccentric millionaire Durst off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live . Durst was heard to mumble to himself 'killed them all, of course' in an unguarded moment off camera featured at the end of the final episode of HBO's The Jinx . Durst was arrested by police in New Orleans just hours before the show was broadcast and has since been charged with murder in the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. There is speculation that Durst's explosive comments could be used against him in court, but attorney Dick DeGuerin said they prove nothing. 'There's one hundred ways of interpreting it ... one of 'em being very Shakespearean. The soliloquy,' he told 48 Hours. Famously used by Shakespeare in a number of his plays, a soliloquy is an act of speaking one's thoughts aloud when by oneself or regardless of any hearers. For instance Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' speech. 'If you are a student of Shakespeare, as I am, you'll understand that what I'm talking about,' said DeGuerin. He said he first heard Durst's recorded comments 'along with the rest of America' when it was broadcast last Sunday. Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, has compared his client's apparant confession to a Shakespearean soliloquy and claims that it could be interpreted in a hundred different ways . The lawyer also said that it is well know that Durst talks to himself and 'that's just one of his quirks.' 'There are people who feel like he got set up. ...My daughter's a journalist, and she was outraged at what Jarecki and his producers pulled.' DeGuerin also said he was 'astonished' that Durst was interviewed by Los Angeles prosecutors for three hours without his lawyer present after his arrest last Saturday. 'Bob is not sophisticated, he is intelligent, he's got Asperger's,' said DeGuerin explaining why his client hadn't simply refused to speak until he had his counsil present. DeGuerin filled court papers on Friday in which he claims Durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, Gibbens and DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They argue that he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,' DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told KTRK-TV. DeGuerin also accused Andrew Jarecki, the director of The Jinx, right, of setting up Robert Durst . 'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.' The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center. He is expected to appear in court on Monday . Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but he is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.' Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.","Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, has dismissed his clients apparent confession during HBO's The Jinx docudrama .

"Some people think of the Women's Institute of just jam and Jerusalem. But as the WI celebrates its 100th anniversary, a new book has been published which offers an insight into the history and politics behind the famous British organisation. Mavis Curtis' book, The WI: A Centenary History, has studied the suffragists who made the WI one of the most important movements for women in the 20th century. Scroll down for video . A member of the WI demonstrates how to bottle fruit to an eager group of students . While many think of the WI as a place where older ladies go to make jam, sing Jerusalem and learn skills like flower arranging and sewing, it has actually been behind some of the biggest social changes in British history. The first WI meeting in the UK was held in Anglesey, north Wales, on September 16, 1915 as a way to encourage women to become more involved in producing food during the First World War. But it went on to spearhead campaigns to improve living conditions and the environment, tackle unemployment, get free family planning, more nursery education for children and even world peace. The movement grew rapidly and now has 212,000 members in about 6,600 groups. They have raised many millions of pounds for charity over the last century. It gave bored middle-class women an outlet for their organisational skills and the opportunity to practice public speaking while providing working-class countrywomen with  the chance to see more of the wider world around them. Trish Stewart (left) of Rylstone and District  WI came up with the idea of posing naked for a calendar to raise money for charity. Right, Judith Connolly, of the same WI, also strikes a pose . Even the Queen Mother was a member of the WI. Mrs Curtis started researching her book after moving to rural Oxfordshire in 2004 and joining the local WI. After writing an article about WI banners, she became interested in the movement and interviewed people from WI groups around the country, collecting stories and nostalgic photographs. The black and white pictures capture classic images associated with the WI, including a young Queen Mother watching a chair caning demonstration, a group preparing fruit for jam making and women waving off a horse and cart after a course on caravanning. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, a member of the WI, watches a chair caning demonstration in 1938 . Lady Denham, chair of the first WI, and, right, the new book marking 100 years of the organisation . The book covers the very beginnings of the movement right through to modern women like the Calendar Girls making their mark. 'It's not always easy to discover what women have achieved,' said Mrs Curtis. 'In the 19th and into the 20th century, women's influence was often exercised through the men in their lives and women's groups have had a similarly low profile.' She said she was surprised to discover the real political movement behind the organisation. The first organisers were ex-suffragists who felt that now women had the vote, they needed an education to give them the confidence to make their mark on the world that was opening up to them. Women collect fruit and vegetables ready to make chutney during the war . Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of the American president Franklyn D Roosevelt, talks to a member of Barham WI in 1942 . She said: 'When I started looking into it I was surprised that a lot of the people who started the WI were suffragists. 'They gave the WI a political twist, using it to educate women in citizenship, give them a new role in society, and that really grabbed me. 'It was about valuing women's work in the home and because it valued the work they did, they could take time away from the home to increase their skills. 'It improved their lives and opened them up to the outside world.' Her book explores key figures in the movement, like Lady Denman, the WI's first formidable chairman and her vice-chairman Grace Hadow, as well as pivotal changing points, like when the Welfare State was introduced. 'The WI had been trying to influence politics all through the 1920s and 30s. They were working all the time to improve living conditions and battle deprivation. 'But the introduction of the Welfare State took those goals away from them - they were no longer needed to do things like raise money for the local hospital. 'So they began looking at the environment and started the Keep Britain Tidy campaign. They worked with other groups to improve the world.' The WI reached its peak in the 1980s when it had more than 9,000 groups around the country, although it was viewed by the general public as being old-fashioned and insignificant. Members of Malton WI set up their market stall in the 1940s . A WI working party making fur coats from rabbit skins for the people of Russia in 1944 . In 1999 a group of women from Rylstone and District WI in North Yorkshire changed that when they turned a personal tragedy into a collective triumph. They produced a nude calendar of some of the members to raise money for a sofa at the hospital where one of the member's husbands was being treated for leukaemia. Their success was completely unprecedented and their 'alternative WI calendar' went on to raise £3 million for Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research. The 'Calendar Girls' spawned a successful film and play and inspired other groups, sports teams and organisations to make their own nude charity calendars. Mrs Curtis said: 'The Calendar Girls rejuvenated everything. They overturned the idea of the WI as an old fashioned collection of elderly ladies who made jam and sang Jerusalem. 'After that the WI got more young groups. There has been a renewed interest in the organisation.' The WI still promotes the home skills it taught when it first started - holding lectures, demonstrations and workshops on all sorts of activities. The end of a caravan course at Denman College in 1948 . A group prepares fruit for jam making . Spindle-spinning wool gathered from the hedges in East Kent during the Second World War . 'I've just done Somerset patchwork for the first time and soon I'll be learning how to paint blown eggs,' added Mrs Curtis. 'It's such fun and it's so out of the norm of what I usually do.' However, the WI also still tackles bigger issues too - violence against women, the environment, health and justice. 'It's a really nice organisation, everyone looks after one another. 'But they're very modest, they're not very good at telling people outside the organisation how much they do. 'I think it has to work on what it's always worked on - valuing women for who they are. 'I think one of the newer, younger members I spoke to summed it up perfectly. 'She said ""it's really nice to feel part of a body of women of all ages who have contributed so much to improving life for women"". We want that to carry on.'

"A man has been brutally assaulted on a St. Louis light rail car after he refused to give his opinion on the shooting of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, last August. David Autry, 43, was travelling home on the MetroLink train at 10pm on Monday when he was approached by a young man in a red T-shirt and baseball cap. The shocking incident was captured on the train's surveillance camera and was also recorded by a passenger who posted his cell phone footage online. Scroll down for video .

The video shows the suspect unleash a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who tries to block them with his hand and forearms, then the attacker kicks Autry in the head, right . The video shows the man in the red T-shirt approach Autry who was sitting at the front of the train. According to Autry, the attacker first asked to use his cell phone. When he refused, the man asked for his opinion on the death of Michael Brown. 'I responded I was too tired to think about it right now,' Autry told KMOV. 'The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face.' The video shows the suspect unleash a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who tries to block them with his hand and forearms. Two other men, described by police as in their 20s, then join in. As the train pulled into a station, the man in the red T-shirt kicks his victim in the head before escaping. The train's surveillance cameras clearly captured  their faces and police have said that they face possible charges of third-degree assault. David Autry said he was most upset that no one stepped in to help him and worse he could hear people laugh . The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, but declined medical treatment. Autry told KMOV he was more upset that no one stepped in to help and worse he could hear people laugh. 'I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,' he said. 'And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911.' Autry has said he would prefer not to use public transportation in future and he has set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $5,000 to buy a motorcycle. The page was setup on Saturday and he has already raised over $1,500. Autry also plans to donate some of the proceeds to neighborhood victims of violent crimes. Unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson in nearby Ferguson last August following an altercation. The incident sparked days of violent protests, as did the decision by a grand jury not to indict Wilson last November. The train's surveillance cameras captured clear images of the attackers' faces. They face possible charges of third-degree assault, police said .","David Autry, 43, was brutally assaulted last Monday night after he refused to give his opinion on the shooting of Michael Brown .

"Sex offender: Andrew Hutchinson, 29, pleaded guilty to 27 counts of rape and voyeurism when he appeared at Oxford Crown Court this morning . A senior nurse who filmed himself raping unconscious patients in an A&E ward is facing a lengthy jail sentence after admitting a string of offences on victims as young as ten. Andrew Hutchinson, 29, abused women under general anaesthetic as they lay in hospital beds behind curtains at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. The nurse even stole a medical camera from the hospital so he could film up a woman’s skirt as she stood by her sick friend’s bedside. Away from the hospital, Hutchinson volunteered as a paramedic at the trendy Wilderness festival in Oxfordshire where he groped two young women who had passed out in the medical tent. He also used the medical camera – which is routinely used by doctors to examine the internal organs of patients – to film girls as young as ten getting changed at his local leisure centre. The nurse was eventually caught by police after two girls at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, saw him lurking near the women’s changing rooms and raised the alarm. Hutchinson was arrested in November 2013 by police officers outside the leisure centre. Detectives found footage of his attacks on his mobile phone, computer, a memory stick and a camera. They also found 1,786 indecent images of children on his computer and phone. When officers contacted his victims, none had any idea that she had been sexually abused because they were either unconscious, anaesthetised or being secretly filmed. Hutchinson appeared at Oxford Crown Court yesterday where he pleaded guilty to all 28 charges put to him. He admitted two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity, 12 counts of voyeurism, five counts of making indecent images of children, one count of outraging public decency, two counts of theft and one count of possession of a Class B drug. The court heard that police had identified ten victims – females aged from ten to 35. Police have been unable to trace one of the victims who was attacked at the hospital and they have been unable to establish the identities of a further 18 victims who were filmed by Hutchinson at the leisure centre. Caught on camera: This CCTV image shows Hutchinson, top, in the leisure centre where he was found to be spying on women . His rape victims were an 18-year-old woman attacked in October 2011 and a 35-year-old woman abused in February 2012. Both were under general anaesthetic at the time in the A&E department. Hutchinson, who had a girlfriend, became a nurse on the A&E wing of John Radcliffe Hospital in 2006. At some point he was promoted to the rank of senior nurse which meant he was trusted to treat patients on his own. The court was told he had no previous convictions and was thought to be a reliable and diligent member of staff. His barrister Claire Fraser said her client had described his behaviour as an ‘addiction he has had over a number of years’. Crime scene: Hutchinson raped two women as they lay unconscious in the A&E department he worked in at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) Caught: The nurse was found to be filming victims at the White Horse Leisure Centre in Abingdon, which led to police discovering his other crime . Judge Zoe Smith remanded him into custody and adjourned sentencing until April 27. She ordered a senior probation officer to prepare a report on Hutchinson to enable her to assess his level of danger to the public. Theft: The nurse stole this Nasopharyngoscope - used for inernal examinations - and used it to film up a woman's skirt as she visited a friend in hospital . Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Johns from Thames Valley Police said: ‘I am pleased that Hutchinson has pleaded guilty to his offences and spared his victims having to endure a trial to receive justice. This has been a complicated and unusual case as the victims of his sex offences were not aware that offences took place because they were not conscious. ‘The victims showed great courage when informed of such distressing news. I have no doubt that Hutchinson would have continued to offend had he not been arrested.’ Mark Power, of the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, added: ‘We have been shocked and horrified by the behaviour of the individual, who so badly let down both the patients he was entrusted to care for and his fellow colleagues and who totally failed in his professional duties and responsibilities as a nurse. ‘I would wish to reassure members of the public that the welfare and safety of our patients is always our first priority.’ Mr Power added: ‘Thames Valley Police has been conducting an extensive investigation and we have done everything possible to support this process. ‘Since his arrest, the individual has not worked in any part of the Trust and is no longer an employee of ours.’","Andrew Hutchinson abused women as they lay unconscious in hospital .

"It has been branded as ingenious by some and is expected to be snapped up by technology fans when it is released next month. But skeptical social media users have taken the opportunity to mock the launch of Apple's new Watch with a selection of memes. Following the announcement of the device's details by the company today, a collection of photos depicting homemade Apple Watches slowly started to appear. They included: people attaching iPhones to their wrists with elastic bands; using watchstraps and an iPod Nano to create a lookalike; and some simply stuck a piece of fruit to their hand. Scroll down for video . This social media user took the opportunity to mock Apple's latest release by attaching the fruit to his wrist . One person took aim at what they believe the battery life on the device may be. It is claimed it will have power for up to 18 hours . Kevin Rose adapted the 1997 Apple advert featuring the Dalai Lama to have him wearing the new watch . This user simply stuck a number of appliances - including a calculator, a phone, scisssors and a GameBoy - to their wrist to display the gadget's versatility . Dan Sinker mocked the $10,000 top price tag of the gadget, branding it the 'Class War' edition . This man shunned sticky tape and instead balanced the apple on his watch . Others used the opportunity to share their fears the battery life will be low while others tried to depict its similarity to other devices. One, however, simply stuck a number of appliances - including a calculator, a phone, scisssors and a GameBoy - to their wrist to display the gadget's versatility. Since its unveiling in September the Watch has been shrouded in mystery, with Apple's boss Tim Cook teasing features at every available opportunity. However the features were fully released during a launch event in San Francisco on Monday. The CEO added that with typical use the battery life is likely to be 18 hours. What 'typical' use entails remains unknown. This Twitter user sparked fears the versatile watch could be taken too far in some instances . Erin Gloria Ryan threatened to rob someone if they were wearing the $10,000 Apple watch . This man suggested that whatever Tim Cook said in his presentation, the Watch would fly off of the shelves regardless of the criticism . Owen Good referenced his grandfather in a tweet, saying he wore it every day of his life for 15.5 months . An Apple sticker is placed over this watch in a bid to make it look like a so-called Apple watch . One skeptic used crossed pieces of string to keep the iPhone safely on his wrist . Prices for the Sport model start at $349 in the US and £299 in the UK, while the stainless steel Watch starts at $549 (£479) and the Edition costs from a staggering $10,000 (£8,000). The most expensive model in the US will cost $17,000 (£11,200). Mr Cook said at the event at Yerba Buena Centre in California: 'This is the most personal device we have ever created. It's not just with you, it's on you.' Apple initially announced its Watch in September at its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch event in California. It comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all models are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions.

"Friends of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz claim he is being framed for murder as part of an elaborate cover-up by his airline company to hide mechanical faults with the plane. They have set up a Facebook page titled 'Andreas Lubitz A320, we are against the hunt' where they have been sharing their theories about the cause of the Alps disaster. Some suggest the black box voice recorder had been tampered with by Germanwings parent company, Lufthansa, to make it appear as if Lubitz had deliberately crashed the plane. Meanwhile, it has emerged that Lubitz's home that he shared with his girlfriend in Dusseldorf has been blurred out on Google Maps in an apparent attempt by family to quell frenetic focus on his life. Scroll down for video . Attracting huge fan club: Hundreds of supporters of pilot Andreas Lubitz have taken to Facebook to make outlandish claims that he is being framed for murder by Lufthansa to hide mechanical faults with the plane . Voicing their views: Supporters have have set up a Facebook page (above) titled 'Andreas Lubitz A320, we are against the hunt' where they have been sharing their theories about the cause of the Alps disaster . Data extracted from the voice recorder last week revealed how senior pilot Patrick Sonderheimer desperately tried to smash the cockpit door down after being locked out by his colleague. Prosecutors said Lubitz then proceeded to set the plane on a collision course with the mountain, killing all 150 people on board. However, commenters allege that the recordings were manufactured in some way by Lufthansa to hide mechanical problems with the plane, according to a report by Vocativ. Hundreds of its followers are understood to be from the pilot's home of Montabaur in Germany and its surrounding area. One supporter, who claims to be a former classmate, said: 'I believe in the innocence of Andy!' They also point out that the second black box data recorder had not yet been recovered from the crash site, which they claim was also proof of a cover-up. Others also suggested that one of Lubitz's former girlfriends was paid by the media to say that he had once planned to commit a 'heinous act' that would go down in history. Lufthansa declined to comment. It has also emerged that Lubitz's home that he shared with his girlfriend in Dusseldorf has been blurred out on Google Maps (above) in apparent attempt by his family to quell frenetic focus on his life . Lubitz is understood to have shared his flat (right) with his maths teacher girlfriend Kathrin Goldbach . In a separate development relatives have apparently asked Google to blur out Lubitz's home in Dusseldorf that he shared with girlfriend Kathrin Goldbach from its Maps service. The move came at some point over the last week since the Alps disaster. Individuals and governments can ask for Google Maps images to be blurred over privacy concerns. After concerns from government officials in 2010, the internet giant offered an opt-out policy to Germans in order to 'obey local privacy laws.' Around 250,000 Germans are believed to have taken up the offer, according to Vocativ. The flat has been the scene of intense focus since the crash and reported claims that Miss Goldbach, 26, discovered that she was expecting his baby as little as two weeks ago. The pair, who are said to have had a patchy relationship over the last seven years, were letting the pregnancy news sink in when Lubitz crashed the jet, according to German newspaper Bild. Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his 'suicidal tendencies' were introduced as a consequence of the Nazis. The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster. But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law. Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany. This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death. Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent. With respect to medical data, the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder. Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy. Many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege.","Supporters set up Facebook page 'Andreas Lubitz, we are against the hunt'

"If you've been in a single slump for too long, perhaps it could be time for a scenic change? According to a new survey from dating site Elite Singles, it seems some Australian cities score higher on the sexy scale than others. Asking over 28,000 singletons between the ages of 30-55 to rate their level of attractiveness on a national scale, results revealed some cities had less qualms rating themselves than others when it came to a hot list. Sexy singles! New survey from  Elite Singles website reveals the top  cities with most attractive singles . Beaches home to babes: The Gold Coast, Broadbeach and Burleigh Heads rated high on attractive singles . Nominating themselves the sexiest singles on the scene was Sydney ranking in at number one,  Melbourne at number two and third sexiest was Queensland's Gold Coast. While the sunnier cities seemed to rate higher, with Brisbane, Perth, Sunshine Coast, Newcastle, and Coffs Harbour all making the top ten, smaller populated capitals like Adelaide and Canberra also made the cut, scoring seven and eight respectively. The study also narrowed results to indicate key suburbs that were voted most in each city, making it even easier for singles to source Australia's most attractive unattached by region. Sizzling Sydney: Local Sydneysider's rated themselves highest on the most attractive single scale . 1. Sydney . 2. Melbourne . 3. Gold Coast . 4. Brisbane . 5. Perth . 6. Sunshine Coast . 7. Adelaide . 8. Canberra . 9. Newcastle . 10. Coffs Harbour . In Sydney, Balmain in the city's inner west comes in at number one, Lane Cove in the lower north shore second and northern beach  suburb Manly takes third place. In Melbourne, the inner South reigned supreme with Toorak (five kilometres South-East of the CBD) coming in at the top, South Bank (one km South from the CBD) scoring second and Port Melbourne (five kilometres South-West of the CBD) coming in third most attractive. Queenslander's however have a wealth of suburbs to choose from, according to the results. The Gold Coast hosts the hottest in Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach and Burleigh Heads. Whereas Brisbane CBD's finest were said to be in Paddington, New Farm and Hamilton. Lastly, for Perth locals, the top talent was found to be in Scarborough, Como and Canningvale. Less populated cities like Darwin favoured a more modest rating and as a result ranked significantly lower on the list, coming in as the 87th most attractive singles city in Australia, while Hobart missed out on a listing completely. Melbourne minxes: Melbourne was nominated as second sexiest city for singles . Down-to-earth Darwin:  The Northern Territory capital scores low at 87th most attractive city due to their modesty . As reported in the Northern Territory News, Darwinian's believe the reason for their low ranking isn't based on their attractive pool but  the fact  they have a more down-to-earth nature than  rival states. 'Sydney people put much more effort in every day - they put make-up on  to go to the corner store, [whereas] Darwin blokes are  rugged which is much better than guys who shave everywhere and spend hours getting ready,' said local Aleisha Boyd, 21. As a self assessed 'attractivity' survey, the overall results do indicate while Sydney leads the way in confidence, the verdict is still out for which state actually holds the most genetically blessed singles.","Dating website Elite Singles surveyed 28,000 single Australians .

"As an aid to literacy, generations of pre-teen youngsters followed the everyday adventures of Peter and Jane, the carefree stars of the Ladybird Book series. Thirty-six of the books were issued as part of the publisher’s Key Words Reading Scheme between 1964 and 1967 and remained in print, selling 80 million copies worldwide, with the illustrations undergoing an occasional redesign. Today, the Peter and Jane books are a valuable piece of British social history, and a side-by-side comparison compiled by a grown-up fan of the books has underlined just how much life changed during the years they continued to engage young minds in countless homes and schools throughout Britain. Where once the brother and sister — like their equally popular middle-class contemporaries Janet and John — could be seen doing all the things a boy and girl might be expected to do in the Sixties, health ’n’ safety, sexual and racial discrimination and political correctness intervened to shepherd them into a very different world. Helen Day, who started a ladybirdflyawayhome.com website dedicated to old Ladybird Books, posted ‘then and now’ photos on Twitter @LBFlyawayhome and invited followers to guess the respective dates. But the pictures instantly became a fascinating chronicle of the subtle lifestyle changes that Peter and Jane underwent in the years following their first appearance. ‘I was brought up reading the 1964 books and I loved them because they were very idyllic,’ said Helen Day, a 50-year-old teacher from Hertfordshire. ‘I was less keen on the later books because they were too much like real life.’ Peaceful waters: In the Sixties drawing, Peter paddles a rubber dinghy without a care while Pat, the family's Irish setter, splashes happily along beside him. By the Seventies, mop-haired Peter must wear a brightly coloured life jacket . All change: Peter, Jane and their friend keeps a tight rein on the docile Pat as smartly dressed Daddy gallantly helps his equally immaculate wife off the train, holding her handbag as he does so. In the Seventies, Mum forges ahead while Dad, still lumbered with the bag, follows meekly behind . Playing a straight bat: Sixties Peter stands poised at the crease while Jane, as befitting a soppy girl, bowls timidly underarm. By the Seventies, it's Jane who's wielding the willow, thwacking a ball clear to the boundary over her brother's flailing fingers . Child's play: Jane, demure in a dress and sensible shoes, looks at the dolls in a Sixties toy shop. a decade later, the tomboyish, jean wearing Jane'e attention is caught by a go-kart while the selection of toys for sale includes Basil brush and a Dalek, reflecting the all-pervading influence of children's television . Sunset over suburbia: The Sixties view from Peter and Jane's bedroom window was of unspoilt greenery. By the Seventies, a housing estate of semi-detached 'des res' properties had sprung up, while beyond them a tower block loom ominously . That's the ticket: The Sixties children make friends on a train ride to the country. By the culturally diverse Seventies, it's a young black friend who is sharing his apples with them. The trilby-wearing gent in green seems to have strayed in from the fifties though. Perhaps he thought he was catching The Titfield Thunderbolt . Everything in the garden's lovely: Peter helps Daddy tend to the dahlias while Jane and Mummy read quietly. By the Seventies, Dad's lazing in the chair with Mum hard at work in the borders. He only gets up to stop Peter and Jane squabbling about a book. There's probably a transistor radio blaring somewhere too . Running free near the water (left) but an adult is later added to indicate the children were supervised (right) Seatbelts have been added in the picture, right, but safety wasn't such a big issue in the earlier version .

"Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files . A Polish man stole secret documents about British nuclear submarines from a neighbour and tried to sell them to his government for £50,000, a court heard today. Marcin Kostrzewa, 31, of Plymouth, Devon, allegedly broke into Shane Spencer’s next-door flat and took the restricted files which were stored in his airing cupboard. They only met when Kostrzewa knocked on Mr Spencer’s door to complain about noise - but he became ‘infatuated’ with him after finding out he worked with submarines, the court was told. Kostrzewa allegedly took the documents after searching online for terms such as ‘spy games’, ‘spies’ and ‘secret documents’ - then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers. Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said Kostrzewa entered the flat of Mr Spencer, who works as an engineer on submarines at the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. Mr Chalk told Plymouth Crown Court the Polish man took ‘sensitive or secret material’ and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police. Kostrzewa thought he was in contact with a man called 'Alex' from the Polish government - but in fact he was a UK security services agent. Mr Chalk said the two men met in a Plymouth hotel and their conversation about the deal was recorded. Kostrzewa also allegedly claimed he had stolen the contents of a computer hard drive. The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines. Base: Mr Spencer is an engineer on submarines in the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth . Mr Spencer first met Kostrzewa in late 2011 when the Pole had knocked on his door to complain about noise, the court was told. Mr Spencer’s girlfriend Sophie Berriman concluded that Kostrzewa was lonely and kept turning up at weekends and in the evenings with alcohol. She thought he was ‘infatuated with Shane’. Mr Chalk said: ‘He said he worked on submarines and showed him a picture of a bulkhead - and that image excited the defendant.’ That unrestricted image from a Trafalgar class submarine was one of those later stolen - and Mr Chalk said the Pole must have seen the folder, which was also stolen. Mr Chalk said Kostrzewa’s frequent attendance began to grate on Mr Spencer and his friends, they refused to answer the door to him and he could be heard saying ‘you reject me, you reject me’. The court heard that the Pole asked Mr Spencer out for a drink but Kostrzewa let himself back into his neighbour’s flat alone - telling a flatmate he had ‘lost’ Mr Spencer. Hearing: Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) was told the Polish man took 'sensitive or secret material' and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police . Miss Berriman also found that she had lost her key to her boyfriend’s flat and Kostrzewa let her into the shared entrance - and then allegedly said he had found her key on the floor of a Co-op store. She was surprised that the key had fallen off the tight-fitting keyring. In the covert recording with the agent Alex, the defendant allegedly said he had ‘acquired keys to Shane Spencer’s flat’. Mr Chalk said on various dates in March 2014, Kostrzewa used search engines on his computer, entering words including ‘spy games, secret documents, spies, consulate Republic of Poland’. Mr Spencer went to Gibraltar to work from March 19 to 25. The prosecutor said: ‘He then offered to sell off the documents relating to UK submarines to the Polish government.’ In April agent Alex rang the Pole and they met on April 10 in Plymouth, going to a hotel room which was rigged up with hidden recording gear. He allegedly said he found a key to access the flat and stole the relevant papers and planned to copy Mr Spencer’s hard drive - and wanted £50,000 for the information. Alex said he 'needed time to consider the documents'. In the recorded conversation, the defendant said ‘this is only the beginning’. Aerial view: The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer at Devonport (above) and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines . He told Alex his neighbour Mr Spencer ‘designs nuclear submarines’ - and said Mr Spencer did not know he had stolen the material from him, the court was told. Kostrzewa allegedly said he pulled out the sheets of paper and replaced them empty sheets of paper to make the file look as thick in the folder. He said he and Mr Spencer ‘booze it up on the vodka’ but his pharmacist girlfriend is intelligent and stops Mr Spencer talking about his work as a mathematician and physicist. Alex asked him how much he wanted for ‘all of it’ with the hard disk - and Kostrzewa requested£50,000 for the material as ‘there are over 20 boats’ and ‘they are boats that are already sailing’. Kostrzewa left the room and Met Police officers turned up at the hotel and studied the documents. Alex allegedly then offered the Pole £4,000 but he said that ‘was not enough’. However, he said he would think about it - but would want the cash in £20 notes, the court was told. As he left the room he was arrested by police. Kostrzewa denies burglary between January and April 2014. The trial continues.

"Longreach in Central West Queensland is famous for Qantas Airline, also known as the Flying Kangeroo, but another airborne animal is nowhere near as popular. Grasshoppers in 'plague proportions' have destroyed hectacres of land in Longreach in recent days after a severe drought there. ‘You walk out on your garden and they just swarm up from the lawn’ one local told 7News. Scroll down for video . What used to be grassy fields is now just barren ground after the grasshopper infestation . The grasshoppers are in their hundreds of thousands 7News reported. They are finally moving on but they have laid eggs and left devastation behind. The locusts have destroyed any greenery they can find, chewing up the leaves and lawns, and stripping trees bare. 'It's at plague proportions here,' another local said. Although some insects thrive in moist conditions, heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers. They are the most most common insects that cause problems during periods of heat and drought. The Australian Plague Locust Commission told ABC News it has been monitoring the situation, but there was no plague. All that's left on the tree is the fruits as the grasshoppers ate all the foliage . ‘What we have got is some areas where there is a localised, high-density infestation,' spokesman Chris Adriaansen said. ‘But the extent of the infestation certainly does not qualify the current population levels to plague proportions. ‘We have been watching that population very closely, obviously. We have our own field staff based at Longreach and they are very aware of what is in that area.' Heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers . Even if the grasshoppers are about to move on they still have left a calling card that could prove disastrous in the future. ‘What we will see now is that those adults that are still in condition to do so will lay some eggs,"" he said. ‘We would expect that within the next two to four weeks we would start to see the third generation of nymphs coming out of the ground. ‘That generation and the extent and the density of that generation will determine what if any control is implemented.' Another worry are Kangeroos looking for food with groups of 25-30 coming in groups in and around the town. Until the grasshopper infestation it was the Flying Kangeroo that Longreach was famous for after one of the founding centres for Qantas, the Australian domestic and international airline. One of the airline's original hangars remains in use at the Longreach Airport and is listed on the Australian National Heritage List. The town is now the home of the Qantas Founders Outback Museum.

"A chip shop in the French skiing village of Val d'Isere has been forced to shut down after the former chairman of L'Oreal  complained about the 'nauseating smell' of chips wafting up his luxury lodge. Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones - a Welsh-born Oxford graduate who stepped down as head of the cosmetics giant in 2006 - had demanded the eatery close because it was an 'olfactory nuisance'. The multimillionaire - who received an £83million pay-off upon leaving L'Oreal - said the smell of the mobile snack stall represented 'an abnormal disturbance' to his life in Val d'Isere, adding that he felt it had also decreased the value of his luxury ski lodge. Now a French court has demanded owner Valerie Maerten close the stall, despite her lawyer having argued that his client's livelihood is more important than the retired businessman's 'precious nostrils' over the course of seven years of legal wranglings. Wealthy: Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones (pictured with his wife Cristina) had demanded the Val d'Isere chip show cease business because it was an 'olfactory nuisance' A French court has now demanded that the chip shop owner Valerie Maerten close her popular stall . Sir Lindsay was finally successful in having the chip shop closed today, having previously launched six other legal cases demanding that it cease operating. When the legal action was launched six years ago, he and three wealthy neighbours demanded damages for a decrease in the value of their homes. His lawsuit argues that the stall, which is extremely popular with skiers who buy chips there throughout the day, produces 'a very important olfactory nuisance due to the cooking and frying odours that rise up into their flats and on to their balconies'. What's more, it adds, the stall spoils the 'view and exceptional tranquility' of the apartment, as there are 'numerous chairs… multi-coloured parasols, dustbins and vehicles' in front of it, the paper said. However, Ms Maerten's lawyer, Maitre Francois Bern, retorted that multi-millionaire Sir Lindsay, whose former company makes world-famous scents, is engaging in 'judicial harassment' to protect nostrils accustomed only to inhaling fine aromas. During the trial he added: 'This is a lawsuit brought by rich people who live in silk and comfort, who only inhale perfume and who want to stop this lady from living.' Lost cause: Over the course of seven years of legal wranglings, Valerie Maerten's lawyer  argued that his client's livelihood is more important than the retired businessman's 'precious nostrils' Prestigious: Val d'Isere - the French Alps resort where the chip shop is based - attracts a well-heeled crowd . Sir Lindsay was finally successful in having the chip shop closed today, having previously launched six other legal cases demanding that it cease operating . Responding to the decision, Ms Maerten told WWD: 'I don’t know whether I will appeal the decision. This has been going on since 2008. I am financially and physically exhausted.' 'There’s been seven rulings, and they lost the first six, but not the last one,' she said, adding that the ruling has left her unemployed, although she confirmed that she has been given until the end of the current winter skiing system to wrap up the business. But she said that once the chip shop closes, it will be demolished within days. When the matter went to court in 2012, Ms Maertens said: 'I'm angry and I feel persecuted. For rich people, it's certain that a chip stall in front of them is going to be annoying but us, we have to work for a living. 'They complain about the noise and the smell of chips, but if you want peace and quiet, you don't buy an apartment at the foot of the slopes.' When Sir Lindsay took over L'Oreal's in the mid-1980s, annual sales were $3.7 billion, and when he stood down they were $14.5 billion. Much of the success was based on brilliant marketing, including slogans like 'Because You're Worth it'. As well as skiing, Sir Lindsay, who is now 68, is passionate about numerous sports including motor racing and sailing. He was knighted in 2005.","Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones described the chip shop as an 'olfactory nuisance'

"'A bubbly, caring person': Lisa Orsi, who died in Singapore this morning after suffering extreme altitude sickness on a volcano trek in Indonesia . A young British physiotherapist has died after suffering extreme altitude sickness during a volcano trek in Indonesia. Lisa Orsi, 22, from Derry city in Northern Ireland, was pronounced dead in Singapore this morning, two weeks after trekking on a popular route up a volcano on East Java. Her parents Dennis and Sharon were by her bedside as she slipped away in the early hours following extensive transplant surgery at Singapore General Hospital. Nine of Miss Orsi's organs will go to patients in need of transplants. Her parents said: 'Lisa was a bubbly, caring person whose infectious joy for life endeared her to so many people. We take comfort in their prayers and well-wishes at this time. 'Even in this dark hour we can look to take solace from knowing that even in her death Lisa's generosity has brought new life to others and given them a second chance.' Irish-born Miss Orsi, who moved to Derry from Donegal aged five, was described as a fit, healthy young woman, who enjoyed athletics and Gaelic football. She collapsed in the shower and fell into a coma after trekking a popular tourist route up an East Java volcano last month. Medics in Indonesia and Singapore spent the past fortnight trying to save her life before turning their attention to using her organs for donation. The law in Singapore makes it compulsory for people who die suddenly to have their organs donated unless they are Muslim or have expressly wished otherwise. Recently qualified as a physio, Miss Orsi was half way through a two year contract at Bright Vision Hospital in Hougang. She had been playing Gaelic football with the Singapore Gaelic Lions in her first year in the city. In a statement to the Press Association, Ms Orsi's parents added: 'The medical team at Siloam Hospital, Surabaya, who initially treated Lisa and the staff at Singapore General Hospital have provided excellent medical care. They have treated Lisa with great compassion and we will be forever appreciative of their efforts.' 'We brought Lisa back to Singapore as it is a place that is so very dear to her heart. She has always spoken of it as a second home and we have been so grateful to receive a homecoming welcome from her Singapore brothers and sisters. 'Lisa has been very fortunate to be surrounded by friends both from her working life and her club-mates from the Singapore Gaelic Lions. Gaelic Football has been a childhood passion for Lisa and we are overwhelmed by all that her GAA family have done for her.' 'Lisa's generosity has brought new life to others': Nine of Miss Orsi's organs will go to patients in need of transplants after medics in Indonesia and Singapore spent two weeks trying to save her life . In the clouds: Irish-born Miss Orsi, who moved to Derryaged five, was described as a fit, healthy young woman, who enjoyed athletics and Gaelic football. She moved to Singapore last year for work . The Orsi family are now making arrangements for their daughter's repatriation and funeral in her home city, possibly next week. They said it would be impossible to personally thank everybody who had helped them over the past two weeks. 'However, as a family, we would like to thank her best friends, Eve King and Sinead McElhinney, the clubs, schools and so many others at home in Ireland for their spontaneous outpouring of love and support. This includes her childhood school, Saint Patrick's and St Brigid's College, and Salford University alumni,' the parents said. The grieving couple paid special tribute to Ms Orsi's boss Limin Yong, who they said gave them so much guidance and assistance. They also thanked Irish politicians Pat Ramsey MLA and Pat 'The Cope' Gallagher MEP and Irish consular staff in both Indonesia and Singapore. 'Their help has been invaluable and we thank them for their ongoing efforts to assist Lisa and the Orsi family,' the couple said. The family also spoke highly about the work of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Asia and at home for helping to fund raise and offering any other support to them over the last two weeks.","Lisa Orsi fell into a coma after trekking up an east Java volcano last month .

"Students are being targeted on social media by escort agencies offering highly paid work. Freshers on Facebook and Twitter are increasingly being sent messages by groups looking for lap dancers, escorts and 'cam girls'. The adverts come as the average student debt rises to £44,000 following the introduction of £9,000 tuition fees in 2012. Lap dancing can earn students between £50 and £800 per night, according to research by the University of Leeds. Escorts can earn thousands of pounds per week. Saffron Gold is an escort agency near Manchester. It posted adverts in student groups including ‘Manchester and Salford University students’ and ‘University of Manchester – Freshers 2013/2014’ at the beginning of Freshers' Week . Men are more likely to perform from their bedrooms on webcams, which can earn them up to £100 per hour, The Times reported. Saffron Gold is an escort agency near Manchester. It posted adverts in student groups including ‘Manchester and Salford University students’ and ‘University of Manchester – Freshers 2013/2014’ at the beginning of Freshers' Week. The agency, which has a profile picture reading 'keep calm and book an escort', described their roles as flexible and said it was looking for 'attractive, charming ladies aged between 18 and 40 with good figures and great personalities'. It added: 'We are happy for ladies with different profiles to apply for our escort vacancies because all our clients are not the same and they have different needs and preferences.' In an earlier advert Saffron Gold wrote it was looking for 'new and experienced' girls. Twitter users in East Anglia were also targeted by an agency that sent dozens of messages urging students to join them. Anglian Escorts followed thousands of students in 2012 in the hope they would see its recruitment adverts. The life of an escort was made public by Dr Brooke Magnanti, 39, whose diary of her adventures was published anonymously under the pen name 'Belle de Jour' Its account was suspended - but it has since been reactivated and hundreds of messages are sent every day. In one Tweet the agency wrote: 'Looking to employ #escorts in East Anglia apply here! Premium escort agency.' A report completed at the University of Leeds found that club managers also deliberately put flyers out in Freshers' Week urging students to join. It said: 'A club manager in a northern city site explained how he always put flyers out at Freshers' Week inviting female students to audition.' London-based agency Haute Girls specifically advertises having students on its books. It states on its website: 'Faced with the options of poorly paid term time jobs and more lucrative escorting, a cash-strapped London student may turn to the later, especially when escorting gives them the extra time and flexibility to study.' The life of an escort was made public by Dr Brooke Magnanti, 39, whose diary of her adventures was published anonymously under the pen name 'Belle de Jour'. Her blog told of her life as a struggling graduate in London and working as call girl to fund her studies. Laura Watson, a spokesman for the English Collective of Prostitutes, said they mostly deal with female students on their hotlines. She said: 'From a student perspective there has definitely been an increase in calls to our helpline since loans were brought in.' Academics at Swansea University will release a report on the extent of students turning to the sex industry next week.","Escort agency posted in student groups on Facebook in Freshers' Week .

"The so-called ‘health tourism gap’ between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million (file picture) Hospitals’ failure to claw back the cost of treating Europeans is costing taxpayers millions of pounds a week, figures suggest. The so-called ‘health tourism gap’ between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million. It means the UK is now paying out £15 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill abroad for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors. The Prime Minister and Health Secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18. Both GPs and hospitals will be given incentives to identify non-British users of the NHS and payment procedures will be made easier. However, the latest Department of Health statistics indicate there is a long way to go. Released following a Freedom of Information request, they show that in 2013/14, British taxpayers handed £749.8million to European governments to pay for the care of UK citizens abroad. This has risen by £100million from £649.3million just a year before. But in the same period, the NHS managed to collect only £50.3million from European countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here. This is an increase on the £32million total the year before – but the number is still dwarfed by money going the other way. Ministers believe part of the problem is that hospitals do not ask enough questions to identify patients who should be paying for treatment. Figures which emerged at the weekend show the NHS is still chasing at least £62million of unpaid bills for foreigners’ care. One London hospital trust alone – King’s College – is owed almost £18million from overseas patients. One single patient at a different trust racked up an unpaid bill of more than £420,000. Others owe more than £100,000 for treatments including dialysis, bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, according to The Sunday Times. Health minister Dan Poulter was even photographed with a new mother from Zimbabwe who is still being pursued for a £3,000 bill. Two years ago, cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned many foreigners were travelling to Britain for expensive treatment and then leaving without paying. He said the NHS was also becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’. Last night Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, said: ‘We’re fortunate to have one of the only truly free at the point of need health services in the world. ‘But we are not the International Health Service, it’s the National Health Service. This is an issue which needs to be addressed.’ Ukip health spokesman Louise Bours said: ‘It is clear from these figures that hospitals in this country are way too lax in chasing up payment for health treatment for EU citizens.’ Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra £500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18 . Part of the gap is due to the fact that so many British pensioners retire to the continent. There may also be more tourists from Britain travelling to mainland Europe than the other way round. But there are more than a million migrant workers from the EU here, against far fewer Britons employed in other European countries. Under EU arrangements, UK citizens can be treated by other nations’ health services and the bill is sent back to Britain. In theory, these European nations should also be billed when their citizens are treated by the NHS. In 2013/14, the UK paid Ireland £246million for treating Britons who fell ill there. Only £22million came back the other way. Some £250million was paid to Spain but only £3.2million came back. France received £152million but returned just £7million. Italy got £6.2million and sent back £1.1million, while Greece collected £8.9million and returned £400,000. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We want international visitors to feel welcome to use the NHS, provided they pay for it – just as families in the UK do through their taxes. ‘Our plans will help recoup up to £500million a year by 2017/18.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Emergency medical treatment is one thing, but taxpayers cannot be expected to pick up the bill for expensive longer-term treatment for tourists. ‘Our authorities must do better to claw back the amount owed by visitors.' Zimbabwean-born Caroline Nyadzyao, who is being chased for £3,000 by the NHS after giving birth in a Norfolk hospital, meets with health minister Daniel Poulter . Smiling alongside a health minister at a Norfolk maternity unit in 2013, this new mum is still being chased for the £3,000 it cost the NHS to help her give birth. Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo’s unpaid bill is part of the £62million cost of ‘health tourism’ to Britain. The 34-year-old, an advertising executive in Africa, was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the maternity suite was reopened. The mum said she complained to Mr Poulter about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it. But Mr Poulter has reportedly said he does not remember being told that. Miss Nyadzayo, now in Harare, told the Sunday Times it was ‘unfair ’ she was still being pursued, because the baby’s father is British. She said: ‘I know the system may believe I travelled to abuse the NHS benefits, but... I just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that?’ The couple were questioned about the birth when they entered Britain at Norwich Airport in October 2013. However, they were released when they agreed they would be paying for it. Miss Nyadzayo said: ‘I was told because I was 31 weeks’ pregnant it was likely I was going to use the NHS to my advantage. We said we would pay for the birth. But we had no idea how much we’d be charged.’","Hospitals still failing to claw back the cost of treating Europeans on NHS .

"Millions still use easy-to-crack passwords such as ‘qwerty’ and ‘123456’, but many people are choosing to use more complex sets of characters for our online accounts. However, a new study has found these seemingly random passwords may be more obvious to hack than you realise. Researchers have shown that passwords such as ‘mnbvcxz’, ‘qaz2wsx’ and ‘adgjmptw’ can be cracked in seconds - and adding numbers to your codes does little to boost its strength. Scroll down for video . The analysis was made by hosting firm WP Engine using 10 million recently leaked passwords. They spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people, such as ‘mnbvcxz’, ‘qaz2wsx’ and ‘adgjmptw’. This is because each of these words follow a certain pattern, or 'walk' on a keyboard (shown) The analysis was made by hosting firm WP Engine using 10 million passwords recently released by security consultant Mark Burnett. As with previous studies, researchers discovered the most common passwords are still ‘123456’, ‘password’, ‘qwerty’ and ‘111111’. They also went a step further and listed all 50 of the most used words, which additionally included ‘superman’ and ‘letmein’. These lists were then divided into sections including the top 10 colours, days of the week, fruits and animals used as passwords - which are ‘red’, ‘Friday’, ‘apple’ and ‘fish’ respectively. But during the analysis they spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people. Like with previous studies, the analysis discovered common passwords are still ‘123456’, ‘password’, ‘qwerty’ and ‘111111’. These lists were then divided into sections including the top 10 colours, days of the week, fruits and animals (pictured) - which are ‘red’, ‘Friday’, ‘apple’ and ‘fish’ respectively . On average more women were found to have longer passwords than men, with an entropy - or password strength - score of 25 and above. More than one in five people who added numbers to a word simply chose '1' For example, ‘qaz2wsx’ was in the top 30. They also noticed that a website called Zxcvbn scored these words as zero, or low, for so-called entropy. The 20th most common keyboard pattern in the list was ‘adgjmptw. This pattern is created when the nine keys on a number pad are pressed in order . Entropy is used to determine the strength of a password in terms of ‘information entropy’. This comes from information theory and is measured in bits. The more bits a word is assigned, based on the number of guesses it would take to crack, the stronger the password. Other words that received a low score include ‘qwertyuiop’, ‘1qaz2wsx’ and ‘zxcvbnm’. This is because each of these words follow a certain pattern on a keyboard, known as ‘keyboard walks’. There was an anomaly in this list, though, because the 20th most common keyboard pattern in this list of passwords was ‘adgjmptw’ - which on face value doesn’t appear to be an obvious keyboard pattern. However, following further investigation the team realised this pattern is created when the nine keys on a telephone number pad are pressed in order. The study said that his pattern in particular shows how password selection is changing as more people create them on touch devices. In addition to these passwords being common, the researchers added that password crackers such as Passpat specialise in such patterns, leaving them more vulnerable than some simpler passwords. People born in the 1980s were the most likely to use the word ‘love’ somewhere in their password. Almost 1.5 per cent of these passwords belonged to women compared to 0.7 per cent of men’s . Elsewhere, nearly half a million - or 420,000 (8.4 per cent) - of the 10 million passwords ended with a number between 0 and 99. And more than one in five people who added those numbers simply chose 1. Hackers can therefore try adding these numbers to the ends of words when trying to hack into an account. On average more women had passwords with an entropy score of 25 and above and people born in the 1980s were the most likely to use the word ‘love’ somewhere in their password. In May 2013 a team of hackers managed to crack more than 14,800 supposedly random passwords - from a list of 16,449  - as part of a hacking experiment for a technology website. The success rate for each hacker ranged from 62% to 90%, and the hacker who cracked 90% of hashed passwords did so in less than an hour using a computer cluster. The hackers also managed to crack 16-character passwords including 'qeadzcwrsfxv1331'. Rather than repeatedly entering passwords into a website, the hackers used a list of hashed passwords they managed to get online. Hashing takes each user's plain text password and runs it through a one-way mathematical function. This creates a unique string of numbers and letters called the hash. Hashing makes it difficult for an attacker to move from hash back to password and it lets sites keep a list of hashes, rather than storing them insecurely as plain-text passwords. This means if a list is stolen, the plain text passwords can't be obtained easily However, this experiment shows this doesn't mean its impossible. When a user types a password into an online form or service, the system hashes the entered word and checks it against the user's stored, pre-hashed password. When the two hashes match, the user is allowed entry to their account. Jeremi Gosney, the founder and CEO of Stricture Consulting Group, managed to crack the first 10,233 hashes, or 62 per cent of the leaked list, in 16 minutes. He used a so-called 'brute-force crack' for all passwords that were one to six characters long. Brute-force attacks is when a computer tries every possible combination of six letters and characters, starting with 'a' and ending with '//////.' Mr Gosney then used brute-force to crack all passwords up to 16 digits long and managed to brute-force 312 passwords in three minutes and 21 seconds.","Experts from hosting firm WP engine analysed 10 million passwords .

"She's one of reality TV's most stylish exports so it was only a matter of time before Millie Mackintosh turned her hand to fashion design. The former Made In Chelsea star's first fashion collection was such a hit that she's back with her spring/summer 15 drop - and it's full of bold floral patterns, hippy chic maxi dresses and the kind of festival fashion staples that she's made her signature. Speaking to FEMAIL about her new collection of suede dresses and tasseled jackets, the 25-year-old said: 'The range was inspired by my love of festivals and it has a real 70s influence. 'It's full of easy-to-wear shapes, feminine patterns and playful prints.' Millie Mackintosh, who found fame on Made In Chelsea, has unveiled her spring/summer designs and models them all herself, of course . Millie explains that this collection is totally different to her first and she took on board her customer and buyers' comments to help develop and enhance the brand. 'The whole process has been such an amazing learning experience and this is my favourite collection ever. I love the black suede jacket and print maxi dress, I am going to be getting a lot of wear out of the collection come summer,' she said. Millie, who is 'gutted' that she can't attend Glastonbury because it clashes with two weddings she has on, will be rocking her designs at Coachella festival, as well as on her upcoming trips to Morocco and Istanbul. You're also likely to catch her showbiz pals donning her designs - and she says seeing her friends such as Rosie Fortescue and Zara Martin wearing her collection is the 'ultimate compliment'. Millie's new range is full of bold floral patterns, hippy chic maxi dresses and the kind of festival fashion staples that she's made her signature . Millie wore this gorgeous tasseled jacket which would be perfect for throwing over a dress for a festival . Posing on location in Marrakesh in the new campaign imagery to promote her designs, Millie shows her fans how to work the looks - and she maintains it's all about letting your inner hippie out. 'When it comes to summer dressing, you've just got to have fun with it. My clothes are really accessible and you can dress them up or down depending on the occasion.' As well as style expertise, Millie, who trained as a make-up artist before finding fame, is a beauty buff with her own eyelash range. Sharing her top beauty tips for flawless summer skin, the star - a self-confessed sun worshiper - says SPF is essential. 'I loved sunbathing all my life and now I am so worried about sun damage so I always wear a tinted moisturiser with an SPF in and some cream bronzer and pastel eyeshadow for a natural sunkissed look.' It's clear to see the 70s inspired this short suede dress which Millie rocked with a pair of snakeskin boots . Aside from fashion and beauty, fitness is one of Millie's passions and she's a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she preaches. Whilst she's confident enough posting videos of her squatting, boxing and participating in the oh-so-fashionable but gruelling SBC class, there's one class Millie is afraid of trying. 'I really want to try this music video dance class at Frame studios but I am too embarrassed. I think it would be really fun and I probably need to learn to just let go of my inhibitions!'. As well as cramming in fashion design and fitness classes, Millie is preparing to release her debut book at the end of the month. If that wasn't enough, she's hoping to expand her eyelash range next year, is already working on her autumn/winter 15 collection and has some exciting health and fitness projects in the pipeline.

"Angry parents alerted police after spotting a small drone hovering over homes and following their children home from school. Grandmother Patricia Bailey-Ruiz, of Alaska, said she spotted the drone flying above her while she was standing in the driveway with her granddaughter, two, on Tuesday. After other parents and school children also mentioned seeing the drone, Bailey alerted police, who told the parents the man operating the drone is not breaking any laws. Parents were angry after a drone was seen hovering near their homes and following complaints from their children that it followed them home from school (above file photo of the DJI Inspire Quadcopter drone) Anchorage police said the man told them he was flying his $3,400 DJI Inspire Quadcopter drone as practice for an impending business venture, according to Alaska Dispatch News. The man, who has not been identified, denied claims that he followed children or flew low enough to peer into people's homes with the drone's camera. He also said other drones operate in the area. When they responded to complaints, police told the man to respect other people's privacy and to stop flying the drone near the school, Eagle River Elementary, and also near the children. As he formerly flew drones for the military and was curious about the capabilities of civilian models, the drone operator said he would not fly the drone when children were returning home from school. 'There is no state or local law for the misuse of drones,' said Anchorage Police Department spokeswoman Anita Shell. 'Can we prove anything illegal has been done? No.' Bailey-Ruiz, who lives close the school, said she was outside with her grandchildren earlier this week around 3.30pm when the drone flew down in close proximity. She said: 'It came right down to us at the height of the light poles and just hovered there. And it was making a clicking noise and it was shifting around in the sky.' The grandmother said she decided to take action after speaking to a child headed home from school who said the drone followed kids, and had been out for a few days. Authorities told the parents that the law prohibits them from shooting at the drones but that throwing rocks and firing slingshots were within their rights, according to KTUU. The man, who was concerned about residents damaging his drone, was advised to avoid flying it over people's property to protect it from potential risks of damage. The man, who has not been identified, denied claims that he followed children with his drone and said he used to fly the device for the military (above Eagle River Elementary School) He was not charged or arrested following the incident. 'He wasn't committing a crime,' said Shell. 'There wasn't anything we could do but advise him of the neighbors' concerns about following children home or flying near windows.' Since the operator was warned, parents said when they saw the drone on Wednesday, it was not following students and was high up above the school. Shell said there has not been any complaints regarding him and his drone. The Federal Aviation Administration has estimated that there could be at least 7,500 civilian drone users in the next four years. While drone operation is banned for commercial purposes, there are few regulations for private drone use. However, current guidelines advise operators to fly the devices at a safe height away from crowds and airports. As for state regulations, operators are only banned from using drones for hunting or to locate animals while preparing for a hunt. The FAA is conducting an investigation into the incident in Eagle River, and are also working on rules for civilian drone use.","Grandmother Patricia Bailey-Ruiz, of Alaska, first spotted the drone flying above her home while standing in the driveway on Tuesday .

"Tears fell and the loved ones of murdered high school sophomore Nichole Cable embraced in Maine on Friday as her killer was finally found guilty of her senseless slaying. Kyle Dube, 21, or Orono, was convicted of luring the 15-year-old girl using a fake Facebook profile, before kidnapping and murdering her in May of 2013, in a botched plot to make himself look like a hero. It took the jury of seven men and five women in Penobscot County Superior Court in Bangor less than an hour to find Dube guilty and the prosecution said the speedy verdict reflected the 'overwhelming' evidence against him. The victims parents left without speaking to the media following the nine-day trial, but relatives and friends wept and hugged as the verdict was handed down. Overwhelmed: Friends of Nicole Cable leave Penobscot Judicial Court in Maine on Friday, after the teen's killer was found guilty of her May 2013 murder . Killer: The jury took just 45 minutes to convict Kyle Dube, 21, of the murder of Nicole Gable, after an 'overhwleming' amount of evidence was presented over the nine-day trial. Here Dube arrives in court . Kyle Dube, 21, (mugshot left) was convicted of kidnapping and murdering 15-year-old high school sophomore Nichole Cable (right) in May of 2013 in Maine . Dube was found guilty of staging Cable's kidnapping so he could later rescue her and be hailed as a hero. Instead, Cable died of asphyxiation and her remains were found in the woods in Old Town on May 20 after an eight-day search. Dube had covered up her body with leaves and sticks. Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber held up a picture of Cable during opening arguments on the first day of Dube's trial at the Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor, Maine . Dube planned to rescue Cable, but she died of asphyxiation and was found after an eight-day search . After the verdict was announced, Cable's father began to applaud, the Bangor Daily News reported. Other friends and family of Cable began to cry, as did Dube's mother and other family members. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Marchese called the crime 'a cautionary tale'. She said. 'It's a cautionary tale to everyone to be careful when you are using social media.' During the two-week trial, the prosecution's case centered on Dube's use of a phony Facebook account to lure Cable out of her home. The profile, under the name of another man who was not involved in Cable's abduction, was traced back to Dube's home. During testimony, that man told jurors he was aware Dube didn't like him. Dube's attorneys professed his innocence and said someone else must have committed the horrid crimes . DNA evidence also tied Dube to Cable's disappearance and several people, including fellow inmates and an ex-girlfriend, testified Dube confessed to the crime. The convicted felon told others that he'd intended to abduct Cable and later come to her rescue, according to police. His plan was to kidnap her while wearing a ski mask and return later without the disguise and find her. Dube's attorneys professed his innocence and said someone else must have committed the kidnapping and murder. Dube, who pleaded not guilty, did not testify. He faces 25 years to life in prison for the murder conviction and up to 30 years for the kidnapping conviction. David Walker, the superintendent of the high school Cable attended, said he has not seen a dramatic change in the way students use social media. He said: 'Hopefully they recognize that the internet isn't always a safe place. 'Everyone is reminding students of the dangers, both parents and teachers.'","Kyle Dube, 21, found guilty of kidnapping and murdering  Nichole Cable .

"The woman who was once the apple of Donald Sterling's eye until she cost him the Los Angeles Clippers was forced Thursday to answer questions about recordings in which she and the billionaire discussed how to hide a house he bought her. Several of the 500 recordings V. Stiviano made during a nearly four-year relationship with Sterling were played in Los Angeles Superior Court in his wife's lawsuit to reclaim millions of dollars he lavished on the younger woman. Donald Sterling foresaw the trouble the gifts posed for Stiviano, pointing out in one recording that they were community property - owned jointly by him and his wife of nearly 60 years. V. Stiviano (above) is seen leaving court with an apple after testifying on Thursday . In a recording heard in court on Thursday , Stiviano and Sterling discuss the best way to try and hide the purchase of the $1.8m duplex from his wife (above) That is the basis for her lawsuit. 'You just can't give somebody a gift,' he said in one recording. He then laughed and added, 'Well, if they don't know about it.' 'Do you think I can hide the house?' Stiviano asked. After two days of testimony attempting to show that Sterling paid the full $1.8million price for the Spanish-style duplex, there's little to hide. The question is whether a judge will make Stiviano relinquish the home, three luxury cars, including a Ferrari, and millions of dollars in cash, jewelry and clothing that an accountant valued conservatively at $3.6million. Her lawyer says most of the funds can't be connected directly from Sterling to Stiviano and that the law doesn't allow a spouse to go after a third party. Lawyers on both sides said there's no precedent for such a case. Judge Richard Fruin Jr. cast doubt on Shelly Sterling's case Thursday, saying there's no clear documentation that funds went from the Sterling family's real estate company to Stiviano's bank accounts. Stiviano denied that some of the 18 bank accounts where checks were deposited even belonged to her. When asked if it was mere coincidence that identical amounts left Sterling's company and then showed up in accounts used to purchase the home, Stiviano pleaded ignorant and said she hadn't signed the checks. 'Life is full of coincidence, sir,' she told Sterling attorney Pierce O'Donnell. The Sterlings are demanding back items worth $3.6 million that they claim Stiviano (above with Donald) swindled from them - including cars and a $1.8 million duplex . On the stand Thursday, Stiviano called Sterling's wife Shelly (above) a 'bully' The trial has provided a backstory of sorts to the saga that played out last year when the recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to publicly associate with blacks culminated with his lifetime ban from the NBA and the record $2billion sale of the team. Stiviano said she loved Sterling and referred to him as her 'hubby' and significant other, but said they never were romantic despite sharing a room on trips to Dubai, Paris and Las Vegas. Shown several photos of her nuzzling the 80-year-old and asked if she was kissing him, she said: 'I don't know if you call duck lips or pucker lips kissing.' Stiviano, 32, smiled broadly at times and was sassy at others, getting laughs from the gallery as she corrected O'Donnell's pronunciation of designer Louis Vuitton. When asked if she hated Shelly Sterling, she didn't hold back. 'She is a bully,' she said. 'That's exactly what I thought she was - the evil witch of the west.' Shelly Sterling looked back at friends in the gallery at points in the testimony and smiled. Stiviano admitted that Donald Sterling had bought her cars, gave her $100,000 to invest in stocks and helped her buy her house with at least $727,000. But she couldn't identify how much of the remaining $1 million he contributed. She said some came from friends and relatives who gave her small bills she squirreled away in a bedroom drawer. Accountant Jay Shapiro testified that he had traced funds from Sterling and found it unbelievable Stiviano's drawer could have made a significant contribution. 'It would be an awful big drawer,' Shapiro said. 'I find the entire story incredulous.'","The Sterlings are demanding back items worth $3.6 million that they claim Stiviano swindled from them - including cars and a $1.8 million duplex .

"Emilie-Lea Hayward, pictured with mother Naolmi, munches through an incredible 30 pots of Petits Filous per day . A fussy four-year-old girl refuses to eat anything other than Petits Filous- munching her way through 30 pots a day. Emilie-Lea Hayward refuses to eat any solid food and becomes hysterical every time mother Naomi, 32, offers her anything other than raspberry and strawberry flavour yoghurt. The youngster won't touch chocolate, sweets or ice cream and even bursts into tears if she is offered an alternative brand. Each 47g pot of Petits Filous contains around a teaspoon of sugar, meaning Emilie-Lea is consuming 30 teaspoons a day - more than twice the recommended adult intake. But doctors who have examined the youngster say her unusual diet - which costs more than £2,000 a year - is not affecting her health or development. However, full-time mother Naomi is worried about the long-term implications and is desperately trying to find somebody to give her some answers. The mother-of-three, from Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire said: 'She has seen pediatricians and dietitians but nobody has been able to help her and I don't know what to do. 'She will play with other food and touch it with her hands but she becomes hysterical if you try and feed her it. 'It is just totally bizarre. I breast fed her and then gave her formula and then she had yogurt but she would never take that next step. 'As she was growing up my family kept saying she would grow out of it but she has started pre-school and I am really worried. 'I have tried to get her to eat in a telling way, I've tried in a nice way, I've tried using encouragement, I've tried using other children, but nothing works. 'She just gets hysterical if you put something on a spoon and give it to her. I can't force feed her and I'm starting to think she will never grow out of it. 'It really has started to worry me. She is going to be starting school in September and she needs a variation in her diet. She refuses to eat any solid food and becomes hysterical every time mother Naomi, 32, offers her anything other than yogurt . Doctors who have examined the youngster say her unusual diet - which costs more than £2,000 a year - is not affecting her health or development . 'We thought the pediatrician would be able to help but she hasn't had a case like it before. 'Her advice has been to just let it follow its natural course and she will grow out of it but I'm not convinced that she will.' Naomi has to make daily visits to her local supermarket to cope with Emilie-Lea's diet - which tops 11,000 pots a year. She will eat six pots for breakfast and then snack on another two dozen pots throughout the rest of the day. Naomi said her daughter even turns her nose up if she tries to disguise one by putting it in an empty Petits Filous pot. Siblings Daisy-Grace, two, and nine-month-old Harper-Jane eat normally. Despite her diet Naomi says doctors at High Wycombe Hospital have told her the youngster is just as healthy as any other child her age. Naomi added: 'She is a very happy child and totally normal in every way apart from this. A mountain of yoghurt: Emilie-Lea (pictured with uncle Bryan Hayward)  will eat six pots for breakfast and then snack on another two dozen pots throughout the rest of the day . 'It hasn't affected her health in any way. We have had blood tests done but she is not anaemic or anything and it is all normal. 'I have not heard anything like it and I want to find somebody similar or find a specialist who can offer some help.' A recent report by the World Health Organisation recommended that adults should eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day. British Dietetic Association spokeswoman Nicole Rothband said Emilie-Lea could be at risk of becoming 'dangerously anaemic'. She said: 'We do come across children who miss that really important weaning window but this is a very unusual case. 'She will probably get enough protein and energy from the diet and she will certainly get enough calcium. The issue would be for minerals and vitamin deficiencies. 'There is no iron in that diet whatsoever and we find children who rely exclusively on milk become dangerously anaemic. 'This seems more extreme than the girl just being fussy and often we find the most extreme eaters tend to be on the autistic spectrum.' A spokeswoman for High Wycombe Hospital said it does not comment on individual cases.","Emilie-Lea Hayward, 4, refuses solid food and won't even touch sweets .

"A 2,200-year-old crossbow which some experts believe could have been almost twice as powerful as a modern-day assault rifle has been discovered among the Terracotta Warriors. The crossbow, which was found intact this week, could have shot an arrow up to 2,600 feet - about the length of nine football pitches, the People's Daily Online reported. The discovery is particularly exciting as experts believe the crossbow may hold the secret to the success of China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang. Discovery: This is the first ever crossbow to have survived intact found from the Qin Dynasty . Uncovered: The bow is still half-buried next to one of China's famous terracotta warriors . The crossbow, which was found half-buried next to one of the terracotta statues, was discovered by archaeologists working at the site. It is the first time archaeologists have seen a complete version of the weapon, although they previously found 10 more broken crossbows in the same pit. The bow measures almost five feet in length, with a height of about 50 inches. Its size suggests that it was one of the most powerful bows of its era. Historical texts indicate that its firing range could have been up to 2,600 feet, according to Huashang Newspaper, which is double the range of an assault rifle, which is about 1,300 feet. Some historians believe that analysis of a number of historical texts shows that the crossbow was  integral to several important military victories of the period. Archaeological importance: Many weapons have been found in the pits, like these ones from 2006 . New: A 'Qing', an item which they had only read about in history books, was also discovered in the pit . Archaeologists are equally excited about the discovery of a 'Qing', an item which they had previously only read about in historical texts. The Qing helps explain how the crossbow was transported and stored, helping it to maintain its shape when not in use. 'We believe that not only in the Qin dynasty but perhaps during the entire Warring States Period they had a very complete system of weapons production, storage and transportation,' Shen Maosheng, the archaeologists' team leade,r told Central China Television. 'This discovery of the most complete Qin Dynasty crossbow, especially the Qing, provides us with new historical evidence for the follow-up study of the Terracotta, especially the study of the Qin dynasty military force.' China's first emperor was buried over two thousand years ago in the most opulent tomb complex ever found in the vast country. Qin Shi Huang's colossal burial site in Xi'an, is thought to comprise some 8,000 life size human soldiers arranged in groups, plus other figures. The ancient site contains a collection of underground caverns containing everything the emperor would need for the afterlife, including reproductions of his armies, concubines, administrators and servants. The first of the life-size terracotta statues was unearthed in 1974 by farmers digging wells near Xi'an and a further 2,000 have been unearthed since. But the emperor’s burial mound has been left untouched because of fears a delicate artwork showing ancient beliefs of the afterlife, could be damaged using current archaeological methods. The site contained a poisonous mercury moat to keep out looters, and experts think further booby-traps await investigators inside the emperor's chamber.","Intact crossbow was found by archaeologists working on the site .

"Buoyant: George Osborne on a visit to a building site in Essex yesterday . Families will be better off this year than they were when the Coalition came to power, independent experts said yesterday. In a boost to George Osborne, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said it was ‘very likely’ that household incomes would be higher this year than in 2010. The Chancellor’s claim that families would be £900 better off in 2015 was one of the key Tory messages in Wednesday’s Budget. The IFS also raised serious questions about Ed Miliband’s much-repeated counter-claim that families are £1,600 worse off than they were in 2010. In its annual post-Budget briefing yesterday, it suggested the Labour leader’s figure was out of date and failed to take account of rising pensioner incomes, surging employment or changes to the tax and benefit system. The think-tank’s verdict potentially deals a fatal blow to Mr Miliband’s claims of a cost of living ‘crisis’. In a further blow, the IFS said inequality in Britain had fallen under the Coalition. It also said Labour’s plans were so lax that Mr Miliband might borrow up to £25billion a year more than the Tories – piling up Britain’s £1.5trillion national debt indefinitely. But it did warn that the impact of coalition cuts had fallen most heavily on the poor, as a result of reductions in benefits. Mr Osborne seized on the IFS verdict last night as evidence that the Government’s plans are starting to deliver higher living standards for families despite the years of austerity needed to deal with the huge budget deficit left by Labour. The Chancellor said: ‘This is a very significant moment for our economic debate: on the day after the Budget, the independent IFS have confirmed the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that living standards are set to be higher in 2015 than in 2010. ‘This is more evidence that our plan is delivering for Britain’s families, and it demolishes Ed Miliband’s central claim in this election. I’m the first to say that the job of repairing our economy isn’t done, because the British people are still paying a huge price for Labour’s great recession, but Britain is on the right track and we must not turn back.’ The debate over living standards provoked a furious row between Labour and the Conservatives during Wednesday’s Budget. The IFS said Labour’s claim was based on figures from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, covering the period 2010-2014. Economist Robert Joyce said it was true that these figures show average earnings fell during this period. But he said more recent data showed earnings are now ‘growing’. And he warned the Labour statistics give only a partial view of total household income. The figures do not include pensions, which have received a substantial boost. Because they are gross figures they also do not include the impact of tax changes. And they do not reflect that fact that employment is up by almost two million – meaning many people who previously had no income are now earning. Mr Joyce said: ‘It is reasonable to think that real average incomes will surpass pre-crisis levels in 2015.’ The Chancellor’s claim that families would be £900 better off in 2015 was one of the key Tory messages in Wednesday’s Budget . He did not directly endorse Mr Osborne’s £900 figure, but said it was based on a ‘quite reasonable measure of living standards’. He said the IFS’s own forecasts also suggest a significant rise in living standards this year. The IFS ruling was not all good news for Mr Osborne. It said there was ‘no cause for celebration’ as Britain has suffered ‘by far the slowest recovery in modern history’. IFS director Paul Johnson said that real incomes were ‘very likely’ to be higher this year than in 2010. But he added: ‘We are, for sure, worse off than we could reasonably have expected to be back in 2007, or indeed back in 2010.’ The IFS also assessed Mr Miliband’s claim that the Coalition has produced a ‘recovery for the few’. Mr Johnson said research showed that ‘across the huge majority of the population, inequality has fallen since 2010’. The total burden of austerity since the start of the recession has fallen most heavily on the top 10 per cent of earners. But, if Labour raids on the rich before 2010 are stripped out, it is the poorest 10 per cent who have lost the biggest proportion of their income, because of cuts to benefits. Those in the middle have been left ‘remarkably unaffected,’ Mr Johnson said. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the findings were a ‘damning verdict’ on the Government. Ed Miliband claimed that families are £1,600 a year worse off compared to 2010 . In the aftermath of Wednesday’s Budget, the Tories and Labour have clashed bitterly over what will be a key General Election battleground: Are households better off now than in 2010? Here, the Daily Mail sorts the claim from the reality... What Ed Miliband says: In his Budget reply, the Labour leader repeated his claim – made ad nauseam in recent years – that: ‘This Chancellor has failed the working families of Britain. People are £1,600 a year worse off.’ Reality: The figure – the foundation of Labour’s ‘cost-of-living crisis’ – is based solely on gross earnings, not net incomes. This means it takes no account of any benefits a family receive or, crucially, the Coalition’s decision to raise the threshold for paying income tax to £10,600. To reach the figure of £1,600, Labour compares a person’s gross income with the Retail Price Index measure of inflation, which is discredited and has been replaced in the national accounts by the Consumer Price Index, which produces a significantly lower annual rate. Also, Labour’s calculation runs only to April 2014. Since then, wages have begun to rise significantly while the CPI inflation rate has fallen to just 0.3 per cent. What George Osborne says: On Wednesday, the Chancellor declared: ‘The facts show households on average will be around £900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 – and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis any more.’ Reality: Ed Balls immediately rubbished the figure, which is based on a measure called Real Household Disposable Income per capita, on the grounds that it also includes income received by churches, trades unions and charities. The Office for National Statistics includes these organisations in the calculation – which compares all financial incomings with outgoings – because they ‘are financed by households and their sole purpose is to serve households’. Ed Balls rubbished Osborne's suggestion that families are £900 better off than they were in 2010 . However, a recent ONS research paper found that if they were removed from the figures, the measure would have delivered a marginally more positive result for ordinary households and Mr Osborne – not less so, as Mr Balls implied. The figures the Chancellor used are based on forecasts by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility up to the end of 2015. The OBR said disposable incomes will grow by 3.1 per cent this year, the fastest since 2001. Verdict: The hammer was brought down in favour of Mr Osborne by the hugely respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, which said average household incomes ‘are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010’. It added that they could also be higher than their previous peak in 2009. Labour will point to the qualifying remark by the IFS that this ‘still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history. Having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration’. But the verdict is still a bitter blow to the Two Eds – whose ‘cost of living’ fox has now been shot. Last year, Mr Balls said the issue that will be centre stage in the election was the same question posed by Ronald Reagan in his first presidential campaign in 1980: ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago?’ In the US, the answer back then was No – and it cost Jimmy Carter the Oval Office. The Tories will hope a Yes – albeit a qualified one – will similarly be enough to keep Labour out of No10. Wannabe Chancellor: Ed Balls still relies on his mother-in-law for help with maths . He wants to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. But Ed Balls still relies on his mother-in-law for help with maths. During an interview on Good Morning Britain yesterday, Labour’s shadow chancellor confessed he was relieved he had not been asked any maths questions live on TV. It came as he struggled to respond to George Osborne’s Budget and admitted he would not reverse any of the measures announced – including the new Help to Buy Isas. Mr Balls appeared on the ITV show in a bid to lead Labour’s post-Budget fightback. At the end of his interview a tired-looking Mr Balls expressed relief he had not been asked any tricky arithmetic questions. He told host Susanna Reid: ‘I was pleased you didn’t ask me any maths questions this morning.’ Asked how he was with fractions, Mr Balls replied: ‘Luckily my mother-in-law is a maths teacher so she is the expert when it comes to maths.’ A shocked Miss Reid interrupted: ‘You cannot tell me that the shadow chancellor relies on his mother-in-law to do his maths.’ Mr Balls said: ‘The kids think the mother-in-law is very good at maths teaching. You always rely on your mother-in-law.’ Later, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Balls admitted it was ‘good’ that Mr Osborne announced help for savers with the £1,000 tax-free savings allowance. He also said the Help to Buy Isa was an ‘interesting idea’ that would not be scrapped if Labour wins in May and that he would keep the rise in the personal tax allowance – to go up from £10,600 to £11,000 by 2017-18. Asked if there was anything from Wednesday’s Budget he would reverse, Mr Balls said: ‘I thought it was quite empty. I don’t think there was too much in it. There’s nothing I’m saying to you from yesterday that I need to reverse. What I will reverse is the plan for deeper spending cuts in the next three years than the last five.’","'Very likely' household incomes will be higher than in 2010, experts say .

"Beer is one of the world's most ancient brews and has played an essential role in society - both for its nutritional and ritual importance - for millennia. Now, 5,000-year-old fragments of pottery used by ancient Egyptians to make beer, have been discovered on a building site in Tel Aviv, Israel. The pottery shards come from large ceramic basins, which were used to prepare fruity beer that was left to ferment under the sun. Scroll down for video . ‘Among the hundreds of pottery shards (pictured) that characterise the local culture, a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an Egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer,’ Dr Barkan said . Diego Barkan, of the Israeli Antiquities Authority, said that 17 pits were found that had been used to store produce in the Early Bronze Age, from 3,500 to 3,000 BC. Beer was the favourite drink of humans and gods in ancient Egypt. It was also drank by rich and poor, adults and children. This was because it was cleaner than water, which came from a river or canal and was often polluted. Beer was considered as staple, along with bread, Reshafim.org reported. Workers were paid with bread, oil, beer and vegetables by their employers. The standard ration was two jars containing three-and-a-half pints (two litres) of beer. Just like today, the Egyptians liked their beer cooled and kept jars in water. ‘Among the hundreds of pottery shards that characterise the local culture, a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an Egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer,’ he said in a statement. The vessels were made with ‘straw temper’ and other organic material to strengthen them – a method which was not in local potteries. The excavation is the first to offer evidence of an ‘Egyptian occupation’ in the centre of Tel Aviv 5,000 years ago. As well as the basins, a bronze dagger and 6,000-year-old flint tools were uncovered. Dr Barken said: ‘This is also the northernmost evidence we have of an Egyptian presence in the early Bronze Age. ‘Until now we were only aware of an Egyptian presence in the northern Negev and southern coastal plain, whereby the northernmost point of Egyptian occupation occurred in Azor. Fragments of pottery that are around 5,000 years old and were used by ancient Egyptians to make beer, have been discovered on a building site in Tel Aviv. Here, Diego Barkan holds the basin parts . Employees of the Israel Antiquities Authority(pictured) work at the site in Tel Aviv where fragments of pottery used by ancient Egyptians have been discovered. A total of 17 pits have revealed finds . As well as the basins, which were pulled from pits in the centre of Tel Aviv (pictured left) a bronze dagger and 6,000-year-old flint tools were uncovered. A flint blade is pictured right . Last year, the tomb of a leading ancient Egyptian beer brewer was discovered. The tomb of Khonso Em Heb, who lived 3,200 years ago, was found by a Japanese team and has been been described as 'one of the most important discoveries' made at the Thebes necropolic site in the city of Luxor. Egypt's antiquities minister Mohamed Ibrahim described Khonso Em Heb as the chief ‘maker of beer for gods of the dead'. He was thought to be the head of a warehouse and judging by the decorations in his tomb was an important and wealthy man. The walls of the tomb contain paintings showing everyday life and rituals. ‘Now we know that they also appreciated what the Tel Aviv region had to offer and that they too knew how to enjoy a glass of beer, just as Tel Avivians do today’. According to the antiquities authority, ‘beer was the Egyptian national drink and was a staple along with bread.’ It said beer was consumed by the entire population of Egypt, regardless of age, gender or status. ‘It was made from a mixture of barley and water that was partially baked and then left to ferment in the sun. ‘Various fruit concentrates were added to this mixture in order to flavour the beer.’ The mixture was filtered in special vessels before serving. Previous excavations carried out in Egypt's Delta region uncovered breweries that indicate beer was already being produced in the mid-fourth millennium BC, the Israeli authority said. The fragments were discovered in pits on Ha-Masger Street in central Tel Aviv (marked on the map). Excavations are taking place before the construction of an office building . The vessels (pictured) were made with ‘straw temper’ and other organic material to strengthen them – a method which was not in local potteries. This one dates to the Early Bronze Age I (3,500 BC) Dr Barken said: ‘This is also the northernmost evidence we have of an Egyptian presence in the early Bronze Age. Here, a worker for the Israel Antiquities Authority cleans findings at the site .","Fragments from ceramic basins were pulled from 17 pits in Tel Aviv, Israel .

"A documentary maker who embarked on a high-sugar diet for 60 days to demonstrate the dramatic effect of sugar on the body has weighed into the debate about controversial new coke product, 'Coke Life'. Health experts have accused Coca Cola of ‘health washing’ consumers with the launch of its new ‘lower-calorie’ soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult’s recommended daily allowance of sugar. Damon Gameau spent two months eating so-called 'healthy' foods such as juice, cereal and sports drinks for a documentary called That Sugar Film - exposing the prevalence of 'hidden sugars'. Australian actor Damon Gameau reintroduced sugar into his diet after three years with shocking results . Coca-Cola Life (left) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular Coca-Cola (right) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar . Dr Rooney highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution, a saccharin [artificial sweetener] solution and only drank a certain amount. But when the rats were given both sugar and saccharin mixed together they drank more than they normally would. ‘It’s called a super mix, a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption… if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for Coke’s profit line,’ Dr Rooney said. Coke Life has its very own ‘super mix’ of both sugar and Stevia - a type of sweetener. ‘Coke will be pushing more products but we will be doing more detriment to our health,’ Dr Rooney warned. When it comes to the green colour of the Coke Life packet it can give off a ‘healthy vibe’, Dr Rooney said. He noted Coke would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley launched Coca-Cola Life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in London in September . In documentary 'That Sugar Film' he aims to highlight the sugars that are often hidden in 'health' foods . ‘There would have been some work that went into the association of green with health. I can understand how on some superficial level at least that it is seen as a healthier product. ‘But people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits,’ he said. Dr Rooney explained that ‘liquid calories’ are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food. ‘If you are looking to improve health the very first step is to remove your liquid calories,’ Dr Rooney said. The best drinks to consume are water and milk, he advised. And when it comes to Coke’s claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic, Dr Rooney said it is ‘disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate for Coke to frame their products as healthy.’ Dr Rooney said it is 'disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate' for Coke products to be marketed as healthy . Coca-Cola Life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant Stevia, which has been in Japan as a sweetener for over 30 years . Sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth, increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist, he explained . ‘I think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight, which is absolutely wrong.’ Dr Rooney explained that 'liquid calories' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food . Professor Amanda Lee of Queensland University of Technology, and former chair of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Dietary Guidelines Working Committee, told the Sydney Morning Herald the launch of Coca Cola Life is an example of ‘greenwashing’. ‘It reminds me of the stage we were up at 30 years ago when manufacturers were making healthy cigarettes. I'm worried, it's trying to make a product that's intrinsically unhealthy, healthy,’ she said. ‘There's a high risk that many consumers could be confused, thinking that it's a low-energy option when it's not.’ The product, which hit Australian shelves on Monday, has more natural ingredients than Diet Coke because it doesn’t use artificial sweeteners like Aspartame. Lisa Winn, Coca-Cola South Pacific Marketing Director, said: ‘Coca-Cola Life truly is another example of us keeping in step with consumer demands. ‘We’re confident that the new product is what consumers have been looking for. We’ve achieved the taste you’d expect from Coca-Cola with 35% reduced sugar and kilojoules, compared to Coca-Cola.’ ‘Coke Life isn’t simply a new product from Coca-Cola – it’s another great choice for people who want a delicious Coca-Cola to fit their lifestyle. There is a Coca-Cola option for everyone,’ she said. It is only the fourth drink to be launched in the Trademark’s 128-year history. Peach flavour Lipton Ice Tea has over eight teaspoons of sugar, while Vitamin Water has seven . V Energy Drinks which promise to give you 'energy' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them . The new addition to Coke's range of 3,500 beverages, should also not be mistaken for Coke Zero, which is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men who don't like the word 'diet' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic Coca-Cola. Coke Life is roughly inbetween Diet Coke and classic Coca-Cola when it comes to calories – you will still find 27 in a can. However, it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic Coke because it uses the natural plant Stevia and sugar as sweeteners, rather than just sugar. Aspartame is a man-made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages. The safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies. However, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure. People with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it. Coke Zero (left) is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate 'diet' drinks with women. Unlike Diet Coke (right), which is completely sugar free, Coke Life still has sugar . Nutritionist Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia said that Stevia is not known to have any health risks but that doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink Coke Life. 'Nutrition Australia would still say that while it's safe it's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets. Stevia is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained. You can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home – or you may find it in icecream, water-based beverages, brewed soft drinks, plain and flavoured soy beverages. It can be used in cooking and baking according to the Stevia Australia website, excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar. It has been used in Japan as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both FSANZ and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the EFSA and USFDA. FSANZ has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns. 'The problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion. 'The other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks, whether sweetened naturally or artificially, are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it. No matter what, the best drink is water and that’s we’d still agree.' If you’re wondering what the need for another low-calorie Coke drink is, the global brand which is worth an estimated $74 billion US dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives. Aspartame is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well-known brands of food, drink and medicine. However, it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health. One study linked diet drinks containing Aspartame to premature births, while another suggested it could cause cancer. However, in December 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe, so Coca-Cola has continued to use it. Powerade has over eight teaspoons of sugar and Gatorade has nine teaspoons . Coca-Cola Life does not contain Aspartame so may be seen as healthier – but it does contain more sugar than Diet Coke. 'I guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful. But because research hasn’t been done checking Stevia it seems to be quiet safe in those respects,’ Ms Hourigan said. Coke Life is meant to taste similar to classic Coca-Cola but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage. Rival soft drink brand Pepsi have also brought out a drink that uses Stevia as a sweetener in some markets. They have named it Pepsi Next.","A 330ml can of Coca Cola Life still has 22g of sugar and 89 calories .

"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian-leaning senator will officially announce his candidacy for president at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky on April 7, a senior adviser to the Republican politician told Daily Mail Online. With Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the race for the White House as of this morning, when he kicked off his own bid with a tweet, Paul plans to follow suit and launch his own campaign in just over two weeks. Louisville, the adviser said, was selected over Paul's hometown, Bowling Green, the city from which he set in motion his quest to become a U.S. senator, for optimum venue space. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is scheduled to follow Ted Cruz's lead and announce his presidential bid at a campaign-style event on April 7 in Louisville, Kentucky . Even before Cruz, 44, kicked off his 2016 bid, Paul, 52, had his eye on April 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign. But the fellow Republican's formal announcement helped to solidify Paul's plans. Determined not to be the first major White House hopeful to wade into the shark-infested waters, Paul intended to wait until at least one other prominent Republican contender swam out to sea. Already, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and wealthy businessman and reality TV star Donald Trump had publicly said they were forming presidential exploratory committees. Such committees allow them to legally collect money for the purposes of travelling around the country to 'test the waters' for a bid and to conduct polling. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has made clear that he will pursue a presidential campaign but has not yet held the kind of large-scale event that typically accompanies the launch of a national campaign. Cruz, voted into the Senate during the last presidential election in 2012, has selected a Christian college in Virginia as the backdrop for the public unveiling of his national enterprise. He'll make the announcement this morning at Liberty University even though he's yet to establish an exploratory committee. Paul has not yet signed paperwork legalizing a committee either but could do so in the two weeks before he throws his name into the ring. Up for reelection this year, the Republican lawmaker first had to settle an in-house dispute over whether he could pursue his current job and the one that he wants at the same time. Earlier this month the Kentucky GOP gave him its blessing to do both. As a result, the state will have a one-time caucus, paid for by Paul, to determine its presidential nominee so that Paul can remain on a statewide ballot as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, as well. If he nabs the Republican nomination for president, however, he'll have to take the state to court in order to protect his fail safe measure, as Kentucky law does not allow a politician to appear on the ballot twice for two separate positions. And Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the loser of last fall's Senate competition, vowed to force Paul to play by the rules. Paul, 52, peaks with diners at Pink Cadillac Diner on Saturday in Rochester, New Hampshire. Paul, who has made many trips to New Hampshire which holds the first primary in the nation. Even before Cruz kicked off his 2016 bid, Paul had his eye on April 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign. But the fellow Republican's formal announcement solidified his plans . Additional heavy hitters presumably joining the crowded field of Republican presidential candidates - former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie - have offered fewer hints about when they drop the curtain on their expected campaigns. Currently they are running shadow campaigns, under the guise of their leadership PACs, and have all taken the preliminary steps to build apparatuses that can compete nationally. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Hewlett Packard executive Carly Fiorina could also enter the race as dark horse candidates. Both have hinted at possible runs, but neither has strongly signaled interest or adopted an aggressive campaign schedule compared to the likes of Cruz, Bush, Paul and others. The candidates known to be all or mostly in have spent the better part of the year building their fan bases in early primary states, chiefly Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and shoring up key Republican donors. Democrats' top contender, Hillary Clinton, is also close to making an announcement, which could reportedly come early as next Wednesday. The political front was mostly quiet on Monday morning, however, as Cruz prepared to lay out his vision for the country in a convocation speech at Liberty, the largest Christian higher-education institution in America, save for a few tweets from his well-known detractors . Paul is pictured here exiting Beantowne Coffee House & Cafe March in Hampstead during his weekend trip to New Hampshire. The freshman senator has not yet signed paperwork legalizing a presidential exploratory committee but could do so in the two weeks before his campaign formally kicks off . The Democratic National Committee hit him several times over the social media network as the 'architect of the disastrous 2013 government shutdown' and forwarded reporters an article positing that Cruz, a Hispanic whose father fled communist Cuba, could actually 'make the relationship between Republicans and Latinos even tougher.' The premise of the Fusion piece was that in making his debut as a national candidate at a university 'whose student body is at least half white,' Cruz, whose policies on issues like immigration are already considered 'divisive' by some, won't attract the kind of support from minority groups that one would expect given his family tree. American Bridge, a progressive, political action committee, tweeted that that the GOP's 'race to the extreme starts today' with Cruz's personal announcement. In a statement the group's president, Brad Woodhouse, also went after Cruz for his role in the 2013 Senate standoff that left the government in limbo for more than two weeks. 'Ted Cruz shut down the government in a tantrum, opposes marriage equality, denies climate change, and opposes a woman’s right to choose even in cases of rape or incest,' Woodhouse said. 'He’s everything voters hate about the modern Republican Party in one candidate' Woodhouse claimed, 'and the entire field is already signing on to his positions.'","The announcement will take place in Louisville, Kentucky .

"Nine high school students have been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two underage girls multiple times. Staff at Venice High School in Los Angeles informed police of a suspected attack on a female student on Tuesday. However the LAPD found the sexual misconduct involved another student and had occurred frequently for more than a year. An investigation has since identified 14 suspects between the ages of 14 and 17 who have allegedly been involved in sexual activity at the school - some consensual and some not. Investigation: Nine students at Venice High School in Los Angeles have been arrested in connection with sexual assaults on two underage girls dating back to 2013 . Eight youngsters from the school were arrested on Friday while another was arrested at another location. The suspected attacks are believed to have occurred on and off campus and date back to around December 2013. However the majority  are believed to have taken place in the last two months. A statement by the LAPD read: 'In an effort to protect the victims, all subjects were arrested at Venice High School and transported to Pacific Area Station for booking. 'The investigation is still ongoing and detectives will continue to interview all parties involved as well as collect any additional evidence.' A source for the LA Times said the accusations involves the male students working together to pressure girls into having sex. Los Angeles Schools Police Chief Steve Zimmerman told the media: 'When we have information about issues that concerning student safety and issues pertained to the school as a whole, we will do everything to ensure that behavior doesn't happen.' The police department confirmed rape wasn't involved but said it involved forced sexual assault. Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Ramon Cortines told The Times the students' parents had been notified and counselors were on campus to assist any other students. He said: 'This is a painful moment for Venice High School, and this district. I want you to know that no sexual misconduct of any kind by students or staff will ever be tolerated in L.A. Unified.'","Staff at Los Angeles school reported a sexual assault on Tuesday .

"A South Australian man holidaying in Vanuatu reportedly survived on a diet of flying fox and small native birds after bunking down with locals in the aftermath of Cyclone Pam. Three days before the category five cyclone hit 45–year-old Andrew Brooks travelled south to Tanna Island in the hopes he could climb the active Yasur volcano. The thrill seeker got more than he bargained for as the powerful cyclone hit in the early hours of the morning killing 16 people across the nation and demolishing almost everything in its path. Scroll down for video . The category five cyclone ravaged small villages completely wiping out the grass huts the villagers call home . Mr Brooks, along with 60 villagers and a score of tourists, sought refuge in a concrete school building and waited for the howling wind to stop. He sat huddled with the villagers for four or five hours while the cyclone tore through, destroying the grass huts that made up the village. He told The Advertiser the wind was incredibly loud, almost like a ‘freight train or jet plane.’ Mr Brooks waited for aid with around 60 villagers at the foot of Yasur volcano after Cyclone Pam hit . After the winds stopped Mr Brooks soon realised he was stranded and spent the next five days cut off from civilisation at the foot of the volcano. It was at this stage the villagers discovered that all the gardens and cooking houses were destroyed by the sheer force of the winds. He said they managed to find some rice vegetables and chicken which sustained them for a day or two before he was gobsmacked by what he was served next. After running out of food villagers offered Mr Brooks flying fox which he said was nice, but tough . Mr Brooks was in the southern region of Vanuatu when Cyclone Pam hit . He was presented with a cooked flying fox but knowing food was limited Mr Brooks said he was in no position to turn his nose up to warm meat . He said the resourceful villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting birds and bats. “Any time anything flew past, whether it was a finch or a flying fox, there’d be this hail of sticks thrown at it,” he told reporters. “They were getting finches and baby pigeons and eating them. And one morning they got a flying fox, which is quite large, and they cooked it up with rice and gave me a serve and they ate the rest. Villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting small birds and bats . He didn’t complain about his interesting diet and said it was ‘quite tasty’ but tough, likening the flavours to that of chicken. Although he was happy not to be starving he said he had concerns about the villagers health and safety after the cyclone left them with nothing. “There are lots of young babies in the area and they were saying, ‘Our babies are going to die and the old people are going to die’, because it’s so remote and they’re at the end of the road so they’re going to be the last to get aid, probably,” he said. He reported that villagers were having to hike 4 kilometers up mountains to get fresh water. Mr Brooks said villagers were concerned about the large population of young children on the island . Mr Brooks is worried the villagers will have trouble bouncing back from the disaster, adding that he hopes aid reaches the ‘far-flung villages’ like the one that sheltered him. Although no one he was with sustained injuries, people in nearby villages weren’t so lucky with a mother and son perishing after they were struck with debris. Mr Brooks said he intended to return to Vanuatu in the ­future to thank the villagers who sheltered and fed him. These revelations came as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pledged Australia’s long term support for Vanuatu during a visit to the Pacific nation. 'The Australian government and the Australian people will continue to support you in your time of need' Accompanied by the Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, she strongly indicated that Australia would make a substantial contribution to the longer term rebuilding of the devastated nation. ""Prime Minister I want to assure you that the Australian government and the Australian people will continue to support you in your time of need, not only in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, but I know that your long term recovery efforts will take some time."" Ms Bishop arrived Sunday morning to tour the cyclone relief centre in the capital Port Vila. She said Australia has sent over 11 military planes carrying lifesaving supplies and humanitarian support personnel.","Andrew Brooks, 45, was holidaying in Vanuatu when Cyclone Pam hit .

"A Labour rising star who claims to support women’s rights has two wives and asked an imam to sign off a supposed Islamic divorce, it was claimed last night. Councillor Waseem Zaffar has said he is committed to fighting gender inequality and declared his opposition to sharia law in Britain. But the politician and magistrate – once pictured with Labour leader Ed Miliband – married teacher Ayesha Imdad last year without having formally divorced his first wife. Lavish ceremony: Labour rising star Waseem Zaffar and his second wife Ayesha at their wedding last year . Instead, Zaffar – who received an MBE in 2012 for his charity work – sent Faraz Begum an Islamic divorce document in the post after walking out on her in 2010. He obtained the document from an imam who operates from a terraced house calling itself Raza mosque in Aston, Birmingham. This means that under English law at least, Zaffar, 33, is still married to Miss Begum, whom he wed in Pakistan in 2003. Meanwhile, in April last year, Zaffar married his second wife – who is now seven months pregnant – in a lavish Islamic ceremony. Among the hundreds of guests was shadow minister Jack Dromey, the husband of deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman. MPs and campaigners last night called for Zaffar’s suspension from the Labour Party. Connected: Councillor Waseem Zaffar pictured rubbing shoulders with Opposition leader Ed Miliband . Honored: Zaffar is awarded his MBE by Prince Charles in recognition of his charity work. The councillor is not formally divorced from his first wife, despite marrying his second last year . Glad-handing: Zaffar with Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Tory MP Dominic Raab has called for the party to investigate the magistrate and councillor . Some followers of sharia law believe divorces can be obtained by men without the knowledge or consent of their wives. A man simply states ‘talaq’ – meaning ‘I divorce thee’ – three times and it is granted. He is not required to give any kind of financial settlement to his wife. However, this method is widely frowned upon and most imams require both parties to be present and commit to a three-month attempt at reconciliation before they grant a divorce. Miss Begum, 36, a British national who is also Zaffar’s first cousin, received the divorce without warning, a friend said. If British citizens marry abroad, it is automatically recognised in English law. For this reason, for the marriage to end, the couple must obtain a divorce recognised by English courts. Miss Begum is currently seeking such a divorce, understood to be in the process of going through the courts. The master’s student said she was unable to comment due to the ongoing legal proceedings. In 2012, Zaffar, councillor for the Lozells and East Handsworth ward in Birmingham, declared on his website: ‘I have never and will never support sharia law in this country.’ Power and influence: Zaffar with Labour grandee Peter Mandelson. MPs and campaigners last night called for his suspension from the party . At the seat of power: Zaffar outside 10 Downing Street (left) and his second wife Ayesha in her wedding dress. Under English law, her husband is not in fact divorced from his first wife . Labour heavyweight David Blunkett (right) with Zaffar. The councillor has posted numerous pictures of himself with high-profile politicians online . He has also thrown his weight behind several women’s rights campaigns. He spoke at an Asian women’s engagement event in 2013, saying: ‘I came to politics to ensure a fair and equal society.’ The well-connected councillor often posts pictures of himself with celebrities and high-profile politicians online. In January, he tweeted a photo taken outside No 10 Downing Street, saying: ‘Brilliant reception hosted by Sam Cameron discussing issues affecting disaffected children across UK.’ Family lawyer and Islamic marriage specialist Aina Khan said Zaffar’s actions are ‘unforgivable if true’. ‘It’s hypocrisy to accept English law and then use sharia law when it suits you better,’ she said. She explained that Zaffar’s Islamic marriage to his second wife may not be recognised in the UK, putting her at risk of ‘losing everything’. The imam, Moulana Bostan Quadri, last night confirmed he gave Zaffar a sharia divorce. He said in broken English: ‘Throughout the Muslim world, it is unanimously that way ... if some Muslim man want to give the divorce to his wife, he can.’ He denied being paid, but divorces of this kind usually cost around £50 to £200. After repeated attempts to contact Zaffar, he declined to comment. Tory MP Dominic Raab called for Labour to investigate the councillor, adding: ‘It beggars belief that they are turning a blind eye.’","Waseem Zaffar, 33, says he is committed to fighting gender inequality .

"Turns out a kettle and microwave just aren't cutting it for British workers any more. A study has revealed  the criteria that would make an ideal working environment - and it has more than just a tea and coffee-making station. A survey of 2,000 office employees found that it's not just location that matters, but also décor, amenities and food menus. A survey of 2,000 British employee reveal that floor-to-ceiling windows is a coveted criteria in a dream office . Workers also said they wanted music played daily in their dream office . It turns out offices such as Google and Innocent are leading the way with their fresh take on office environments. They have proved among the most desirable places to work, due to their emphasis on a laid-back atmosphere and intriguing choice of décor. The offices of Innocent have areas of turfed floor with picnic benches, whereas Google's offices are known for their bright and sleek interior. It all starts with location, with workers stating that they would prefer their offices to be a three-mile commute away from their home. Four in ten also added that they would prefer it if their work was situated in a converted manor or warehouse - ideally next to a river. It seems a spacious work area is a high criteria of many workers, as Brits also expected floor-to-ceiling windows and natural lighting. A designated napping area was an aspect that people flagged would be a component of their dream office . Many workers stated that they would prefer their offices to be in a spacious manor or warehouse - ideally next to a river . Other décor criteria included brighter-coloured walls, comfortable chairs and modern furnishings. For summer days, office employees also suggested a garden space for 'al fresco' board meetings and summer socialising. In these outdoor areas, workers prioritised 'a great view', with the addition of sun loungers, picnic tables and exotic plants. The dream office would also have a bigger emphasis on a relaxing atmosphere and creative leisure time. Music would be played all the time, there would be designated napping areas, board games and pool tables. Unsurprisingly, British workers were disappointed with the lack of eating facilities in their current work places. Many wanted a canteen with a daily-changing menu, free fresh fruit bowls, and one in four wanted a buffet trolley to deliver cakes and drinks every Friday. Many employees wanted on-site crèches to look after their children while they worked, others wanted small accessories such as high-tech espresso machines . The study from 72Point, also revealed that many desired additional amenities that would either solve daily inconveniences or make the office a more well-rounded place. For those conscious of fitness, or those with children, 37 per cent of people wanted an on-site gym as well as a crèche. A spokesperson for Furniture at Work has stated: 'Sadly, the majority of offices were built decades ago, which can cause many workers to feel demotivated. 'No employee should feel cramped or ill due to their outdated surroundings, so it could be worth mentioning it to your supervisors.' In addition to improved amenities, people also wanted accessories such as hair-straighteners in the toilets as well as high-tech espresso machines. The spokesperson added: 'Offices are definitely changing, and it could be to everyone’s benefit.

"Florida beachgoers who were cooling down in the mid-afternoon sun on Monday afternoon were sent fleeing from the sea in terror after spotting sharks swimming just feet away from the shore. Dozens of men, women and children were frolicking in the ocean at Jacksonville Beach shortly before 3pm when someone noticed a shark fin gliding along the shore in 'knee-deep' water. After the person alerted other beachgoers to the sighting, there was a mad frenzy as everyone ran out of the water for their lives. Shortly after, another shark fin was spotted near Jacksonville Pier. The fin is believed to have belonged to another shark.

A few minutes later, another shark fin was spotted near the pier (pictured) Minutes after the sightings, some beachgoers headed back into the water to take a closer look at the sharks. Many took photos and videos of the shark's fins on their phones, according to News 4 Jax. Speaking to the news station, Admir Osmanovic said he was playing soccer on the beach when he saw 'everybody' turn to look toward the ocean. 'I'm like, ""What's everybody looking at?"", he said. 'Then I turn around and I see just everybody running, and there's a shark. It's about a 6-foot shark.' Mr Osmanovic added that although beachgoers had been terrified at first, many had proceeded to venture back into the water 'to check out' the marine animals, which he described as 'awesome'. 'Everybody is coming to the water, we're checking it out, we're pretty close to it,' he said. It was pretty cool, you know. First time ever seeing a shark in 15 years living in Jacksonville. I liked it.' Frenzy: After the person who saw the first shark fin alerted other beachgoers to the sighting, there was a mad frenzy as everyone ran out of the water.

"Labour MP Frank Field is in hospital after collapsing at a meeting in Birkenhead last night . Veteran Labour MP Frank Field is in hospital after collapsing at a meeting yesterday evening. The 72-year-old apparently blacked out following a public meeting and was taken to hospital by ambulance. He had been at a meeting at Highfield Church on the future of the Rock Ferry High School site. Mr Field is being treated at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital. He is reportedly responding well to treatment. A witness told the Wirral Globe Mr Field appeared to have 'fainted' as the debate grew heated. A Labour Party spokesman told the newspaper: 'He was taken to hospital last night. 'He is responding well to treatment. He will be making his own statement in due course.' A statement on the Save Rock Ferry High School Facebook page reported Mr Field said: 'Thankfully, I was told he was sitting up and OK but he was being taken to hospital for a check up. 'I also saw the ambulance arrive so that is likely to have been the case. 'Other than that, we know nothing and share your concern.' It added: 'We wish Mr Field well and a speedy recovery.' Mr Field, who was born in London, was first elected to the Commons in 1979. Previously, he was the first director of pressure group The Child Poverty Action, from 1969 to 1979. He was famously told to 'think the unthinkable' by Tony Blair while welfare reform minister. He resigned later after reported clashes with Gordon Brown and Harriet Harman. He went on to become one of the Labour Government's most outspoken critics. After the party's defeat in the 2010 general election, he was appointed Prime Minister David Cameron's poverty tsar and became the first member of the Labour party to be given a role in Cameron's team.

"The world’s first roller-skating artist has says she wants to reinvigorate traditional Chinese art for the next generation - by painting with wheels instead of a pen. Tian Haisu’s latest painting, ‘Blood-Lane-Line’ has gone on exhibition in the California College of Arts, The People's Daily Online has reported. The artist has ditched the calligraphy pen, which has been used for more than a thousand years in traditional Chinese painting, for a pair of skates, after being inspired by her favourite sport, ice skating. Chinese artist Tian Haisu paints her huge art using roller skates instead of the traditional calligraphy pen . The artist has adapted the skates so that they can hold a pot of paint, which releases as she weaves around the canvas . Tian, who started painting aged just three years old, adapted her skates especially so that a pot of black paint could be attached to them - a technique which she says makes her feel ‘at one with her art’. Through the new medium, she says she wants to give the traditional Chinese landscape painting a whole new lease of life. She said: ‘My whole body is involved and I produce all kids of ink landscapes. ‘Such creation is full of power, speed and rhythm. Tian has called her unique technique 'landskating', and say it makes her feel at one with her art . ‘I am so passionate about ink landscaping because it shows very rich emotions by means of simple forms. ‘I call it landskating.’ Born in Sichuan in 1988, Tian is a graduate of the San Francisco Art Institute and is currently studing at the California College of Arts. She first exhibited her work aged just 18 and her painting ‘Waiting’ was snapped up by the Beijing Olympic Committee in the year the Olympics were held in the China. Since then she has exhibited across China and the US - from Chengdu to Beijing and New York to San Francisco. The finished artwork is entitled 'Blood-Land-Line' and is deliberately hung so that the top half is on the wall, as a way of symbolising the link between heaven, earth and art . Tian is a critically-acclaimed artist currently studying at the California College of Arts . As well as winning numerous awards for her paintings, she has now been appointed a goodwill ambassador for the Beijing Huaya Education Fund. Her latest painting, measuring 13 metres (43 feet) tall by six metres (20 feet) wide was deliberately hung so that the top half was on the wall and the bottom half flowed onto the floor. Tian's intention, she explained was to gives the impression that heaven and earth are filled with the artistry of her creation in a way never seen before in other exhibitions.","Artist Tian Haisu swapped calligraphy pen for skates to create the work .

"The FBI increased a reward on Monday for helping to find an American ex-agent who disappeared in Iran eight years ago. In a statement, the FBI said the U.S. government will pay up to $5 million for information that can help bring Robert Levinson home, up from $1 million. 'We ask the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to work cooperatively with us on the investigation into Robert Levinson's disappearance so we can ensure his safe return,' Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. The FBI increased a reward on Monday for helping to find Robert Levinson (seen left in 2010 and right before he went missing) who disappeared in Iran eight years ago . FBI Director James Comey said 'it is long past time for Bob to come home.' Secretary of State John Kerry urged the Iranian government to 'work cooperatively with us on the investigation.' The father of seven retired from the FBI in 1998. Levinson, disappeared from the Iranian resort of Kish Island on March 9, 2007, while on a business trip. Friends of Levinson said that, around that time, he had been investigating the counterfeiting of cigarettes, though mainly in Latin America. The FBI has been investigating Levinson's disappearance and the hunt has led them into Afghanistan and Pakistan - and back to Iran. However, two Iranian presidents - including recently-elected moderate Hassan Rouhani - have denied having any involvement in his kidnapping or knowing where he is. An Associated Press investigation published in 2013 revealed that Levinson vanished while working for the CIA on an unapproved intelligence-gathering mission. Levinson had flown to the Iranian resort of Kish Island in March 2007 on CIA intelligence-gathering business when he was kidnapped . Levinson disappeared from Kish Island, an Iranian resort in the Persian Gulf. The Iranian government has repeatedly claimed that it has no idea where he is and was not responsible for his kidnapping . 'Year after year, the family has endured the pain of his absence. It is time for him to come home,' Kerry wrote, also expressing concern for Levinson's health. In November 2010, a video surfaced in which Levinson asked for help in winning his freedom but did not say who was holding him or where he was. The Iranian government has repeatedly said it knows nothing about Levinson's disappearance or whereabouts. In 2013 Sen. John McCain said that ‘the CIA did not tell the truth to the Congress’ about Levinson. McCain said he was confident the U.S. is doing all it can to learn what has happened to Levinson, but added he was disturbed the Obama administration has not been more forthcoming with information about him. Levinson was last seen in 2010 when his captors sent a video showing him holding several signs. He had lost weight and begged for help from the U.S. government . Levinson is seen here with his daughter Samantha at one of his favorite restaurants in Orlando, Florida . He said he didn't ‘think there's any doubt’ about whether Iran knows Levinson's fate. After he vanished, the CIA at first told lawmakers he had previously done contract work for the agency, but he had no current relationship with the agency and there was no connection to Iran. However, in October 2007, Levinson's lawyer discovered emails in which Levinson told a CIA friend that he was working to develop a source with access to the Iranian government. The emails were turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which touched off an internal CIA investigation. Three veteran analysts were forced out of the CIA and seven others were disciplined as a result of a breach of agency rules. The CIA paid Levinson's family $2.5 million to pre-empt a revealing lawsuit, and the agency rewrote its rules restricting how analysts can work with outsiders. The last photos and video of a bearded, emaciated Levinson were released anonymously to his family in 2010 and early 2011. Investigators say his trail has grown cold since. Top intelligence officials fear that he is dead. Tuesday is Levinson's 67th birthday - if he remains alive, he has been held captive longer than any American, longer than AP journalist Terry Anderson, who was held more than six years in Beirut.","Robert Levinson disappeared from the Iranian resort of Kish Island on March 9, 2007 .

"Airlines are changing procedures to ensure two crew are in the cockpit at all times following the Germanwings tragedy that killed 150 people. It dramatically emerged today that the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 that crashed into the French Alps locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane. The final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said it was 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz's plan to 'destroy the plane'. Now budget carrier EasyJet has announced the move will come into force tomorrow - and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across airlines. Scroll down for video . Disaster prevention: Budget airlines EasyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle will introduce new rules to ensure two crew members are in the cockpit at all times in the wake of the Germanwings air disaster . Tragedy: It emerged today that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people on board . Safety: Now budget carrier EasyJet has announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines . Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door, EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet . The move comes after the Civil Aviation Authority urged airlines to review their policies to avoid the pilot or co-pilot being alone at the controls. An easyJet spokeswoman said: 'easyJet can confirm that, with effect from Friday 27 March, it will change its procedure which will mean that two crew members will be in the cockpit at all times. 'This decision has been taken in consultation with the Civil Aviation Authority. The safety and security and of its passengers and crew is the airline's highest priority.' EasyJet said a cabin crew member will temporarily enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet. The airline will not have a third trained pilot on board. And a spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: 'We always ensure we have the highest safety standards and, while it is our common practise to have two members of our crew in the flight deck at all times, in light of recent events we are now in the process of formalising this to be policy.' The change is also being implemented by package tour operator Thomas Cook, whose spokesman said: 'We are adapting our procedures to ensure there will always two people in the cockpit.' An aviation industry insider said: 'There is some industry chatter about the policy becoming mandatory.' Budget airlines Ryanair, Monarch and Jet2, which flies from airports in the Midlands, North and Scotland, said they already had policies to ensure two crew are in the cockpit at all times. Ryanair said it already operates a policy requiring two people in the cockpit 'at all times'. Its spokeswoman said: 'If a pilot needs to visit the bathroom the cabin crew supervisor is required to stand in the cockpit for these brief periods.' Risk management: Pilot Europe's third largest budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle has also announced the same move for 'safety reasons' Doomed: The captain of the ill-fated flight - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter (file photo) Monarch's spokeswoman added: 'We also have an 'eyes-on' rule requiring cabin crew to enter the cockpit during the cruising stage to check on the pilot and co-pilot.' A Jet2 spokeswoman said: 'This rule has been in place for a number of years to ensure the safety and security of our customers.' While a FlyBe spokespman said their Operations Manual 'states that two members of crew are to be present in the cockpit at all times during flight'. British Airways and BMI Regional declined to comment, while Ryanair were unavailable. Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures. 'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence. As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually. 'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards. 'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.' His parents only discovered that their son was a mass murderer minutes before the dramatic press conference by prosecutors in Marseille. 'Deliberate': Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually . Heart-broken: Family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene in Le Vernet near the French Alps today, as rescuers tried to recover the dead bodies of their deceased relatives . Rescue: Helicopters lowered investigators down to the scene of the obliterated plane where debris and human remains were scattered . Safety procedure: Budget airlines Ryanair, Monarch and Jet said they already had policies to ensure two crew are in the cockpit at all times . 'When one person leaves the cockpit, two people will now have to be there,' Norwegian's flight operations director Thomas Hesthammer said. Long haul flights usually have more than two crew capable of flying the plane because shift changes are often required in flight. A spokeswoman for German carrier Lufthansa, parent company of Germanwings, said: 'A crew member may temporarily leave the cockpit during a specific phase of the flight. 'So far, no decision has been taken to change the procedure as it is already approved by the German office of federal aviation but we will look into it. So far, we trust our procedure. It also transpired today that the Germanwings co-pilot who flew the plane into the Alps at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and 'burnout'. Mr Lubitz - whose family were at the scene of the crash in Seyne today -  postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was 'in depression'. Airline bosses confirmed Lubitz had taken several months off work and had to retrain to join the firm but insisted he was '100% fit to fly'. Raid: German police have investigated Andreas Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf . Killer's home: A French prosecutor in Marseille said Mr Lubitz's breathing was normal as the plane descended rapidly before crashing into the French Alps . German police have since raided Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf. At an extraordinary press conference earlier, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box. He said Lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck. At that point, Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually - and deliberately. He said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'. Earlier in the flight, Mr Robin said Lubitz's responses were initially courteous, but became 'curt' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane. The captain - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter. Mr Robin said: 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something. 'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane. 'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit.'","Andreas Lubitz locked pilot out of cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed A320 .

"Ireland's Prime Minister has reacted angrily to a St Patrick's Day video message from Prime Minister Tony Abbott who he accused of promoting a 'stage Irish perception' of the country. Enda Kenny told the Irish Independent he had watched Mr Abbott's video and rejected the implication given by Mr Abbott that Ireland was synonymous with drinking copious amounts of alcohol. Mr Abbott came in for criticism last week for the video message where he awkwardly described St Patrick's Day as the one day of the year when 'it's good to be green'. Scroll down for video . 'As you can see, I've got my green tie on for the occasion.' Tony Abbott has come under fire for his 'patronising' St Patrick's Day message . 'It has been said that the English made the laws, the Scots made the money and the Irish made the songs,' Mr Abbott says in the video . He proclaims Ireland's most famous day 'a great day for the Irish, and the English, the Vietnamese, the Cambodians and everyone who cares to come to a party'. Mr Abbott even apologises that 'I can't be there to share a Guinness or two or maybe even three'. The Irish prime minister, known in Gaelic as the Taoiseach, said he had heard Mr Abbott's comments and wasn't happy with them. 'I've heard the Prime Minister's comments. He made them. I don't agree with that,' Mr Kenny said in the Irish Independent. 'I think that it is perfectly in order for so many Irish people in Australia to have an enjoyable celebration of St Patrick's Day and St Patrick's week, and to do so in a thoroughly responsible fashion. 'There has been a long-term view of a stage Irish perception. I reject that. I think it's really important that we understand that we have a national day that can be celebrated worldwide, St Patrick's Day.' Mr Abbott apologised that 'I can't be there to share a Guinness or two or maybe even three' 'I would have hoped for a more business-focussed message in a video that was designed for business functions,' an Irish businessman told the Irish Times . Is this what I think it is? Defence Minister Kevin Andrews gets ready to celebrate St Patrick's Day . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Defence Minister Kevin Andrews also drew a link between St Patrick's Day and alcohol consumption, tweeting a picture of himself holding a can of Guinness. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was asked about Mr Kenny's comments and whether Australia had received a complaint from the Irish ambassador on the video message. Ms Bishop said: 'I have not had the Irish ambassador complain about a conspicuous consumption of alcohol.' Last week Mr Abbott came under fire from Irish leaders  who dubbed his St Patrick's Day video message 'patrionising'. Mr Abbott said St Patrick's Day is a 'great day for the Irish...and anyone else who wants to come to a party', and that it is the 'one day of the year when it's good to be green,' in the video posted to the Liberal Party's YouTube page. 'This is the love of  life and good humour the Irish have given Australia,' he continued. 'It has been said that the English made the laws, the Scots made the money and the Irish made the songs.' An Irish businessman in Australia said the Prime Minister's message is 'patronising', according to the Irish Times. 'I would have hoped for a more business-focussed message in a video that was designed for business functions,' he said. The video was supplied to both the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Lansdowne Club to be played during St Patrick's Day celebrations, but reportedly neither party will show it . 'There are so many good stories of Irish people in business in Australia, Mr Abbott's lack of awareness of any of that is astonishing.' The video was supplied to both the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Lansdowne Club to be played during St Patrick's Day celebrations, but reportedly neither party will show it. The Lansdowne Club said it was unable to find space on the day's schedule to show the 70-second video. Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Barry Corr said the video was 'a generic St Patrick's Day message' and 'on that basis it is not part of the event'.","Enda Kenny said Mr Abbott's comments promoted a 'stage Irish perception' of the country .

"Whiskey lovers all over the world claim the key to the perfect bourbon is time. But a catastrophic shortage of whiskey could soon be on the way with anecdotal reports suggesting the demand for bourbon is about to outstrip supply. Now, some distillers have taken heed of the warnings and are coming up with radical new ways to mature whiskey to its full potential faster than ever before. Whiskey lovers all over the world will tell you the key to the perfect bourbon is time. But a catastrophic shortage of whiskey could soon be the way with anecdotal reports suggesting the demand for bourbon is about to outstrip supply . According to a report by Tasha Eichensehert in Nautilus, the popularity of bourbon last year saw 19 million cases sold, generating $2.7 billion in revenue. She claims that through a series of inventive ageing methods, manufacturers have been able to cut the two-to-20-year process into just days and months. The ageing of whiskey usually takes place in 200-litres (53 American gallons) barrels made from seasoned American white oak, Quercus alba. These barrels are charred, breaking down the lignin in the wood into compounds called aldehydes. Adding alcohol to the barrel causes oxidation which transforms the aldehydes into acids. Changes in heat within the barrel then give whiskey its complex flavour. Through a series of inventive ageing methods, manufacturers have been able to cut the two-to-20-year process whiskey ageing process into just days and months . Nautilus reports that Tuthilltown Spirits in Gardiner, New York - the makers of Hudson Baby Bourbon – are now letting the alcohol settle in 2- to 5-gallon oak barrels. This, they say, increases the alcohol-to-barrel-surface ratio, causing the whiskey to mature faster, cutting the time down to around four months. Meanwhile Copper Fox Distillery in Virginia is adding toasted oak chips their barrel, in another attempt to increase the alcohol-to-surface ratio. One distillery in South Carolina claims it has cut the process down to just eight hours. Terressentia, near Charleston, first filters the whiskey in plastic tanks. There are concerns that pubs could become a thing of the past as thousands close each year due to spiralling production costs. But a new machine could help landlords feeling the pinch, because it can produce pints that cost just 35 pence (53 cents) each. The Truebrew Technobrewery  can make 280 pints of beer in just two hours at the touch of a button. A similar size to an industrial oven, the machine is intended for business use and will cost around £25,000 ($38,000). The machine allows landlords to brew their own beer for a quarter of the price of buying it in from a brewery. The machine is filled it with water, and then ingredients including hops are placed inside. It's then switched on for two hours. The machine is self-cleaning and the beer is ready to drink seven days later. This speeds up the aldehyde and acid reaction creating chemical compounds that can be consumed in a matter of hours. Entrepreneurs have also created home tools for people to fake the taste of aged whisky. A wooden tool called 'Whiskey Element,' which claims to be able to make cheap liquor taste expensive in just 24 hours. The oak sticks are specially designed to 'age' the drink by filtering out impurities and infusing the whiskey with a more woody flavour similar to pricier tipples. The sticks have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall-surface area touching the liquid. They are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whiskey to replicate the taste of a more expensive tipple. Whether or not these fast-Bourbon's live up to the taste test remains to be seen.

"When Kerryn Barnett sat down at the dinner table with her family on Christmas Day, she had no idea that  she was about to eat  her last solid meal for three months. After suffering debilitating vomiting and extreme fatigue after the feast, the 36-year-old mother-of-three was diagnosed with severe gastroparesis, a condition that paralyses the muscles and nerves of the stomach. In the past five months, the Wollongong quality controller has shed a staggering 15kg due to the illness and is living on purely a liquid diet. Now she's been told by her insurance company Bupa that they will not pay for her life-saving surgery, leaving her facing a medical bill of $33,000. Kerryn Barnett (left) has not been able to eat a solid meal since Christmas lunch due to a rare condition called gastroparesis . Nearly ten months ago, Ms Barnett knew something was wrong with her body when she lost her appetite and started experiencing nausea and bloating. 'I started to vomit after eating and then the weight started to drop quite rapidly,' Ms Barnett told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Barnett went straight to the doctor, who took blood tests and conducted a pelvic ultrasound. The tests continued for four months, with Ms Barnett visiting two different specialists and a professor, testing out over 15 types of medication until finally she got a diagnosis. Gastroparesis is a rare condition which causes the stomach to stop working as it should. It results in the body being unable to digest or tolerate foods. The disease is extremely debilitating with constant nausea, daily vomiting, fatigue, muscle cramping, fainting episodes, abdominal bloating and reduced appetite taking over sufferers's lives. Ms Barnett has been forced to cut down the hours of her full-time job due to the extreme fatigue she experiences and has lost 15kg in just five months. Her main priority is to get out of bed in the morning and help her 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old twin boys get ready for school. The Wollongong mother-of-three, pictured here with her husband and children, has lost 15kg in five months . Ms Barnett is terrified about her future, and is also concerned about how she is going to continue to care for her children . Then she will go back to bed and hope to make it up just in time to greet them at the door when they return. 'I feel absolutely exhausted because obviously none of the food goes down the small intestine, which distributes the food to different parts of your body, so I'm fatigued and exhausted at the moment,' she said. 'It’s had a huge impact on the kids. 'I've got 8-year-old twin boys. One runs off to his bedroom crying every time I'm sick. I obviously try and be as discreet as I possibly can because some days the vomiting is so bad it’s loud and I’m running from one side of the house to get to the bathroom. It’s a little bit hard,' she said. While she has explained her condition to her three children, Ms Barnett said she only gives them the information they need to know. 'I've tried to sit down and explain that there’s nowhere for the food to go and that’s why I start to vomit. 'I try to tell them as much as I can but not enough to scare them. 'I've got one that’s a bit emotional at the moment and the teachers are keeping an eye on them,' she said. Her diet now consists only of liquid. A typical meal for the mum would be soup or broth. On a good day she might try to hold down a smoothie with yoghurt. She is unable to drink Powerade without water, as it is too strong for her stomach to handle or any type of solid food. Going out to a restaurant is traumatic for the mother, as even if she limits herself to soup from the menu, she will more than likely be running for the bathroom after 20 minutes to vomit. The rare condition has paralysed the nerves and muscles of her stomach, but her health insurer are refusing to pay for life-saving surgery . 'I've got 8-year-old twin boys. One runs off to his bedroom crying every time I'm sick' Ms Barnett revealed . 'You kind of take advantage of the fact that you have the ability to eat, it’s only when you can’t eat that you realise how much food impacts on you life, even just the social aspect,' she said. 'Most of the time as soon as I eat, it’s coming straight back up within 20 mins to an hour and I certainly don’t want to be at a restaurant getting sick on someone's birthday. Due to the extent of Ms Barnett's weight loss and malnutrition, her only option is to try and treat the condition with a gastric neurostimulator as soon as possible. The pacemaker, which is similar to a pacemaker that goes into heart, is placed in the stomach and is used to assist the muscles in breaking down the food which enters the body. The pioneering surgery has only been tried out 22 times in Australia, but for Ms Barnett, the 80 per cent proven reduction in vomiting could change her life forever. 'As a mother of three young children I so desperately want to be here on this earth to see them grow up, this surgery will allow me a chance, a hope to be able to do that. 'Hopefully it will cut down on the vomiting so I can actually take medication and keep it down and be able to eat some puréed meals and hopefully solid meals one day,' she said. However Ms Barnett's insurance provider, Bupa, has refused to foot the bill for the $33,000 surgery, due to the fact that the device is not regularly used in the medical world, unlike a pacemaker for the heart. Ms Barnett's insurance provider, Bupa, has refused to foot the bill for the $33,000 surgery, due to the fact that the device is not regularly used in the medical world . 'There’s no Medicare item number for the device so they won’t cover the cost primarily for that reason,' Ms Barnett said. 'They will pay for the hospital stay, the cost of the surgeon and the abdominal surgery because they all have Medicare item numbers so we have to pay for the device ourselves.' Ms Barnett was told that she could appeal the decision by Bupa, but it will take three to four months for that to occur. 'I don’t have three or four months to wait to see the outcome of an appeal,' she said. 'I don’t know where I’ll be in four or five months with my current weight loss.' Ms Barnett has gone ahead and set the date for the surgery. The pacemaker, which will be installed into her stomach on April 16,  is set to cost Ms Barnett $25,000  and $3800 for each of the lead. If it is unsuccessful, the next step would be to remove her whole stomach, leaving her unable to ever eat solid food again or even consume any liquids. 'That would take away my ability to even drink water. I’d never ever be able to have anything else orally so that would be the absolute last resort,' she said. Last week, Ms Barnett set up a fundraising page in the hope that the public can help her raise the funds for the much-needed surgery. Mr Barnett said she is 'amazed' that over $8,000 has already been raised on the site, however she is still holding out hope that Bupa will change their mind over their decision. 'Every time I get off the phone I just spend the afternoon crying it’s just devastating,' she said. 'They've got my life in their hands. They haven't called me and looked at my individual case. They've just said a blanket no. 'I feel quite abandoned by them and it’s additional stress when you’re unwell that you don’t need,' she said. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Bupa for comment.","36-year-old Kerryn Barnett has not eaten a solid meal since Christmas Day .

"In an northeastern Indian town, residents are dying of breathing disorders and skin diseases at alarming rates as underground fires that have raged for nearly a century continue to blanket the city in toxic smoke. The town of Jharia, in India's northeastern Jharkhand province, plays host to more than 70 fires which have burned continuously beneath the earth's surface since 1916. Here the infernos have been left to burn unhindered following a coal mine collapse in the resource-rich region - which produced a blaze so intense authorities have balked for decades at the effort required to extinguish it. Villagers in Jharia, Jharkhand, warm themselves beside a fire made of coal scavenged from the vast mine .

A man bathes in water which is in itself badly contaminated after spending several days scavenging coal . Fuelled by billions of dollars worth of coal lying under the surface, the fires cause sinkholes which twenty years ago swallowed 250 homes within four hours. Toxic fumes - which include poisons such as sulfur, sulfur, carbon and nitrogen oxides - are a part of everyday life where coal emissions are causing devastatingly high rates of breathing disorders and skin diseases among locals. Residents and children spend their days clamoring over the hot ground to eke out a living by chiseling out pieces of coal to sell at local markets. The first coal mine fire was detected in the area in 1916 and is believed to be due to a open cast mine not being correctly decommissioned. In the decades since, it has spread to become truly unmanageable. And despite repeated warnings that the town and surrounding area is on the brink of an ecological and humanitarian disaster, little has been done to help residents despite promises to move the entirety of the town.

In spite of horrendous living conditions, he also witnessed children making their way through the area in bare feet in order to eke out a living from what coal they could salvage. He said: 'At the end of every day I had a layer of coal on my clothes and my skin and sometimes and I often felt like my face was burning,' Wired reported. 'I had pretty heavy boots, but sometimes just walking around the soles almost melted off. 'I saw young kids - six or seven years old - carrying coal with no shoes on, breathing that air.

"A police officer called to a domestic fight over a love triangle compared the row to the Jeremy Kyle show and complained, 'I don't get paid for this s***', a report claimed today. The comment was said to have been made when Darren Orrett turned up at the home of his ex-lover Dawn Barr - five days before Barr stabbed him to death. Two officers, PC Simon Butler and Acting Sgt Michael Poole, have now been formally disciplined for failing to deal with the incident properly amidst claims that they did not take the argument seriously. Row: Dawn Barr, left, killed ex-boyfriend Darren Orrett, right, five days after an argument attended by police . Police did not report the fact that Mr Orrett, 32, had sustained a stab wound during the altercation as they apparently believed Barr's assertion that he had inflicted it on himself, according to a report from the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Five days later, Barr, 42, stabbed Mr Orrett in the neck with a vegetable knife, causing him to bleed to death. She was later convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nine years in jail. The couple had been together for 12 years before they split up and had four young children together, three of whom suffered from cystic fibrosis. Mr Orrett struggled to accept the end of their relationship, and would often turn up at Barr's home in a bid to win her back, even though she was now seeing another man, Robert Joyce. In November 2012, police were called to Barr's house in Cheadle, Greater Manchester after she called them accusing him of threatening to stab her new boyfriend. Scene: Forensic officers at Barr's house in Cheadle, Greater Manchester after the fatal stabbing . Horror: Police initially downplayed the incident in November 2012 five days before Mr Orrett was killed . According to Barr, one of the officers on the scene said: 'This is like f***ing Jeremy Kyle, I don't get paid for this s***.' All the police involved denied comparing the situation to the controversial talk show, but the IPCC report concluded it was likely that someone had used the phrase. When they later filed a log of the incident, the officers stated that no offences had been committed despite the fact that Mr Orrett showed them a stab wound in his abdomen. In the domestic violence report which the police filled out, they did not mention a weapon and downplayed the severity of the incident. Following the IPCC's report, PC Butler and Acting Sgt Poole, from Greater Manchester Police, were given written warnings for misconduct. Five days after the argument which was attended by police, Mr Orrett once again turned up at Barr's home because their daughter sent him a message saying she missed him. He clashed with his ex and tried to hide her mobile phone so she couldn't contact Mr Joyce, leading to a fight in which he was stabbed in the neck. Father: Mr Orrett pictured with two of his four children with Barr, three of whom had cystic fibrosis . Barr called 999 and police arrived to find Mr Orrett bleeding to death on the floor. His former partner was cleared of murdering him but found guilty of murder in May 2013. It later emerged that she had written messages to Mr Joyce in which she said, 'I'll stab the c*** myself' and 'Get him gone - I'm gonna kill this c***.' IPCC commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said today: ' What we have seen in this investigation and others we have done into the way Greater Manchester Police deal with victims of domestic abuse is that there is sometimes a disconnect between the policies and practice of the force and what is actually happening on the front line. 'There is a need to tackle a culture on the front line, which appears to minimise and dismiss the impact of domestic violence, to make sure that we do not see further examples where victims are let down with catastrophic outcomes. 'There were opportunities for officers to take more robust action in this case and those opportunities were missed. 'We are concerned that this is one of a number of Greater Manchester Police cases we are investigating, and hope that the force and its officers are learning from our and HMIC's recommendations so that the service it provides improves.'","Dawn Barr called the police when Darren Orrett turned up at her home in Greater Manchester in November 2012 .

"Armed with plastic bags packed with silver coins, Indonesian protesters today took to the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to 'pay back' the country's $1 billion aid donation given in the aftermath of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The tongue-in-cheek protest followed an Indonesian uproar over Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks last month linking Australia's humanitarian work in Indonesia to the fate of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are slated for execution by firing squad. Carrying flags with Mr Abbott's face crossed out, the small group of protesters were photographed handing over the petty currency to embassy officials. Is this a down payment? Indonesian protesters today handed bags of silver coins to Australian officials at the embassy in Jakarta after Mr Abbott last month referenced Australia's billion dollar aid donation to Indonesia following the Boxing Day tsunami in relation to the imminent execution of the Bali Nine . A small group of young Indonesians today protested Mr Abbott's remarks linking the execution of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . 'Coin4Abbott': After collecting bags of coins, Indonesian activists today attempted to re-pay the Australian government for their $1 billion Boxing Day tsunami aid . In late February, Mr Abbott caused a furore when told reporters: 'Let us not forget that a few years ago, when Indonesia was struck by the Indian Ocean tsunami, Australia sent a billion dollars worth of assistance.' He added that Australians lost their lives in the humanitarian campaign and that Australia would be 'grievously let down'. 'I would say to the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government - we in Australia are always there to help you and we hope that you might reciprocate in this way at this time.' Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir responded by telling media: 'From what I know, nobody responds well to threats'. Crossed out: Prime Minister Tony Abbott's visage was vandalised by demonstrators in Jakarta today, as protesters 'donated' several bags of coins to the Indonesian embassy . Many Indonesians took social media to rail against the Prime Minister's remarks last month, particularly under the hashtag #Coin4Abbott . Many Indonesians took social media to rail against the Prime Minister's remarks, particularly under the hashtag #Coin4Abbott.

Indonesia's Attorney-General has delayed Chan and Sukumaran's execution until all of their avenues of appeal have been exhausted. Mr Abbott told WSFM on Friday that the protest would not stop him from holidaying in Bali, adding that his diplomacy would take a more private form. 'I would hate to think that our understandable dismay and disappointment and even anger at the prospect of these executions... would permanently blight the relationship, because it's too important to both our countries,' he said.","Indonesian protesters today attempted to 'pay back' Australia's $1 billion Boxing Day tsunami aid donation .

"A suspected Banksy of a pouting young girl is believed to now be worthless after a vandal painted over it so she is now wearing a burkha. The artwork, which first appeared on the side of the North Star pub in Hounslow, west London, in 2007, was defaced over the weekend. The 6ft tall mural, thought to be worth £100,000, has the word 'smile' in brightly coloured letters written above the girl, originally pictured in pigtails - but now only her eyes remain visible. The Banksy of a pouting young girl in Hounslow, which first appeared in 2007 (left) was defaced over the weekend to show the girl wearing a burkha, leaving only her eyes visible . Local residents were left furious after the work - believed to be worth more than £100,000 - was vandalised, adding it had been the 'only thing that made them smile in Hounslow'. Sandra D'Souza said she was 'horrified' when she saw the defaced artwork. She said: 'I'm sure it brought a smile to the face of lots of other people passing by and it's such a shame it's been defaced like this.' Sam Spencer, 32, added: 'I was walking to Hounslow station on Sunday, which is right near the Banksy and saw the girl had been covered with a burkha. 'I don't know what is wrong with people around here - it's about the only thing Hounslow has got going for it and now it's ruined.' Twitter user @missfab2014 said the work was the 'only decent thing' in Hounslow and urged the artist to fix it . A Twitter user, known as Ems, urged the artist to come and fix the work. She said: 'The only decent thing in Hounslow and now look at it #banksy @thereaIbanksy come sort it out pls!!' Soon after the mural appeared in 2007, Paul Riley, the then landlord of the North Star pub - now a bar called Platform 3 - installed CCTV to stop the Banksy being vandalised. It is not known if the cameras are still in place. He said at the time: 'I phoned the council to tell them not to paint over it because it was a work of art. 'They came to look at it and agreed with me. I think it is lovely.' UPDATE: A representative for Banksy has confirmed to MailOnline that the work is not by the artist. The work has now been restored. Because of the value attached to many of Banky's pieces, his work had long been targeted by thieves hoping to sell stolen work for huge amounts. But they've also been attacked by vandals - some rival graffiti artists - for no other apparent purpose than to deface and destroy the work. His Spybooth painting, featuring three 1950s-style agents, wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats, using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box, appeared in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in April last year. It soared in value when Banksy confirmed it was one of his pieces - and the wall was boarded up but a bidding war ensued as locals tried to raise an estimated £1million to secure it for the town. It was defaced a few months later - and last month, the stencil was granted Grade II-listed status. The 'Spybooth' Banksy in Cheltenham features three agents, wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats, using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box. Pictured left, in 2014 and right, its defaced state . But the owner of the property it is on says the work has 'ruined his life'. David Possee, 45, says he has been unable to remove and sell the work - and cannot carry out building work to make the house habitable. Last year, a Banksy painting of a woman staring at an empty plinth on the wall of an amusement arcade in Folkestone, Kent, was valued at £300,000. The local council quickly placed a perspex cover over the mural to protect it, heading off a potential disastrous act of vandalism when someone later crudely scrawled a penis on the plinth. Last October, a large mural in the elusive artist's hometown of Bristol - dubbed 'The Girl With The Pierced Eardrum' - had paint thrown over it days after it appeared. The work, a parody of the famous Girl With A Pearl Earring by Dutch master Vermeer, had a yellow alarm box replacing the earring from the original painting.","Artwork first appeared on side of pub in Hounslow, west London, in 2007 .

"Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez peers into a monitor as it displays evidence in his murder trial. One day there is a photograph of him smiling next to his fiancee on Father's Day, a few hours before the killing. Another shows Hernandez on video dancing at a gas station minutes before prosecutors say he picked up the victim. Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez sits with his defense attorney Charles Rankin during his murder trial at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts . Hernandez is charged with killing semiprofessional football player Odin Lloyd . Hernandez has made hard faces at witnesses as they come of the stand, or even flirted in some cases . And still another shows the bullets that killed Odin Lloyd on June 17, 2013. Hernandez has watched the case against him unfold for more than a month, taking notes but also taking time to banter with his attorneys or make eyes at the high school sweetheart who could be called to testify against him. Hernandez is accused of killing Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd's body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's home. At the time, Hernandez had a $40 million contract as one of the Patriots' star tight ends. The year before the killing, Hernandez played in the Super Bowl and caught a touchdown pass from Tom Brady. The trial began in January, and now Hernandez spends his days - 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. - in a courtroom, with one 15-minute morning break and an hour break for lunch. Hernandez first day of court opened with him giving his attorney a hug and talking high school sports . Hernandez is slighter now than he was June 26, 2013, the day he was arrested in Lloyd's killing. But there are still flashes of the old football star. He often enters the courtroom with a swagger. The first time he was in court after his former team won the Super Bowl last month, he greeted his lawyer with a big hug. He can sometimes be overheard talking high school sports with his lawyer and a court officer. One of Hernandez's lawyers, Michael Fee, would not comment when asked last week how Hernandez is doing. The judge has directed lawyers not to speak to reporters about the case. Hernandez appears to be paying close attention in court, though the judge has told lawyers no to talk to reporters about the trial . For the most part, Hernandez appears to pay close attention to what is happening in the courtroom, even when it is dry and technical. He stands respectfully for the 16 jurors when they enter and leave the courtroom and occasionally passes notes or whispers to his lawyers Charles Rankin, who sits next to him, and Fee and James Sultan, who sit at a table in front of him. He sometimes chuckles at the pointed questions and mannerisms of Sultan, who has aggressively gone after some witnesses in the case. Hernandez can be more interesting to watch when the jury is not there. One day, with the jury out of the courtroom, a high school teammate of Hernandez's came in to be questioned. Robert Paradis had told investigators Hernandez told him that he had a .45-caliber gun. He also said he opened a drawer at Hernandez's home in California and found what he believed was a gun wrapped in a black shirt, and he picked it up but did not unwrap it. Hernandez gave Paradis the stink eye as he walked past, apparently trying to stare him down. Paradis looked unsettled. The bench in the gallery behind Hernandez's seat is typically reserved for his family members, but lately it has been empty more often than not. On some days, he steals sideways glances at the vacant seats. By contrast, across the aisle behind prosecutors, several members of Lloyd's family occupy the front row every day. His mother, Terri Hernandez, who lives more than two hours away in Connecticut, occasionally attends the trial with aunts, uncles or cousins. His brother, DJ, a graduate assistant football coach at Iowa, attended the first two days in January but has not been seen at court since. On days when his relatives come, Hernandez turns on the charm. He beams a dimpled smile to the front row and occasionally whispers jokes, once telling them that he wants coffee in the carafe that court officers give him at the defense table, but all they will give him is water. At the time of the killing Hernandez was playing for the Patriots with a $40 million contract . Shayanna Jenkins, his fiancee and the mother of his 2-year-old daughter, comes sporadically. On those days, the two flirt and giggle together. Hernandez compliments her hair and winks at her. Jenkins has been granted immunity to testify. That could allow prosecutors to compel her to take the stand. It's unclear how much she is cooperating or whether she would testify if called. On Friday, Jenkins attended the trial for the first time in more than a week, along with Hernandez's mother and others. Hernandez tends to flirt and giggle when his fiance is in court . Hernandez lit up when he saw them, thanking them for coming. Jenkins was not wearing the huge diamond engagement ring she typically sports on her left ring finger, but it was not clear whether Hernandez noticed or why it was missing. At the end of the day, Hernandez turned to look at her one last time. 'I love you, girl,' he said. She just smiled.

"Superbike champion: Sean Emmett (pictured), 45, flew into a rage over his girlfriend's table manners . A drunken former British Superbike champion who attacked his girlfriend because he didn’t like the way she was eating has been jailed for three months. Sean Emmett, 45, of Molesey, Surrey, flew into a rage over the table manners of Lana Saoud, 25, after drinking eight pints of Guinness - throttling her and hitting her around the face. Blood was found all over the room where the 45-year-old motorcyclist and his partner of two years Miss Saoud were staying following the attack, Guildford Magistrates’ Court was told. A judge was told father-of-three Emmett lost his temper after the couple returned to the house where they were staying with a takeaway - and he took exception to the way she was eating. He admitted assault and was jailed for 12 weeks last Friday. Emmett's former wife Abbie died after falling to her death from a hotel while they were on their honeymoon in Dubai in 2013. At court last week, Carole Fern, prosecuting, said Emmett had calmly returned to the pub to drink more after beating up Miss Saoud. She was left in the street with a nose bleed. Ms Fern added: ‘They were eating dinner, she was eating quickly as she was hungry. They had a difference of opinion about her manner of eating. She said he grabbed her around the neck with one hand and hit her in the face. 'He does say she slapped him first and in her statement she does say she slapped him.’  Ms Fern said the man who they were staying with then heard Emmett tell his partner to ‘get out’. ‘She’s injured now and she’s on the street,’ the prosecutor said. ‘It’s about 8.30 or 9 in the evening. While this is happening the defendant goes back to the pub. Motorcyclist: A judge was told father-of-three Emmett (pictured at Snetterton Circuit in Norfolk in 2006) lost his temper after the couple returned to the house where they were staying with a takeaway . Sentenced: Emmett was jailed for 12 weeks at Guildford Magistrates’ Court (above) after admitting the assault . Pub: The couple had been drinking at The Lord Hotham (pictured) in West Molesey, Surrey, before the attack . ‘There are young people outside the Royal Oak pub and the victim is trying to cover her face with her hands. She says “please call me an ambulance, he’s hurt me”.’ However, Miss Saoub later told police and paramedics that she had sustained her injuries after falling over. Ms Fern said she had been left with hand marks around her neck, a very bruised left cheek bone and injuries to her nose. Ex-spouse: Emmett's former wife Abbie (pictured) died after falling to her death from a hotel while they were on their honeymoon in Dubai in 2013 . The Lebanese national had already been attacked by Emmett once before, resulting in him being given a domestic violence protection order, the court heard. Ms Fern said: ‘She’s vulnerable, she has no place else to go. He has the control there. 'It’s aggravated by the fact he had a DVPO for the same victim that was breached by taking her away and he served time for that.’ The court was also told how Miss Saoud had given police a statement from her bed in Kingston Hospital in which she said her boyfriend had drunk ‘seven or eight pints of Guinness and she drank four or five’. The couple had been drinking at The Lord Hotham pub in West Molesey, before the attack took place on January 24 this year. Simon Collingham, defending, told the court that Emmett admitted going ‘beyond reasonable force’, but claimed it was ‘dangerous’ to speculate about other issues. He said: ‘Those who deal with the defendant make no comment about his intoxication whatsoever. Do you think it would have been something they would have mentioned? ‘We only have to judge the case on the facts. He had no intention to cause great harm.' Mr Collingham revealed the pair are now engaged to be married and added there had been correspondence between the two while he was in custody. Chair of the bench Jane Bak decided not to issue a restraining order to Emmett after hearing Miss Saoud did not want one. As well as being jailed, Emmett was told to pay an £80 victim surcharge.

"David Cameron's claim to be a 'tax-cutting politician' was under fire last night – as a study found the Coalition has raised taxes by more than £16billion a year. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said the net effect of changes by the Coalition had raised taxes by an average £255 for every person in the UK. The respected think-tank found the tax rises totalled £64.3billion – including a £14billion hike in VAT and a £5.2billion increase in National Insurance contributions. Millions of people have been dragged into paying the 40p tax rate for the first time – and inheritance tax has increased as thresholds have been frozen for years. Humiliating: Revelation that the Coalition has raised taxes is embarrassing for Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured), who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to be seen as a 'tax cutter' The tax hikes have been only partially offset by reductions totalling £48billion – including £8billion from raising the personal income tax threshold, £5.9billion in lowering corporation tax and £3.9billion from real-terms cuts in fuel duties. Ministers insist the tax rises were needed to help plug the budget deficit left by Labour. Sources say they had no choice but to take 'difficult decisions' to save Britain from bankruptcy. But the findings remain embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who has spoken repeatedly of his desire to be seen as a 'tax cutter'. They show the value of the rise in personal income tax allowance has been wiped out by rises in other levies. In next week's Budget, Chancellor George Osborne, is expected to announce a further increase in the personal allowance, along with modest cuts in alcohol duties. But Treasury sources admit they have little money to play with. The IFS said the Coalition's changes represented a 'missed opportunity to improve the tax system', with little attempt to address 'fundamental structural deficiencies'. Several of the changes have increased 'unwelcome distortions' in the system, the think-tank added. It said it was difficult to find a 'good economic reason' for lifting lower-paid workers out of income tax while leaving National Insurance thresholds largely untouched – warning it was an 'absurdity' that the two taxes were not integrated. Warned: The UK Statistics authority has 'ticked off' Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls for claiming the number of workers on zero-hours contracts had increased by 400,000 in recent months . Ed Balls has been ticked off by the statistics watchdog for claiming the number of workers on zero-hours contracts had increased by 400,000 in recent months. Sir Andrew Dilnot, of the UK Statistics Authority, said Mr Balls's statement was incorrect, as it relied on comparing totals at two different times of year and ignored the possibility that some people could hold multiple contracts for different jobs. The study praised last year's stamp duty reforms. But it warned that council tax had been allowed to get 'ever more out of date', with bands in England and Scotland based on 1991 property prices. It added that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had seen 'ad hoc, often temporary, announcements overtaking each other'. Authors Stuart Adam and Barra Roantree said there was a 'better way to make tax policy'. Labour seized on the report as evidence that the Government had failed to deliver better living standards. George Osborne will pledge to tackle the scandal of ordinary workers being dragged into the 40p tax rate next week in his last Budget before the election. The Chancellor is expected to fast-track plans to raise the starting threshold for paying the higher rate tax to £50,000, if the Tories win the election. The Conservatives promised the move last year, but did not set out a detailed timetable. At the time, Mr Osborne said only that the threshold – currently £41,865 – would rise to £50,000 by 2020. Lib Dem opposition means no action can be taken in the Finance Bill which will be pushed through before parliament breaks up at the end of the month. 'Tax-cutting': Chancellor George Osborne is expected to fast-track plans to raise the starting threshold for paying the higher rate tax to £50,000 if the Tories win the election . But Prime Minister David Cameron is understood to be pushing for a commitment to begin raising the threshold next year. A Tory source said: 'There is a recognition that we need to get on with this to show that we mean business.' The number of people paying 40p tax has risen by about two million, to five million, since 2010, as the Coalition cut the threshold, and then raised it more slowly than inflation, to help pay off the budget deficit left by Labour. The threshold is also the starting point at which families with a relatively high earner start to lose their child benefit payments. The Prime Minister said this week that too many people were now paying a tax that was 'only ever meant for the better off'.","Prime Minister David Cameron has claimed to be a 'tax cutting' politician .

"The NHS is rationing operations and treatment for patients deemed too fat. An investigation has found that four in five health trusts refuse to fund some procedures for patients classified obese. These include hip and knee surgery, IVF, joint replacements and in the case of one organisation, all routine operations. Details obtained from Freedom of Information requests also show that two thirds of trusts deny some procedures for smokers. Senior doctors have described the policies as ‘blatant rationing’ and say they are ‘immoral’ and ‘unfair’. An investigation has found that four in five health trusts refuse to fund some procedures for patients classified obese. Meanwhile two thirds of trusts deny some procedures for smokers . But managers said that given their increasingly limited budgets, it was inappropriate to offer certain non-urgent treatments to patients for which they might not be effective. The NHS as a whole is under severe financial strain and is struggling to meet the demands of the rising and increasingly ageing population. Last year its Chief Executive Simon Stevens predicted that an extra £30 billion would need to go into its budget by 2020 just to ensure the standards of care did not slip. In the face of such financial pressure, many trusts have begun rationing procedures which aren’t deemed urgent to save money. But this investigation by GP magazine  reveals the extent to which managers are refusing patients treatment due to their lifestyles. Freedom of Information responses from 145 of the 211 Clinical Commissioning Groups, (CCGS), – local NHS bodies – showed that 38 per cent restricted some procedures for obese patients. A further 63 per cent refused to allow patients to have certain treatment if they smoked. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, who is based in Leeds, said managers were using ‘spurious clinical reasons’ to discriminate some patients. He added: ‘It’s blatant rationing. CCGs should be open and honest. ‘If we’re going to ration a service we should ration it for all people, not just those in particular groups and pretend it’s for clinical reasons. These include hip and knee surgery, IVF, joint replacements and in the case of one organisation, all routine operations. Senior doctors have described the policies as ‘blatant rationing’ and say they are ‘immoral’ ‘If it’s purely down to cost saving, it’s not ethical. ‘There are clearly cases where certain people’s body size may make it difficult to safely do a certain procedure, but they’re exceptional. ‘I think what’s happening here is overt rationing to save money.’ Katherine Murphy, Chief Executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘We are aware that hospital trusts are under considerable financial pressures, but we hope that the need to save money won’t affect patient safety. ‘Each case must be individually assessed and each decision must be ethical and in the best interests of the patient. ‘We recognise that patients do have a responsibility to look after their own health and to be aware of the outcomes of unhealthy lifestyles. ‘However, patients should not take the brunt for years of wasteful spending in the NHS. ‘It is easy to target vulnerable patients, and we must be very careful not to unfairly discriminate against people who aren’t always able to speak out.’ Herts Valleys CCG in Hertfordshire refuses to offer any routine surgery to patients whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is above 35. This is a measurement of obesity and above 25 is classified as overweight, over 30 obese and more than 35, morbidly obese. And a total of 30 CCGs refused to pay for IVF for women with a BMI of over 30. The figures reveal that Herts Valleys CCG in Hertfordshire refuses to offer any routine surgery to patients whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is above 35 . This is equivalent to a 5ft 6 woman (170 m) weighing just under 13 and a half stone (84 kg). Dr David Haslam, GP in Watton-in-Stone, Hertfordshire, who is also chair of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘What we hate as GPs is blanket bans and you can’t just take BMI (a measure of obesity) as a reason to operate or not operate. ‘Some restrictions could have a sound clinical basis, he said, but it is wrong to turn away patients based on weight and do nothing to help change their circumstances. ‘Weight loss interventions must be offered, otherwise it’s immoral and unethical,’ he said. Several of the CCGs said that IVF and joint replacements, for example, weren’t always successful for the obese patients and therefore not ‘cost effective.’ Last year managers at Northern, Eastern and Western Devon CCG threatened to ban all treatments for anyone with a BMI above 35 to help cut a £14.5 million shortfall in its budget. They subsequently dropped the proposals following an outcry from patient groups and health professionals, including the Royal College of Surgeons.","Ops rationed include hip and knee surgery, IVF, and joint replacements .

"An elderly postmistress foiled two masked robbers who pointed a gun at her during a hold-up – by giving them a 'five second warning'. Carol Jones, 72, who has been running her village post office for more than 30 years, refused to give in when the raiders held a pistol to her face. She told them: 'If you've not left here in five seconds I'll get the police using the alarm system.' James Price, 16, and David Andrews, 21, fled and were later jailed for a total of eight years for attempted robbery and possession of an imitation firearm.

Cool Mrs Jones even served another customer at the shop in Graig-yr-Rhacca, near Caerphilly, South Wales, before calling the police. Police arrested Price at his home and found a blue imitation gun along with a balaclava and a paint balling mask used in the February raid. Recorder Judge Eleri Rees praised Mrs Jones for her bravery at Cardiff Crown Court after the pair admitted their crimes. She said: 'To her credit she showed great resilience she stood her ground and then called the police. You were armed with an imitation firearm- she had no idea if it was a real firearm or not.

"Star Wars fans who once flocked to the Tunisian town which was Luke Skywalker's home are now staying away because of the proximity of violent jihadists. The desert cliffs around the town of Tataouine were once the backdrop for much of the 1977 classic, parts of which were filmed in the Arab state the year before. The struggling town on the fringes of the Sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict, as a way-station for jihadists crossing the Libyan border 60 miles to the east, according to CNN. The igloo home of Luke and his foster family was destroyed in the film by stormtroopers from the Galactic Empire, but should militants extend their reach across the border, it could well be threatened for real. Scroll down for video . Luke Skywalker's home in the first Star Wars film in 1977 is close to the town of Tataouine in Tunisia . Tatouine is now threatened by the rise of an ISIS affiliate group just 60 miles away in neighbouring LIbya . The granaries in Tataouine which were made famous in Star Wars and still attract fans of the sci-fi classic . Three young men were arrested in the area earlier this month as they allegedly made plans to cross into Libya and join an affiliate of Islamic State, whose tentacles now stretch half-way across the country. Two arms caches, one of which included rocket-propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, have also been found in the region this month. They are thought to have been removed from a Libyan armory in the aftermath of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi's ouster in 2011. This area is vast and sparsely populated, with dozens of smugglers' tracks along which petrol, drugs and other contraband are smuggled across the frontier. There is now a 1.8-mile no-go zone inside the 380 mile long border, and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles. The Tunisian government claims the security presence has been boosted seven to tenfold. C-3PO und R2-D2 in the Tunisian desert during filming. The area is under threat from an ISIS affiliate group .

A much wider 12 mile buffer zone has also been created, which people can only enter with permission, and men aged 18-35 have reportedly been banned from going to Libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there. Even so the two gunmen who stormed into the Bardo Museum in the capital Tunis last week, who were both in their twenties, had been able to cross illicitly into Libya in December, according to Tunisian State Security Minister Rafik Chelly.

"George Osborne today sought to bring some pre-election cheer with cuts to the taxes on beer, cider and whisky. The Chancellor boasted more pubs would be saved from closure with the promise of a penny off a pint of beer for the third year in a row. And as he cancelled a scheduled rise in fuel duty, meaning it will cost £10 less to fill up a car than it would have under Labour's plans. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne, pictured in a pub in February last year, boasted more pubs would be saved with the promise of a penny off a pint of beer for the third year in a row . The Budget cut the price of beer duty by 1p alongside a 2 per cent cut to cider duty 'to support our producers in the West Country and elsewhere'. He also announced that 'to back one of the UK's biggest exports, the duty on Scotch whisky and other spirits will be cut by 2 per cent as well'. Duties on tobacco and gaming are unchanged and wine duty is frozen. Mr Osborne said: 'Last year, I cut beer duty for the second year in a row and the industry estimates that helped create 16,000 jobs. 'Today I am cutting beer duty for the third year in a row – taking another penny off a pint. 'I am cutting cider duty by 2 per cent - to support our producers in the West Country and elsewhere. 'And to back one of the UK's biggest exports, the duty on Scotch whisky and other spirits will be cut by 2 per cent as well. Wine duty will be frozen. 'More pubs saved, jobs created, families supported – and a penny off a pint for the third year in a row.' Camra (the Campaign for Real Ale) said it was 'delighted' with the hat-trick of cuts, adding it would be welcomed by millions of beer-drinkers across the country . Chief executive Tim Page said: 'The last two cuts have already had a huge impact, saving over 1,000 pubs from closure and keeping the price of a pub pint down. 'Independent research by the Centre for Economic and Business Research forecasts that the price of a pub pint will now be more than 20p cheaper than it would have been had the beer duty escalator remained in place.' A planned rise in fuel duty was also cancelled by the Chancellor, in good news for motorists . Scotch Whisky Association chief executive David Frost said: 'This is a historic decision and only the fourth time whisky duty has been cut in a century. 'The Chancellor's announcement will be toasted across the whisky industry and by consumers who are getting a fairer deal on tax when they have a drink of Scotch. The move is a major boost to our industry as we look to grow again in the UK, and equally sends out an important signal on fair taxation to our export markets. 'The industry is raising a glass to George Osborne and his Treasury team, as well as to all those who have supported our campaign over the last two decades.' Wine and Spirit Trade Association chief executive Miles Beale said: 'We are delighted that the Government has listened to consumers and taken action to address the UK's excessive spirit duty rates. This small drop in duty will result in a big cheer for the UK's 24 million spirit consumers.' But Alcohol Concern said the Government had 'once again cast aside the health of the nation to protect the interests of ""big alcohol"" '. Mr Osborne also pleased motorists by extending the freeze on fuel duty as well as announcing a round-the-regions package of transport improvements. Fuel duty has been frozen for four years. Today Mr Osborne said he was carrying on the no-rise policy by scrapping the planned September increase, which would have added 0.54p a litre to prices at the pumps. Mr Osborne said: 'Petrol frozen again. It's the longest duty freeze in over twenty years. It saves a family around £10 every time they fill up their car. Ten pounds off a tank with the Tories.' The RAC Foundation said the continued freeze was 'very welcome' while the AA said the announcement 'allows the coalition to dodge the fuel-protest bullet'.","Chancellor boosts pubs with a promise of a penny off a pint of beer .

"Supermarkets have been accused of 'bully boy tactics' by offering their suppliers bank loans instead of swiftly settling their debts. Chains including Morrisons and Marks & Spencer have introduced schemes that delay the payment of invoices to small businesses that supply them with goods. The suppliers have to wait up to a month longer to have their bills honoured, but if they cannot hold on this long, the supermarkets offer them access to credit from a bank. It pays the money earlier than the supermarket would – but charges interest on the loan. Supermerket chains have introduced schemes that delay the payment of invoices to small businesses meaning many farmers will face a cashflow crisis . Critics say such schemes force small firms to pay through the nose to get money that should have been handed to them promptly in the first place. Phil Orford, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said last night: 'This is yet another ethical deficit at the heart of some of Britain's most well-known companies. Their apparent collusion in this area threatens to break the backbone of the UK economy – small businesses.' Morrisons, for example, has a 'supplier finance' scheme with Lloyds Bank. Under arrangements introduced late last year, most of the supermarket's suppliers have been persuaded to wait 90 days for their invoices to be paid, a month longer than previously. Those that cannot hang on that long are directed towards the deal Morrisons has drawn up with Lloyds. The bank will give them their money sooner in the form of a loan. Morrisons has a 'supplier finance' scheme with Lloyds Bank. The bank can give suppliers  their money sooner in the form of a loan . Lloyds earns interest charges, Morrisons keeps the cash it owes in its coffers for longer – and the firms pay to get their money. A Morrisons supplier, who wished to remain anonymous, said it is the latest example of big business using 'bully-boy tactics' to make an extra profit. The practice is legal, but the supplier said it can be the difference between some small businesses surviving or failing. Mr Orford said: 'There is a growing trend for large businesses to use supply chain finance to extend payment times and pass the cost of credit down to their suppliers. 1 A supermarket decides to buy apples from a farmer and agrees to pay him £10,000 every month. 2 A year into the contract the supermarket says it is keen to work with the supplier for another 12 months – but rather than settle the invoice monthly it would prefer to hang on to the cash for longer and delay payment to 90 days. 3 The farmer doesn’t want to upset the supermarket but suddenly finds himself with a cashflow issue – if he can’t pay his bills his business could collapse. 4 The supermarket comes up with a solution. It has devised a scheme with a bank that means the farmer can get paid even quicker than 30 days but at a cost. A bank will pay the money owed in the form of a loan, but will take a fee for providing the cash ‘early’ – typically interest of 1.2 per cent, or £120 per month. 5 So the farmer only receives £9,880 rather than the £10,000 he is owed. 'This is a process which, whilst reducing their own costs, also makes money for the bank supporting the scheme.' The finance deals are not compulsory, but many suppliers feel it is an offer they cannot refuse for fear of losing business. One supplier, who asked for anonymity, said Morrisons and others are being opportunist introducing the schemes at a time when interest rates are low. He said he fears they will rocket when borrowing costs start to rise, but by then small firms will be locked into costly deals. Morrisons' deal with Lloyds allows the supplier to receive payment earlier if they pay interest at 0.75 per cent above the Libor benchmark rate, currently 0.27 per cent, meaning a charge of 1.02 per cent. Other grocers offer similar schemes, but they are not tied to suppliers agreeing a lengthening of payment terms. Marks & Spencer offered a scheme with HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, offering borrowing rates of 0.95 per cent above the Libor rate. M&S increased the waiting time for suppliers before their bills are settled from 60 days to 75 for clothing and 'general merchandise' in 2013. Food suppliers wait between 19 and 39 days. Morrisons said: 'If suppliers don't want to take part, they don't have to.' Lloyds said the deals let suppliers get cash at low cost, and helps businesses to 'free up capital to invest in their business'. Marks & Spencer said: 'We have only received positive feedback from suppliers that participate.' Sainsbury's, Tesco and Asda also offer similar schemes, but Waitrose does not.","Morrisons and M&S have introduced schemes that delay invoice payment .

"In a bizarre tribunal case a hospital employee will be awarded substantial compensation after management wrongly thought that he had sexual contact with a corpse. The Department for Health and Ageing were ordered by a Workers Compensation Tribunal to pay compensation to an employee at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Adelaide for emotional trauma after it was wrongly assumed he was facing trial for necrophilia. In Judge Leonie Farrell’s judgement she said that in October 2012 the worker’s relationship with his partner broke down, The Advertiser reported. He was charged with aggravated assault by his ex-partner and had to inform his employer of this. The man was working at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide when he was suspended . The worker spoke to his operations manager about the alleged assault case where the manager made notes of their conversation. It was here where all the confusion began. '(The operations manager wrote) he faced allegations of ‘necrophilia, intercourse with a corpse located at the QEH morgue which apparently everyone knows about’,' Judge Farrell said. Other allegations made against the worker by his ex-partner was that he was a 'pornographic king'. Judge Farrell said the operations manager was 'unfamiliar with criminal procedure' and 'saw no distinction' between a charge and an allegation. A hospital operations manager wrongly assumed during an interview with the employee that he was facing trial for necrophilia . The worker was suspended from his job as it was believed 'he had been charged with interfering with a body in the morgue'. It was Judge Farrell's view that the operations manager misunderstood what the worker was telling her about the necrophilia allegation. 'She did not do so deliberately or maliciously ... it was a simple misunderstanding resulting from her unfamiliarity with the matters being raised,' the judge said. As the aggravated assault case progressed through the justice system, the worker was diagnosed HIV-positive and began to suffer anxiety issues. An appropriate award of compensation for the hospital employee is now being worked out . South Australia Police later confirmed that 'the comments made by the ex-partner appeared to have no substance'. It was ruled that it was clear there had been a misunderstanding, that the worker had not breached the code of ethics and should never have been suspended. The matter was adjourned to hear submissions on the appropriate award of compensation.","Worker suffers trauma after wrongful suspension at hospital in Adelaide .

"Two statues of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were unveiled at Canterbury Cathedral today - the first royal sculptures to be installed there during her reign. The monarch arrived at Capel-le-Ferne in Kent this afternoon to open a new £3.5million visitor centre that honours the Battle of Britain war heroes. She then made her way to the cathedral with husband Prince Philip to reveal the figures, which have been created to mark her Diamond Jubilee. Scroll down for video . The statues of the Queen (left) and the Duke of Edinburgh (right) were unveiled at Canterbury Cathedral today . The statues were carved by sculptor Nina Bilbey, 47, from Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, and will stand by the west door in the Kent cathedral. The Dean of Canterbury, the Very Revd Dr Robert Willis, said: 'The new royal statues will be a splendid addition to the cathedral and they will be a sign of the high respect and affection that everyone at Canterbury has for the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.' She earlier opened visitor and education centre, The Wing, which offers an interactive experience of the story of the Battle of Britain. The building follows the wing plan of R J Mitchell's best-known fighter, the Supermarine Spitfire - one of the two aircraft credited with doing the most to win the battle in 1940. The Queen and The Duke were greeted by Prince Michael of Kent, who is a patron of the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydo. She then met with  some of the last surviving Battle of Britain pilots of Winston Churchill's famous 'few' at the National Memorial to the Few above the white cliffs in Kent. The statues were carved by sculptor Nina Bilbey, 47, from Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee . They are the first royal sculptures to be installed at the Kent Cathedral during her reign and it is her first visit to Canterbury in 13 years today . She has followed in the footsteps of her mother, the Queen Mother, who unveiled the memorial at Capel-le-Ferne, near Folkestone, on July 9, 1993. A flypast of a Hurricane, Spitfire and Typhoon took place over the English Channel where RAF pilots defied Germany's Luftwaffe more than 70 years ago. More than 500 of the 3,000 or so men of RAF Fighter Command died in the Battle of Britain between July and October 1940. Of the remainder, a further 814 died before the end of the war. As the battle raged in August 1940, Churchill uttered his famous words in a speech to Parliament: 'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.' Nina Bilbey, who was commissioned to carve the royal statues, stands proudly with the finished figures . Nina Bilbey, 47, is a sculptor and senior carving tutor at The City and Guilds Art School in London. She gained a B.A. Hons in Sculpture at St Martins School of Art before gaining a post graduate certificate in education from the University of Leeds. She has since done a diploma in stone masonry. Since 2000 Nina has specialised in stone carving and has been commissioned for several statues including ones for  Hampton Court flower show. She has also carved Gargoyles for St. Pancras Station and Saint Georges Chapel Windsor, and projects for The Houses of Parliament, The Royal Pavilion Brighton and Hereford Cathedral. The founder member of 'The London Carving Co-Op', Nina has spent six months working on the Royal Barge and has just finished a major carving commission for a Private house in Cheshire. She blogged about the royal commission on her website as she went along, showing the original sketches, the cast coloured in bronze powder and a half sized model version. Explaining how she made the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh statues, she said that it was very 'difficult getting the likeness and modelling tiny chains'. She said she spoke to Lady Hussey, one of the Queen's Lady in Waiting, who provided photographs and advised on how to do the hair. Pictures of the original designs were sent to the palace, which decided that the Prince should hold his robes, rather than gloves as she had planned.","The Queen arrived at Capel-Le-Ferne to open new £3.5million visitor centre .

"Warmer weather has melted much of the snow in Boston, but some remnants of the snowiest winter in the city's history refuse to leave. One snow farm in Boston was photographed on Wednesday, now turned to a gross shade of grey with dirt and debris. According to Think Progress, the city will have spent some $50million hauling snow to farms like this at the end of the season. But it looks like winter isn't quite over yet for Bostonians - or much of the East Coast. More snow is expected to hit the city on Friday, ironically timed for the first day of spring. The big thaw: Trucks drive past a mound of partially-melted dirty snow at a  snow farm in Boston on Wednesday, March 18 . Isn't spring lovely? The snow in the mound was cleared from city's streets. Boston made history by having the snowiest, and probably most miserable, season since 1872 . Before: Above, a picture of a Boston snow farm during the height of the snowfall, on February 18, 2015 . The snow system is expected to start falling over the northern Appalachians and southern Pennsylvania on Thursday night before reaching New York and southern New England on Friday. New York City will see its first flakes around 9am on Friday and snow will continue to fall throughout the day - covering the city with two inches in total. The snow is unlikely to settle, however, thanks to warmer ground temperatures. Nevertheless, the snow will likely hamper travel and create a headache of a commute on Friday,' John Homenuk of New York Metro Weather warned. 'Roads will be slick and travel will be hazardous when snow is falling. Be sure to leave extra time and bring your winter jacket.' No end: More snow is expected across the northeast on Friday and into the weekend as this winter shows no sign of easing up. Pictured, people use umbrellas against the snow in Boston last Sunday . 'Temperatures will stay in the 30s, around 15 degrees lower than average for the time of year. And in a bleak outlook for residents sick of the cold, Boston could get 1-3 inches of snow on Friday evening, as the white stuff falls across New England, northeast Pennsylvania and Upstate New York. By Saturday, it will ease up in New England but will likely continue to cover western, central and Upstate New York, while New York City residents will still be battling temperatures in the 30s. Over Boston, the snow will turn into rain through Saturday and Sunday. On its way: A map shows the snowfall expected this week, with parts of New York and Pennsylvania expected to fair the worst - around five inches - while New England will just get an inch or two . Cold mix: The storm will bring wet snow to New England as it moves northeast throughout the weekend . New England residents will be pleased to hear they will not be getting the worst snowfall; instead central Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and the outskirts of New York City will see the most - as many as five inches. The ongoing wintry mix comes as Boston set an all-time snowfall record. A storm this past weekend dropped 2.9 inches of snow at Logan International Airport, pushing the seasonal accumulation to 108.6 inches and surpassing the previous record of 107.6 set in 1995-96. The season snowfall record is measured from July 1 through June 30. Records go back to 1872. 'I wished I would have blocked the numbers from friends back in Southern California texting me screenshots of the 80-plus degree weather there,' said Matt Guerrieri who just moved to Boston. Ahead of the storm: The northeast is expected to get sun on Thursday and snow will start falling overnight . Cold: But on Friday, temperatures in New York will plunge as the icy weather hits the northeast . Winter weary: By Saturday, the storm will have moved further north and temperatures will warm again . But the snow that has already fallen didn't bury Bostonians' collective sense of humor. Mayor Marty Walsh tweeted that the Boston yeti - a local who's been dressing up as the abominable snowman and walking around the city drawing laughs - would be taking over as interim mayor. Bruce Mendelsohn, a Cambridge public relations executive, quipped, 'Boston has a rich tradition of leading the nation in the pursuit of liberty, freedom, sports titles and snowplows.' And there is more to come, weather.com reported. 'In snow-weary Boston, it's par for the course to pick up another 3-4 inches of snow after March 20,' it warned, adding that Bangor, Maine can expect another seven to eight inches of spring snow.","Boston could get 1-3 inches of snow Friday as a wintry mix starts moving northeast at the start of the weekend .
The city is still struggling to clean up after their snowiest winter on record ."
"There seemed to be a medal on every uniform – be it military or school. Three Victoria Crosses, four George Crosses, 1,650 gallantry decorations and tens of thousands of campaign medals were awarded during Britain’s 13-year action in Afghanistan. Yesterday, as the country gathered to honour that campaign at St Paul’s Cathedral, several children were wearing the medals of fathers who never returned from the war against the Taliban. Scroll down for video . Gallant: Prince Philip, 93, guides the Queen down the steps of St Paul's Cathedral after Friday's service . It was the Queen who led the nation’s tribute, supported by the 93-year-old Duke of Edinburgh (literally so when it came to negotiating the steps of St Paul’s). In pride of place behind her were the holders of another decoration. The Elizabeth Cross is the medal no one wants. Yet no decoration, surely, is worn with greater pride. Devised by the sovereign at the height of the Afghan conflict in 2009, it is a silver brooch presented to the next of kin of every member of the Armed Forces killed in the line of duty – and there were 453 of those in Afghanistan. Yesterday, the families of every single one had been invited to join the Queen at St Paul’s. Historians and politicians will still be debating the merits of the Afghan project years from now. But the bravery and determination of those called upon to serve there has never been in question. Hence the decision to recognise their collective efforts with a formal act of worship and a parade through the City of London. Entitled ‘A Service of Commemoration, Reflection and Remembrance’ (‘thanksgiving’ might have been triumphal), this was a state occasion of the highest order. All the senior members of the Royal Family – including Afghan veteran Prince Harry – and all the Service chiefs were present, along with the three main party leaders plus representatives of our Nato allies and all the main faiths. For dad: Charlton Taylor, five, son of Royal Marine Michael Taylor who was killed in Afghanistan in June 2010 . Remembered: Charlton (left) wore the medals awarded to his father (right) who was just 30 when he died . Past prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were also present. They had front row seats in the South Transept, flanked by senior Forces personnel rather than grieving families. In the run-up to this service some had questioned the presence of the leaders who took Britain into this conflict. There would, of course, have been louder criticism had the two men stayed away. Even so, great delicacy was required. At the close, the ex-PMs were out of a side door and off the premises before the royal chauffeurs had even started their engines. By far the largest section of the 2,600-strong congregation – more numerous, even, than the veterans themselves – were the bereaved. For each holder of the Elizabeth Cross had been granted two invitations – and quite right, too. There were some desperately poignant sights; a schoolboy with Dad’s medals sitting alongside Mum, in black, with her Elizabeth Cross on her lapel and tissues clasped tightly in her hand; a middle-aged couple blinking back tears; a young mother, dressed in black, dashing for the door with a small, screaming boy in her arms during the opening prayers. It’s rare to see a toddler at a state occasion. Presumably, the little chap was there to honour a gallant father or uncle. Touching moment: Prince Charles with Forces families at the reception at the Guildhall after the service . I hope they were both allowed back in. Because this was a magnificent service, a finely judged blend of tradition, innovation, stirring but non-martial music and audience participation. Among half a dozen worshippers chosen to read the prayers of intercession were a senior RAF officer, former Corporal Sarah Bushbye MC, who won her Military Cross dashing through a maelstrom of gunfire to treat four wounded soldiers, and Kerry Ashworth, mother of Lance Corporal James Ashworth of the Grenadier Guards. He won a posthumous VC for his attack on Taliban positions in 2012. ‘For peacemakers and peacekeepers who seek to keep this world secure and free, may God give peace,’ declared Mrs Ashworth faultlessly, her son’s VC pinned alongside her EC. Seats were left empty at the service as family members of the 453 who died chose not to attend. Relatives travelled to London to watch the service on a screen outside St Paul’s Cathedral – even though more than 40 seats were left unoccupied inside. Graham Knight, whose son Sergeant Ben Knight, 25, was killed in an explosion in 2006, was one who declined the invitation. Mr Knight, from John O’ Groats, said: ‘It is more of a public relations exercise, with the good and the great at the front and all the relatives at the back. We don’t need to go to a service like that to remember our son, we remember him every day.’ Around 20 bereaved family members and veterans were either unwell or unable to travel at the last minute and did not attend the service. Another 15 to 20 bereaved family members and veterans unexpectedly did not turn up. A Ministry of Defence source said: ‘It’s understandable that on such an emotional day for so many people there were some who felt they couldn’t attend today’s service.’ After a lesson from Prime Minister David Cameron (‘Blessed are the peacemakers…’), the Bishop of London shared his readings with 13-year-old Tyler Barrow from Hampshire. Tyler still remembers the day in 2007 when his father, Captain Gary Barrow of the King’s Royal Hussars, was so badly wounded he had to be evacuated back to Britain. But Captain Barrow made a full recovery and went on to complete a further two tours of duty. It was hard to tell who was proudest of whom when I met them yesterday. ‘I’m more nervous than he is,’ Captain Barrow admitted before the service. In another emotionally charged moment, the Bastion Cross was carried the full length of the cathedral in a procession of its own. Originally knocked together from old shell cases at Camp Bastion, this brass crucifix became a shrine for troops in the field. Yesterday, before the Head of the Armed Forces herself, it was formally rededicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Rev Justin Welby. The Archbishop based his short sermon on the words of the prophet, Jeremiah: ‘Great is your faithfulness.’ Thanking all the troops, he also lauded the vast support network behind them. ‘I’m told that each wounded person was supported by up to 80 others by the time they got home.’ And he had stirring words for the home front. ‘We also thank those of you who stayed behind, who let your loved ones go; you who worried for their safety each day, took your phone to your bedside each night. Great is your faithfulness.’ Departing to Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in B Minor, the Queen was introduced to another cross-section of those whose lives were turned upside down by this conflict. Corporal Matthew Webb of the Royal Marines is now a triple amputee. Sally Thorneloe lost her husband, Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Thorneloe of the Welsh Guards, the most senior officer killed in the conflict. Yesterday, she was accompanied by her daughters, Hannah, nine, and Sophie, seven, who presented flowers to the Queen. Respects: The Queen  receives flowers from sisters Sophie (right) and Hannah Thorneloe (second right), whose father Lieutenant Colonel Rupert Thorneloe was the most senior officer to be killed in Afghanistan . In front of the cathedral, the parade was forming up. Detachments from all the Services marched the short distance to a Guildhall reception while an RAF flypast – including that great Afghan warhorse, the Chinook – flew overhead. Thousands of onlookers, many of them City workers, had turned out to clap them all. I am glad to report that I neither saw nor heard a single protester, just lots of polite, heartfelt applause. Some of the loudest was for those bringing up the rear – the families. For many, the last experience of something like this was the raw agony of the homecoming parade at Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire. Yesterday should leave them with a sunnier memory. ‘No tears today. That was beautiful and we are smiling,’ said Elizabeth Daniels of Hyde, Lancashire, beneath a glorious lime green hat. She was here to remember her beloved brother, Corporal Harvey Holmes, and to support her mother Beverley Mayall. Parents-to-be: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge also attended the moving service . At Guildhall I met Brenda Wilson and her daughter Rachel Stanley, 27. Her Elizabeth Cross pinned proudly to her coat, Brenda had bumped into some old comrades of her son, Corporal Jack Stanley of the Queen’s Royal Hussars, who died on Easter Sunday 2012. ‘I cannot fault anything about today. It’s been wonderful,’ she said. ‘Coming here, you realise you’re not on your own. You’re part of an enormous family.’ It may be a family that has known great pain. But yesterday will undoubtedly have left it stronger. As peek-a-boo Ed nods off... his two predecessors sneak out the back door . Tony and Gordon Brown attended the service but left out of a back entrance of St Paul’s to avoid coming face to face with the families of those who died in Afghanistan. Mr Blair, the prime minister who took Britain to war, and his successor left several minutes before the other guests, escorted by bodyguards to separate BMW saloons. Relatives had reacted with fury last week when told Mr Blair and Mr Brown would be among the congregation, with one saying Mr Blair has ‘got blood on his hands’. A spokesman for Mr Blair said he had to leave quickly to fly to an economic conference in Egypt.

"Authorities are conducting a new search on a Virginia mountain for the remains of two Maryland sisters who disappeared in 1975. The Bedford County Sheriff's Office said Monday that additional leads prompted another dig on Taylor's Mountain in Bedford County, but officials didn't provide details. The operation is expected to take several days. An earlier dig was conducted on the mountain in January. The sheriff's Office, the Virginia State Police and the Montgomery Police Department in Maryland are conducting the search for the remains of ten-year-old Katherine Lyon and 12-year-old Sheila Lyon. 12-year-old Sheila Lyon (left) and ten-year-old Katharine Lyon (right) went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations . The Lyon sisters never came home after walking to the mall together in 1975. A massive search turned up nothing . The girls went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations. The Lyon sisters never came home, and a massive search turned up nothing. Parents John and Mary Lyon have never been able to find out what happened to their daughters. Over four decades, police have pursued numerous leads and periodically identified potential suspects. But they never charged anyone. Authorities have, however, named Richard Allen Welch Sr. and his nephew, Lloyd Lee Welch, as persons of interest in the case. Neither man has been charged. In February it was revealed that Lloyd Lee Welch, a sex offender, told investigators that he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to  police affidavits. The Washington Post reported that Montgomery County police, citing the ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the affidavits or how credible they find 58-year-old Lloyd Welch's recent statements. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza (pictured, 1975) and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car . Though volunteers searched for the sisters, they came up with nothing. Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible . 'Our department and our partners in Virginia remain committed to determining what happened to Katherine and Sheila Lyon,' Montgomery Police Chief Tom Manger said in February. 'We believe that there are people, including family members of Dick and Lloyd Welch, who have information that would further this investigation.' Richard Welch's wife, Patricia, was charged with perjury after testifying before the grand jury in December. The affidavits released in February did not say whether any incriminating evidence has been found on Taylor's Mountain in Virginia. Investigators have found bones on a property near Taylor's mountain that used to belong to the family of Lloyd Lee Welch, according to court papers. But that may not mean much because the land contains an old cemetery with more than 30 unmarked graves. At one point during the search, detectives wrote that a dog trained to sniff decomposition 'alerted' to areas away from the cemetery. On the day they vanished, the girls' older brother reported seeing them at the mall, and a friend claimed to have seen them talking to an older man who was carrying a microphone and a briefcase. Lloyd Welch told investigators he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to police affidavits unsealed in Febrary . Authorities have been searching for the remains of 12-year-old Sheila Lyon and 10-year-old Katharine Lyon on a remote mountain in Bedford County, Virginia, some 200 miles from their Montgomery County, Maryland, home, since September . A sketch of that man, who had long hair and a mustache, was created and circulated, but it didn't lead to any arrests. One person who provided details to a police artist said the man had been 'fixated' on the girls. Welch, who worked at a traveling carnival with his then girlfriend Helen Craver, had been at the mall and was seen paying attention to the Lyon girls, police chief Thomas Manger said. The filings detail for the first time how Lloyd Welch surfaced in the case. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car. Police gave him a polygraph test which showed he was lying, according to the affidavits, which did not say whether authorities continued to look into Welch. The detectives on the case in 2013 set out to learn more about Welch, who had been arrested in 1977 in Montgomery in a burglary case. His mug shot from that arrest strongly resembled a sketch in the Lyon sisters case that had been drawn based on a witness's description of a man at Wheaton Plaza who was staring at the girls and following them, according to the affidavits. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. The girls' father, John Lyon, became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones . Police searched property in Virginia (pictured) once owned by the family of drifter and convicted child rapist Lloyd Lee Welch . In 1994, he had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in South Carolina. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in Delaware and was sentenced to three decades in prison. The detectives went to Delaware, according to the affidavits, and interviewed Welch several times in prison. 'During these interviews, Lloyd Welch has admitted he left Wheaton Plaza in a vehicle with the Lyon sisters on the day they disappeared,' according to the affidavits, written by Montgomery Detective Mark Janney and Detectives R.D. Baldwin and S.O. Smith of the Bedford County Sheriff's Office. The affidavits say Lloyd Welch told police Richard Welch was involved in kidnapping the girls. Lloyd Welch said he was dropped off near his home, and the next day he went to Richard Welch's home where he saw the uncle sexually abusing one of the sisters. He said he left and never saw the girls again. Shelia and Katherine were on spring break when they disappeared. They left their home at 11am and their mother Mary Lyon told them to be home by 4pm. Mrs Lyon later said that in the quiet Washington, D.C., suburb, it was common to let children go to the shopping center alone. As the Montgomery County Gazette put it years later - it was a simpler time when everyone looked out for everyone else's children. The massive investigation that followed the girls' disappearance brought in countless tips and widespread national and local media coverage. Potential clues were found, but later discounted. People were brought in for questioning, but later released without charge. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created age-progressed photographs of the sisters. Sheila Lyon (left) would now be 52 and Katherine Lyon (right) would be 50 years old . Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. Mr Lyon became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones. The girls' brother, who was 15 at the time they vanished, became a homicide detective when he grew up. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Katherine Lyon was last seen wearing a baby beads necklace with orange beads and 'KATE' in black letters on white beads and dirty beige brushed suede wallaby type Jumping Jack shoes with dirty beige shoelaces. Sheila Lyon was last seen wearing farsighted gold wire rimmed glasses, low cut GallenKamp sneakers, size 6.5 or 7.5, with dirty white shoestrings, and knee socks. Katherine has a birthmark on the inside of her upper thigh. The organization also created age-progressed photographs of the sisters.

"Fifty years after the bound body of a dairy farmer was pulled from a river, a new theory has emerged in the unsolved case of his death. Prosperous but unpopular dairy farmer Orville Gibson disappeared in the wee hours of New Year's Eve 1957 in Newbury, Vermont. Searchers pulled his bound body from the river nearly three months later. The case remains officially unsolved, but it's been widely accepted for decades that a small mob of drunken townspeople incensed by rumors that Gibson had beaten his elderly hired man kidnapped him, tied him up and threw him in a car trunk, where he suffocated. They threw his body into the river. Scroll down for video . The body of Orville Gibson (pictured) was pulled from a lake three months after he went missing. He had been bound at the ankles, and with his hands behind his knees. A new book claims that he staged an elaborate sucide . The crime was deemed a 'lynching' by editorial writers from Boston to Washington to the civil rights-era South. (All the players in Vermont were white, but white supremacists in the South used the story to cry they were being unfairly singled out for the mob killings of black men.) The story spread across the globe, even earning a feature in Life magazine. Orville Gibson was a successful dairy farmer who had many enemies in the community of Newbury . 'You can go anywhere, quite a ways off, and if you say you're from Newbury they'll bring it up,' said Eleanor Placey, 72, who was related to Gibson by marriage. Two men later went on trial but were both acquitted. So what really happened? Judge Stephen Martin, who as a new lawyer in 1960 helped represent one of the accused, recently published a book in which he argues Orville Gibson killed himself, with some ingenuity and difficulty, in a largely successful attempt to get revenge on his neighbors by pinning the blame on them. In Orville's Revenge: The Anatomy of a Suicide, Martin argues that Gibson, broken by the criminal charge he was facing in the hired man's beating and by the enmity he had created among his neighbors, staged evidence at his farm, walked over a bridge to New Hampshire, climbed out on a pier, tied himself up and rolled himself into the water. 'He was very proud, quick to hold a grudge, and his whole life was crashing down upon him,' Martin said in an interview. Martin has taken his conclusions to the Vermont attorney general's office, whose investigators plan to take another look. They could reclassify the case and remove it from the list of Vermont's unsolved homicides. Not everybody buys Martin's theory. 'I don't know why a supposedly intelligent man like Judge Martin would say that,' said Doris McClintock, 75, Gibson's niece, who still believes some of her neighbors know what happened to her uncle. McClintock and the Placeys offer-point-by-point rebuttals of why they believe Martin's book is inaccurate, getting basic facts wrong and ignoring others that don't fit his thesis. They speak of threats they believe were intended to keep people quiet, including one in which a note was stuck with a knife to a tree outside the home of a potential witness. Martin's theory isn't entirely new, but the book lays it out in detail. The idea that Gibson could have tied himself up was brought up during the second trial, but investigators didn't accept it. Gibson, 47 when he died, came to Newbury with his family as a child. He purchased the farm out of foreclosure several years before his death. Over the years, he built it up to be one of the richest properties in the fertile land along the river. But he never fit in. He and his wife weren't part of the partying crowd. He drew resentment for being the early bird at the courthouse to purchase his property, beating more established townspeople who wanted it. Orville Gibson's barn following his disappearance in 1957. Evidence of a crime, including depressions in a grain bag where it appeared two men had sat, drag marks on the floor and a crushed milk pail, was found . Widow Evalyn Gibson crying as she sees photo of husband Orville in the newspaper. His body, which had been bound at the feet and with his hands behind his knees, was pulled from the river three months after his disappearance on New Year's Eve 1957 . Judge Stephen Martin demonstrates how it would be possible for someone to tie themselves up and roll themselves into the water . And then came the last straw — the story about the beating of his hired man. Gibson was charged with a crime, though some argue the man's injuries were exaggerated by the town rumor mill. The day Gibson disappeared, he had planned to visit a lawyer. Eleanor Placey's husband, David, now 71, responded the day of the disappearance to a call from Gibson's wife when her husband didn't return from the morning milking. In the barn, he saw evidence of a crime, including depressions in a grain bag where he believed two men had sat, drag marks on the floor and a crushed milk pail. 'It was pretty plain that something happened there; there was not a question in your mind,' Placey said recently. Police dragged the river but found nothing until the end of March, when troopers discovered Gibson's body miles downstream. He was wearing his farm clothes, his ankles were bound and his hands were tied behind his knees. His body was in remarkable condition. The death certificate cites 'suffocation (means unknown)'. It wasn't until fall 1958 that a doctor told investigators he had driven by Gibson's barn the morning the farmer disappeared and saw a car he recognized and two men he knew. Those two men - Robert 'Ozzie' Welch and Frank Carpenter - went on trial separately. Welch was acquitted after the judge ruled there wasn't enough evidence to convict him. A jury cleared Carpenter, represented with help from Martin. Martin, who became a judge in 1970 and retired in 1998, argues investigators never allowed themselves to consider possibilities other than a vigilante killing. He is seeking the support of the Vidocq Society, a private organization of sleuths that specializes in solving old crimes. Video from RSM Distributors . The barn where Orville Gibson disappeared on the morning of New Year's Eve 1957 sits alongside on U.S. Route 5 in Newbury, Vermont (pictured last month). Almost 60 years after he disappeared and was later found dead, a retired Vermont judge is arguing in a new book that Gibson's death was a suicide. For decades many thought Gibson's death was vigilante revenge for his beating of a hired man . Society member Peter Stephenson said he believes Martin's explanation. If vigilantes had killed Gibson, his body would have been beaten to a pulp. And by killing himself, Gibson was able to take control of a life that was spiraling down, he said. 'If you look at Orville's behavior pre-crime, you'll find that a lot of people had tried to take control of his life,' Stephenson said. By now, most of the original players are dead. Gibson's wife died in 1973. Welch died two months after the trial. Carpenter died in 1972. Despite the ugly memories it dredges up, Gibson's niece said she thinks it's good people are talking about her uncle again. 'We would just like to know the answers,' McClintock said. 'I don't think there's any purpose of trying to arrest anyone. It's way past time for that.' A bridge crosses the Connecticut River from Newbury, Vermont, into Haverhill, New Hampshire.

Ed Miliband has said he will take part in all three televised leaders' debate during the election campaign - the day after David Cameron flatly refused. The Labour leader's campaign chairman Douglas Alexander confirmed in a letter to broadcaster that Mr Miliband was prepared to appear. His willingness to appear is in stark contrast with that of Mr Cameron, who last night made it clear he was willing to do one seven-way debate at the end of March, but no more. Meanwhile, the four broadcasters - the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 - announced they will stick to their previously-announced plans for three debates during the election campaign. In a joint statement, the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven-way debate involving Mr Cameron, Labour's Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg of the Lib Dems and the leaders of the Greens, Ukip, Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru on ITV on April 2. This would be followed by a second show on BBC featuring the same line-up on April 16 and a final one-on-one clash between the Tory and Labour leaders on Sky News and Channel 4 on April 30 - exactly a week before the May 7 election. They urged the Prime Minister to 'reconsider' his refusal to take part in these shows. But Mr Cameron's chief spin doctor Craig Oliver said their response was 'disappointing' and restated the Prime Minister's 'final position' was for a single debate to take place in the week starting March 23. In a speech to his party's Scottish conference Mr Miliband is expected to say: 'Today the Labour Party has written to the broadcasters saying with or without David Cameron, I will be at the debates. 'And every day up to these debates he [Mr Cameron] will be asked: what are you hiding from?' Mr Miliband is expected to use his conference speech to accuse Mr Cameron of 'duplicity' and of trying to 'chicken out' of the debates. He will say: 'This is what David Cameron used to say about TV election debates: that they were essential to our democracy. Contrast: The Labour leader's confirmation is in contrast to David Cameron's refusal to take part . 'Chicken': Mr Miliband is expected to accuse the Conservative leader of 'running away' in his speech . A Tory-Labour grand coalition could be needed after the election to stop the Scottish National Party holding the balance of power and provoking a constitutional crisis, a former Conservative Home Secretary has said. Lord Baker of Dorking said a deal between the two largest parties could be necessary to ensure the 'continuing unity' of the UK. The former MP said such an agreement could avoid the 'nightmare' of a minority Labour administration depending on SNP support to govern - something which could 'stretch the constitution of our country to breaking point'. Writing in The Independent, the former Cabinet minister accepted that a deal between David Cameron and Ed Miliband was 'quite unthinkable' at the moment, but pointed out it worked in Germany. Lord Baker argued: 'What is at risk is the continuing unity of the United Kingdom. In order to preserve that unity another way should be found. 'This could be a joint government of the Labour and Conservative parties: quite unthinkable at the moment, and at this time likely to be rejected by both of them - but this is what has happened in Germany.' He said it would be possible for the two parties to find areas of agreement - defence, counter-terrorism, infrastructure investment in schools, road, rail and in the reform of skills training and energy - while more controversial manifesto promises would have to wait until 2018. Lord Baker's intervention follows a warning from former prime minister Sir John Major that the SNP would enter any deal with Labour with the 'overriding aim' of 'prising apart' the union. 'That every country apart from Mongolia had them. 'That he wasn't going to have any feeble excuses to get out of debates. 'And now he is doing everything he can to stop them. 'And it is on the issue of leadership debates that David Cameron's duplicity has caught up with him. 'He says this election is all about leadership, all about the choice between him and me, and when it comes to a debate between him and me, he's running scared. 'He's running away. 'I say to David Cameron: You can refuse to face the public, but you can't deny your record. 'You can try to chicken out of the debates, but don't ever again claim that you provide strong leadership. 'You can try to escape the people's debates, but you can't escape the people's verdict.' He will add: 'When all people will see is an empty chair, his claims of leadership will be exposed as empty.' In a letter to Mr Oliver, the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if Mr Cameron decides not to take part - effectively 'empty-chairing' the Prime Minister. But Mr Oliver replied: 'I made the Prime Minister's final position clear in my last letter - he is willing to do a seven-way debate in the week beginning March 23. 'Clearly it is disappointing that you are not prepared to take him up on that offer. 'I am ready to discuss at your convenience the logistics of making the debate we have suggested happen.' With neither side in the stand-off backing down, the debates are set to go ahead without Mr Cameron's participation.","Labour leader said he would take part after David Cameron flatly refused .

"Two moms started a science-themed clothing line for girls after they realized they couldn't find clothing featuring rocket ships and dinosaurs outside the boys' department. Jennifer Muhm and Malorie Catchpole's buddingSTEM line has dresses, leggings, T-shirts and underwear with rocket ship, train and dinosaur patterns for girls between 18 months and eight years old. The moms said that though they have no experience in the business of fashion, the idea for buddingSTEM -STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math - came out of experiences with their own daughters. Scroll down for video . Two Washington moms have created a science-themed clothing line for girls after they realized that they couldn't find clothes featuring dinosaurs, trains and rocket ships outside the boys' department . Jennifer Muhm (left) and Malorie Catchpole (right) said they came up with the idea of buddingSTEM after experiences they had with their own daughters . 'We're not anti-princess. We're not anti-pink. We're not anti-girly. We just think there needs to be more than just that offered for our girls,' Muhm, 37, of Shoreline, Washington, told ABC News. She said her now-five-year-old daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween in 2013, but noticed the costume catalog only had boys wearing the costume. 'She looked at me and said, 'I can't be an astronaut. They're only for boys',' Muhm told ABC. After seeing pictures of Sally Ride, Joan Higginbotham and other female astronauts, however, her daughter still dressed up as an astronaut, according to the moms' Kickstarter page. Muhm said her daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween, but was put off by the fact that only boys wore the costume in the catalogs . Muhm and Catchpole said that their daughters are interested in things that are not usually found on girls' clothing, including space ships, dinosaurs and trains . Muhm told Catchpole, 34, also of Shoreline, about the issue and they were both frustrated. Catchpole told ABC that her three-year-old daughter is 'very into trains' and when she and her husband wanted to buy train-themed underwear as a gift to their daughter for Christmas, they could only find boy's underwear. Catchpole bought them anyway. 'I was actually at their house on Christmas and saw the boys' underpants under the tree, and it was that moment that it kind of clicked,' Muhm said. 'I said, 'You know what, Malorie? We should make underpants with trains on them… and then we thought why just underpants: There are no dinosaurs or rocket ships on leggings or dresses for girls',' she added. The women, who have no experience in the business of fashion created dresses, leggings, T-shirts and underwear  for girls between 18 months and eight years old . BuddingSTEM - STEM standing for science, technology, engineering and math - was registered as a business in April 2014. Since the business's origination, the moms have raised more than $52,500 for the company through a Kickstarter . And so the pair filed their business registration for buddingSTEM in April 2014. 'If there is something that is not fair - because my daughter will say that it is not fair - you can actually start working toward doing something about it,' said Muhm. With help from a textile designer and a Kickstarter that helped them raise $52,500 to date, the clothing line will be available in July. 'One of the things that I'm happiest about… is what I think we've shown our daughters,' Catchpole said. 'We're two working moms. We don't have a background in fashion, and we saw a need and we worked hard.' The clothing line features simply designed outfits that are easily mixed-and-matched with train, space and dinosaur themes. Clothing can come in blue and pink or teal and gray . Catchpole said she was disappointed when she wanted to give her daughter train-themed underwear as a gift for Christmas, but couldn't find any in the girls' department .","Jennifer Muhm and Malorie Catchpole's buddingSTEM line has dresses, leggings, T-shirts and underwear for girls .

"Friends and family of tragic skydivers Michael Vaughan and Alana Clarke have flocked to their social media pages to pay tribute to the pair, who died in a freak accident on Friday. Mr Vaughan, aged in his 40s, had spent more than 24 hours hospitalised in a critical condition after the accident. His family and friends  spent the day by his side in a Gold Coast hospital, hoping and praying for him to pull through. He died after his family made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support. News of his death came after the identity of the woman who died when their parachutes tangled mid-air was confirmed as Briony 'Alana' Clarke. Scroll down for video . Michael Vaughan (left) died after being involved in a freak skydiving accident in Byron Bay . Mourners have flooded Mr Vaughan's Facebook page with messages since the news of his death broke. 'Took Dawn for a jump this morning, blowing kisses under canopy for Alana Clarke and Michael Vaughan,' one commenter said. 'It's a tough time for our family's & friends but it was nice to be in the air. 'They will be missed and never forgotten.' 'Fly Free. The world has lost an absolute gentleman,' one post read. 'You shall be remembered as a man with great talent, passion, patience and as someone who never stopped giving in this sport of ours. Thanks for sharing your skills with so many. Fly free and have fun up there and all around us...Massive love and hugs to your family and to Kate,' another read. Skydiver Alana Clarke (pictured) died at the scene. She has been remembered by friends and family on social media . Tragedy struck when the 29-year-old woman and Michael Vaughan attempted a mid-air manoeuvre on Friday afternoon. This left Mr Vaughan in a critical condition while NSW Police confirmed on Saturday that Ms Clarke died at the scene. Mr Vaughan was taken to hospital and has reportedly survived surgery overnight, according to the Australian Parachute Federation. Mr Vaughan's Facebook page was early filled with words of encouragement and photos shared by loved ones worldwide. One friend from the US wrote: 'Vaughny, we ALL need you! Please, fight!' Family and friends of Michael Vaughan have taken to social media to wish him well in his recovery as he remains in a critical condition after a skydiving accident near Sydney on Friday afternoon . 'Pull through this Vaughany. You are loved by so many my friend,' another friend posted on Facebook. The Australian Parachute Federation issued a statement earlier on Saturday, saying Mr Vaughan 'is in critical condition but has survived the night and is undergoing some more tests'. 'The families of both Kate [believed to be Mr Vaughan's partner] and Michael thank you for your support and messages and are grateful for your prayers,' the statement reads. Mr Vaughan, who is believed to be a champion of the sport, has made more than 10,000 jumps in his career, and is considered one of Australia's best 'canopy pilots'. According to an advertisement posted online, Mr Vaughan held a training course from March 20 to 27. An flier for the event posted by Mr Vaughan read: 'work on your landings or come fly with me.... Or BOTH!!!' Tragedy struck when Mr Vaughan and a woman, reportedly an experienced skydiver in her 30s, attempted a mid-air manoeuvre . The woman, which the Herald Sun reports to be Briony 'Alana' Clarke, was killed while Mr Vaughan was taken to hospital . Mr Vaughan also shared a group photo of members who were part of his landings course a day before the accident. Among those tagged in the photo was Alana Clarke, who wore a blue jumpsuit. Details emerged that Friday was slated to be a 'flying', course in which participants learnt manoeuvres such as in-flight stalls and high-performance landings. Varying reports have emerged of what happened in the air, but investigators from the Australian Parachute Foundation (APF) now believe the pair collided and became entangled during a dive that required them to fly close together. The trouble started below 3000 feet after the parachutes opened, according to investigators who visited the site on Saturday. Entangled, the pair spiralled towards the Tyagarah farmland, near Byron Bay, and hit the ground about 3.30pm. A woman was killed and a man is in a critical condition following the accident . Emergency services arrived at the scene in Tyagarah, near Bryon Bay, about 3:30pm . Police believe the accident was caused when the parachutes of the skydivers became tangled during the jump . APF safety and training manager Richard McCooey says there is usually a procedure to use a reserve parachute in the event of a mid-air tangle. Investigations will focus on why that option wasn't used. The South Queensland Parachute Council released an update on Mr Vaughan's condition on Friday night on its Facebook page. 'At the hospital with Michael's family,' the post read. 'He is in surgery for the last two hours and will be there for a few more. His injuries are very severe and we do not know if they are survivable. Please keep praying for him. He has already survived more than they expected him to so that is something.' Another post said the 'entire skydiving nation (is holding) its collective breath'. The pair had been training together at Skydive Byron Bay, according to the AAP. They landed heavily at an airstrip off the Pacific Highway in Tyagarah, after the jump around 3:30pm on Friday afternoon. 'A group of people jumped. Two of those people's parachutes opened normally but close to each other and they collided after their parachutes opened,' McCooey said, according tothe Daily Telegraph. Mr Vaughan's Facebook page has been flooded with words of encouragement and photos shared by loved ones . It is believed the duo was training together when the accident occurred . 'Their parachutes collided, and then what tends to happen is their parachutes become tangled. 'That upsets the normal descent rate of the parachute and they descend faster than they are meant to ... they have impacted the ground very hard.' The pair was treated at the scene by paramedics, however the woman, who has not been formally identified, died. The man has been flown to Gold Coast hospital in a critical condition. 'It's not a common activity within skydiving,' CEO of Skydive the Beach Anthony Boucaut told AAP. 'The canopies dock on each other, they touch each other's parachutes. '(The moves are) part of an internationally recognised competition.' While police investigate the death and the man fights for his life, Mr Boucaut said the crash would reverberate throughout the skydiving community. 'It's a horrific incident, with two highly skilled people,' he told AAP. Michael Vaughan is a champion of the sport and had made more than 10,000 jumps in her career before Friday's tragic accident . Mr Vaughan is considered one of Australia's best 'canopy pilots' and trained other skydivers . Mr Vaughan held a training course from March 20 to 27. A post advertising the event from Mr Vaughan read: 'work on your landings or come fly with me.... Or BOTH!!!' 'The gentleman involved in the incident is a world and Australian champion. 'He's regarded highly in the community.' Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the Australian Parachute Foundation would be responsible for investigating the tragedy, with a report to be handed to CASA for review. 'They take carriage of it but we certainly review it all and make any decisions about whether any ations are needed,' he said. Meanwhile, another parachuting accident has left a man in a serious condition in Victoria on Saturday morning. He hit his head and suffered pelvic and leg injuries after a 'rapid descent' and 'hard landing' at Barwon Heads on Saturday, Ambulance Victoria says. The man, who is yet to be identified, was airlifted to the Alfred Hospital in a serious but stable condition. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene, and the man has been flown to a Gold Coast hospital (stock picture) Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the Australian Parachute Foundation would be responsible for investigating the tragedy, with a report to be handed to CASA for review (stock picture)","Champion skydiver died in Gold Coast hospital after 24 hour fight .

"The United States military dropped 60,000 copies of a graphic leaflet near the northern Syrian city of Raqqa that depict potential Islamic State recruits being fed into a meat grinder. The leaflets, part of an information campaign to discourage people from joining the extremist group, were dropped in a canister by an F-15 fighter jet last week. 'The message of this leaflet is, if you allow yourself to be recruited by Daesh, you will find yourself in a meat grinder. And it's not beneficial to your health,' said Army Col Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman who released a copy of the leaflet Thursday in response to media requests. Scroll down for video . Propaganda offensive: This image, which depicts young ISIS recruits being churned through a meat grinder, was printed 60,000 times and dropped over Raqqa, Syria, to stop men being lured to join the terror group . Daesh is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. The gruesome drawing shows seven young men standing in a line under a sign that says Daesh Recruiting Office. A man with a monster face is beckoning the first man in line, who has a frightened look on his face. A second man is turning the grinder while appearing to push someone into the feeder tube. Two legs are protruding from the feeder, and blood is spurting out the grinder's other end. The meat grinder is labeled as Daesh, and a sign in the corner says 'Now serving 6001.' The scared young man appears to be dropping a ticket that says '6001.' Is it working? The U.S. military commander for the Middle East says ISIS is 'losing momentum' in Syria . Warren said this is the only leaflet he knows about. U.S. military officials have expressed concerns that IS was winning the propaganda war, with its use of social media to attract supporters and recruits. A central theme that U.S. officials have tried to convey is the militants' brutality and violence, including to women and children. IS has taken over large parts of Iraq and Syria. But the top U.S. military commander for the Middle East said Thursday that the group is 'in a defensive crouch' in Iraq, and losing some momentum in Syria. The U.S. and other coalition members have conducted airstrikes on the group in Iraq and Syria.","The leaflets were dropped in a canister by F-15 fighter jet last week .

"Internet retail giant Amazon is testing its drone delivery system at a secret site in British Columbia after becoming frustrated with US regulations. The world's largest online store had wanted to test its Prime Air drones, which fly between 200 and 500 feet in the air, in Washington state but has now moved its research across the border, the Guardian reported. Last week the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) gave Amazon permission to begin testing one particular type of drone that the company now says is obsolete because the technology is moving so quickly. However, the company has already been testing in secret for the last several month at its own restricted airspace in Canada, about 2,000 from the border. Scroll down for video . Amazon has been testing delivery drones at its British Columbia facility for several months after receiving a license for restricted airspace 2,000 feet from the US border in December . The online retailer had been granted an exemption for testing a prototype drone in rural Washington, though they say that the technology behind that application is already obsolete . The license went into effect on December 17, according to the CBC. FAA's regulations proposed earlier this year also state that the person controlling the drone must have constant sight of the robot. The body has only approved 48 out of more than 750 exemption requests for exemptions that would allow outdoor drone testing before new guidelines are in place. Amazon's applied last July but still does not have an exemption, as it has only received a 'experimental airworthiness certificate' for its previous prototype. Oil giant BP was the first company to get approved for commercial drones over US land last year and drone pilots for the exemptions have been required to get pilot's licenses. The approval process includes nearly 100 pages of paperwork, a four hour presentation at FAA headquarters and a site visit. Canada has fewer restrictions, essentially allowing Amazon do whatever testing they needed within their airspace, and only took three weeks to give the go ahead to the Seattle-based retailer's application. The Federal Aviation Authority has only approved several dozen applications for drone testing licenses, though Canada has approved more than 1,600. Above, boxes that can be carried by drones . Amazon plans on creating a system that can deliver goods ordered online in less than 30 minutes. The FAA's proposed rules mandate that drones would have to be in the line of sight of their pilots at all times . Transport Canada, which has been giving out the licenses for almost a decade while the US just started last year, said that is aims to complete applications in 20 working days. 'In Canada, it's mostly about safety,' University of Toronto drone researcher Angela Schoellig said. 'If you show that you know what you are doing, it's very likely that you'll get a licence.' Amazon is developing small aerial vehicles as part of Amazon Prime Air. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds. About 86 percent of Amazon's deliveries are 5 pounds or less, the company said. 'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' the company has said previously.. It expects to eventually be able to deliver goods to customers within 30 minutes of online orders. The US's northern neighbor has granted 1,672 drone testing applications. 'Different laws and regulatory structures in other nations may allow them to act more quickly to approve certain UAS [drone] operations,' an FAA spokesman said of the Guardian's report. The agency's representative said the authority is 'safety-oriented' and approval is based on 'assessment of the risks to other aircraft and to people and property on the ground'. The FAA is expected to vote on its proposed drone rules by the end of the year. Amazon hopes that it's Canadian testing will help build a system that allows customers to have goods delivered to their homes within 30 minutes of ordering them online. It is working on high autonomous robots less than 55lbs that can carry objects less than 5lbs, the vast majority of the items Amazon ships. The company also has research outposts in Cambridge, UK, and Israel. FAA proposed rules also state that drones cannot operate over people not involved with them and cannot fly at night. Pilot's licenses and airworthiness certificates will not be required.","Online retailer was granted license for restricted airspace in December .

"A photographer is hitting back at a 'cyber bully' and critics after her photo shoot with a military family featured their baby boy wrapped in an American flag. Vanessa Hicks, 29, from Virginia Beach posted pictures from the photo shoot onto her Facebook page on Sunday, unaware that they would receive negative feedback. The image shows Landon Clevenger, at the time eight days old, from Virginia Beach being cradled in an American flag held by his father, Rodney Clevenger, who is wearing his U.S. Navy uniform. Scroll down for video . A photographer is hitting back at a 'cyber bully' and critics after her photo shoot with a military family featured their baby boy wrapped in an American flag. The image shows Landon Clevenger, at the time eight days old, from Virginia Beach being cradled in an American flag by his father, Rodney Clevenger, who is wearing his U.S. Navy uniform (pictured above) Vanessa Hicks (above), 29, from Virginia Beach posted pictures from the photo shoot onto her Facebook page on March 8, unaware that they would receive negative feedback . However, a community business page on Facebook, 'You Call Yourself A Photographer?' posted Hicks's image of Landon and Mr Clevenger criticizing the use of the flag. The group wrote that the flag is 'not a prop' (the post above) Hicks said her intention was to honor the U.S. flag while also honoring the parents, as Clevenger's wife, Samantha, also served for the country as a former US Army member, and he has served as a sailor in the US Navy for six years, according to ABC News. The family wanted to include their military service in the photos said Hicks. The mother-of-three and Navy veteran who served for four years said the image she took illustrates what Mr Clevenger was fighting for - the American flag. 'I have seen first-hand what is desecration of the flag,' said Hicks of her time in the Navy. 'At the end of the day I didn't do anything that disrespected this flag.' However, a community business page on Facebook, 'You Call Yourself A Photographer?' posted Hicks's image of Landon and Mr Clevenger criticizing the use of the flag. The group wrote: 'The flag is not a prop. I repeat: The flag is not a prop. To use the American flag in such a way is disrespectful, rude, tacky, disgusting, and against the U.S. Flag Code.' It continued detailing the 'key points' of the code including that the flag should never touch anything beneath it. The post concluded with: 'Mr. Clevenger, you have disgraced our fallen soldiers as well by disobeying that code. Hicks said: 'When I look at [the] picture, I see a man who has served six years in our Navy, the mother of this child is prior Army' (above Samantha and Rodney in uniform) Hicks said her intention was to honor the U.S. flag while also honoring the family, as Clevenger's wife Samantha (pictured above with her father, a Navy member), also served for the country as a former US Army member, and he has served as a sailor in the US Navy for six years . 'I don't know what the military teaches these days but I do know my son was taught the flag code and also taught that any disobedience towards that code would result in repercussions from your command....yet here you are in uniform, name fully visible, on a photographer's Facebook page disobeying that code and dishonoring our fallen soldiers and you obviously don't care.' Several Facebook users supported the post agreeing that the 'code was broken and the flag was used as a prop', while others said 'anyone who is offended by this is uptight and ignorant'. One user wrote: 'I agree the code was broken and the flag was used as a prop. And desecrated by pee and poop from what I heard. 'I hold the flag sacred and it is my opinion is has 2 places. On a pole or on the casket of a fallen hero.' Hicks said she spent hours taking down comments from her business and company page criticizing the photo. Several Facebook users supported the post agreeing that the 'code was broken and the flag was used as a prop' (above a user slams Hicks's use of the flag in the photo shoot) On Facebook, she posted earlier this week writing that she almost let the negativity take her down, but then decided to take a stand and fight back. She wrote: 'Yesterday, I woke up to see this photo was shared on a group site that is meant to bash other photographers. It was in their opinion I had disrespected our nations flag. I had disrespected our country by taking this picture. 'Several of these people not only bashed the picture, but me, saying I should be ashamed of myself, my husband should be ashamed, etc and I received several private messages to my business page. 'They even took it a step farther and bashed the service member in the picture, hoping he gets in trouble for participating in desecration of the flag.'

"Paul McCartney's rich neighbours have blown nearly half a million pounds fighting over a leaky gutter that would have cost just £7,000 to fix. Multi-millionaire property tycoon Brenda Fenton - who lives next door to the former Beatle - has been at war for years with surveyor, Clive Lewis, whose £20million mansion adjoins her own listed home. The trouble between the pair centres on water overflowing from a blocked gutter on an extension at the back of Mr Lewis's house and creating a damp problem in Mrs Fenton's mansion next door. Now a county court judge has ordered Mr Lewis to alter his house and pay his neighbour £250,000 in costs and damages, leaving him facing an estimated total bill for the dispute approaching half a million pounds. A row broke out between the owners of these two west London mansions over a £7,000 leaky gutter . The owners of the properties, which neighbour Paul McCartney's home, ended up going to court over the dispute and paid hundreds of thousands in legal fees . The court heard that wealthy widow Mrs Fenton, 84, moved into her home in St John's Wood, West London, 35 years ago. Sir Paul lives next door, in a house not far from the famous Abbey Road studios. Both Mrs Fenton and Mr Lewis are friends with the former Beatle, Judge Edward Bailey told Central London County Court, commenting that Mrs Fenton 'enjoyed an excellent relationship with her famous neighbour.' However the court heard that the relationship between Mrs Fenton and Mr Lewis is less friendly, and that since he bought his house in the late 1990s, she has been 'embroiled in a number of disputes' with him. Caroline Shea, for Mrs Fenton, told the judge that the dispute between the neighbours sprang out of a long-standing gripe about defective guttering on a glass-roofed extension to the back of the Lewis' palatial house. The extension, built in 1997, had inadequate guttering when it was put up, which Mr Lewis had also allowed to become blocked with leaves and other debris, the barrister said, causing damp problems in the day room, kitchen and garage of Mrs Fenton's own mansion. Brenda Fenton (left) insisted the extension of neighbour Clive Lewis (right) was ruining her own home . Miss Shea told the judge: 'Mrs Fenton is an elderly widow who has occupied her house for 35 years. She added: 'Mrs Fenton seeks injunctive relief requiring Mr and Mrs Lewis to rebuild the roof of the extension in such a way as to prevent rainwater running down to collect in the gutter and thence penetrating into [her home].' Philip Byrne, for Mr Lewis, denied that Mr Lewis had caused a 'nuisance' to his neighbour and dismissed expert reports linking the damp in Mrs Fenton's home to the gutter as 'erroneous.' The barrister said that Mr Lewis and his wife Marsha, an interior designer, put the blame for the malfunctioning guttering on Mrs Fenton's own wisteria plant, which they claimed was causing the blockage, and which was none of their responsibility. But Judge Bailey branded the extension as 'bog standard' and not in keeping with an area famed for its celebrity residents. He found the gutter had been blocked by lack of maintenance and obstructed by pipes carrying water to and from a swimming pool. Sir Paul McCartney lives next to the warring pair in this home and is said to be friends with both of them . The judge said: 'Since Mr Lewis acquired [her home] she has found herself embroiled in a number of disputes, which must have been very trying for a lady of 84 years of age,' he went on. 'Mrs Fenton first noticed damp in 2003 and raised the question of damp with Mr Lewis in 2011, and proceedings were launched in 2014. She suffered damp in two of the most important rooms in her house and her troubles are not yet over.' Criticising Mr Lewis, the judge said: 'Any responsible householder knows that gutters get blocked. It is unacceptable that, having built a gutter right against his neighbour's wall, Mr Lewis didn't have a system of maintenance. 'Mr Lewis has shown himself to be incapable of maintaining the guttering, even when it was clear that this litigation had been commenced,' he added. Sir Paul's home is separated from the two homes in the case and was he was not involved in the case . Of the extension the judge said: 'This was a bog standard construction, not of good quality for a terraced house in Clapham, a semi-detached in Ealing and certainly not in line with the quality of this detached house in St John's Wood, which has been valued, modestly, at £20million.' Dismissing Mr Lewis's attempt to blame Mrs Fenton's wisteria he said: 'I reject that argument - I don't accept that the wisteria was the primary cause of the blockage at the rear of the gutter. 'It was substantially cut back from time to time and I don't accept that it could have contributed to blocking the gutter by growing into it.' The judge ordered Mr Lewis to pay his neighbour £27,000 damages to repair her house, plus £50,000 for loss of amenity. He also granted an injunction, compelling Mr Lewis to have his extension roof reconstructed and re-angled so that rainwater pours towards his own property, not the house next door. Mr Lewis was ordered to pay Mrs Fenton over £170,000 for her legal costs. His own lawyers bill is likely to be a similar sum. The judge concluded by saying that it would have cost Mr Lewis about £7,000 to get a contractor to fix the leaky gutter, and thus avoid the costly court case. Mrs Fenton said outside court afterwards 'I'm just very happy that, after years of litigation, I've won.'","Neighbours of former Beatle get on with star but took each other to court .

Police are questioning two 'persons of interest' after a student vanished in 'suspicious circumstances a week ago. Sahray Barber was last seen by her roommates on March 9 as she left her home for the Art Institute of California in San Bernardino.

"Over the last few weeks, Jeremy Clarkson has had to defend himself from all sides as he faced the axe from his Top Gear show. But while the TV star went through a range of emotions under the glare of the media spotlight, one constant that remained by his side was an attractive blonde, who was the first to rush to Jeremy's London home following the news of his BBC sacking today. Phillipa Sage, 45, has been a feature in Jeremy’s life since 2010, while he was still in a relationship with his wife Frances. Scroll down for video . Phillipa Sage arrives at Jeremy Clarkson's London home today after he learns that he won't have his Top Gear contract renewed by the BBC . But their relationship first came to light in April 2011, after it emerged the pair had become extremely close on the Top Gear World Tour, where Jeremy visited countries including Australia, South Africa and Norway with his co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May. Phillipa worked as an events organiser for the show and so she was constantly by the team’s side as they visited the exotic locations. It was her job to make sure that the events ran smoothly and all of the guests were briefed and relaxed ahead of their appearance. The pair were reported to have shared hotel rooms in several countries on tour and were said to be openly affectionate with each other in front of the rest of the crew. Jeremy and Phillipa arriving at Sir David Tang's 60th birthday party last November at the Dorchester in London . They were first pictured together beside a pool on March 18, 2011, in Johannesburg, where Jeremy was rumoured to have fed Phillipa lettuce with his fingers. A year earlier, Jeremy had appeared to make reference to his rumoured love interest in a motoring column in a national newspaper where he discussed a time that he test drove a Maserati in New Zealand, with Phillipa in the back seat. In the article, which lead with the headline, ‘Lie back, leggy Philippa, while I have some fun,’ the presenter also referenced the blonde’s impressive stature. He wrote: ‘In the Maserati there was space behind Nigel for our green-room director Philippa, who's so tall she's actually measured in hands.’ At the time, both sides were quick to deny the affair, with Phillipa telling the Mirror: ‘Jeremy and I are friends, I have worked with him, er, them (the Top Gear team) for years.’ And after being told that she had been seen leaving his hotel room, she replied: ‘What? I often stay in colleagues’ hotel rooms – that’s not unusual.’ For his part, Jeremy said: ‘I’m surprised to find that I’m the new Tiger Woods.’ Jeremy Clarkson  enjoying a day by the beach along with Phillipa Sage in a Greek island while on holiday in 2013 . The pair appears to share a laugh together as they enjoyed a few drinks . Soon after the pictures appeared in a national newspaper, it was reported that Phillipa had left her position on the show in a bid to placate Jeremy’s furious wife, who had to learn of the affair while at home with their three children. After Jeremy returned home, the couple then took their children on a family holiday to Barbados in an effort to get past the event. Phillipa in the sea on their Greek holiday . For a while, everything appeared to have calmed down and little more thought was given to Phillipa, until she was pictured with Jeremy on holiday in Rome in November 2012, more than a year after they were photographed together. The couple appeared to be staying at the £650-a-night Hotel Ruisse, which is perfectly situated between the Spanish steps and the Piazza del Popolo for a romantic weekend away. By this time, Jeremy and his wife were living in separate homes, although they remained on good terms for the sake of their three children. The star regularly goes back to their old home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, to spend time as a family and the pair also attend lunches and dinner parties with their shared friends. The couple still share many friends and sometimes go to dinner parties or lunches together. Last summer, Jeremy admitted to his old enemy - MailOnline US Editor-At-Large Piers Morgan that he and Francie were going through a divorce. Piers told the Mail On Sunday that Jeremy told him: ‘I’m going through a difficult divorce, my first ex-wife has also came out of the woodwork to give me hell. 'I’m smoking too much, drinking too much, my back hurts, I’m all over the papers with this N-word scandal, I’m at war with my BBC bosses, and my mother has just died. 'I simply don’t have the energy [to war with] you any more.’ Although Phillipa shied away from joining Jeremy at any social engagements in the UK, the pair were then spotted on holiday together again in March 2013, when they were photographed on a yacht and on the balcony of the TV star's apartment in Sydney Harbour, while he completed Top Gear commitments. Phillipa and Jeremy on a weekend break to Rome in 2012 . Five months later they visited Greece in August 2013 and were pictured openly kissing one another at a beach-side taverna in Greece as they shared some drinks. Then in November 2014, they made their first public appearance in the UK together, as she accompanied him to the 60th birthday bash of businessman Sir David Tang. Although Jeremy appeared to have a change of heart inside the venue and opted to leave with the writer Rachel Johnson as Phillipa exited alone slightly later in the evening. But over the last few weeks, Phillipa has put her concerns about appearing with the television presenter aside and has been pictured arriving at his London home, picking him up from an event at the Camden Roundhouse and most recently today, when she raced to his home after hearing of his sacking by the BBC.

Phillipa, who stands at a statuesque 5ft 11ins is best known to her friends as Pip and lives in Hertfordshire with her son, who she conceived during a previous relationship with a man called Edward Taylor, who works as an operations director. She lives with her son, who she describes at the love of her life, on a farm not far from where she grew up with her family in a barn conversion in Knebworth. Philipa was always somewhat of a tomboy after growing up with two brothers, although she initially trained as a beautician and masseuse at the local country club after graduating from grammar school . Phillipa arrives at Jeremy's home in west London last week . But the job didn’t hold enough of a challenge for Phillipa and she soon moved into events, where she eventually started working at Top Gear, where she stayed until she a newspaper reported on her alleged affair with Jeremy in 2011. She now works at an events company in London called Key Events, which deals with big brands including Coca Cola, Samsun and Bacardi. And while Jeremy’s career appears to have hit a roadblock, his relationship with Phillipa has remained strong. The pair are now reported to be planning an exotic break in the next few weeks in order to escape the media glare.","Phillipa Sage, 45, has been by Jeremy's side throughout his recent ordeal .

"Smiling children enjoy fairground rides and a small boy eagerly waves at the camera while a candy-coloured big wheel turns in the distance. The footage could show scenes from any amusement park, anywhere in the world, yet it is a propaganda video designed to show the 'lighter' side of living under the bloodthirsty Islamic State caliphate.

The ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like under the Islamic State caliphate . The scenes could be from any park, anywhere in the world, but these children live under the control of ISIS . The video, entitled 'Citizens’ Days Out in the Shadow of the Islamic State' and published today, is an attempt to depict an idealised version of everyday life under the caliphate. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, analysed the footage. 'In the video, we see men and children playing in Dijla City theme park, which is located just on the outside of Mosul in northern Iraq,' Mr Winter said. 'While it may seem a strange addition to IS’s propaganda repertoire, is nothing unusual. 'Just as they do in many other videos like this, the propagandists are peddling the idea that there has been a total reversal of the status quo for Sunni Muslims in IS-held territory.

"Militants have killed five people in a gun attack on a restaurant in Mali's capital, including a French citizen and a Belgian security officer with the EU delegation in the country, authorities say. Mali's desert north, where French forces wrested control of territory from separatist rebels and al Qaeda-linked fighters, is plagued by frequent political violence - but this is the first militant attack for years in Bamako, in the south. Three Malians were also killed in the violence, which began about 1am, in and around La Terrasse restaurant, which is popular with expatriates. Police carry out their investigations at the scene of the militant attack in Mali's capital . Soldiers gesture in front of the La Terrasse restaurant where five people were killed . Blood stains on the floor of the restaurant show where the group were killed . A group of soldiers controlling the crime scene perimeter carry gear into the zone . An armed soldier stands guard after French and Belgium nationals were killed in the attack . It also left nine people injured and authorities said two people have been arrested. Senior police officer Falaye Kanta said: 'There were two individuals who were armed and hooded. 'One burst into the La Terrasse restaurant and opened fire on people. Then he got into a vehicle in which the other was waiting. 'As they fled down a neighbouring street, they shot a Belgian man who was in front of his house. 'He's dead. Not far away they came across a police vehicle and threw a grenade, killing the driver.' Those killed included a girl who died in hospital, Kanta said. Witnesses said police secured the street where the restaurant shooting took place because of unexploded grenades. Two international experts with the United Nations Mine Action Service were among the wounded, according to initial reports, said Mongi Hamdi, U.N. special envoy for the peacekeeping mission to Mali (MINUSMA). French forces took control of northern Mali two years ago but insurgents continue to mount attacks. France has more than 3,000 soldiers in West Africa as part of a counter-insurgency force against al Qaeda-linked militants. Mali's government signed a preliminary peace proposal on Sunday meant to end fighting with northern separatists, but the Tuareg-led rebels demanded more time before agreeing to any accord. Police said they arrested two men who they believe carried out the attack . Those killed included a girl who died in hospital, police said . Two international experts with the United Nations Mine Action Service were among the wounded . France and Belgium condemned the attack at La Terrasse restaurant and bar in Bamako and their foreign ministers confirmed the deaths of their nationals. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said one of the victims of the Bamako attack was a Belgian security officer with the EU delegation in the capital. 'This terrorist act strengthens even more our resolve to help fight terrorism throughout the region,' she said. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders denounced a 'cowardly act of terror' and France's Laurent Fabius said 'everything must be done to find those responsible for this crime.' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed a French citizen was among those killed and said the attack strengthened France's resolve to 'fight terrorism in all its forms'. The French embassy in Mali said on Saturday it had alerted its citizens and beefed up security.","Militants have killed five people in a gun attack at a restaurant in Mali .

"We spend hundreds or thousands of pounds on holidays that whisk us away from  'everyday life' to far-off places that provide the ultimate escape. But one designer believes people can find that escape with a unique - and cheaper - experience that allows them to fall in love again with the landscape that is around them every day.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Schrader said: 'We spend more and more time working - at the same time the affordable space for living, and therefore relaxation is decreasing.

Within a few seconds the machine converts the familiar environment into a new experience for 15 minutes.

'For just a short time, perhaps in your lunch break, you create a new and exciting situation by just shifting the perspective,' added Mr Schrader. People in cities such as London and New York are considered the target group, as their personal space is 'limited' The German anticipates the platforms will be hired locally, and the furniture on top can include dining areas and gardens, which will be owned by the city or private operator. Prices will vary from city to city, and will be dependent on the type of platform chosen, and what facilities are on offer, he added. Mr Schrader was born in Dusseldorf, Germany in 1978, and went on to study at University College London, as well as institutions in Vienna, Halifax, Canada and in his hometown.

"Grieving relatives of the two Australians killed when a Germanwings Airbus was flown into a mountain in the French Alps are preparing for an 'unbearably' sad day when they visit the crash site early next week. Relatives of Carol Friday, 68, and her 29-year-old son Greig, both from Melbourne, are en route to Germany this weekend. This comes as tributes continue to flow for the two Australians killed when Germanwings flight 4U 9525 lost altitude and crashed into a remote region of the French Alps. The mother and son were killed when the passenger jet, en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight on Tuesday. New photos of the 29-year-old have since emerged, showing him as a political activist who campaigned for equality. Scroll down for videos . Carol Friday and her son Greig, both from Victoria, were killed when the passenger jet, enroute from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight . Greig, who was to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering . Relatives of the mother and son are expected to fly to France on Monday and travel by road to Seyne-les-Alpes near the crash site. 'We are expecting the family to visit the site early next week, probably on Monday,' said Australia's ambassador in Paris, Stephen Brady. 'We hope that provides a small degree of solace.' Carol Friday's brother, Mal Coram, will represent the family in Seyne along with his two daughters, Georgie and Pippa. The Melbourne nurse's husband, Dave, and the couple's daughter, Alex, aren't travelling to France. The Corams will pay their respects at a newly erected memorial for the victims. Fairfax Media has reported they'll leave tributes from other family and friends including poems, photos and reminders of the Australian bush that Carol and Greig loved. 'I think that's a very beautiful gesture,' Mr Brady said on Friday. 'We'll do everything we can to make an unbearable day a little easier for them.' A statement from the Friday family said Greig was 'a man who loved others and life with a full heart' Australia's consul-general from Paris will be on hand to help the relatives in southern France. Specialists are combing the wreckage for body parts and DNA samples that will enable them to identify the 150 people who died in Tuesday's crash that was apparently deliberately initiated by co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. Prosecutors have revealed the German hid a serious illness from the airline amid reports he was severely depressed. Mr Brady on Friday thanked the French government for its handling of the disaster. 'I have nothing but praise for the swiftness and comprehensiveness of the French government's response,' the ambassador said. 'Despite not suffering any losses themselves the French have not stinted in providing a superb response to this tragic event.' France was rocked by the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in January and is now coping with what appears to be one of Europe's worst peacetime massacres since World War II. 'It's been two human tragedies of immense scale and consequence,' Mr Brady said from Paris. 'There's a resolve in government circles to ensure that the French state is able to cope with any crisis. 'But the atmosphere is sombre. It's deeply reflective.' Germany and Spain bore the brunt of the tragedy with 75 Germans dead and at least 50 Spaniards on board the Barcelona to Duesseldorf flight 4U9525. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has said that 'everything is pointing towards an act that we can't describe: criminal, crazy, suicidal.' Flowers are laid at a memorial for the victims of the air disaster near the crash site of the Airbus A320 in the French Alps . People join airport staff and emergency pastoral carers to take part in a memorial service for the victims of the plane crash in Germany on Friday . Since the plane crash, Greig's Facebook page is now serving as memorial with posts on climate change, world heritage, and gay rights issues. Greig's former manager at Jacob's engineering Sarah Alper said staff have been left devastated, according to SBS News. 'It's really devastating because our memory of him is that he was so happy and so excited about his adventure. It is just really sad.' Carol, a nurse for more than 40 years, had dedicated her life to helping others. Lisa Fitzpatrick from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said Carol's work with both Indigenous and refugee communities was testament to her generous spirit. 'She's worked with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. She's a woman who's demonstrated that her social perspective in helping others is not something she's just done in her working life but she has certainly been involved with working with refugees when they came from Kosovo to Australia back in the late 90s,' she said. The Friday family issued a statement through Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  saying they were in 'deep disbelief and crippled with sadness' over the death of the 68-year-old nurse and 29-year-old engineer. 'They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many, who they loved in return. They will forever be with us in our hearts, memories and dreams,' it read. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Prime Minister Tony Abbott both offered their condolences to the family of the two Australian victims . Mrs Friday, who turned 68 just two days ago, was on a holiday with her son who was planning to remain in Europe so he could teach English. Greig, who was about to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering. 'He also loved to travel and had just completed a course for teaching English as a foreign language, which he was hoping to do in France in the coming year,' the family said. 'Greig was a man who loved others and life with a full heart.' His mother was described as a devoted wife to her husband Dave and loving mother to Greig and daughter Alex. She was a registered nurse and midwife who regularly travelled. 'Carol loved life! She enjoyed every minute with her family and friends,' her family said. 'She was a talented artist and enjoyed spending time creating with her local art group. She loved to travel and has seen many of the world's greatest sights. 'Carol and Greig were enjoying a few weeks holiday together at the start of his European stay.' The news came as the first pictures of some of those lost emerged - and search teams recovered the black box from the crash site, where wreckage, bodies and personal belongings were strewn across a large area on the mountainside. A helicopter flies over the debris of the Airbus A320 at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes, French Alps . Part of the writing on the fuselage of the plane is visible on a piece of the wreckage (centre) on the mountainside . 'I don't think it gets any easier announcing the death of Australian citizens in a tragedy overseas,' Ms Bishop said. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this shocking tragedy. We extend our condolences to the governments of Germany, France and Spain and their people who appear to have borne the brunt of this tragedy.' Ms Bishop's prayers were echoed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. 'This incident will be a very painful reminder of other disasters in recent times - whether it's MH370 or MH17 - this will be a very raw moment for many Victorian families who have had to live through those tragedies just in the space of the last 12 months,' Mr Andrews said.","Carol Friday, 68, and her son Greig  among the 150 people killed in crash .

"A new ad starring a 'realistic' fashion doll with curves, stretch marks and a 'normal' sized body is trying to change women's perceptions of their bodies. Plastic doll Lammily - who was created as an antidote to Barbie's super-slim frame - is being used to teach us about our bikini body obsession. The brown-haired figure confronts her fears on a trip to the beach and sees other women there with flaws and scars, making her realise that no one's perfect. Scroll down for video . In the new Lammily advert the 'average barbie' is shown with stretch marks, the ad is meant to highlight the pressures women are under to be bikini ready . Highlighting the pressures on women to look 'swimwear ready,' at all times the magazine reads, 'Are you bikini ready?' She then starts looking at her friend's Facebook page where they have posted a bikini picture with the mocking hashtags, #plasticperfection, #donthate, #thighgapclub, #bikinibody, #youknowit. In what seems to be a parody of the Victoria's Secret show - famous for its underwear clad models - two barbies then start twerking on a stage as average Barbie looks on. She is then confronted by adverts for a 'dolly tuck,' and one which says you can lose half an inch in two weeks - a reference to the dolls small waists. In the advert Lammily is constantly faced with adverts which tell her she can lose weight quickly - the same images women see in real life . The doll is initially seen with red cheeks when she gets to the beach because she is embarrassed by her bikini body . However when she finally heads to the beach average Lammily realises that everyone there has their own issues. Some have stretch marks, others have spots and one has a scar across her stomach. The dolls creator Nickolay Lamm, a digital artist who majored in marketing at the University of Pittsburgh, said of making the ad: 'I was thinking about how Lammily, in the fashion doll world, would feel very out of place. I think one of the hardest things to do in life is to be yourself.' Lammily also looks at magazines which ask her 'Are you beach ready?' When Lammily sees the other dolls on the beach she soon realises that they all have their issues with their bodies . Lammily was first created in 2014 as the result of a crowd-funding project. Nickolay felt that there was no doll on the market that represented real women. More than 13,000 people signed up to the project with 19,000 of the dolls being pre-ordered. You can buy clothes to fit on the doll as well as stickers which show scars, stretch marks and acne just like normal women have. Nickolay, speaking in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, said: 'I’m an artist, plus event planner, email checker, data entry person, graphic designer and pizza delivery driver. My goal isn’t to make a ton of money. I just want to create the most awesome content on the Internet.' If you buy a Lammily doll then you can buy stickers to go on her - for example these stretch mark stickers which show the marks many women have on their bodies . Lammily has stretch marks herself which she proudly shows off as she DJs a party on the beach for her friends .","Lammily takes a trip to the beach in the new advert .

"Obesity rates in South Los Angeles grew by 12 per cent over three years despite a much-hailed ban on new fast food restaurants, research had found. Before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008, 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county. But three years on, instead of the law curbing weight gain, the opposite trend took force. In 2011 75 percent of South Los Angeles residents reported being overweight or obese, while rates elsewhere only increased by one per cent. Obesity rates in South Los Angeles grew by 12per cent despite a much-hailed three-year ban on stand-alone fast-food restaurants, a new study has found . The failed fast food ruling targeted a 32-square-mile area south of Interstate 10 that struggles with high obesity rates and other health problems. The law, believed to be the first effort of its kind by a major city to improve public health, did not ban new eateries in strip malls. The research by the Rand Corp. think tank found that obesity rates in South Los Angeles continued to rise after passage of the law. 'It had no meaningful effect,' Rand senior economist Roland Sturm said. 'There's no evidence that diets have improved more in South Los Angeles. Obesity and overweight rates have not fallen.' Health experts said a single intervention would not reverse the obesity problem. People also have to exercise and make lifestyle changes, they said. Local problem: Before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008, 63per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57per cent in other parts of the county . 'It's not just about limiting unhealthy food, but increasing access to healthy food,' said Alex Ortega, a professor of public health at the University of California, Los Angeles, who had no role in the study. Rand researchers reviewed permits issued by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which inspects food outlets. There were no licenses for stand-alone fast-food restaurants, but chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in South Los Angeles from 2008 to 2012. Almost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food, the study found. Researchers also compared obesity rates in South Los Angeles and other parts of the county using surveys that asked residents to report their weight and eating habits. Supporters said the ordinance worked because it prevented chains from opening new restaurants at major intersections with their own drive-thru windows and parking lots. They acknowledged it will take some time to see health gains but noted that the area has seen farmers markets and community gardens in recent years. 'We never said this ordinance was the silver bullet' to solving the obesity problem, said Gwen Flynn of the Community Health Councils. Unhappy: Standing outside a McDonald's in the Leimert Park neighborhood on Wednesday, Edward Cox lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes - he wasn't a fan of the fast food ban . Changing tastes: Maurice Thrower, who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast-food chains, said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers . 'As long as we can make sure people have more options, that's the important thing.' City Councilman Bernard Parks, who supported the zoning law, said he was hopeful that the area can attract more markets selling fresh food. The ordinance was opposed by the California Restaurant Association. Spokeswoman Janna Haynes said the group had no comment on the Rand study. Standing outside a McDonald's in the Leimert Park neighborhood on Wednesday, Edward Cox lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes. 'I want to sit down and eat, but there's no place to sit down and eat,' said the retiree, who usually drives to another neighborhood to dine out. Cox said he's hopeful that a planned light rail line will attract a variety of new eateries. Maurice Thrower, who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast-food chains, said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers. 'Once people stop to eat here, they come back,' said Thrower, who opened Simply Delicious Burgers last year.","Before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008, 63per cent of South Los Angeles reported being overweight or obese .

"Tim Tebow, whose stint as a National Football League quarterback briefly sparked 'Tebow-mania', spent Monday trying to make a comeback in a workout for the Philadelphia Eagles. But after one day of training, Tebow left without being signed, according to ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter. The 27-year-old  who once played for the Denver Broncos and New York Jets performed for the Eagles and coach Chip Kelly in hopes of trying out for a quarterback position, a source told AP. Tim Tebow, pictured in August 20123, trained with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday in an attempt to try out for a quarterback position . Considering all the offseason moves made by  Kelly, taking a look at the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner with the huge following shouldn't be a surprise. It has been speculated that Tebow could run zone-read plays better than Philadelphia's four current quarterbacks. Tebow elicited interest from millions of fans in large part for his public displays of religious faith on and off the field, a head-bowing genuflecting move on one knee that became known as 'Tebowing' in the wake of his success. In 2011, Tebow began the season as a backup with the Denver Broncos but was given a chance to start after a 1-4 start. Tebow sparked a string of come-from-behind victories and led Denver into the playoffs and an upset of Pittsburgh in the first round. But Tebow's 47-per cent pass-completion rate was the worst in the NFL that season and when the Broncos signed Peyton Manning in 2012, Tebow became expendable. He was sent to the Jets in a trade. Tebow was seldom used even as Jets starter Mark Sanchez struggled. He was released in 2013 having thrown only eight passes and run just 32 times in his lone season in New York. The New England Patriots made Tebow one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no NFL team wanted him. Tebow, pictured here in August 2013, left training on Monday without signing with the Eagles. But ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter left the idea open, claiming 'We'll see if anything changes' Tebow was being assessed by an Eagles team that features Sanchez, who joined Philadelphia after his own departure from the Jets, and Sam Bradford, a quarterback who missed most of last season with a torn left knee ligament. Bradford was the second sophomore player to win the Heisman Trophy as the top college player, doing so in 2008. Tebow had been the first in 2007. Tebow has an 8-6 record as an NFL starting quarterback with a career 48-per cent completion rate for 2,422 yards with 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Schefter announced on Twitter that the Eagles decided not to sign Tebow, but left the option open. 'Tim Tebow has come and gone from Philadelphia. Team is not planning to sign him at this time. We'll see if anything changes,' he wrote. Kelly's remake of the Eagles' roster has included trading star running back LeSean McCoy to Buffalo, then signing Offensive Player of the Year DeMarco Murray to replace him. Clearly, Kelly - who took over personnel duties after last season - is unafraid to look anywhere for possible upgrades. Although Tebow had some success in Denver, his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the NFL. His strength has been running the ball or improvising. There's also been some thought that Tebow might switch to tight end or fullback, although he has balked at such a move in the past. The Eagles have depth at tight end, but no fullbacks on the roster.","Tebow spent one day of training with team before leaving .

"More than half of young adults in Los Angeles can fluently speak a language other than English, despite the fact that the city's percentage of foreign born residents is decreasing. Fifty-seven per cent of those aged 18 to 34, in LA spoke a language other than English at home, beating out Miami which had 55 per cent and San Jose with 54 per cent. Roughly a quarter of the 'Millenial' generation nationwide uses another language, according to the American Community Survey. A map of young adults' ability to speak a language other than English uses dark red for counties where more than 40 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds communicate in a foreign language at home, and lighter shades of pink for smaller proportions of the population . Roughly 60 per cent of LA city residents age five and older speak a language other than English, with Spanish the most popular language among them. In addition to a large number of Latino immigrants, Los Angeles also has large Middle Eastern, Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European communities. However, the proportion of foreign-born adults in Los Angeles has actually decreased 9 percentage points to a little less than a third since 1990, and a large number of the Millenials with foreign language skills are thought to be bilingual. The rise in bilingualism is probably caused by children continuing to speak their parents' tongues in addition to English, according to Voice of America. UCLA professor Raul Hinojosa said that the children and grandchildren of immigrants historically stopped learning to speak the same language of their ancestors, but that there has been a 'sea change in the last ten years'. California has seen a growing percentage of its young adults speaking foreign languages (bars in blue) since the 1980s. The US as a whole (pink bars) has also seen its rate increase at a slower pace . Hinojosa said that languages beyond Spanish, second and third-generation immigrants will be encouraged to keep knowledge of Mandarin and other languages. The American Community Survey collected data between 2009 and 2013 and found that 23.3 per cent of the population was between 18 and 34 years old, a fall from 30 per cent in 1980. Data showed that the generation is less likely to be married and more likely to have gone to college than three decades ago, as well as more likely to speak a foreign language. Areas that showed the highest rates for speaking something other than English were near the US-Mexico border in California and Texas. New Jersey was found to be the third most likely state for a young adult to speak a foreign language at home. West Virginia ranked last for the statistic with 3.63 per cent and Middlesborough, Kentucky, was the metro with the lowest percentage of young adults who could speak a foreign language with 0.034. In contrast to Los Angeles, many US cities and states have seen significant increases in their foreign-born populations. The United States as a whole saw its estimated foreign-born population decline 0.4 percentage points from 2000 to the American Community Survey. US: 25 per cent . Atlanta: 22.5 . Boston: 28.1 . Chicago: 33.1 . Cleveland: 11.6 . Dallas-Ft Worth: 35.8 . Denver: 23.5 . Detroit: 14.2 . Houston: 42.6 . Los Angeles: 57.6 . Miami: 55.5 . Minneapolis: 17.5 . New York-Newark 42.9 .

"David and Victoria Beckham's plans to refurbish their new £31.5million mansion have hit trouble after a rich neighbour complained they are damaging the historic character of their leafy London boulevard. For 18 months the couple, said to be worth a combined £210million, have spent £5million improving the palatial west London  home - an inner-city replacement for their sprawling Hertfordshire estate 'Beckingham Palace'. But at least one neighbour is upset about plans to install air conditioning in five rooms, including in the new gym and wine cellar. Moving in: The Beckhams are spending £5million on building work before they move into their new London home, pictured, but a neighbour has complained over plans to install air conditioning . Plans: The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria’s shoe collection . Portfolio: The couple, pictured together at a charity dinner, have applied for planning permission to improve their mansion, which will become their main UK residence after they sold Beckingham Palace in Hertfordshire - they already have homes in California, France and Dubai . One resident has written to the local council and said he 'totally disagrees' with the plans, which 'will affect the historic character of the Victorian house of the streets, my house included'. MailOnline understands that the complainant is worried about air conditioning units being attached to the mansion, because of the visual impact and the humming noise. His letter said: 'The council must identifed (sic) our deep concerns about all adverse impacts on living conditions from noise, vibration, dirt, pollution and dust from construction and from associated traffic, in addition to concerns about impacts on drainage, on appearance and landscape, on structural stability, and on historic buildings.' The Beckhams have hired designer Rose Uniacke to oversee the project and plans for 'internal alterations at all levels' were approved in February this year. This included the enlargement of the lower ground floor wine cellar and the installation of a retractable cinema screen. They also want to re-configure two bathrooms while removing a third-floor guest bathroom to form an extended bedroom and sitting room. When ready, the  home will have six-bedrooms, a gym, study, office, playroom, cinema and large drawing room. The first floor will belong to David and Victoria, and boast a huge bedroom, an even bigger dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. The house will include rooms for hairdressing, manicures and make-up, as well as separate rooms for 40-year-old Victoria’s shoe collection. Staff and security will have access to a tunnel which will take them unseen to a second property. The couple have already installed a sound system so that music can be played in every room, and which can be controlled by a phone or computer. They are planning on adding specially designed waterproof plasma TVs in every bathroom. Their children Brooklyn, 16; Romeo, 12; Cruz, ten; and daughter Harper, three, will take over the second floor of the house which has three bedrooms, all with en-suite bathrooms. An artist's impression of what it might look like inside the Beckhams' home . Family: David Beckham  takes a selfie of himself and his children (L-R) Brooklyn Beckham, Romeo Beckham, Cruz Beckham and Harper Beckham, before Victoria's event at New York Fashion Week. All the children will have huge amounts of space in the mansion . Particulars: These photos submitted to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council in October 2014 show the mansion needs refurbishing since it was last updated in the 1990s . The lower ground floor includes a study, a gym and massage room, three service rooms and a small garden and there is an underground garage where David can keep his fleet of cars. David and Victoria reportedly sold their Hertfordshire home, known as Beckingham Palace, for £12million. However, they also own homes in California, Dubai and a £2.6million holiday home in the South of France. The Beckhams bought the 12-acre estate just three months after their wedding in 1999 for £2.5million. They submitted a fresh application for air-conditioning in February, with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council expected to make a decision on it in the next three weeks. The Beckhams will also be installing underfloor heating at the home. Photos submitted to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council in October 2014 show it needs redecorating. But estate agent Becky Fatemi, who runs Rokstone, believes when the project is finished it will be a brilliant family home. She said: 'The Beckhams' home has got very grand proportions, it is a trophy home. You don't get that many coming up for sale as many of these homes have been turned into flats. 'With planning on a home like this it is perfectly normal to take this long. 'The work will probably cost around £500 - £600 per sq/ft so it will cost around £5 million to do. 'When the work is done, it will be a brilliant home for a family. 'There are good schools in the area, there is the park and the Westfield is nearby. 'I am sure when the work it is complete, it will be in good taste and they'd look to get £4,000 per sq/ft for it.' Old pad: The Beckhams reportedly sold Beckingham Palace, pictured, for £11.5million - a tidy £9million profit . This would value the property at £42 million. David and Victoria bought the home in September 2013 with the grand property dubbed Beckingham Palace II. In the 1930s it was a boarding house for single ladies before being converted into a flats in the 1940s. During the 1960s it was awarded Grade II status. In 1989, it was returned to a single family home and renovated before being sold for £3.45 million in 1992. During the 1990 renovation, a lift was built, a full-length swimming pool was installed in the basement and the first floor was re-ordered to accommodate a billiards room. However, these changes were reversed a decade later with the pool filled in and replaced with a family room and gym. The property was sold in 2005 to a Guernsey-based company which sold it to the Beckhams eight years later. The Beckhams also own a mews house at the rear of the property and have just submitted plans to make minor alterations to it.","Beckhams are spending £5m on renovations on London replacement to previous mansion Beckingham Palace .

"Bed-blocking  has reached record levels as thousands of healthy people fill hospital wards needed for sick patients, official figures reveal. Hospital beds were taken up on more than 1 million days in the last 12 months - a 19 per cent increase on the year before. The problem - which is caused by delayed discharges - is now costing the NHS an estimated £287million a year. In January alone, the latest month for which figures are available, discharges from hospital were delayed for a total 103,776 days, according to NHS England records. Bed-blocking has reached record levels as thousands of healthy people fill hospital wards needed for sick patients . It is the first time the figure has risen over 100,000 since records began in 2010. A bed in a hospital costs the NHS a basic £275 per day with medicines and other care excluded, according to Department of Health figures. And with each delayed discharge lasting an average 28 days in January, the costs quickly mount up. Successive governments have failed to deal with the problem of bed-blocking. But with numbers of bed days lost to the issue having nearly doubled from 55,000 a month in August 2010 to more than 103,000 in January 2015, critics have accused the Coalition of losing grip of the issue. Healthy patients are usually kept in hospital because they have nowhere else to go. At Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge 18 per cent of acute inpatient beds were occupied last November by people whose discharge had been delayed . This is often because councils do not have a space in a care home to take them to, or because a care package has not yet been set up in their own home. Labour yesterday blamed the escalation of the problem on cuts to social care budgets, which have been reduced by £3.5billion since 2010. A leading doctor recently warned that the lack of available council care risked bringing the NHS 'to its knees'. At Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge 18 per cent of acute inpatient beds were occupied last November by people whose discharge had been delayed. Dr Susan Robinson, an A&E consultant at the hospital, said in November: 'If we' re crowded it's because the hospital's crowded, and the hospital's crowded because they can't get patients out. 'The crowded hospital is almost bringing us to our knees.' NHS England statistics show that from February 2014 to January 2015 1,042,434 bed days were lost due to patients being unable to be discharged. For the same period last year 873,415 days were lost. King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham told the Independent on Sunday: 'Many delayed transfers of care are caused by problems accessing other parts of the NHS, such as community and mental health services, while increasing pressures on social care are also a factor. 'The solution must be sought in better co-ordination and adequate funding both for the NHS and social care.' Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: 'Back in 2010 I said it would be irresponsible to safeguard the NHS budget if the way you pay for it is by raiding social care. This Parliament has borne that out completely. Care costs are the root cause of the A&E crisis. 'In their Budget assessment the Office for Budget Responsibility said there would be a 'rollercoaster' in 2016-17 and 2017-18 – far deeper cuts than we have seen in this parliament. ' The Department of Health said that although delayed transfers have risen, hospital admissions have risen faster. A spokesman said: 'In fact, proportionally fewer patients are being delayed in hospital as the NHS helps record numbers of patients. 'We've given a record £700million this winter for thousands more NHS staff and beds, alongside £37m for local authorities to help more people go home from hospital promptly. 'We're also bringing health and social care services together for the first time next month to further reduce A&E admissions and get people out of hospital more quickly.'","Hospital beds were taken up on more than 1 million days in past 12 months .
This is 19% increase on last year meaning bed-blocking has hit record high .

"A Sydney mum who won $10,000 on the Today Show this morning has hit back at trolls who attacked her for not deserving the prize. Amanda Bushe won the money as part of the morning show's Knock of Cash promotion, when weatherman Steven Jacobs arrived on the doorstep of her Eschol Park home to surprise the pregnant single mum. Ms Bushe eventually emerged wearing her dressing gown, and explained she has been unable to work during her pregnancy. Sydney mum Amanda Bushe, who won $10,000 on the Today Show this morning, has hit back at trolls who attacked her for not deserving the prize . She said the money would 'massively' change her life. Ms Bushe also said she had recently been served with an eviction notice as a result of not being able to pay the rent. Her friend, Nicole, who nominated her for the prize said Ms Bush is 'one of the strongest and most lovely women' she has met, and very deserving of the cash. However, viewers of the show quickly took to Today's Facebook page, attacking her justification for being job-less. 'I didn't know your (sic) could get evicted for being pregnant, must be another reason!!! and she said she only took kids in to look after them that's not a foster parent because foster parents get paid to do that,' one person wrote. Channel Nine weatherman Steven Jacobs arrived on Ms Bushes doorstep as part of the Today Show's Knock of Cash competition . Ms Bushe, who answered the door in her dressing gown, initially slammed the door in the presenter's face . 'This annoys me! It's called priorities! I was a single mum with two kids one with a disability for 8yrs, no family to help me and I never once was not able to pay my bills!' another commented. 'How about giving away cash to the average bloke & lady that work long hrs that are on a low wages just to give them a break well like that will ever happen these shows & radio shows always go after people with all the problems in world,' one Facebook user complained. Ms Bushe then leaped to her own defence, and swung back at the trolls attacking her. She explained that she had slept for little more than an hour overnight due to her medical condition, which explained her seemingly dazed and confused state when first opening the door. 'I opened the door in my robe (that didn't have a tie) having no idea who was there and to be honest was a bit worried having a mic shoved in my face by a complete stranger not knowing what was going on,' she wrote. Online trolls attacked the mum's win, saying she 'didn't have her priorities in order' and that her pregnancy wouldn't have caused her not to have a job . Ms Bushe quickly leaped to her own defence. 'I was in a good job and a comfortable position before I fell pregnant and was able to afford these luxuries' she said . 'As for my piercings and tattoos. I was in a good job and a comfortable position before I fell pregnant and was able to afford these luxuries. I didn't get pregnant then run off and decide to get a million piercings.' 'As for fostering kids I don't do this through foster care. I have taken kids in that have been kicked out of home and have nowhere to go. 'So to answer some questions in here no I don't get anything for it.' Other users quickly began to throw their support behind Ms Bushe, and started hitting back at the 'cruel hearted' and 'small minded' people who were critical of her win. 'Australia has become such a nasty country! So jealous that you all have to put this lady down when you don't know her situation and don't forget she's been a foster mum to many kids.'","Amanda Bushe surprised by Channel Nine's weatherman Steven Jacobs .

"Tory peer Lord Wolfson, who last year took home £4.6million, said the living wage was 'irrelevant' The multi-millionaire boss of Next sparked anger last night after declaring that the living wage was ‘irrelevant’. Tory peer Lord Wolfson, who last year took home £4.6million, said it was ‘an invention’ and ‘not a reality’. The living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living in the UK and is £7.85 an hour and £9.15 in London. It has become a cause celebre with trade unions and some politicians - including Labour leader Ed Miliband and London Mayor Boris Johnson. Lord Wolfson earns a basic salary of £729,000 which works out at £233 an hour assuming he works 12 hours a day and excludes weekends. He believes the living wage is irrelevant because it depends on how many hours staff work as to what they earn and whether they can live on it. He said: ‘I think retail wages are a living wage for a lot of people but not for everybody. 'What is a living wage will depend on the circumstances of the person earning it more than the amount being paid. ‘What is a living wage for a student living at home is very different to a living wage to someone who is supporting family. ‘I think there are a lot of people for whom £6.70 an hour is a wage they can live on but it’s not a wage everyone can raise a family on.’ ‘You have got to remember in retail the vast majority of jobs are part time so the amount you are earning per hour is irrelevant really,’ he said. ‘It’s the amount you earn in total that will determine whether you can live on it or not. ‘ . Lord Wolfson made the comment on the same day Next posted bumper annual figures . The Next chief executive employs 48,417 full and part time staff earning an average £11,000 annual salary. These are supplemented by an average 10 percent bonus of around £1,100 as well as a 25 percent clothing allowance. The firm says its rate of £6.70 an hour is above the minimum wage of £6.50. Luke Hildyard from the High Pay Centre described Lord Wolfson’s comments as ‘crass’. He said: ‘The living wage is calculated by independent experts looking at a wide range of evidence. Labour MP Ann McKechin (pictured) said the comments were ‘ill-judged' ‘They are probably better judges of its relevance than Lord Wolfson - and with estimated wealth of more than £100 million, it does feel a bit crass for him to be passing comment on whether people can get by on less than £7.85 an hour.’ Labour MP Ann McKechin, a member of the influential business committee, said the comments were ‘ill-judged coming from someone who is fortunate enough to have such a good income’. She said Next staff ‘live a very different life from the cushy life that he enjoys in his private life’. She added that it would be ‘a reality check’ for Lord Wolfson ‘to try and live on that wage for a prolonged period’. She added: ‘It’s just not taking his staff seriously. ‘He is entitled to his political views, but at the end of the day any employer who is not prepared to engage in this debate is doing their staff down.’ Lord Wolfson made the comment on the same day as Next posted bumper annual figures. Annual pre-tax profit increased 12.5 percent rise to £794.8 million as and the dividend rose by 16.3 percent. He also said that election is causing uncertainty. ‘The reason we refer to political uncertainty is really that the environment in the Autumn or Winter will depend on who gets into the government and what they do in their first budget,’ he said. ‘I don’t think consumers think there is an election coming up I don’t think I will buy a dress.’","Next boss earned £4.6million last year - pays shop workers £6.70 an hour .

"Are you curious and creative but a bit standoffish? Then you're probably a Londoner. Think of yourself as more dependable and down to earth? You may well live in the Midlands. And if you pride yourself on your friendliness and ability to stay calm in a crisis, you're most likely to be Scottish. This is according to experts at Cambridge University, who have marked out a personality map of the whole of Britain. Revealed: The moody map of Britain details the country's most and least friendly inhabitants . The profile revealed that inhabitants of the capital are the least welcoming of all. The Welsh also fare badly, with the researchers declaring them to be exceptionally shy and neurotic. The Scots, however, can hold their heads high, as they are the friendliest and most emotionally stable people in Britain. To find out what where we live says about us, psychologists asked almost 400,000 Britons a series of questions designed to assess five key personality traits. They then looked to see how common each of the five characteristics – agreeableness, extraversion, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism – was in each of the 380 council areas in England, Scotland and Wales. Characteristics: People in the Midlands were among the most conscientious (left), suggesting that like residents of the Scottish Highlands, they are dependable, reliable types. Meanwhile those who lived in the capital scored highly on extraversion (right), as did the people of Manchester . Mapped out: The Scots scored highest in agreeableness (left), which covers friendliness, trust, co-operation and concern about others. The Scots also emerged as the least neurotic (right) and the most calm and contented. The colour red means a greater level of an attribute, while blue is for the opposite . New experiences: Inhabitants of the East Midlands and the east of England were the least open – leading to them being labelled 'conventional, down to earth and traditional' The result is a fascinating, and at times controversial, snapshot of the psychology of Britain. The Scots scored highest in agreeableness. The first of the five traits polled, it covers friendliness, trust, co-operation and concern about others. People in Devon, Somerset, East Anglia and Yorkshire are also highly agreeable sorts. And at the other end of the scale are the residents of London, who were found to be the least friendly of all. Rather than being warm and welcoming, they are likely to be uncooperative, quarrelsome and irritable, the journal PLOS ONE reports. Those who lived in the capital, however, scored highly on extraversion, as did the people of Manchester. In contrast, those living in the Scottish Highlands and parts of Lincolnshire were among the most quiet and reserved. Londoners fared badly in the study - they were found to be among some of Britain's least friendly residents . City-dwellers also did well on another trait, openness. This is a measure of curiosity, imagination and intellect, and was particularly high in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton, Bristol, Manchester and Glasgow. Residents of some parts of Wales were also deemed creative and curious. Inhabitants of the East Midlands and the east of England were the least open – leading to them being labelled 'conventional, down to earth and traditional'. However, people in the Midlands were among the most conscientious, suggesting that like residents of the Scottish Highlands, they are dependable, reliable types. Londoners and the Welsh fared badly once more, with the survey finding them to be among the most slapdash and unreliable. The Welsh's answers also led to them being branded the least emotionally stable and the most anxious, depressed and temperamental. The Scots emerged at the other end of the scale, as the least neurotic and the most calm and contented. People from Devon were found to be highly agreeable, the study showed. Pictured is the charming seaside town of Woolacombe, Devon . Researcher Jason Rentfrow said some of the results can be explained by people moving to areas that better suit their personality. The local economy and even the weather may have an impact – with lots of rainy days putting a dampener on happiness. But with personality traits linked to various illnesses, as well as rates of crime and even the way people vote, the results are more than just a bit of fun. Dr Rentfrow said: 'Geographical differences are associated with a range of economic, health and social outcomes – and hence how important resources are allocated.'","A Cambridge University study has marked out a personality map of Britain .

"Avoided jail: Tomas Drungelas, 33, was spared a prison sentence despite his 202 burglaries . A serial thief who admitted committing more than 200 burglaries in just two years has avoided jail and been ordered to attend a ‘victim empathy course’, it was revealed today. Tomas Drungelas, 33, of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was spared a prison sentence - despite victims telling the judge that they would ‘be angry’ if he was treated leniently. The Lithuanian criminal broke into and burgled 202 homes in the Hertfordshire area between 2013 and 2014 to fund his addiction to alcohol and gambling, St Albans Crown Court was told. But Judge Andrew Bright QC said that he would spare Drungelas jail and send him on a locally-run rehabilitation course called Choices and Consequences, or the ‘C2 Programme’. He also said Drungelas would be tagged for 36 months, under curfew between 9pm and 6am and must complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Drungelas was also ordered to go on the victim empathy course as well as attend alcohol and gambling ‘intervention programmes’. The judge said: ‘The victims of some of the burglaries you have committed have contacted me and expressed their anger if you were to be treated leniently. ‘Under normal circumstances you would face five or six years in prison for the offences you have committed, and many people will say that this is not the way to deal with a prolific burglar. 'However, you have been given an opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to turning your life around.' He added: ‘Some may say that this is a let off, but it is not, because if you break any of the conditions or reoffend you will find yourself back in this court and you will serve the full sentence for the crimes you have admitted to, which could be five or six years in prison.’ The C2 Programme is run by Hertfordshire Constabulary in partnership with the probation service, ‘under the direction’ of Judge Bright. It aims to turn around the lives of ‘prolific offenders’ to offer them a ‘realistic opportunity to break free from the cycle of crime’. In its first year 31 criminals took part, confessing to 1,800 crimes. Sentencing: St Albans Crown Court (above) was told the Lithuanian criminal broke into and burgled 202 homes in the Hertfordshire area between 2013 and 2014 to fund his addiction to alcohol and gambling .","Tomas Drungelas, 33, was spared prison term at St Albans Crown Court .

"A Utah restaurant has caused a stir over the anatomy of a giant bull it uses to advertise the eaterie, . Businessman Stephen Ward applied to Hurricane City council for permission to erect the giant bull above his restaurant named Barista's and unveiled the beast earlier this month. However, locals have attacked the massive sign and have even started a petition for the council strip restaurant of its business licence. Locals in Utah have complained about the size of a bull's anatomy, pictured perched above Barista restaurant . More than 500 people have signed a petition for the restaurant to lose its business licence due to the bull . Owner Stephen Ward, pictured, said locals in Hurricane City dislike him and that is why they are complaining . More than 500 people have already signed the petition, which has been created Charge.org. According to the petition: 'As a member of the Hurricane City council has already said, Barista's has given Hurricane, UT a ""black eye"". 'It's owner is a terrible representation of what our community stands for. He takes advantage of every person that walks into his restaurant. 'They intentionally take excessive advantage of those that are visiting our community from other parts of the world. 'They have a horrible reputation that shines a bad light on the rest of Hurricane, UT. We as a community will not stand aside and allow this false representation be made!' Local resident Denise Mackelprang told The St George News: 'It looks terrible. I could see the bull, but not the details of the sex. It’s R-rated to me, especially with young school kids seeing it and talking about it.' Fellow resident Lindsay Knapp complained: 'The giant bull is awesome. The giant, weird testicles and penis are not even anatomically correct … that is my issue.' However, Mr Ward said local residents do not like him and that is the main problem. He said: 'If I put Pinocchio up there, its nose would be too big. It’s me. It’s me. It’s not the bull. It’s not the restaurant. They don’t like me. But you know what, where does it say in the world, in the Constitution, that they can prevent me having the right to do legal commerce in the United States? That is my God-given right.' As well as the petition, some residents have threatened to go to a council meeting to lobby politicians to act against the giant bull.","Restaurateur Stephen Ward erected the giant bull above his restaurant .

"A 13-year-old boy has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of murder after he stamped on a woman so hard he left a shoe print on her face. The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, punched charity worker Glynis Bensley, 47, in the head and stamped on her  before stealing her money, phone and jewellery. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in September last year. The child robber stood trial alongside Zoheb Majid, 20, from Smethwick, who was found guilty of robbery and manslaughter. A 13-year-old boy has become one of the youngest people in Britain to be convicted of murder after he stamped on a woman so hard he left a shoe print on her face (pictured is the scene in Smethwick) A jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the duo had planned to carry out a robbery via text messages a fortnight before the murder. Mrs Bensley was on her way home from the Seven Stars when she was knocked to the ground by the schoolboy. CCTV footage revealed that  Majid arrived on his bicycle moments later and the pair turned their victim over, stealing from her pockets. A post-mortem examination of Ms Bensley revealed she died from a severe bleed on the brain. After the attack, the schoolboy fled to nearby Victoria Park to meet up with friends and was heard boasting about the murder and selling a gold bracelet. Both robbers claimed they believed the victim was a man because of Ms Bensley's clothing and hairstyle. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted. Ms Bensley was found dead in a pool of blood with her head in the gutter in Smethwick, West Midlands, moments after the violent battering in September last year . 'They were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other. 'Ms Bensley was tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time and was randomly picked out by the pair believing that she was a man and that she was wearing a gold bracelet. 'The brutal attack was captured on CCTV lasting 32 seconds. 'Our thoughts remain with Glynis' family at this time and we hope that today's verdict will provide some help in their grieving process.' Ms Bensley's sister Dawn, 55, from Smethwick, said: 'We are a very close and supportive family and always look out for each other. 'To try and explain how Glynis' murder has affected us is very hard to put into words. 'Glynis was my only sister and best friend. I would describe her as my right arm and I thought we would grow old together.' A full statement from the victim's family read: 'We as individuals and collectively as a family have lost a great friend. 'We are unable to express in words the impact that our loss is having on our family. 'Whilst we get on with the day-to-day trivialities of life, the circumstances of Glynis' death remind us all of the important things in life. 'At the time of Glynis' death she was upbeat and looking forward to family holidays and celebrations including her own birthday later that month. 'Glynis spent her life caring for others working in roles for the British Heart Foundation, animal welfare, and was also an active fundraiser for charity's Cancer Research, Mencap and Cystic Fibrosis. 'The family would like to acknowledge and thank the family liaison team for taking us through this dark period. 'They would also like to offer sincere thanks to Mr Atkins QC and the investigation team.'

"The Clintons are going back to the White House this spring – onstage, that is. 'Clinton the Musical,' the brainchild of two Australian brothers, makes its off-Broadway debut in April with a hysterical premise and a gentle look back at the '90s. The play celebrates the first baby-boomer president – the one who preferred briefs to boxers, played a sax on national TV, presided over an economic boom and got himself impeached. The cast of characters includes Dick Morris, Newt Gingrich, Monica Lewinsky and former Clinton special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who sings 'A Starr Is Born' and 'Sexual Relations.' 'Clinton the Musical' stars Tom Galantich (left) as the wholesome and intelligent Bill Clinton, Duke Lafoon (right) as the sex-crazed 'Billy Clinton,' and  Kerry Butler (center) as Hillary Rodham Clinton – the only person who can see both of them . YES, SHE'S THERE TOO: Monica Lewinsky (left), the president's White-House-intern lover, makes appearances in 'Clinton the Musical' ALL IS FORGIVEN? As Hillary Rodham Clinton (left) prepares to run for president, her husband's legendary sexual appetite could come back to haunt her . 'The thing that endeared Bill Clinton and continues to endear him to the American public is that he was a very identifiable human being,' said Paul Hodge, who wrote the music and lyrics and co-wrote the story. 'He was clearly human and he had flaws like everyone.' There's a dancing press corps in the show, and music that takes you back to Celine Dion, Hanson and the Spice Girls. 'It really does its job of taking down America and uplifting it at the same time, in a weird sort of way,' said Dan Knechtges, the Tony Award-nominated director and choreographer. 'Nothing is sacred.' Two men will play the 42nd president – one a wholesome, intelligent Clinton, and another a randy, rogue one (Tom Galantich and Duke Lafoon share the task.) Only Hillary can see both. That bifurcated idea was first proposed by Michael Hodge, Paul's older brother, a lawyer in Australia, who co-wrote the story and now consults daily with his brother via Skype on last-minute changes. 'It seemed like a good device to sum up a very complicated man but also something that had a lot of opportunity for humor, and also something that allowed us to tell a story that everyone knows in way that they don't know,' said Paul Hodge, a Ph.D. candidate in musical composition at the University of Queensland. NO 'BIMBO ERUPTIONS'? It's unclear whether Bill Clinton accusers Gennifer Flowers (left), Juanita Broaddrick (center) and Paula Jones (right) made any apearances in the new off-broadway production . Kerry Butler, the Tony Award-nominated star of 'Xanadu,' will play Hillary Rodham Clinton just as the former secretary of state debates whether to run her own presidential campaign in 2016. The Hodge brothers kept an eye on Hillary Clinton's career as they wrote the show, reworking her part and throwing in topical humor, like jokes about her email. 'That's part of the fun of doing something that's set in the past where people know what's going to happen in the future but the characters in the past don't know what's going to happen,' said Paul Hodge, 27. 'That's an opportunity for comedy.' The show was first presented in a shortened form at The Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2012, before playing the New York Musical Theater Festival last year. It opens off-Broadway at New World Stages on April 9. The Hodge brothers have been adding and shaping the show, and only two songs remain from the fringe show. Characters have also been deepened. 'There was not enough Ken Starr. You can never get enough Ken Starr,' Paul Hodge joked. Bill Clinton's tenure was highlighted by a failed health care reform plan and record budget surpluses. He faced constant scandals, capped by an affair with a White House intern that made him just the second president to be impeached. The show notes that the Clinton presidency also coincided with the start of the cable boom and the 24-hour news cycle, developments that have buffeted the leaders who follow. 'I think it was a time when the distance between the public and the presidency evaporated,' said Paul Hodge, whose humor is rooted in shows like 'The Simpsons,' ''30 Rock,' ''Arrested Development' and 'The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.' 'A STARR IS BORN': An actor portraying Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr (left) makes an appearance in the show, along with the president's 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman' moment (right) The idea of making a musical about the Clinton presidency came about a decade ago when the Hodge brothers saw 'Keating!,' a musical about Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. They went with their dad, Robert Hodge, who afterward commented: 'It's good, but I don't think politicians make great subject matter for musicals, except maybe Bill Clinton.' 'We went, 'Of course!'' Paul Hodge said. The brothers insist they have no domestic political axe to grind, seeing as they are Australian citizens. They wanted simply to see the president as a flesh-and-blood man. 'I admire Bill Clinton,' Paul Hodge said. 'He's a very complicated person, but I think we all are. My view of all of the people involved in the story is that they're all very complicated human beings.'","Two men will play the 42nd president: one portraying him as wholesome and intelligent, and another as a lascivious rogue .

"Thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the Amazon  each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world. But despite this, the planet has got greener in the past decade, with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall. The increase is so noticeable that the world's trees and plants now store almost four billion more tonnes of carbon than they did in 2003. Thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the Amazon (pictured) each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world - but despite this, the planet has got greener in the past decade, with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall . This is thanks to tree-planting in China, forest regrowth in former Soviet states because of abandoned farms, and more lush savannas because of higher rainfall. Scientists analysed 20 years of satellite data and found an increase in carbon, despite ongoing large-scale tropical deforestation in Brazil and Indonesia, according to research published on Monday in Nature Climate Change. Carbon flows between the world's oceans, air and land. It is present in the atmosphere primarily as carbon dioxide (CO2) - the main climate-changing gas - and stored as carbon in trees. Through photosynthesis, trees convert carbon dioxide into the food they need to grow, locking the carbon in their wood. The greening of Earth is thanks to tree-planting in China, forest regrowth in former Soviet states because of abandoned farms and more lush savannas because of abandoned farms and higher rainfall. An an image of a family on a farming collective in the USSR in 1935 is shown . The researchers say that Earth is getting greener thanks to a combination of environmental and financial factors. There are more trees in China because of planting programmes that have been running for a few decades. Vegetation has increased on the savannahs of Australia, Africa and South America as a result of increasing rainfall. Russia and former Soviet republics have seen the regrowth of forests since huge collective farms have been abandoned. The increase of carbon in the atmosphere over the past decade has caused the 'CO2 fertilisation effect' which has improved the growing conditions for plants a little. As Earth gradually warms up and ice and permafrost melts in the Arctic, the 'tree line' is moving north, meaning there are more pine forests springing up. While the four-billion-tonne increase is helpful, it is small compared to the 60 billion tonnes of carbon released into the atmosphere by fossil fuel burning and cement production over the same period, said Yi Liu, the study's lead author and a scientist at the University of New South Wales. 'From this research, we can see these plants can help absorb some carbon dioxide, but there's still a lot of carbon dioxide staying in the atmosphere,' Dr Liu said by telephone from Sydney. 'If we want to stabilise the current level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - and avoid the consequent impacts - it still requires us to reduce fossil fuel emissions.' Dr Liu, who specialises in observing the water cycle, including rainfall and soil moisture, used a new technique of collecting satellite data on radio frequency radiation naturally emitted by the Earth to calculate the amount of vegetation in a given area. Before, scientists measured vegetation through satellite images and other techniques, looking at canopy greenness and plant height. He had expected to find increased forests in China, which has had tree-planting projects for two to three decades, as well as on abandoned farmland in former Soviet countries. China has had tree-planting projects for two to three decades and is now boosting the Earth's greenery, researchers say. Here, two giant pandas rest on the outskirts of Chengdu in China's Sichuan province . But he was surprised to discover the large expansion in vegetation due to higher rainfall on tropical savannas and shrublands in Australia, Africa and South America. But these fragile gains may be easily lost, as weather patterns shift with climate change, he warned. 'Savannas and shrublands are vulnerable to rainfall – one year can be very wet, and more carbon will be fixed in plants, but the next year can be very dry, and then we will lose the carbon fixed in previous years,' Dr Liu explained. Louis Verchot, a research director at the Indonesia-based Centre for International Forestry Research, said Dr Liu's findings were 'by and large what we would expect in the warmer and wetter world that results from climate change'. Declines is rainforest vegetation has been particularly dramatic in the Amazon and Indonesia's provinces of Kalimantan and Sumatra. This image shows slash-and-burn agriculture in Mozambique . Researchers found a large expansion in vegetation due to higher rainfall on tropical savannas and shrublands in Australia, Africa and South America. The Savannah, Serengeti National Park, Tanzania pictured . Over 2,300 square miles (6,000 square km) of Amazon Rainforest was destroyed in the 12 months to the end of July 2013, according to statistics from the Brazilian government. This means that deforestation was up by 29 per cent and the most activity was seen in the states of Para and Mato, where more than 390 square miles (1,000 square km) of land was cleared in each location, the BBC reported. Before these figures, there was some decline in the clearing of the precious resource to make room for grazing animals and crops. The increase is thought to be because of illegal logging and the building of new infrastructure such as roads and dams, as well as making space for farmers. 'As ice and permafrost melt, they are being replaced by vegetation, and the tree line is moving north as the Arctic warms,' he said by email. Vegetation growth is also expected to increase due to rising CO2 in the atmosphere, known as the 'CO2 fertilisation effect,'which has improved the growing conditions for plants a little. Dr Verchot said the value of Dr Liu's study is that it puts a number on the contribution of vegetation to moderating greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere. 'Hopefully this will lead to greater efforts to stop tropical forest loss and to promote sustainable use of ecosystems in ways that preserve enough of the carbon absorption function as we continue to pump CO2 into the atmosphere through fossil fuel burning,' Dr Verchot added. Declines is rainforest vegetation has been particularly dramatic in the Amazon and Indonesia's provinces of Kalimantan and Sumatra. Scientists are particularly alarmed by land clearances in these areas because the forests are richer and more diverse habitats than grassland, for example, and absorb more carbon per hectare than savannah and croplands. While total plant cover may have increased over the past decade, it is arguably of lower quality than that found in rainforests, which also support networks of rare inter-dependent species. The report said that only half of rainforest loss has been offset by growth in other types of forests.","Scientists in Australia analysed 20 years of satellite data on greenery .

"Astronomers may have finally found evidence of the elusive dark matter that permeates the universe. Its presence has potentially been spotted in a dwarf matter orbiting the Milky Way which is radiating gamma rays - the most powerful form of radioactive waves known in the universe. How these mysterious waves are made, and where exactly they come from have baffled scientists for years, but scientists believe they are a sign for dark matter. Scroll down for video . Scientists at Brown, Carnegie Mellon, and Cambridge universities have detected gamma ray emissions from the direction of the galaxy Reticulum 2. Bright areas indicate a strong gamma ray signal coming from the direction of the galaxy, according to the researchers’ search algorithm . Dark matter is the missing substance that makes up to 80 per cent of the universe's mass. It has been described as 'the most important unsolved problems in modern physics.' When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. The galaxy, named Reticulum 2, was discovered within the past few weeks in the data of the Dark Energy Survey. At 98,000 light-years from Earth, Reticulum 2 is one of the nearest dwarf galaxies yet detected . According to physicists at Carnegie Mellon, Brown and Cambridge universities, gamma rays coming from the direction of the galaxy are in excess of what would be expected from normal background. 'Something in the direction of this dwarf galaxy is emitting gamma rays,' said Alex Geringer-Sameth, a postdoctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon University. 'There's no conventional reason this galaxy should be giving off gamma rays, so it's potentially a signal for dark matter,' said Alex Geringer-Sameth, a postdoctoral research associate in CMU's Department of Physics and the paper's lead author. 'In the search for dark matter, gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature,' added Brown University's Savvas Koushiappas Koushiappas, an assistant professor of physics. 'It seems like we may now be detecting such a thing for the first time.' The researchers caution that while these preliminary results are exciting, there's more work to be done to confirm a dark matter origin. Scientists know that dark matter exists because it exerts gravitational effects on visible matter, which explains the observed rotation of galaxies and galaxy clusters as well as the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. Dwarf galaxies are important in the hunt for the dark matter particle. They are thought to lack other gamma-ray-producing sources, so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter. Pictured is an artist's impression of the jet from a gamma-ray burst emerging at nearly light speed . 'The gravitational detection of dark matter tells you very little about the particle behaviour of the dark matter,' said Matthew Walker, assistant professor of physics and a member of CMU's McWilliams Center for Cosmology. Gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature of dark matter. A leading theory suggests that dark matter particles are WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. When pairs of WIMPs meet, they annihilate one another, giving off high-energy gamma rays. If that's true, then there should be a lot of gamma rays emanating from places where WIMPs are thought to be plentiful, like the dense centres of galaxies. 'But now we may have a non-gravitational detection that shows dark matter behaving like a particle, which is a holy grail of sorts.' A leading theory suggests that dark matter particles are WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. When pairs of WIMPs meet, they annihilate one another, giving off high-energy gamma rays. If that's true, then there should be a lot of gamma rays emanating from places where WIMPs are thought to be plentiful, like the dense centres of galaxies. The trouble is, the high-energy rays also originate from many other sources, including black holes and pulsars, which makes it difficult to untangle a dark matter signal from the background noise. That's why dwarf galaxies are important in the hunt for the dark matter particle. They are thought to lack other gamma-ray-producing sources, so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter. 'They're basically very clean and quiet systems,' Professor Koushiappas said. Scientists have been looking at them for signs of gamma rays for the last several years using Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. There's never been a convincing signal, until now. Further study of this dwarf galaxy's attributes could reveal hidden sources that may be emitting gamma rays, but the researchers are cautiously optimistic. 'The fact that there are gamma rays and also a clump of dark matter in the same direction makes it quite interesting,' Professor Walker said.","Dark matter is the missing material making up 80% of universe's mass .

"She has walked for the likes of Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana,  been a Victoria's Secret Angel for five years in a row, and on top of this, is a married woman. So it's no wonder that busy supermodel Lindsay Ellingson needs ways to unwind, just like everyone else. The 30-year-old has now revealed her top tips for managing stress to online beauty magazine, Byrdie, and thankfully they are things that everyone can incorporate into their lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Victoria's Secret Angel for five years, Lindsay Ellingson has revealed her top tips for managing stress . Lindsay Ellingson regularly posts images of her cockapoo Carly and says 'nothing beats' time with her . The model admitted that 'nothing beats quality time with my little pup Carly!' The California-native is regularly pictured with her dog, Carly the cockapoo (a cross between an American Cocker Spaniel and a poodle) on Instagram. Ellingson commented on the feeling of love that she receives from spending time with her pet: 'She's just full of love, as are most pets.' She goes on to suggest alternatives for those who don't own dogs: 'If you don’t or can’t have a pet, many animal shelters love to have volunteers who come to interact with the animals. 'In fact, several shelters [...] let you come and walk the dogs for a few hours a day.' Lindsay also recommends massaging oil into the skin on daily basis, revealing it's the smell that works to de-stress: 'The scents will immediately transport you to a calm place.' Aromatherapy oils are yet another way that the model stays stress-free in her hectic lifestyle . Forget coffee, the model drinks calming organic tea, containing liquorice ginger, cardamon, and cinnamon . She even carries her oils with her, admitting, 'I never leave home without it.' The Victoria's Secret model also says  drinking a special herbal tea when she's on the move or feeling out of sorts can make her feel calm again. In particular, she goes for natural herbal Vata tea, which consists of liquorice root, organic ginger, cardamom and cinnamon. Ellingson further adds that she personally opts for the tea when 'travelling [or] feeling restless.' The 30-year-old emphasises always 'falling asleep the right way' - especially with Carly next to her . 5. Spa day - A midday spa appointment is one of the Victoria Secret Angel's favourite ways to unwind . And for the model, getting her beauty sleep is a must. She opts for a pre-bed ritual to guarantee she'll feel well-rested the next days, explaining that it's important to fall 'asleep the right way'. This involves removing devices from around the bed. She said: 'Reading on my iPad is a big no-no.' Instead, she suggested 'a cup of warm almond milk before bed and then massaging your feet with an essential oil.' The best time to go to sleep? 'Preferably at 10pm - according to Ayurveda, an alternative medicine, originating from India, your body repairs itself most effectively between 10pm and 2am,' she said. While another New Age tip for managing stress is: 'a mid-day Ayurveda facial in between running to my appointments', which she describes as 'the perfect pick-me-up.' And the best bit is the massage. The model's favourite parts to concentrate on are: 'My favorite part is the face, neck, arm, and shoulder massage.' For those who are new to the entire spa experience? 'Bring a friend to enjoy the day,' she advises. For the next tip, Lindsay can't quite put her finger on the reason she finds painting her nails so relaxing. 'Maybe it's the total distraction from all my daily activities and the focus it takes to paint inside the lines.' Lindsay finds that the concentration needed to paint her nails is a relaxing experience . Ayurvedic self-massage - The model has always been interested in alternative medicine and tried out Ayurveda, which aims to balance the body, mind, and spirit through a combination of sleep, yoga, herbs and oils, meditation, and a healthy diet . Another tip from Lindsay: 'I love the idea of giving yourself an oil massage every day.' Earlier this year the model became interested in Ayurveda: an alternative medicine that originated in India. 'I wanted to try something new and good for my body and mind.' Prior to giving the self-massage, the model suggests: '[Rubbing] a couple drops of calming oil into [your] hands for a few seconds... and deep breaths to slowly transition into a meditative state.' Lindsay states that she enjoys an oil massage due to the fact: 'It's incredibly soothing and detoxifying.' Lindsay says that something that everyone can relate to enjoying is a getaway . The beauty pairs a face mask with  under-eye patches, and for the extra relaxation factor, a cup of tea . Lindsay flags going on holiday as 'the ultimate way to recharge' and that listening to the sound of the waves is an incredible relaxation technique. Her low-budget alternative? 'If you can’t afford a seaside getaway, no problem. Thankfully there's an app for that - the soothing sound of crashing waves, no beach required!' And if you'd rather just put your feet up at home, make like the model and slap on a face mask while you're sipping a calming cuppa. Although she admits:'I try not to scare my husband like this too often!'","The 30-year-old model has been a Victoria Secret Angel for five years .

"While interstellar space travel is still in the realm of science fiction, scientists say that if an alien ship came within range of Earth at near light speed, we would be able to detect it. This is according to a pair of defence engineers who say that any spacecraft travelling that fast would leave distinct light signatures in its wake. But their study also reveals the tricky physics of travelling at near light speeds, calculating that a collision with single dust grain would release energy equal to 5291lbs (2,400kg) of exploding TNT. A pair of defence engineers say that any spacecraft travelling close to the speed of light would leave light signatures in its wake because it would interact with the cosmic microwave background (pictured). The panels show how scientists predict the CMB signature would change as the spacecraft increases speed . California-based Raytheon engineers Ulvi Yurtsever and Steven Wilkinson claim that spaceships travelling at near light speeds would interact with the cosmic microwave background (CMB). CMB is the light left over from the earliest moments of creation that has been stretched across the entire cosmos as the universe expanded. A fast-moving spacecraft would collide with cosmic microwave photons, say the engineers, creating highly gamma rays, according to a report inMIT Technology Review. Raytheon engineers  suggest that spaceships travelling at near light speeds would interact with the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Pictured is a  Narn spacecraft from Babylon 5 . The researchers have estimated that each cubic centimetre of space contains over 400 microwave photons. This means a spaceship would collide with thousands of billions of  photons every second creating something known as electron-positron pairs. Each of these pairs would cause drag on a spaceship. 'Assuming an effective cross-sectional area of say 100 square meters, the dissipative effect is about two million Joules per second,' said Yurtsever and Wilkinson in their study. There may be many things we don't understand about the universe, but one thing we can be certain of is that the speed of light cannot be exceeded. Right? Not necessarily, according to one scientist. He claims that a certain effect may be capable of producing the illusion that 'spots' of light travel faster than lightspeed. And his research says that when this occurs, the spots produce a phenomenon known as a 'photonic boom'. The controversial study was carried out by physics professor Dr Robert Nemiroff from Michigan Tech University, and he recently presented his research at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle. He claims that if you shine a powerful enough laser pointer on the moon from Earth and sweep it across the surface, the 'spot of light' could appear to move faster than the speed of light. This is because, in this hypothetical scenario, if another person standing on a moon attempted to shine a light across the moon at the same time, it would take longer. 'The stream of particles (photons) from your laser pointer can sequentially impact the moon so that another light beam - confined to the surface of the moon - could not keep up,' Dr Nemiroff told MailOnline. In his paper he explained that, although light takes about 0.0116 seconds to cross the moon, a person standing on Earth can sweep a laser pointer across the moon's surface in less time. Such sweeps in the universe are known as 'superluminal sweeps' - superluminal meaning faster than light. The speed of light in a vacuum is 186,282 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second). Seconds last longer when travelling at high speed so the energy dissipation is higher too at around 10^14 Joules per second. 'In general one can imagine the same interactions that occur in a particle accelerator to occur between relativistic spacecraft and interstellar matter,' write the authors in their study. As well as drag, a single cosmic dust grain with a mass of 10^-(14) grams would release about 10,000 megajoules worth of energy if it the spacecraft. The engineers explain that is the same amount of energy released by 2,400 kilograms of exploding TNT. 'Our assumption that matter-matter interactions can be dealt with when civilisation can build relativistic spacecraft may prove false and may be a barrier that will prevent space travel [at relativistic speeds],' write the engineers.","Engineers say spacecraft travelling that fast would hit photons of light .
This would cause interstellar aliens to leave light signatures in their wake .
But travelling so fast means there will be significant drag from photons .

"Chilling images have emerged showing terrorists loyal to the Islamic State on a hill-walking holiday in the Iraqi mountains as they take a break from the rape and massacre of the local population. The photographs, released by ISIS' official propaganda wing, show the militants reading the Koran, enjoying a picnic, and even riding ponies as they relax  in northern Iraq's mountainous region. With total disregard for the atrocities carried out by ISIS in the country over the past year, including the kidnapping and forced sex slavery of thousands of young Yazidi girls, the heavily armed men are seen smiling as they happily pose with the terror group's sinister black and white banner.

One photograph shows them frying what appear to be homemade chips, while a second captures them sitting inside a building eating and reading religious texts. Callous: With total disregard for the atrocities carried out by ISIS in the country over the past year, the heavily armed men are seen happily posing with the terror group's sinister black and white banner . Reaching the summit: Photographs of the militants relaxing in northern Iraq were widely shared on social media by thousands of sympathisers of the Islamic State terror group . While not out on the mountains, the men appear to spend their time reading the Koran and consuming food . The images emerged as the United Nations human rights office said that ISIS fighters may have committed genocide against the minority Yezidi community in Iraq as well as crimes against humanity and war crimes against civilians including children. In a report based on interviews with more than 100 alleged victims and witnesses, it urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court for prosecution of perpetrators. The report also said Iraqi government forces and affiliated militias 'may have committed some war crimes' while battling the insurgency. The U.N. Human Rights Council launched its inquiry in September after the Islamist militant group Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seized large swathes of northern Iraq. Chilling: The images show terrorists loyal to the Islamic State taking part in a hill-walking holiday in the Iraqi mountains as they take a break from raping and massacring the local population . Not healthy: This photograph shows the militants frying what appear to be homemade chips . The report said the Council had found 'information that points to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes', and that the Security Council should 'consider referring the situation in Iraq to the International Criminal Court'. There was a 'manifest pattern of attacks' by Islamic State on Yezidis as well as Christians and other minorities as it laid siege to towns and villages in Iraq. The U.N. investigators also cited allegations that ISIL had used chlorine gas, a prohibited chemical weapon, against Iraqi soldiers in the western province of Anbar in September. Captured women and children were treated as 'spoils of war', and often subjected to rape or sexual slavery, it said. The report said that ISIL's Islamic sharia courts in Mosul had also meted out cruel punishments including stoning and amputation. 'Thirteen teenage boys were sentenced to death for watching a football match,' it said. The U.N. investigators said it was 'widely alleged' that Iraqi government forces had used barrel bombs, an indiscriminate weapon banned by international law, but this required further investigation.","Images show ISIS terrorists relaxing in the mountains of northern Iraq .

"Michelle Obama has touched down in Tokyo in what is being described as a 'makeup call' after she 'snubbed' the Japanese by failing to accompany her husband during his state visit to Japan last year. In a further patching up of relations, Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe, is due to make a reciprocal visit to America next month. Mrs Obama's previous no-show  upset members of the Japanese establishment so deeply that one politician, Kazuyuki Hamada, made the outrageous claim that the Obamas were getting divorced, as the president had been using Secret Service agents to cover for his extramarital affairs. Scroll down for video . Big in Japan: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama waves upon her arrival at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, wearing a green printed dress from Kenzo’s Fall 2014 collection, which costs around $700, offset by a chunky belt. Her visit is being described as a 'makeup call' after she snubbed the country last year . Diplomacy: Michelle Obama meets and greets upon arriving at Tokyo airport. Last year, she failed to accompany her husband on an official visit to Japan, which reportedly caused offence . Thaw: Michelle Obama will reportedly be attempting to build bridges with Japan after snubbing the country last year. Next month, the Prime Minister of Japan will visit the U.S. in a move to further patch up relations . Michelle Obama descends the stairs of Air Force One upon her arrival at Haneda international airport in Tokyo on Wednesday . Mrs Obama's trip comes at a time of high tension for Americans in Japan, as Tokyo police investigate phone calls threatening to kill U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and Alfred Magleby, the U.S. consul general based on the southern island of Okinawa. Her arrival also coincides with a visit by former president Bill Clinton, who is in the country to deliver a keynote speech at the JFK International Symposium held at Waseda University in Tokyo. During the five-day trip, Mrs Obama will also visit Cambodia - whose leader, Hun Sen, has a reputation for ruthlessness, and where child prostitution and human trafficking is rife - to highlight a campaign supporting education for girls. There were so far no details on the cost of the trip but the First Lady's group spent $222,000 over two days in hotel expenses during her 2014 trip to China, the Washington Examiner reported. Mrs Obama, who is visiting Japan for the first time, will have separate meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. She will visit historic sites in the ancient capital, Kyoto, before travelling to Cambodia. In Tokyo she plans to announce, along with Japanese first lady Akie Abe, the Let Girls Learn initiative, a partnership supporting girls' education. The two will also meet with Japanese university students. It is hoped that the community-based aid program, led by the Peace Corps and similar aid organizations, will help get 62 million girls back into school. White House staff said that the program also reflects a U.S. commitment to be more involved in the Asia-Pacific region. Mrs Obama leaves the plane and heads for her motorcade in Tokyo where she will meet with Japanese first lady Akie Abe to discuss her education initiative . Mrs Obama will be the first sitting U.S. first lady to visit Cambodia, one of 11 countries participating in the Let Girls Learn initiative. Cambodia's government is led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has a reputation for ruthlessness and little tolerance for dissent. The country also has child prostitution and human trafficking problems. Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told reporters that while in Cambodia, Mrs Obama plans to discuss the need for open and inclusive politics and highlight basic values and principles that are important to the U.S. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Mrs. Obama called it a 'tragic waste of human potential' when 62 million girls worldwide are not in school. 'It is also a serious public-health challenge, a drag on national economies and global prosperity, and a threat to the security of countries around the world, including our own,' Mrs. Obama wrote in her online travel journal. 'This visit is part of a journey that began decades ago, back when I was a little girl.' YouTube celebrity Michelle Phan is joining Mrs. Obama in Tokyo to help spread awareness for the Let Girls Learn campaign, and pose questions to the first lady submitted through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

"A mother has told of her horror after her daughter bit into a takeaway pizza and discovered a one-inch knife blade. Sobia Khan, 38, ordered two pizzas from Pizza Hut for her family, including her 14-year-old daughter Aamana. Aamana tucked into a large vegetable pizza but after a bite she grimaced and said to her mother, 'mum, I think I have got something metal in my food.' Threat: The knife blade which was reportedly discovered in the Pizza Hut vegetarian pizza . Miss Khan, who had ordered the takeaway pizzas to her parents' house in Slough, Berks, pulled out the piece of metal and was stunned to discover it was the snapped-off tip of a knife blade. The mother-of-one, who works at a recruitment agency in Slough, said: 'I thought it was tin foil but when I pulled it out it was the tip of a knife. Everyone was horrified and shocked. 'The thought of my daughter having to swallow that or put that in her mouth is horrific. 'She could have cut her tongue or the inside of her throat. I could have been sat in A&E.' Amana Khan, 14, bit into the vegetarian pizza before complaining to her mother that she thought there was something metal in it . Store: The Pizza Hut takeaway in Slough, Berks, sent a driver round to the family's house and took away the knife blade . Miss Khan immediately called Pizza Hut but felt like she was being accused of making it up. She said: 'I felt like I was being accused of putting the blade in there myself just to get a free pizza. 'I had to explain to him if you looked at your records you will see how many times we order pizza from you.' A delivery driver came round to the house and provided a refund as well as taking the blade away - but Miss Khan is still frustrated with Pizza Hut's response. Mother Sobia Khan, who ordered the pizzas, said she was not looking for compensation but wants Pizza Hut to acknowledge what happened . She said: 'My daughter was not hurt so I am immensely grateful. 'I am not looking for compensation or anything silly like that, I want acknowledgment that this was in their food because it is absolutely disgusting. 'If my daughter or another child had swallowed that, or an adult, can you imagine? It could have cut up the inside of their throat or the lining of their stomach.' A statement from Pizza Hut said: 'Following our investigation, we regret to confirm that the object in Ms Khan's pizza did originate from our Hut. This is not acceptable and does not meet our high standards of food preparation. We are reviewing this with our Hut team to ensure this isolated incident does not happen again. 'We apologise to Ms Khan and her family unreservedly and are extremely thankful that no physical harm was caused.

"Connor Marshall has died after being found in a life-threatening condition outside a caravan at Trecco Bay Caravan Park, Porthcawl, on Sunday morning . Police have launched a murder investigation after a teenager died in hospital after being seriously assaulted at a Welsh caravan park. Connor Marshall, 18, from Barry in south Wales, was found in a life-threatening condition at Trecco Bay Caravan Park, Porthcawl, in the early hours of Sunday. He was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and remained in intensive care for almost a week - but despite the best efforts of doctors he died today. South Wales Police say they have now launched a murder inquiry. The teenager and two friends went to a number of pubs in the Porthcawl area before they returned to the park at 1am. Connor was found seven hours later by early morning campers. Police made a caravan to caravan search at the park - one of the biggest in the UK and a favourite for families. Holidaymaker father-of-three Martin Hatley, from Swindon, said: 'I was shocked. As a dad to a teenage boy myself it's terrible to hear about something like this. Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'Officers are continuing to conduct inquiries to establish the full circumstances of what happened. 'However, we would appeal to anyone who has any information that could assist us with our inquiries to contact us immediately. 'This was a brutal attack upon Connor with fatal consequences. 'I believe the person responsible may have shared information with friends, relatives or neighbours and I would urge anyone who has information or who may have been in the area of Trecco Bay between midnight and 7am on March 8 to contact the police. Connor Marshall was found unconscious at Trecco Bay Caravan Park, Porthcawl, on Sunday morning . Connor (pictured) and two friends went to a number of pubs in the Porthcawl area before they returned to the park at 1am.

Sharon Edwards, 54, posted a smiling image of herself in front of a sunrise on the morning she disappeared . The teacher was last seen between late on Saturday in Grafton, on the New South Wales north coast . It was first noticed Ms Edwards was missing when she failed to show up for a class she was due to teach . Police this week forensically examined three properties the pair own together, one in Grafton and two, including a vacant block, in nearby Lawrence. Police divers and the water police joined the search on Friday with a focus on the Clarence River. It is understood Ms Edwards lives in the Grafton home and her husband often stays at the Lawrence property. Police and family say they hold 'grave concerns' for her welfare as it is extremely out of character. She has no known medical conditions and has not made contact with relatives.

"The last salmon fisherman on the River Severn is embroiled in a legal battle with the Environment Agency - after catching just a single fish too many. Nigel Mott, 71, has been catching salmon in traditional basket traps since the 1970s and once netted up to 600 fish a year worth £100 each. But his livelihood was thrown into doubt in 2012 when the Environment Agency ruled that no individual fisherman could land more than 30 in a season. Nigel Mott is the last remaining commercial salmon fisherman on the River Severn and claims it is impossible for him to make a living if he is restricted to catching just 30 fish in a season . The River Severn. Nigel's home in Stroat, Gloucestershire, is around six miles from the town of Lydney, off which he fishes. The 71-year-old used to catch up to 600 salmon a year worth £100 each . Defiant Nigel continued to use his putcher rank - an array of 650 basket-like traps - and hit the quota in just 26 days. As a protest he presented his 31st fish to the local Environment Agency office - and was duly prosecuted. He won his case but the agency has now announced plans to appeal the decision. Nigel said: 'When I caught the 30th fish, I rang them up and told them I was going to fish in excess of the 30 - I even brought them my 31st fish. 'They seized my fish and warned me of a prosecution - which is exactly what I wanted because I was very anxious to get my evidence before a court.' The Environment Agency introduced the new quotas amid fears that the salmon population in the Severn was dangerously low. Nigel, of Stroat, Gloucestershire, has won his case, but must face another hearing in the Court of Appeal . After catching his 31st fish Nigel was prosecuted for breaching his licence and the case was heard at the High Court in London in February. Nigel, of Stroat, Gloucestershire, argued that the unreasonably low quota threatened his livelihood and would put him out of business. He claims his form of fishing has minimal impact on salmon in the Severn, as his putchers stretch out just a couple of hundred metres from the riverbank. That leaves a mile of open water for the fish to swim past his cages, he argued, allowing plenty of space. Despite winning the case his legal battle still shows no signs of ending as the Environment Agency has vowed to take it to the Court of Appeal. A spokesman said: 'Although the judge has at this stage ruled in Mr Mott's favour, we will be seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. 'All of these sites are designated to protect salmon, and these populations are currently under threat. 'We impose restrictions on salmon fishing for all fisheries in these areas because of the need to protect the designated habitats and fisheries.'","Nigel Mott has been fishing with traditional basket traps since the 1970s .

"Virgin Australia are investigating  standards on-board their planes following an irate passenger's video in which he documented the lack of cleanliness on his flight from Sydney to Melbourne. The man known only as Stuart Mc called the video: ‘Virgin Australia – A Disgrace' and filmed a dirty seat, chewing gum, dirt and paper littered around flight VA 868 from SYD to MEL. Despite the obvious filth surrounding the man's seat, a spokesperson for Virgin Australia told Daily Mail Australia that the airline is committed to providing flyers with a clean environment and will be looking further into the circumstances surrounding the man's flight. What looks like a bolt is lying down the side of a seat along side some chewing gum . 'Virgin Australia prides itself on delivering a superior customer experience which includes maintaining a high standard of cleanliness on board our aircraft,' the spokesperson said. 'This example is clearly not up to that standard and we are investigating as a matter of priority.' However it was definitely a warts and all video with filthy aisles and seats the first thing you see. The disgruntled man made his opinions clear during the video, which he uploaded to YouTube, claiming he would prefer if the carrier spend more time on their standards than promoting cheap fares. 'And they want us to believe Tiger is the discount carrier.... this is the seat I was allocated this afternoon on VA 868 SYD to MEL. Obviously short cutting cleaning is the way to making a profit for Virgin Australia,' Stuart Mc commented on the YouTube segment. Virgin Australia say they are investigating the incident on-board one of their planes from Sydney to Melbourne . Dust and grime also can bee seen lying down the side of the seat . As the camera pans along you then see what looks like chewing gum, dust, grime and bits of paper down the side of the seat. It's clear that the seats and down the side of them had not been cleaned for quite a while. Even the arm rests were dirty. It was a gross rather than great experience. Not that it was the only airline to be a loser in the cleanliness stakes. After splashing out up to £9,000 on first class flights on British Airways from Gatwick to the Caribbean, on what was supposed to be a 'trip of a lifetime', TV news presenter Owen Thomas was horrified to find dirt and grime caked around his first class seat. Dust, detritus and hairs can be clearly seen in an other shot . The arm rest of the seat has obviously not been washed for a while . Videoing the evidence, the former BBC anchorman posted the evidence on Twitter, dubbing the service 'Filth Class'. Narrating the short 30-second video, the presenter explains: 'So this is BA first class and it is abs filthy. You see the marks on here, most of these you can just actually scrape off. 'You see the stains down here. It's when you open your seat that the real horror begins . There is also dust and dirt down the side of the arm rest . 'This is first class. This is British Airways First Class. It's disgusting.' The former BBC anchorman and reporter flew off to St Lucia with a companion on Saturday in First Class seats that retail on BA's website for nearly £9,000 each in peak-season January. In 2000, the Virgin brand entered the Australian aviation market for the first time. The new brand Virgin Australia was launched in May 2011 to be Australia’s airline of choice.","Virgin Australia are investigating the standards on-board their planes .

"Tom Sherrington, head of Highbury Grove School sent 300 pupils to detention a day during his first week in charge back in September . A super-strict headmaster has transformed behaviour at his secondary school by putting more than 300 pupils a day in detention. Tom Sherrington joined Highbury Grove School last September and immediately enforced a tough discipline policy, which was called ‘Orwellian’ by some parents. Automatic one-hour detentions were introduced for arriving late to a lesson or wearing uniform incorrectly. Disruption in lessons led to a full day in an isolation room. The approach led to ‘huge numbers’ in detention – more than 300 every day in the first week. Now, the figure is about 80. However, punctuality and uniform standards at the school in Islington, North London, have ‘improved dramatically’. The turnaround contributed to society magazine Tatler naming it one of Britain’s best state schools this year. Writing in the Times Educational Supplement, Mr Sherrington said: ‘Standards continue to improve; behaviour is not yet impeccable but we’re well on the way. ‘More and more students are prepared to admit that they like it; the school is still a happy, friendly, supportive place – but now they can get on with learning and teachers can get on with teaching in a way that wasn’t always possible before.’ When he started at the music specialist school there was a feeling among staff that approaches based on ‘restorative justice hadn’t really worked’. This trendy discipline method in many schools involves taking a no-blame approach to bullies. Mr Sherrington wrote: ‘The perception was that it had created a need for constant negotiation, enacted inconsistently across the school because of a lack of clarity around the rules and the consequences of breaking them. ‘Several teachers who left last summer even cited behaviour as a reason. It wasn’t terrible in general, but some classes were just too hard to teach. Clearly I needed to act.’ In January, Tatler magazine said the school, pictured, had been transformed by 'a brilliant new head' Pupils were given a set of coded warnings and consequences, so they had to make a choice between meeting standards or ‘sit a detention’. Mr Sherrington said: ‘After 15 weeks, the impact has been clear. Uniform standards and punctuality improved dramatically almost overnight: Students run into school now instead of dawdling and 99 per cent have perfect uniform. Teachers are extremely positive too.’ He admitted the early weeks were ‘tough’, with parents complaining about the detentions. Some critics said it was ‘draconian’ for pupils to sit in silence for an hour. But others urged him not to change the strategy. In January Tatler said the school was ‘transformed’ with a ‘brilliant new head’ who was keen on ‘impeccable behaviour’ and ‘details’ including top buttons being done up at all times. This is in stark contrast to the school’s low point in 2005 when Channel 4’s Dispatches sent an undercover teacher who filmed pupils clambering across desks, throwing books across the room and attacking each other.","Tom Sherrington joined Highbury Grove School back in September .

"Labour's strategy to cast Ed Miliband as an ordinary family man escalated tonight as his wife Justine gave her first major TV interview ahead of the general election. In a surprise move, she has spoken of her husband's regret at not seeing enough of their sons and the pressure of political attacks on their family life. The child actress-turned-barrister is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day, but it is likely to draw comparisons with failed attempts by Gordon Brown and Iain Duncan Smith to use their other halves to bolster their poll ratings. Justine Miliband has spoken of her husband's regret at not seeing enough of their sons Daniel (right) and Sam (left) and the pressure of political attacks on their family life . At the weekend Mr Miliband spoke of the strains his political role puts on family life, claiming missing his wife and sons Daniel and Same is the 'hardest thing' about his job. Now Mrs Miliband has entered the fray in what will be seen as an attempt to humanise a politician often mocked for appearing wonkish. In a rare interview with  BBC News, she repeated the line that her husband's regret about the job of leading Labour is 'not seeing the children enough or worrying he doesn't see the children as much as he'd like'. Asked about dealing with the attacks on her husband she added: 'I think it's going to get worse, I think over the next couple of months it's going to get really vicious, really personal, but I'm totally up for this fight.' She stressed that she was going public now 'because I think this goes way beyond Ed as an individual, I think it's about whether decencies and principle count for something in political life'. Mrs Miliband admitted she had not yet started thinking about how her life will change if her husband becomes Prime Minister in two months' time. 'I haven't thought about the future particularly,' she said. 'Probably like most women, being a working mother and having a husband who's Ed, I'm definitely on a 48-hour timetable, so I haven't really thought about it.' Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day . Mrs Miliband said her husband showed he had 'guts' when he decided to take on Rupert Murdoch and News International over phone-hacking in 2011, though she admitted she was 'nervy' about it at the time. Asked if she ever advised Mr Miliband on policy, she said: 'We are married, so we talk about things that happen to crop up. 'One of the clearest examples that has stayed with me is when we were going to work one morning in the car and the radio came on with the news and the news had just broken about phone hacking and about how low some journalists had gone in pursuit of the news. Mrs Miliband said she was speaking out to show that she was 'more than a dress', a reference to her appearances on stage at party conferences . 'We just were totally shocked - that immediate human reaction - and sickened actually. We talked about it and quite quickly, for someone like Ed, it becomes a question not just of that immediate reaction but . 'What am I going to do about this?' 'We talked briefly. It was back in 2011 and you didn't take on News International in 2011, so it felt pretty serious. I remember being on the Tube on the way home and I had a copy of the Evening Standard and my eyes caught the headline, which was something like 'Miliband calls on Murdoch to resign'. 'I remember thinking 'He has gone ahead and done that' and that felt pretty nervy and I remember not being quite sure how it would all play out, but I thought 'You have shown you have got the guts to do things that people wouldn't expect'.' A new opinion poll today suggested more voters think that their families and Britain as a whole will be better-off with David Cameron as prime minister than with Mr Miliband in charge. The YouGov poll for the Westminster Policy Institute found that 26 per cent of people believed Britain as a while would be better off with Mr Miliband as prime minister, compared to 39 per cent for Mr Cameron. When the same question was asked about their families' position, some 35 per cent thought they would be better off with Mr Cameron in charge, compared to 26 per cent for Mr Miliband. In the new focus on life at their family home in north London, Mrs Miliband lifted the lid on how their sons cope with seeing their father in the spotlight. 'There's quite a lot of chats about what the red team's doing and who the red team's helping,' she said. Mr Miliband repeatedly said he would not copy David Cameron's habit of eye-catching photo opportunities while opposition leader, and would instead focus on policies. But Labour strategists plan to use his wife more in the run up to the election, in addition to appearances at party conferences. She added: 'The only reason I first gave a speech to Labour Party members at Labour Party conference was because I was so worried that by about three years in all they knew about me was a dress I wore to Ed's speech and I thought I really want to reassure people that I am in fact more than a dress.' As a teenager, she carved out a career as an actor, starring in the ITV series Dramarama, which ran from 1983 and helped launch the careers of talent including writer Kay Mellor and actor David Tennant. She also appeared in 1987 school-based sitcom Hardwicke House, which was axed after just two episodes after being mauled by critics.","Barrister expected to make a series of appearances in run-up to polling day .

"A mother was left with a paralysed face and in agonising pain after being bitten by a  tick in her own back garden. Claire Dean, 43, noticed an insect bite on her hip while gardening in September last year, but thought nothing of it. A few days later she began suffering mysterious flu-like symptoms, and  soon found herself in crippling pain. A few days later she woke up with numb cheeks and noticed her face was paralysed - to the point where she looked unrecognisable  in the mirror. She was in such agony she had to quit her job as a cleaner and  was hospitalised for two weeks. Claire Dean, 43, was left with a paralysed face and in agonising pain after being bitten by a tick while gardening in September last year. She is pictured with daughter Alexandra, 21 . Ms Dean remembers being bitten on her hip but thought nothing of it. Days later, she suffered flu-like symptoms which became worse until she was in agony . After carrying out tests, doctors discovered the mother-of-two had developed Lyme disease, a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. She was prescribed antibiotics and underwent months of physiotherapy to help strengthen the muscles in her face - and is now telling her story to warn others of the dangers of tick bites. On the day she was bitten she had been wearing jeans and a baggy jumper, which she believes the tick must have become caught in. Ms Dean, from Castle Douglas, Scotland, said: 'I was in agony. The bites themselves weren't itchy or painful, so I didn't think they were the cause at first. 'I'm quite an active person and just put the aches and sharp pains down to my body being worn out.' She began suffering flu like symptoms and went to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, when the pain in her hip and back became so severe she could hardly move. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. It is is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the UK, Europe and North America. Public Health England estimates there are 2,000 to 3,000 cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year, and that about 15 per cent of cases occur while people are abroad. Ticks are tiny arachnids found in woodland areas that feed on the blood of mammals, including humans. Tick bites often go unnoticed and the tick can remain feeding for several days before dropping off. The longer the tick is in place, the higher the risk of it passing on the infection. Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but areas known to have a particularly high population of ticks include Exmoor, the New Forest in Hampshire, the South Downs and parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire. They are also found in parts of Surrey and West Sussex, Thetford Forest in Norfolk, the Lake District, the North York Moors and the Scottish Highlands. Lyme disease can cause problems with a person's skin, joints, heart and nervous system. It is treated with antibiotics. Source: NHS Choices . She was treated for pressure sores with codeine and paracetemol, before being sent home with crutches. The pain became increasingly worse, but she didn't want to burden her family and so tried not to complain. She said: 'I tried to hide the pain from my kids as I didn't want to worry them, but it was getting harder to put on a brave face' 'I had to quit my job as a cleaner as I just couldn't work, I was in that much pain. 'It got so bad, my daughter called an out-of-hours doctor who visited me and gave me a morphine injection for the pain.' Just days later, Ms Dean woke to find she'd lost feeling in both of her cheeks. She could barely open her mouth to speak and found smiling or wrinkling her nose impossible. Her GP performed a series of reflex test and diagnosed Bell's Palsy – a rare condition that causes temporary weakness of the facial muscles. There is no known cure for the condition, although most people notice an improvement in their symptoms after a few weeks. But six months on, Ms Dean's face was showing few signs of improvement. 'I was horrified that my face was paralysed, but even more so when my doctor told me that there's no cure,' Ms Dean said. 'I was told I could be paralysed for weeks, or even months. Only time would tell.' Ms Dean, who is a single mother to Alexandra, 21, and Carl, 12, was referred to hospital. She underwent blood tests and a lumbar punctures, which is where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord or other parts of the nervous system. It was then revealed Ms Dean had been suffering from Lyme Disease - a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. When doctors gave the diagnosis, she suddenly remembered she had been bitten while gardening. Ms Dean, pictured before her face became paralysed, woke up one day with numb cheeks and no movement in her face. it was then she was diagnosed with Lyme disease . She said: 'It was only then that I remembered the bites on my hip. I showed them to the doctors and they confirmed they were tick bites. 'Bell's Palsy can be caused by a viral infection, so suddenly all of the symptoms I'd been suffering made sense.' Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the UK, Europe and North America. The ticks, which flourish in long grass or undergrowth, typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes, badgers, mice, birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans. Indeed, areas of undergrowth (and that includes parks and gardens as well as woodland and open country) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife. Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but there are certain areas which are know to be tick hotspots. These include Exmoor, the New Forest in Hampshire, the South Downs and parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire. Six months on, Ms Dean is starting to see some improvements, although she is still in pain . They are also found in parts of Surrey and West Sussex, Thetford Forest in Norfolk, the Lake District, the North York Moors and the Scottish Highlands. If left untreated, Lyme disease can spread causing arthritis, heart problems, muscle pain and neurological symptoms such as paralysis. Fortunately, Ms Dean was treated with antibiotics and spent the next two weeks in hospital recovering. But even after fighting the disease, her face still remains paralysed. She said: 'It was awful. I was finally feeling better after getting over the Lyme disease, but my face was still such a mess. I couldn't even bring myself to look in the mirror. 'Whenever I caught my reflection, it was like a stranger looking back at me. I had no facial expression. 'I suffered for months, until I finally started receiving physiotherapy to help speed up my recovery. 'I'm still not 100 per cent, but I'm getting there now. My face muscles are getting stronger and I'm slowly beginning to move them again. 'It's hard to believe that a few little tick bites caused so many problems. 'I hope my story encourages people to take more care in their back gardens. Who knows what's lurking in your flower bed.'","Claire Dean, 43, was bitten while gardening in September last year .

"Parents who ‘overvalue’ their children risk creating arrogant, narcissistic adults, according to scientists . They may be your pride and joy – but telling your child they are special gives them an inflated view of themselves. And parents who ‘overvalue’ their children risk creating arrogant, narcissistic adults, according to scientists. A psychological study found that instead of telling children they are better than others, parents should tell them they are as good as anyone else. The research, which tracked participants for 18 months, suggests there is a fine line between self-esteem and narcissism. Children who are repeatedly told they are special go on to have an inflated view of themselves, whereas those who are simply told they are loved tend to be confident and well-rounded. The difference is a child who thinks they are as good as others – and one who thinks they are better than others and entitled to special treatment. However, narcissistic children still have lower self-esteem than their more modest playmates. The study of 565 Dutch children aged seven to 11 was carried out in a joint project by the University of Amsterdam and Ohio State University. Interviewed four times, parents were asked about their relationship and conversations with their child, and the child was asked how they viewed themselves and others. Lead researcher Dr Eddie Brummelman, from the University of Amsterdam, said: ‘Rather than raising self-esteem, overvaluing practices may inadvertently raise levels of narcissism.’ Professor Brad Bushman of Ohio State University added: ‘Children believe it when their parents tell them that they are more special than others. That may not be good for them or for society. People with high self-esteem think they’re as good as others, whereas narcissists think they’re better than others.’ The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that children who were repeatedly told they were special tended to think less of others – but did not necessarily have higher self-esteem. In contrast, children whose parents showed them more emotional warmth had higher levels of self-esteem. Professor Bushman said: ‘Overvaluation predicted narcissism, not self-esteem, whereas warmth predicted self-esteem, not narcissism.’ The research, which tracked participants for 18 months, suggests there is a fine line between self-esteem and narcissism . The psychologist, a father of three, said his research had changed his own parenting style. ‘When I first started doing this research in the 1990s, I used to think my children should be treated like they were extra-special,’ he said. ‘I’m careful not to do that now. ‘It is important to express warmth to your children because that may promote self-esteem, but overvaluing them may promote higher narcissism.’ Dr Brummelman suggested that parents could be taught to express affection without telling their children they are superior to others. ‘Future studies should test whether this can work,’ he said.","Parents who ‘overvalue’ children risk creating arrogant, narcissistic adults .

"Over the past two years, the duo – real names Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly – have starred in a series of Morrisons campaigns . They're the nation’s favourite hosts of Saturday night TV, but cheeky chappies Ant and Dec will no longer be the face of struggling supermarket chain Morrisons, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Over the past two years, the duo – real names Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly – have starred in a series of Morrisons campaigns. But now they and the retailer have parted company, ripping up their multi-million advertising deal. And last night there was mystery over who exactly had ended the relationship. Sources close to Ant and Dec said they had been offered another 12-month contract but turned it down. However, business insiders told The Mail on Sunday that Morrisons would not renew the deal because it wants future advertising to emphasise its value credentials and the quality of its food, which the duo no longer represent. Analyst Bryan Roberts, of market research firm Kantar Retail, said: ‘In marketing terms, this is absolutely the right thing to do. 'People turn on the television and see two incredibly wealthy lads being well paid to advertise a supermarket which is supposed to be helping us save money. ‘People are far more savvy these days and they can make that connection.’ Scroll down for video . Morrisons reported profits down by 52 per cent to £345 million last week – its worst results in eight years. And chairman Andy Higginson said it had slashed the value of its property portfolio by £1.3 billion. Both Morrisons and Ant and Dec declined to comment on the decision.

"A kind-hearted 12-year-old boy turned down a £20 reward for returning a lost mobile phone and instead told the owner to do 'something nice for someone else'. Josh Brown found an iPhone4 on a train seat and answered a call from the owner's mother after getting off at Birmingham on February 21. He told Michelle Hickinbottom, 36, that he would leave her 16-year-old daughter Shaunnah's phone at the ticket office at Selly Oak train station on his way home to Alvechurch, Worcestershire. Josh Brown (left) turned down a £20 reward after he found Shaunnah Hickinbottom's iPhone4 (right) on a train . Ms Hickinbottom had offered Josh a £20 reward to express her gratitude that she would have posted to him if he left his home address. Later that day, she went to the train station and was given a handwritten note from Josh as well as the phone, which had cost £250. And she was stunned to see that instead of his address, Josh had left her a lovely message, which said: 'Don't worry about the money, just do something nice for someone else.' Ms Hickinbottom, from West Heath in Birmingham, decided to start a social media campaign to track down the youngster. And after her posts were shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter, Josh's mother Angela Brown came forward on Friday. She said Josh, who attends Alvechurch CofE Middle School, is 'overwhelmed' by the response. Ms Hickinbottom said: 'I just wanted to find him as I thought it was a lovely thing to do. I said to him on the phone at the time it was really appreciated and to leave his address so I could send him £20 to thank him really. Michelle Hickinbottom had offered to post Josh £20 to thank him if he left his address, but was stunned to find a heartwarming note, which said 'just do something nice for someone else' from him instead . 'I was choked when I saw the letter. I was really overwhelmed. He will go far in life with an attitude like that. He seems a great lad.' She added: 'We are really grateful because my daughter has got a lot of photos on there she wants to keep. 'It is more sentimental and personal than anything else. 'I think he knows how appreciated he is and hopefully other people will be inspired by this.' Mrs Brown said: 'We can't believe all the lovely comments that people have taken the time to post on Facebook and Twitter, Josh is so pleased. Michelle Hickinbottom (pictured with daughter Shaunnah) said she was 'choked' when she read the letter . 'We are still overwhelmed by the lovely posts and the attention it has attracted. 'We are very proud of him. But he just did the right thing. It was the only bit of paper I had in my handbag. It was the back of an envelope. 'It was all Josh's idea. He said he wasn't going to take any money off her and he'd just ask her to do something nice for someone else in future.' Josh said: 'I was going to Birmingham to see the canals being drained when I spotted this phone on the seat. 'Not long after a lady phoned it and said it was hers. I told her I was coming back through Selly Oak and I would leave the phone there for her. 'She was very grateful and said for me to leave a note with my address on and she would send me £20 as a thank you.

"A Romanian school has come under fire for hosting a play in which children as young as 10  pretend to have their heads chopped off by a masked executioner. The event at the Holy Martyrs Brancoveni school, an Orthodox Christian school in the city of Constanta, south-east Romania is part of an annual festival. Organisers say the play was meant to be a portrayal of the execution of Constantin Brancoveanu, a king of Wallachia, and his five sons, in 1714. But a short film showing five children, all under 10, leaning over a block while an older child pretends to chop off their heads was recently posted online -  and quickly faced a raft of criticism in the wake of the public executions by ISIS. A Romanian school has come under fire for putting on a play in which young children were told to say their prayers and then pretend to have their heads chopped off by a masked executioner . A short film showing five children all aged under 10 lent over a block while an older child pretends to chop off their heads was recently posted online . Organisers say the play was meant to be a portrayal of the execution of Constantin Brancoveanu, a king of Wallachia, and his five sons, in 1714 . In the video the hooded executioner carries a plastic axe and decapitates the children one at a time. Then at the very end the child playing the King in the play is executed after seeing all of his children killed. The short clip concludes with parents and children in the audience applauding the child actors. It quickly attracted criticism from education officials although the school, parents and a priest who was involved in creating the play defended the decision. The Association of the Pupils of Constanta publicly criticised the move saying that the drama was inappropriate for the children. In a statement it said: 'A very worrying fact about this whole affair is that people who played Constantin Branconveanu and his sons were young children, students younger than 10. They were exposed and subjected to simulated scenes of violence, which can seriously affect their psycho-social development and can induce violent attitudes. In the video the black scarf wearing executioner carrying a plastic axe decapitates the children one at a time, and at the very end the child playing the King in the play is executed after seeing all of his children killed . The short clip concludes with parents and children in the audience applauding the child actors . 'We believe that the event may have negative effects on children, as they could perceive in a wrong way a very sensible historical act.' The organisers of the event said that the clip been taken out of context and it was part of a festival that they organised every year. The board of Brancoveanu College, a private educational institution, said that everything happened with parental consent and that there were no complaints about the sketch, whose purpose was just 'to teach children a little history'. One of the teachers who organised the show, who is also a priest, Adrian Chiaga, said: 'The whole sketch was put on because we want our children to learn about this very important moment of our national history. What was filmed and released on social media sites was taken out of the context of a bigger festival, which was very educational. 'The parents thought the same way and they fully supports us. As well as the kids, who understood the meaning of what we were doing and were not emotionally affected. 'What really affected them was the press reaction, because they worked very hard to play their parts, and they are upset about the way their efforts were presented.'","Play was meant to portray execution of King Constantin Brancoveanu .

"A homeowner checking his house after tenants moved out found the property had been rigged with explosives set to detonate with the flip of a light switch. Lendel Williams was inspecting the house in Milton, Massachusetts on Tuesday as he prepared to sell the home when his electrician came across the suspicious device in a bedroom closet. They called police and it was successfully deactivated a few hours later. 'I am angry,' Lendel told reporters outside the home on Tuesday night. 'I just can't believe people can really do that to be quite frank with you.' Scroll down for video . Danger: This owner of this home in Milton, Massachusetts found it had been rigged with explosives . Safe: The homeowner called police who arrived at the home on Tuesday and deactivated the device . Investigation: Hours later they declared the home safe and removed items from the property . The electrician found the explosive device behind a recently plastered section of wall in a bedroom closet, CBS Boston reported. The mechanism involved a gallon of a flammable substance with wires snaking out of it and around the house. The end of the wire led to a light switch. 'We believe the intention was that if someone flipped the light switch on where it ended, the device would have exploded,' Milton Police Chief Richard Wells said. 'It took some work to put it in there.' Authorities said the intricate system could have caused 'significant destruction' if it had been set off and could have even resulted in a loss of life. Police have not yet named any suspects and said they are considering anyone with access to the house as a person of interest in the case, WCVB reported. Shock: Homeowner Lendel Williams, pictured, said he could not believe that someone had set up the device, which his electrician found behind a recently-plastered wall during an inspection on Tuesday . Scene: Police and members of the bomb squad swarm the street outside the home on Tuesday . But Williams said he believes his former tenants could be responsible and the Boston and Milton police departments are looking for them. Last week, police were called to the home for an act of vandalism after Williams found cement had been poured down the drain. On Sunday, a few days after the complaint was filed, the former tenants, a man, his wife and their daughter, moved out. They had lived at the property since June. Police were called to the home on Craig Street and several hours later, a bomb squad rendered the device safe. Officers were seen removing brown bags from the house.

"An Indian nun who was gang-raped at a convent is praying for the attackers to be forgiven just 36 hours after the ordeal. The 71-year-old was trying to prevent six men from assaulting another woman and robbing the Christian missionary school on Friday night when she was locked in a room and raped. CCTV was released for the first time yesterday showing the suspects leaving the staff room at the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal. A reward of 100,000 rupees (£1,075) is on offer for any leads, police said. But the victim is said to be more concerned that the men are forgiven and the students are safe. Scroll down for video . Caught: Three men suspected of gang-raping an elderly Indian nun at the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal were pictured for the first time yesterday. The victim is said to be more concerned the men are forgiven and the students are safe . One mother, who went to visit the nun at her hospital in Ranaghat, said: 'That's the greatness of a spiritual soul like her. 'All of us want the miscreants behind such a heinous crime to be arrested and given exemplary punishment.' Atindranath Mondal, hospital superintendent, added that the nun was brought to the hospital around 7am on Saturday. 'Immediately a team of doctors attended to her and a senior gynaecologist operated on her,' he told The Times of India. Arnab Ghosh, a police superintendent, said five men had been detained for questioning. He added: 'CCTV footage showed that six men, aged between 20 and 30, scaled the boundary wall around 11.40pm and entered the school and disconnected the telephone lines.' The robbers then tied up and gagged a security guard before entering the nuns' room, where they found the women sleeping, police said. When the victim, who is the oldest nun at the school, tried to stop them taking another woman into a separate room they raped her. Suspects: The CCTV footage has  been released showing the suspects leaving the school's staff room around midnight on Friday. Five other men have been detained for questioning . Demonstrations: Prayers were said at churches across India yesterday for the victim. Hundreds of people staged a demonstration in Ranaghat, where the nun is being treated in hospital, to demand justice . Outrage: The robbers  tied up and gagged a security guard before entering the nuns' room. Furious residents and students took to the streets after the attack to demand justice . Sorrow: Nuns gather in front of the convent. Archbishop Thomas D'Souza said the sisters prayed for the victim during Sunday Mass . The men escaped with some cash, a mobile phone, a laptop and a camera. They also ransacked the school's chapel and took holy items. Footage shows books and papers strewn across the floor as the men leave the staff room. One sister, who flew in from Rome after the incident, said she had never heard of such an attack on a nun, even in conflict zones. Mr Ghosh added: 'At least two of them were armed and the rest were carrying burglary tools. In the chapel, a holy scripture was found torn and a bust of Jesus was broken.' Furious  residents took to the streets yesterday, shouting slogans demanding action and blocking off the main highway. Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Chief Minister, also tweeted her condemnation of what she called a 'horrific attack' promising 'swift, strong action'. Solidarity: The nun is recovering in hospital in Ranaghat. Meanwhile hundreds of people, including schoolchildren, blocked off the main highway holding signs and candles . Defiant: The demonstrations highlighted the strength of public anger at the rape, which came at a time of great tension over the sexual abuse of women in India . Prayers: Crowds of students lit dozens of candles at the peaceful protest yesterday . Strength in numbers: Students from the convent, dressed in a smart red and white uniform, held a candle-lit vigil for the injured nun . Archbishop Thomas D'Souza has appealed to people to maintain peace and harmony in the area. He said: 'In our Sunday Mass, we prayed for the sister to recover quickly from trauma, fear and her physical injuries. We will pray for her again this evening. 'They not only committed a heinous crime, but they also vandalized the chapel. This is the first time such an attack has happened in India.' Bewildered: Indian nuns, who normally lead relatively reclusive lives, suddenly found themselves at the centre of an unfolding story of national importance . Scene of the crime: Police stand guard outside the convent school at Ranaghat,  north of Calcutta, while the search for evidence continues . The incident comes at a time of heightened sensitivity over women's safety in India, which last week saw  a documentary about the 2012 gang-rape of a student in Delhi being banned. Authorities said screening the documentary could have caused public disorder, but critics accused the government of being more concerned with the country's reputation than the safety of its women. Shocking footage also emerged this week of an angry mob stripping and slowly beating a man to death in an Indian village after he was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. The prolonged attack on the 18-year-old was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd.","Nun was also trying to prevent gang from robbing the convent .

"Roland Sturm (above), a senior economist at RAND Corporation, said the much-hailed Los Angeles fast-food ban did little to reshape the retail food landscape in the targeted area . The  South Los Angeles fast-food ban did not  decrease obesity in poor neighborhoods because residents found unhealthy food at restaurants in strip malls and convenience stores instead, a new study has found. In 2008, a dietary ordinance targeted a 32-square-mile area south of Interstate 10 that struggles with high obesity rates and other health problems. The ban went into effect in South Los Angeles and restricted the opening or expansion of standalone fast-food restaurants. However, the law, believed to be the first effort of its kind by a major city to improve public health, did not ban new fast food restaurants in strip malls. This made it possible for unhealthy food to continue making its way into the low-income neighborhoods. Roland Sturm, a senior economist at RAND Corporation and lead author of the study, said findings should not come as a surprise, as most food outlets in the area are small food stores or restaurants that have limited seating and were not affected by the policy. In the study, which was published in the Social Science and Medicine journal, Sturm found that in the targeted area, free-standing  restaurants were rare to begin with and no new ones have opened since the ordinance took effect. These standalone fast-food restaurants are outnumbered by restaurants in strip malls and small food stores, such as  convenience stores, which were not restricted by the ban, according to NPR. Rand researchers reviewed permits issued by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which inspects food outlets. Larger fast-food chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in South Los Angeles from 2008 to 2012. Almost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food. Obesity rates in South Los Angeles grew by 12 per cent despite a much-hailed three-year ban on stand-alone fast-food restaurants, a new study has found . Findings showed that before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008, 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county. But three years on, instead of the law curbing weight gain, the opposite trend took force as obesity rates grew by 12 per cent in South Los Angeles. 'The South Los Angeles fast food ban may have symbolic value, but it has had no measurable impact in improving diets or reducing obesity,' said Sturm. The study also revealed that  obesity rates following the ban have been significantly larger in South Los Angeles compared to other parts of the city. In 2011, 75 per cent of South Los Angeles residents reported being overweight or obese, while rates elsewhere only increased by one per cent. However, a positive development was a drop in soft drink consumption since 2007, which also occurred across the city. 'The one bright spot we found is that soft drink consumption dropped, but the decrease was similar in all areas across Los Angeles,' said co-author of the study, Aiko Hattori of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. 'Unfortunately, the rates of overweight and obesity increased and they increased fastest in the area subject to the fast-food ban.' Before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008, 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county . Standing outside a McDonald's in the Leimert Park neighborhood on Wednesday, Edward Cox lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes - he was not a fan of the fast food ban . Barry Popkin, a professor from University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill said he was not surprised by Sturm's observation and that the ban was 'too trivial'. However, Kelly Brownell, a professor from Duke University said the ban was not a trivial measure, and that setting limits could help prevent problems. He also said he was not surprised the ordinance was not effective. Health experts said a single intervention would not reverse the obesity problem. People also have to exercise and make lifestyle changes, they said. 'It's not just about limiting unhealthy food, but increasing access to healthy food,' Alex Ortega, a professor of public health at the University of California, Los Angeles, who had no role in the study. Researchers compared obesity rates in South Los Angeles and other parts of the county using surveys that asked residents to report their weight and eating habits. Supporters said the ordinance worked because it prevented chains from opening new restaurants at major intersections with their own drive-thru windows and parking lots. They acknowledged it will take some time to see health gains but noted that the area has seen farmers markets and community gardens in recent years. 'We never said this ordinance was the silver bullet' to solving the obesity problem, said Gwen Flynn of the Community Health Councils. 'As long as we can make sure people have more options, that's the important thing.' Maurice Thrower, who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast-food chains, said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers . Sturm has said changing aspects of food environment can impact diets and obesity, particularly when considering food prices. After analyzing data from the U.S. and South Africa, Sturm learned in both cases that when healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables were cheaper, people at them more often as compared with unhealthy foods. City Councilman Bernard Parks, who supported the zoning law, said he was hopeful that the area can attract more markets selling fresh food. The ordinance was opposed by the California Restaurant Association. Spokeswoman Janna Haynes said the group had no comment on the Rand study. Standing outside a McDonald's in the Leimert Park neighborhood on Wednesday, Edward Cox lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes. 'I want to sit down and eat, but there's no place to sit down and eat,' said the retiree, who usually drives to another neighborhood to dine out. Cox said he's hopeful that a planned light rail line will attract a variety of new eateries. Maurice Thrower, who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast-food chains, said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers. 'Once people stop to eat here, they come back,' said Thrower, who opened Simply Delicious Burgers last year.","Study shows law only banned construction and expansion of stand-alone fast-food restaurants, which are rare in the area to begin with .

"Saving the lives of premature babies is not always the most kind course of action, doctors have been told. New guidance says health professionals should carefully consider whether medical intervention is in the baby's best interest, and shouldn't be carried out 'just because the technology is there'. Continuing treatment to keep the baby alive can sometimes actually cause greater suffering, child health doctors said. Doctors should carefully consider whether saving the lives of premature babies is the kindest course of action, new guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) says . The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) today released a new framework, which advises doctors on how to care for children and babies with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions. It asks medics to weight up the benefits of prolonged treatment versus the suffering the young patient might be likely to experience. It says seriously ill children should be given a greater say in whether they want to continue receiving treatment which is keeping them alive. The updated information provides three sets of circumstances for when limiting or withdrawing the treatment of children and babies can be considered. This can be done when life is limited in quality or when life is limited in quantity. Treatment can also be limited or withdrawn when there is 'competent refusal of treatment' - if an older child with extensive experience of illness repeatedly consents to stopping their medical care. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) advises doctors on when to treat children and babies with life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses. It says life-sustaining treatment can be limited or withdrawn when: . For example, a child that has undergone repeated cycles of chemotherapy or had organ transplantation, 'will have more informed views about continuing treatment than an adult facing such treatment for the first time', the document says. But it adds that, equally, children may not have any experience in decision making and it therefore may not be as appropriate for them to be involved. Written by medics, lawyers and ethicists, the framework was published to provide an ethical and legal framework for doctors. Since the last version was published 10 years ago, major breakthroughs in medical science have led to better survival rates for seriously sick babies and children. Babies born at 22 or 23 weeks are now surviving. But child health experts said that just because the technology is there, it does not mean it is necessarily in the child or baby's best interests to use it if their circumstances fall under any of the categories set out. Dr Simon Newell, a consultant neonatologist and vice president of the RCPCH, said the document sets out a 'better and more family-friendly process'. 'For some, continuing life-sustaining treatment is simply prolonging suffering in the face of the inevitable,' he said. Seriously ill children should be given a greater say in whether they want to continue treatment that is keeping them alive, the guidance adds (file photo) 'In these cases, an active decision is reached among the clinicians, parents and other parties to discontinue treatment rather than cause greater suffering for the child by keeping them alive.' The better informed the family or the patient themselves is, the better, he said, and more children and babies are receiving palliative care in hospices or at home rather than dying in hospital. Dr Joe Brierley, consultant in paediatric and neonatal intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and chairman of the Ethics and Law Advisory Committee at the RCPCH, said: 'This is a sensitive and challenging area of medicine. 'The guiding principle remains to act in the best interest of the child, actively involving them in the decision making where possible, and of course considering the interests of the families and their rights. 'Decisions to limit treatments should be made by clinical teams in partnership with, and with the agreement of, the parents and child.'","New guidance is from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health .

"Why is the sun’s corona - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - so much hotter than its surface? That is one of greatest solar mysteries, but astronomers will be hoping to find an answer on Friday - by observing the total solar eclipse from the North Pole. The plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse, so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena. And in an amazing coincidence, the eclipse will occur over the North Pole on the same day the sun comes into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years. Scroll down for video . A team of scientists is travelling to Svalbard to observe the solar eclipse. They will use an array of instruments to look at the sun's corona . This is plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse. Shown is an image of 1999's solar elcipse from France, with the corona visible around the edges . The team of scientists will be working at an old observatory on Svalbard, midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. They are travelling to this region to ensure they see totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse. For observers in other regions, such as the UK, less than 90 per cent of the sun will be covered. The team at Svalbard, led by Professor Shadia Habbal, Professor of Solar Physics at the University of Hawaii, will include scientists from Aberystwyth University in Wales. They are Joe Hutton and Nathalia Alzate from the Solar System Physics Group at the Department of Physics at Aberystwyth University. They will join scientists from the US, Czech Republic and Germany as part of the 'Solar Wind Sherpas'. Up to 14 specially adapted cameras will be used to photograph the sun in different frequencies during the eclipse, capturing images of the plasma from the corona. In so doing, they will hope to solve the sun’s greatest mystery. The temperature of the sun is known to be around 6,000°C (10,800°F), but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000°C (1,800,000°F), and even reaches 2,000,000°C (3,600,000°F) in some areas. This factor of 300 difference would be akin to the flame of a fire being 300 times colder than the air around it - but why this is occurring is unknown. One potential reason could be magnetic forces on the sun, with superheated gas creating a strong magnetic field and funnelling energy into the corona, but this has not yet been confirmed. The team of scientists will be working at an old observatory on Svalbard, midway between continental Norway and the North Pole (shown with the red marker). They are travelling to this region to ensure they see totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse . Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine . Do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse? 'It’s all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening, but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes, binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight. 'That’s not to say that you can’t watch the eclipse on Friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection. 'Dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk. However, unless you already own one, know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy, they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds. 'There are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse, though.' Are solar glasses fine to use? 'Many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse. These can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers. 'They work by employing a Mylar film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun’s light, allowing you to view the eclipse safely. 'Before using them though, you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer. If you’re in doubt, don’t use your viewers at all.' How can you use a telescope to observe the eclipse? 'If you own a telescope, then there are several ways for you to observe the eclipse. 'If you don’t own them already, it is possible for you to buy a solar filter, which covers the aperture of your telescope to ensure that you can observe the sun safely. 'They are found to be made of glass or as with the solar glasses, Mylar film. It is possible to make a solar filter using Mylar sheets but caution is advised while making your own solar filter - any scratches or pinholes will lead to dangerous amount of sunlight entering your eyes. 'You should also avoid relying on eyepiece filters - they cannot handle the sun’s light. 'Telescope projection is also a safe way to observe the eclipse. By using two large, white pieces of card, you can project the eclipse’s image onto one piece, while using the other to fit around your telescope’s tube to act as a mask to shield your eyes from the sun. 'Focusing your telescope’s eyepiece, while holding the second card away, which projects the image, will enable you to show the eclipse to a large group of people safely. 'You should not use a cheap, plastic telescope for telescope projection and ensure that your finderscope has its cap on. 'Never look at the eclipse whilst lining up your telescope with the sun and never leave your telescope unattended. You should also ensure that your instrument doesn’t overheat.' Can you use household items to view the eclipse? 'If you don’t have a standard telescope or have forgotten to buy a solar viewer, then there are several household items you can use so that you don’t miss out on seeing this fantastic event. 'Using a piece of card, or anything that has small holes punched into it, you can project the eclipse onto another piece of card. This is certainly one of the safest ways of viewing the eclipse since you don’t need to look at the sun at all. 'A washing up bowl or bucket can also be lined with a black bin liner and then filled with water to make a reflective surface to safely watch the eclipse. When and where will the eclipse be visible? 'The eclipse will begin in the morning. For observers in the UK, the eclipse starts at 8.30am, peaks at 9.35 am and ends at 10.41am, so you should make sure that you know where the Sun rises from your location. 'The total solar eclipse - that’s 100 per cent of the Sun’s surface covered by the Moon - is visible from the Faroe Islands and Svalbard but if you are unable to get to these locations, many are able to see a substantial partial eclipse - for instance, Scotland will see around 90 per cent of the Sun’s disc covered by the moon.' How dark will it get in the UK? 'In London and even in places where there's 90 per cent sun coverage, we're not really going to notice any changes in brightness because there's still a portion of the sun's surface uncovered. 'It'll be like there's a cloud passing over the Sun - you know it's cloudy but it's still light.' Observations will take place from the Kjell Henriksen Observatory Longyearbyen in Svalbard, pictured. In an amazing coincidence, the eclipse will occur over the North Pole on the same day the sun comes into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years. Data and images taken during the eclipse will be used to try and develop a mathematical model to understand this difference in temperature. 'The difference between the temperature of the sun and that of the sun’s corona is one of the great mysteries of astronomy,’ said Dr Huw Morgan, a Reader at the Solar System Physics Group at Aberystwyth University, who is overseeing the team’s work from the UK. ‘A total eclipse gives us an unique opportunity to measure the corona of the sun is so much detail and collect data that will enable us to better understand this difference.' The temperature of the sun's surface (shown ion this Nasa image) is known to be around 6,000°C (10,800°F), but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000°C (1,800,000°F), and even reaches 2,000,000°C (3,600,000°F) in some areas, a factor of about 300 . He also added that studying the corona could help protect satellite-based communication systems from solar storms, which can be affected by coronal mass ejections - huge eruptions of material - from the sun. But he noted that the conditions were 'cold' - and also potentially dangerous. ‘All the team have had to do safety training, including polar bear training,’ Dr Morgan told The Guardian. ‘They will have a guard with a rifle. I hope they come back in one piece.’","A team of scientists is travelling to Svalbard to observe the solar eclipse .

"Karen Danczuk jetted out of the UK today after it emerged the brother she accuses of sexually abusing her is being questioned over separate allegations. Mrs Danczuk - the wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk - looked tired as she entered Manchester Airport this morning to fly overseas. She left the UK after it emerged her brother, who she has accused of abusing her when she was still a schoolgirl, has been re-arrested over further sex abuse claims by two other women. Karen Danczuk walks into Manchester Airport this morning as she heads off on a break with a friend . Mrs Danczuk flew away for a break  three weeks after she first made the allegations public, before making a complaint to the police. A source said: 'Everything had become a bit much for her and she's decided to go away for a few days and just get out of the country.' Last month, Mrs Danczuk – who became well-known for posting revealing 'selfie' pictures of herself on Twitter – claimed she was raped by a family member ‘hundreds of times’ between the ages of six and 12. She did not name her attacker initially, but her brother, Michael Burke, was later arrested. Last week, the 36-year-old vehemently denied the claims, saying: ‘The allegations are false. I’m just so shocked and disgusted by it all.’ Mrs Danczuk, 31, has said she starting posting ‘selfies’ after feeling she can now ‘have fun without being ashamed of myself’. Mrs Danczuk has claimed a member of her family abused her when she was young. Her brother Michael Burke was later arrested but has denied any wrongdoing, saying he is 'shocked and disgusted' by the claims . Her husband Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has been a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said yesterday: ‘A man has been rearrested on suspicion of historic sexual offences. ‘This relates to officers speaking to a woman on February 16, 2015, regarding historic sexual abuse and new information coming to light. He remains in police custody for questioning.’ It is not known when the fresh offences are alleged to have taken place. But Greater Manchester Police were already investigating Mr Burke over claims that he sexually abused his sister between 1989 and 1995.

He said: 'People always say I look like Peter Parker (the high school student behind the mask) when I wear my reading glasses. 'The first time I went out, the people I handed the sandwiches to had a massive smile in their face. 'Passers-by would ask for a photo, when I told them what I was doing, they would say that's really cool. 'People have said they were going to go out with their friends and do the same. People have posted on Twitter, could I go to Coventry and do it?' 'People have asked to contribute to the sandwiches but I've got enough money to do this. I want to see them go out themselves and do it.' The do-gooder, who is single and originally from Water Orton, Warwickshire, added: 'I've had to the classic thing of buying a sandwich usually from Tesco in normal clothes and then go up an alley and change into my Spider-Man outfit. 'It sounds surreal. When I go home, I have to look in the mirror and say ""I'm not Spider-Man"".' The dedicated helper has lived all over Birmingham and has been assisting the homeless and vulnerable since he was 17, when he joined a city centre church group distributing food in the area. He said: 'I noticed we would get a lot of people coming up after we had run out of food. 'I thought why don't we go out a lot later at night because people are still out and asking for spare change - they obviously don't have anywhere to go.' 'At the start of 2014, I used to see people who had almost passed out from the cold and people walking straight past them.
