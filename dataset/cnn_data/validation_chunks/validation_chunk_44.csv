"A cancer nurse at a hospice drowned herself in a hot tub four days before she was due to face disciplinary proceedings, an inquest has heard. Jane Revell, 53, who worked part-time at Katharine House Hospice in Stafford, was found dead in a the jacuzzi in her back garden on December 18 last year. An inquest into her death  heard prior to her death she had been 'upset and worried' about appearing at a hearing to answer questions about the referral of a patient. Cancer nurse Jane Revell, 53, (pictured) drowned herself in a hot tub four days before she was due to face disciplinary proceedings, the inquest into her death heard . Mrs Revell worked part-time at Katharine House Hospice in Stafford, and had been due to  answer questions about the referral of a patient . The allegation was said to be 'of a minor nature' and not one which could lead to her dismissal, the hearing at Cannock Coroner's Court was told. The inquest heard how Mrs Revell's husband Paul, 57, had returned to the couple's £270,000 home in Stafford after work where he found his wife's body in the hot tub. She was fully clothed except for her shoes. Earlier in the day, the mother-of-two and school governor had written a suicide note which she had put in a Christmas card and left in the kitchen. She had also sent a text message to her daughter Hannah, telling her to go to a neighbour's house after school. The inquest heard how Mrs Revell's husband Paul, 57, had returned to the couple's £270,000 home in Stafford after work where he found his wife's body in the hot tub in the back garden . Before her death, Mrs Revell had sent a text to her daughter Hannah telling her to go to a neighbour's house, instead of the family home (pictured) 'When Hannah and the neighbour arrived at the house at around 5pm they found the front door unlocked and Mrs Revell's car in the drive,' Detective Constable Mark Bailey told the hearing. 'Mr Revell arrived home from work soon after and searched the garden before finding his wife's body in the hot tub. 'A farewell message was later found inside a Christmas card in the kitchen.' A post mortem examination revealed that she had drowned, and there was no trace of alcohol or drugs in her body. The inquest heard she was in good health and had no history of mental health problems. South Staffordshire Coroner Andy Haigh concluded Mrs Revell had committed suicide 'while stressed.' He said: 'She was a lady who was committed to her family, her community and her career. 'She did have some recent problems at work. 'These appear to have been of a minor nature, but with the benefit of hindsight they were not minor matters for Jane and are a major reason for her death. 'I fully accept that no-one in the family expected Jane to have done this, and I am very sorry that she should have done.' Speaking after the inquest, Dr Richard Soulsby, chief executive of Katharine House Hospice, paid tribute to Mrs Revell. 'Jane's contribution to the hospice over the last 12 years has been immeasurable and her death has been a huge shock to her friends, colleagues, and patients,' he said. 'She was a vibrant and greatly valued member of our team.'","Jane Revell, 53, found in the back garden of her home in Stafford .

"For some, just the idea of tracking steps and calories is enough to make them exercise - but many of us need much more of an incentive. So designers in Austin have created a concept app that rewards you for working out by turning your heart rate data into virtual currency. The FitCoin technology syncs with fitness trackers to monitor how much energy is being used and this energy is converted into Bitcoins. Scroll down for video .

A Bitcoin is a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation computers can break. Each Bitcoin is a piece of code that has been generated through computer processing, known as 'mining'. Once released it can be traded and used online and can be bought with cash. Bitcoin operates as a two-way currency which can be exchanged for dollars, and vice versa. The finite nature of Bitcoins means it performs more like a commodity, such as gold. Bitcoin first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. It was created by a hacker whose identity is a mystery, but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it. Users choose a virtual wallet  which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. The app only works with fitness trackers that monitor heart rate and have open source software, which includes the Jawbone UP3 and Mio. As the wearer exercises, the fitness tracker sends the heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used. An algorithm then converts this energy into 'computer processing time on a Bitcoin mining rig' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins.

"Jagger, pictured, died the night after winning a silver medal at Crufts following his return to Belgium . The pedigree dog allegedly ‘murdered’ at Crufts was probably poisoned the day after he competed in the show, the vet investigating his death said yesterday. Irish setter Jagger collapsed and died the night after winning a silver medal in his class at the competition following his return to his co-owners’ family home in Belgium. His distraught owners Willem and Aleksandra Lauwers are convinced he was fed beef laced with slow-acting toxins as he sat on the bench awaiting to perform at Crufts as it was the only time he was left unattended. But their family vet Dr Patrick Jans said Jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died. Speaking for the first time about the tragedy, he told the Mail: ‘I doubt that it happened at Crufts. I think it’s unlikely because of the long time delay. ‘I am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case.’ The dramatic new twist came as Crufts organisers the Kennel Club confirmed they are looking into a report that a second dog, an unnamed shih tzu, also died following the event. But they stressed they have received no details about the shih tzu, saying: ‘We cannot look into claims about which we have no direct information, which is why it essential that people come forward with any concerns.’ The Lauwers phoned Dr Jans’ practice at 2am on Saturday morning after Jagger fell ill soon after they had taken him for a walk in the area around their home in the village of Lauw, near Liege. Dr Jans said: ‘There was some suspicious content in the stomach. ‘I would be cautious about suspicion on where the problem was caused. Everything about Crufts is speculation. ‘It could have happened on their way back or even in the hours after they arrived back. ‘They told us that they came back at night and they took the dogs for a walk to do their business. ‘Then a few moments later the problem started. ‘It was a very long time between the show in England and the trip over to here, where nothing wrong was seen with the dog. ‘We feel his death was very acute - it was something that happened quite urgently, quite quickly. ‘I have my doubts about the story from Crufts.’ An autopsy carried out by his colleague Dr Claudia Minsen discovered miniscule black pellets similar to those used by farmers apparently ‘folded’ into pieces of beef in his stomach. Dr Jans said: ‘There were not three different types of poison as some people have speculated - only one. We think it may have been a pesticide. ‘Those kind of products are very common in agriculture and are relatively easy to get hold of.’ Vets believe that Jagger, pictured, was fed beef laced with black pellets before his death . Dr Jans said he had sent samples to the toxology department at the University of Ghent who are expected to report their findings early next week. He said: ‘It depends on the product, but I think when we have an indication of what product it was, then we can see a time scale of when things happened. ‘We informed the police of what we found. ‘They are taking it seriously and have informed the neighbourhood.’ Dr Minsen, who conducted the autopsy on the dog, said: ‘The meat seemed to be beef. There were little black pellets in it. ‘They were really, really tiny and there were a lot of them. They looked like agricultural pellets. ‘They weren’t injected into the meat, they were just folded into it. ‘I do believe it was put in deliberately but it could have been an accident.’ But speaking from her family home yesterday, Mrs Lauwers said: ‘It didn’t happen in Belgium – I am 100 per cent sure it happened in England. ‘We are convinced it happened there. ‘The CCTV from Crufts is being checked by someone we know. ‘I am convinced it didn’t happen here as my dog was 100 per cent attended.’ The revelations came as Jagger was cremated yesterday at a special centre for family pets twenty miles from the family home. The Lauwers brought his ashes home and plan to spread them in the coming weeks in woods near their home where he liked to walk. They also plan to spread some of his ashes in Kilby, Leicestershire where he was born and his British co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott runs a kennel. A further four dogs – two Shetland Sheepdogs, an Afghan and a West Highland Terrier - are also feared to have been poisoned at Crufts. But Kennel Club Secretary Caroline Kisko said: ‘Whilst reports surrounding the welfare of dogs at Crufts are taken with the utmost of seriousness, a number of the reports in the news about dogs becoming sick after leaving the show have been from anonymous sources, who have not reported the allegations to us or the police, and we cannot look into claims about which we have no direct information. ‘We urge these people and anybody else who may have similar concerns to come forward and report them to the Kennel Club.’ Anyone ‘caught attempting to deliberately sabotage another competitor’s performance, particularly if a dog’s welfare is put at risk’ will face severe disciplinary action and could be prosecuted under the Animal Welfare Act, she added. Andreas Schemel, the show's chief vet, said yesterday that it would be difficult to stop a poisoner if they wanted to commit a criminal act. And William Jeffels, another of the vets at the NEC in Birmingham, said dogs which they had treated for gastro-intestinal conditions could have been 'the victims of skullduggery'.","Vets performed a post mortem on Crufts silver medalist Jagger .

"From tiny keyboards that learn your intentions to ones that fold in half to save space, the race is on to modify the humble computer keyboard, which has remained largely unchanged since it was invented. Now Google has been granted a patent that hints that the clunky piece of hardware could one day be replaced with not much at all. It suggests that using audio sensors that plug into a smartphone or tablet, any flat surface could be transformed into a virtual keyboard. Just like magic: Google has been granted a patent (image shown) that suggests that using audio sensors that plug into a smartphone or tablet, any flat surface could be transformed into a virtual keyboard . The design would make it far easier to type on devices with smaller touchscreens, which are currently dominated by pop-up keyboards. The patent suggests that a user would tap on a surface just as if they were typing on a regular keyboard. The audio sensors would decipher vibrations made by tapping to work out which ‘keys’ a user is pressing and the corresponding letters would appear on a screen, like normal, Quartz reported. The patent hints that the Google is one of many thinking about ways to revolutionise large piece of hardware, which have outgrown portable devices such as tablets and phones. A Samsung patent (pictured) shows a system that could turn a user’s hand into a keyboard . Developers have created a keyboard cover that turns every key of the board into one emoji. Once installed, the Caps Lock key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to Facebook posts, tweets and even official documents. Developers have made a keyboard cover that turns every key  into one emoji (shown) The Emoji Keyboard and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at California-based Disk Cactus. Each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust, dirt and liquid. More than 150 emoji are accessible directly from the keyboard but using the Shift, Control, and Option keys gives access to related characters. It is available to pre-order from Kickstarter for just $15 (£10) and, if funded, will ship in April. The design may have a few drawbacks however, as it could make typing tricky for people who can’t touch type and no cushioning when pressing ‘keys’ would mean that the process could become uncomfortable or even painful after a while. While the patent filing doesn’t mean that Google is working on the design, it hints that the firm is one of many thinking about ways to revolutionise the traditionally large piece of hardware, which has outgrown many portable devices such as tablets and phones. A patent filed by Samsung last March showed a wearable system that could turn a user’s hand into a keyboard. In the proposed system, people wearing a camera - on a Google Glass-style device dubbed Galaxy Glass - would be able to look down at their hands, which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard, and use their thumbs to select the keys, negating the need for a physical keyboard. The patent reads: ‘Recently there is much interest in the wearable computers such as glasses-type terminal and wristwatch terminals. ‘Such wearable computers are even more limited in space for mounting an input means such as button type keypad and touchscreen.' The system involves a camera for capturing an image, a storage unit that stores the ‘key to hand mapping table,’ a display and a control unit. Numbers could be assigned to a forefinger, for example, while symbols could be assigned to the middle finger. Alternatively, letters could be plotted at various points across the fingers and palm from top to bottom. Users would then use their thumb to ‘press’ the various keys on both hands. The camera would capture the movement of the thumb, or identify the force pressed onto each finger, to establish which key had been pressed and type the message accordingly.","Patent suggests audio sensors could be plugged into a phone or tablet .

"This is the shocking moment a white van driver rammed another car out of the way so he could park his vehicle in a particular parking space. CCTV footage shows the white van pulling up behind a black Peugeot 207, which is parked on a residential street in Sheerness, Kent, before shunting it forward several yards. The driver then gets out of his vehicle and brazenly walks around the front of his van, between the two vehicles, before disappearing down an alleyway. Scroll down for video . CCTV shows the white van pulling up behind the black Peugeot 207, which is parked  in a residential street in Sheerness, Kent. Dan Lassman, 23, had left his vehicle parked outside his home when the incident occurred . The footage shows the white van striking the Peugeot before pushing it along the road for several yards . Father-of-two Mr Lassman said his car was left on the kerb and with hundreds of pounds worth of damage . Dan Lassman, 23, who owns the Peugeot, said he had parked it outside his home and was perplexed when he went outside and realise it had been moved. He said his car had been shoved onto the kerb and had suffered hundreds of pounds worth of damage. The father-of-two said: 'I had been in that day and I came out at about 5pm to get my son from nursery and I just knew I hadn't parked my car there. 'So I asked my partner if she had driven it and she said no so I went to have a look and there were paint chips and scrapes over the back of the car. Dan Lassman, 23, who owns the Peugeot, said he had parked it outside his home and was perplexed when he went outside and realise it had been moved . 'When it's a fairly newish car, you don't want people damaging it. 'During the day it can be a bit of a free-for-all on the road because you do get a lot of people who park and walk into town rather than pay for a ticket or you get a lot of the staff in town but there's quite a lot of free space.' Mr Lassman, who is training to be a lorry driver, added that there was damage to the boot and rear bumper of his vehicle. After making the discovery, he spoke to his neighbour Dennis Smith who let him access the CCTV footage from the front of his house. Mr Lassman managed to spot the white van bumping his car and reported the incident, which happened just before 2.30pm on Monday, to police. His girlfriend, who does not wish to be named, shares the car with her partner and said they will now have to fork out hundreds of pounds for it to be repainted. The call centre operator said: 'Dan came in and asked me if I'd been driving it because it was hanging off the kerb. 'He thought it was just ""women driving"" but I'd been ill all day and hadn't left the house. 'We saw the damage, the paint had all come away and it's really scratched. 'We're hoping to catch the van driver so we can claim on his insurance or we'll have to pay out hundreds of pounds as we were due to sell it shortly.' A Kent Police spokesman confirmed the incident had been reported to the force. After the incident, the driver parks his van before climbing out of the vehicle and walking behind his vehicle . The driver then appears from the other side of his van before walking between the two vehicles.

"Diarist Anne Frank likely died a month earlier than previously thought meaning there was little chance of her surviving the Holocaust, according to new research. It was previously believed that the Jewish teenager, who was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, died of typhus on 31 March 1945, two weeks before the camp was liberated. However a new study puts the date of her death at some point in mid February, meaning that even if British troops had reached the camp a little sooner, she would likely not have survived. Scroll down for video . Anne Frank (pictured) likely died of typhus inside the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in mid February 1945, a study has shown, not on March 31 as previously thought . Anne's diary, which documents how her family went into hiding from the Nazis in the Netherlands during the Second World War, became a bestseller when it was published after then end of the war. The book documents how Anne, her sister Margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house, but were eventually betrayed and sent to Bergen-Belsen, where she and her sister perished. Anne Frank wrote her diary while in hiding from Nazi persecution during World War II. By 1940 the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped. In 1942 the family went into hiding in secret rooms of Otto Frank's office building. But after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne died of typhus in 1945. Otto Frank, Anne's father, returned to Amsterdam after the war and discovered her diary had been saved. It was published in 1947, leading to her posthumous fame. After the war the Dutch government set the official date of her death as March 31, based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in March. Because the Allies liberated the camp on April 15, this added a bitter twist to her tale - the thought that if she could have hung on a few weeks longer she might have been saved. However, Erika Prins, a researcher at the Anne Frank House museum, has now revised that date having studied witness accounts, archives, and conducted at least one new interview. Ms Prins said she now believes that Anne and her sister began exhibiting symptoms of typhus at the beginning of February. According to Dutch health authorities, most patients do not live for more than 12 days after that. 'In view of this, the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in February. The exact date is unknown,' the study says. Ms Prins added: 'It was horrible. It was terrible. And it still is. But when you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. Bergen-Belsen was liberated in April 1945, meaning if Anne died in March, then she was two weeks from rescue. But this new study shows she was months from safety (Anne pictured left, with father Otto, and right) Anne and her sister Margot died during a typhus epidemic that swept through the Bergen-Belsen camp in 1945, killing an estimated 35,000 people (pictured, typhus patients inside the camp) 'So maybe if they'd lived two more weeks... well, that's not true anymore.' It is unlikely that the exact date of Anne's death will ever be uncovered, as disease was so common in the camps that individuals passing away often went unnoticed. In the words of one witness, Rachel van Amerongen, who knew the Frank sisters and was cited by researchers, 'one day they simply weren't there anymore.' Anne and Margot were just two of an estimated 35,000 deaths at Bergen-Belsen when a typhus epidemic swept through the camp in early 1945.","Anne Frank died from typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp .

"A British man was killed in an avalanche while he was skiing off piste with his older brother who was powerless to help, say police. The  brothers, aged 30 and 31, were descending down the slope of Mount Velan, situated in the canton of Valais in Switzerland, when the younger was caught in a deadly avalanche. He was swept away and buried under the snow at around 3,600 metres, as his brother watched helplessly. A British man is the latest person to have been killed by an avalanche on the Swiss Alps this winter, like the one pictured. The man, who has not yet been named, was skiing off piste with his brother when he was trapped under snow and killed . Three helicopers were scrambled to the rescue on Saturday at 12.20pm, but the 30-year-old, who lived in Switzerland, died on the mountain. The tragic accident happened as the men - who were both strong skiers and well equipped for the expedition - were travelling down the so-called Hannibal Corridor. The victim's brother was unharmed but could see the avalanche sweep his brother away 'clearly', according to a spokesman for the Valais police force. The avalanche risk on Saturday was classed as 'limited', or a two out of a possible five on the European avalanche risk table. In Switzerland most avalanche deaths occur at levels two and three. The police spokesman  said: 'The men were well-equipped and they were good skiers. They were alone, just the two brothers aged 30 and 31 together. A mountain climber reaches the summit of Mount Telliers, with Grad Combin and Mount Velan - the site of the latest death on the Swiss Alps - in the background . 'An avalanche was triggered in the Mont Vélan sector at a place called the Hannibal Corridor. 'The younger brother was swept away. His brother was not taken {by the avalanche}. He saw it clearly. 'Despite the rapid rescue effort, the younger skier died at the scene. 'He was 30 and lived in Switzerland in Canton Vaud. 'Both the men were equipped with avalanche transceivers. 'Three helicopters, a doctor and two guides were involved in the rescue.' The transceivers worn by the men emit a beacon signal, which allows rescuers to search for the exact location of an avalanche victim - even when buried under several feet of snow. The Foreign Office has not released the name of the victim, but a spokesman confirmed they were aware a British citizen had been killed on the slopes. He said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national on March 28 in Switzerland. 'We stand ready to provide consular assistance.' The death of the 30-year-old brings the total number of people killed in avalanches in the Swiss Alps this winter to 28, making it the deadliest winter since the 2010/11 season. Across the Alps more than 100 people have perished in avalanches, and four people have been killed in Alpine avalanches since Friday. The tragic incident took place in the canton of Valais, the same region that is home for the Matterhorn mountain (pictured) On Friday a group of seven skiers were swept away by an avalanche as they descended the Pigne d'Arolla mountain within the Swiss Alps. All except a German man, 60, were able to dig themselves out from under the snow. He was airlifted to hospital but later died of his injuries. Another three members of the group, which was made up of five skiers and two guides, were injured, according to a statement released by Swiss police. Mount Velan, located on the border of Switzerland and Italy, is the highest summit sitting between the Great St Bernard Pass and Grand Combin. General view of the Swiss Alps at night. 28 people have been killed skiing in the Swiss Alps this winter . Heavy snow overnight on Sunday across the Alps has raised the avalanche risk to four out of five. During the coming days, Meteo France is forecasting up to 80cm of fresh snow at altitude in the Northern Alps accompanied by strong winds. The large volume of fresh snow falling after a period of warm weather means the snow is particularly unstable and dangerous for skiiers, say experts.","The 30-year-old died when he was caught in avalanche on Mount Velan .

'We are working with the Virgin Formula E team to develop the plan for next season's cars,' Virgin Group spokesman Nick Fox told Reuters. 'Our aim is to build a leading engine and car for next season. 'Maybe ultimately that could be used in the broader car market in the future.' In addition to Tesla, most of the world's automakers sell or are developing electric cars. The Virgin firm could take on Elon Musk's Tesla electric car firm, according to Branson. There are also signs Apple may be working on an electric car and Google is developing a car that can drive itself. However, broader acceptance of electric cars has been held back by the premium consumers must pay for the technology and fears about the driving range of an all-electric vehicle. Branson told Bloomberg TV, 'Tesla is as sexy as any other car on the road today.'

"In the one and a half years they have been married Andrew and Erica Holloway have never argued, have no secrets and are more in love today than the moment they met. Yet incredibly this Melbourne-based couple, both aged 30, have never consummated their marriage - and Erica admits that she has no intention of ever doing so. For while Andrew would love to rip his wife's clothes off, Erica  is in fact still a virgin and reveals to the Daily Mail Online that the very idea of making love to her husband is a complete turn off rather than a turn on. Unique arrangement: Erica and Andrew Holloway have been married since October 2012 but have never had sex because Erica is 'repulsed' by the idea . 'I wish I wanted to have sex with my husband,' Erica, a graphic designer, explains. 'But I don't and I know I never will as, while I love him, the idea of sex repulses me. 'We are still very affectionate with each other and love to hold hands and kiss and cuddle, but that's as far as I could ever go. 'People might think our marriage would be a disaster because of this, but we are as happy now as the day we met.' Erica has known since the tender age of 15 that she was asexual - after realizing that she had never felt sexually attracted to anyone. And despite trying to force herself to feel some kind of sexual desire towards a few men in her late teens, she admits that she failed to ever feel the kind of connection that so many of her peers seemed to experience . At this point, Erica had almost given up on ever finding love, as, perhaps unsurprisingly, most men she met ran a mile when she told them about her total aversion to sex. 'It was such a frustrating period of my life as I knew I was different, I just didn't know why,' she recalls. 'All my friends were experimenting with boyfriends, yet when I even kissed a boy, it just left me cold. 'I still wanted the companionship you get from a partner, I just didn't want the sex side and I worried I would never ever find anyone who would be prepared to love and accept me the way I am.' But in 2002, Erica's world changed when she met Andrew, while the pair were both living in Melbourne. She admits that she felt as though she had finally met a man who did love her just the way she was. And after first living as housemates, the pair became an official couple in 2009 after Andrew moved to Canada and the duo realized that they couldn't bear to be apart from one another. They were married on October 27th 2012. Happy couple: Erica, pictured with Andrew on their wedding day in 2012, allows her husband to sleep with other women, including professional escorts . True love: Erica and Andrew became a couple in 2009, after seven years of friendship blossomed into something more . 'I was very honest with Andrew and didn't think for a moment we would ever be anything more than friends, ' Erica says. 'But when he emigrated to Canada in 2008, I think we both realized how much we missed each other and have never looked back since. 'We just connect on every level, apart from sexually, and are each others soul mates. Neither of us has ever wanted a family, so that helps too. 'We are the perfect couple, we just don't have sex.' Yet Andrew admits it was not easy to come to terms with sharing his life with a woman who had no desire to share his bed and he even had second thoughts about asking her to be his wife. 'I loved Erica from the moment I met her and back then naively thought I would one day convince her to fancy me,' the IT manager explains. 'But over time while our love has grown, Erica's aversion to sex has not once waivered and it has not been easy for me to deal with. 'She is the one woman I dream of having sex with, yet I know I never will and that has been sad. 'And there was a period when I did question whether if I asked her to marry me it could ever work. 'But every time I thought about ending it, I knew I could not live without her in my life. 'If I didn't love her as much as I do it would never have lasted, but we are still hopelessly in love in spite of our lack of intimacy. 'On our wedding night I longed to make love to her, but I couldn't and that did cause us both pain. 'But over time we have made this situation work as I would rather share my life with Erica with no sex than not at all.' The couple reveal that, in order to make their relationship work, they now have an open marriage, whereby Erica not only turns a blind eye to Andrew having sex with other women, she has also been the driving force behind his flings. And to date he has slept with ten other women. Making it work: Erica insists that she and Andrew have the 'perfect relationship', despite not being sexually intimate with one another . Wedded bliss: The couple, pictured on their wedding day, were determined to make their marriage work, despite Andrew admitting that he found Erica's issues with sex difficult to deal with . 'Just because I don't want sex, I understand Andrew does, so we sought help from a sex counselor who came up with the suggestion he takes lovers and it seemed the perfect solution for us,' Erica says. 'Jealousy is never a factor as I'm just relieved Andrew is having sex; I feel guilty it can't be with me. 'It's not that often, but when he feels the desire, he either calls an escort or maybe a woman who he has met on the Internet and goes to see them. 'I just wave him off and tell him to have a good time and I absolutely mean it. 'We never discuss what he has got up to, but I know by the huge smile on his face when he comes through the door he has had a good time and that makes me happy.' It is an unconventional marital set up that Andrew admits has been harder for him to get used to than Erica. 'When I got married I never once thought I would be cheating on my wife and I still struggle with it as it just seems like a betrayal of our vows,' he explains. 'But over time it is getting easier and it does take the pressure off Erica. 'Of course I would rather be having sex with her, but if I can't then this seems like the best solution as it is the only thing missing in my life and marriage.' Indeed, so comfortable is Erica with Andrew having sex with other women, the she admits she is even trying to find her husband a permanent live-in lover. She explained: 'I think that would be the dream situation, as that way Andrew doesn't even need to leave our home to have sex. 'But finding someone we both like enough to share our home with is no easy task and to date we have been unsuccessful. 'Our dream scenario is to find someone we both really enjoy the company of who would live in our spare room and be an integral part of our family who can also enjoy an intimate relationship with Andrew.' Andrew added: 'We know we don't have a conventional marriage, but Erica and I are 100 per cent happy and it works for us. 'We just feel lucky to have even found each other so if the only thing missing is sex, then I still think we have more than what most people will ever have in their marriage.'","Erica Holloway, 30, has known that she was asexual since the age of 15 .

"British airlines are planning to introduce rules ensuring that two crew members are on the flight deck at all times once an aircraft is airborne. The move was prompted by Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz who commanded the autopilot on his Airbus A-320 to descend from 38,000 feet to just 100 feet while it was approaching the Alps after his captain stepped out to the toilet. The Federal Aviation Authority requires at least two crew members on the flight deck at all times to prevent similar types of disaster. Disaster prevention: Budget airlines EasyJet and Norwegian Air Shuttle will introduce new rules to ensure two crew members are in the cockpit at all times in the wake of the Germanwings air disaster . Tragedy: It emerged today that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people on board . Safety: Now budget carrier EasyJet has announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines . The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has written to all UK operators following Tuesday's tragedy asking them to review their flight deck protocols. Already Monarch, easyJet, Virgin Atlantic and Thomas Cook said they will implement a new two crew rule, while Jet2, Flybe and Irish airline Ryanair said they already had such a system. British Airways said it would not discuss 'issues of security' as a matter of policy. According to Virgin Atlantic: 'We always ensure we have the highest safety standards and, while it is our common practice to have two members of our crew in the flight deck at all times, in light of recent events we are now in the process of formalising this to be policy.' An easyJet spokeswoman said: 'easyJet can confirm that, with effect from Friday 27 March, it will change its procedure which will mean that two crew members will be in the cockpit at all times. 'This decision has been taken in consultation with the Civil Aviation Authority. The safety and security and of its passengers and crew is the airline's highest priority.' The FAA already has rules which require two crew members to remain on the flight deck at all times . EasyJet said a cabin crew member will temporarily enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet. The airline will not have a third trained pilot on board. The change is also being implemented by package tour operator Thomas Cook, whose spokesman said: 'We are adapting our procedures to ensure there will always two people in the cockpit.' An aviation industry insider said: 'There is some industry chatter about the policy becoming mandatory.' Ryanair said: 'If a pilot needs to visit the bathroom the cabin crew supervisor is required to stand in the cockpit for these brief periods.' Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door, EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet . Risk management: Pilot Europe's third largest budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle has also announced the same move for 'safety reasons' Doomed: The captain of the ill-fated flight - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter (file photo) Monarch's spokeswoman added: 'We also have an 'eyes-on' rule requiring cabin crew to enter the cockpit during the cruising stage to check on the pilot and co-pilot.' A Jet2 spokeswoman said: 'This rule has been in place for a number of years to ensure the safety and security of our customers.' While a FlyBe spokespman said their Operations Manual 'states that two members of crew are to be present in the cockpit at all times during flight'. British Airways and BMI Regional declined to comment, while Ryanair were unavailable. Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures. 'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence. As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually. 'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards. 'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.' His parents only discovered that their son was a mass murderer minutes before the dramatic press conference by prosecutors in Marseille. 'Deliberate': Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually . Heart-broken: Family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene in Le Vernet near the French Alps today, as rescuers tried to recover the dead bodies of their deceased relatives . Rescue: Helicopters lowered investigators down to the scene of the obliterated plane where debris and human remains were scattered . Safety procedure: Budget airlines Ryanair, Monarch and Jet said they already had policies to ensure two crew are in the cockpit at all times . 'When one person leaves the cockpit, two people will now have to be there,' Norwegian's flight operations director Thomas Hesthammer said. Long haul flights usually have more than two crew capable of flying the plane because shift changes are often required in flight. A spokeswoman for German carrier Lufthansa, parent company of Germanwings, said: 'A crew member may temporarily leave the cockpit during a specific phase of the flight. 'So far, no decision has been taken to change the procedure as it is already approved by the German office of federal aviation but we will look into it. So far, we trust our procedure. It also transpired today that the Germanwings co-pilot who flew the plane into the Alps at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and 'burnout'. Mr Lubitz - whose family were at the scene of the crash in Seyne today -  postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was 'in depression'. Airline bosses confirmed Lubitz had taken several months off work and had to retrain to join the firm but insisted he was '100% fit to fly'. Raid: German police have investigated Andreas Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf . Killer's home: A French prosecutor in Marseille said Mr Lubitz's breathing was normal as the plane descended rapidly before crashing into the French Alps . German police have since raided Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf. At an extraordinary press conference earlier, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box. He said Lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck. At that point, Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually - and deliberately. He said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph). 'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'. Earlier in the flight, Mr Robin said Lubitz's responses were initially courteous, but became 'curt' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane. The captain - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter. Mr Robin said: 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something. 'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane. 'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit.'","Andreas Lubitz locked pilot out of cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed A320 .

"A size 28 woman who was told she could die if she didn't lose weight has been crowned slimmer of the year - after shedding more than eight stone. Georgina Wallace, from Feltham, London, was told by the doctor treating her mother for a fatal heart attack that the 39-year-old faced the same fate if she didn't eat more healthily. Tipping the scales at 18 stone, Miss Wallace, a marketing manager, said food was her only comfort  after her father was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, and her mother died. Scroll down for video . Georgina Wallace (pictured weighing 18 stone, left, and 10 stone, right) has been named Slimming World's Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2015 . Georgia couldn't contain her happiness today when she posed alongside a life size cut out of herself having lost a considerable amount of weight . She revealed she had been overweight since primary school but her weight spiralled out of control after losing both her parents in her mid-20s. Now, Miss Wallace has lost more than eight stone and says slimming down hasn't only changed her life, it's saved her life. And she has been rewarded for her hard work, as she was today named Slimming World's Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2015 for the work she does to help other people to lose weight. Miss Wallace said: 'I was 26 when my dad was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, then a year later my mum had a heart attack and died just days later. 'My world was completely thrown upside down and food was my only comfort.' While her mother was in intensive care Georgina received some frank words from the doctor caring for her mother. She said: 'He explained that the main reason my mum was lying in that hospital bed at just 59 years old was her weight. 'He warned me that I was heavier than her and, if I carried on the way I was going, would probably not even reach her age. Those words will stay with me forever.' Georgina larked about with her cardboard cut out, throwing it the air as she was awarded her Slimmer Of The Year title . Georgina, pictured before the weight loss, piled on the pounds after both of her parents died . Georgina, pictured weighing 10 stone, now fronts her own Slimming World group, she says when she first joined she finally felt at home and was glad to find that nobody judged her . Following her mother's death, Miss Wallace nursed her father until he died 18 months later. Afterwards, with the doctor's warning still ringing in her ears, she tried slimming down and yo-yo dieted for more than seven years. While she managed to lose 7st at one point, she found the diets she followed didn't help her to change her relationship with food and she struggled to manage her weight in the long term. Name: Georgina Wallace . Age: 39 . Height: 5ft 5in/1.65m . Starting weight: 18st 3½lbs . Current weight: 10st 1½lbs . Weight loss: 8st 2lbs . Starting dress size: 28 . Current dress size: 10/12 . Date joined Slimming World: June 2010 . Date became a Slimming World Consultant: October 2013 . She finally joined Slimming World in 2010 after hearing about the club's Food Optimising eating plan from an ex-work colleague. 'We'd gone out for dinner and my friend ordered a huge plate of pasta with cheese on the top and even had a glass of wine, yet she told me she could have all of this with Slimming World and still lose weight,' she said. 'I looked up my nearest group as soon as I got home and joined the very next week. 'I was terrified of walking into a room full of strangers. I thought I'd be the biggest person there and worried everyone would judge me because of my size. 'I couldn't have been more wrong though; nobody was pointing or laughing or judging me and straightaway I felt like I was one of them. It was a magical feeling; I felt safe and I knew I belonged in that room.' Miss Wallace, who has been married to husband Mohamed for three years, began following the Food Optimising plan and discovered a love of cooking including whipping up her favourite homemade chilli con carne with rice. She also started slowly becoming more active by tracking her steps. Nowadays she walks around 20,000 steps a day including the 5km home from work and has taken up running, completing several 5km runs and one 10km run to raise money for charity. Since that first night Georgina's lost 8st 2lbs, dropping from 18st 3lbs to 10st 1lbs, and after previously wearing a dress size 28 she's now a size 10/12. Pictured before losing weight Georgina played with a dolphin while on holiday . Georgina said that she used food for comfort, saying that she would tuck in to her favourite dishes whenever she felt sad or angry . During this time she's also given up smoking. She says: 'For the first time in 30 years I am in control of my eating. 'I used to treat myself with food when I was happy and comfort myself with food when I was sad or angry. Everything I've achieved has shown me that I am a strong person and I don't need to use food as an emotional crutch anymore.' In October 2013, after losing nearly 7st, Georgina decided that she felt so passionately about the difference her own weight loss had made to her life that she wanted to help other people to slim down in the same way. She trained as a Slimming World Consultant and opened her own group in Hanworth, which she runs alongside her full-time job. Georgina started Slimming World first and then started to introduce exercise into her life, she now walks everywhere and has taken part in several runs . Miss Wallace said: 'I've been a Consultant for nearly 18 months now. Knowing that every week my members are changing their lives and I'm helping them to do that makes me so proud. 'They motivate and help me to stay on track in my own journey too, so this award is for them as well as me. 'I'm fitter and healthier – my doctor says I have 'perfect' blood pressure – than I have ever been in my life, so I always say that losing weight hasn't only changed my life it's saved my life. 'I would love to go back to the hospital and thank the doctor who looked after my mum because even though I didn't act on his words straightaway I never forgot them. 'My only regret is that my parents died before I took control of my weight, I know they'd be extremely proud of me though.' Miss Wallace's next challenge is to fulfil a lifetime ambition to scuba dive. She says: 'I have always loved the water but the fear of putting on a wet suit has always held me back. Now I've lost weight I feel like I can do anything so this is definitely top of my to-do list.' – ends – . Breakfast: .

"It's not known if she leaves the toilet seat up after she uses it, but Johnie the crocodile loves nothing more than a good soak in the tub. That's what was revealed in a recent video when the croc's owner Vicki Lowing from Melbourne captured bath time in her house. The video was uploaded to YouTube this week, and shows Lowing calling to 18-year-old freshwater croc Johnie who is 1.5 metres long and weighes 12kg. Scroll down for video . Bath time: 18-year-old freshwater croc Johnie is 1.5 metres long, weighes 12kg and loves a good soak in the tub . Johnie walks down through Vicki Lowing's house in Melbourne to get her daily bath . The 57-year-old nurse claims that the crocodiles she has had were always totally domesticated . With the sound of the bath being run in the background Johnie walks down through Lowing's house to the bathroom. 'Come on let's have a bath,' Lowing says. 'There's a girl. Get in that bath. Come on buddy. I'll help you get in.' Lowing is true to her word and once the croc gets to the bathroom she lifts it into the half full bath. 'That's better isn't it? How's that?' asks Vicki. Johnie doesn't have to answer - the image of her floating contentedly in the bath says it all. Nicknamed 'croc lady' in Melbourne, Lowing, has owned crocodiles for more than 30 years. She claims they have all been totally domesticated and that she can even communicate with them telepathically. Are we nearly there yet? Lowing's crocodiles have even ridden in her car over the years . Do you need your back washed? Lowing helps Johnie get cleaned up in the bath tub . Lowing said she first became fascinated with the animals after watching a film in the 1960s, and she has never looked back. Amazingly, despite Johnie nipping her a decade ago while ill, the 57-year-old nurse has never sustained any injuries. She admits neighbours keep their distance when she has taken her pets for walks but on the plus side she has never had problems with burglars. Over the years it would not be unusual for her son Andrew, now 20 years old, to wake up with Johnie on his bed - just like any family pet. Lowing's son Andrew would often wake up with Johnie the croc lying on his bed .","It's bath time for 18-year-old freshwater croc Johnie who is 1.5 metres long and weighes 12kg .

"When I imagine my last day on earth, and I try not to think about it too often, I think of a sunny day in the country and going for a walk among daffodils and green fields. I eat a delicious meal with my children and grandchildren — possibly my great-grandchildren (in my fantasy, I am seriously old but still really fit) — then, after a glass or two of champagne, I fall into a deep and dreamless sleep from which I just don’t wake up. I know I don’t want to go like my mother did, fully conscious that death was imminent and having to deal with the grief of the people who loved her. But at least my mother, the writer Jocasta Innes, was in her right mind until pancreatic cancer ended her life two years ago, aged 78. Writer Daisy Goodwin used an American DNA mapping service to discover whether or not she carried the mutated genes likely to raise your risk of breast and ovarian cancer, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease . My poor grandmother Eileen didn’t have that: she died in a fog of mental confusion, looking at her children as if they were strangers. Is there ever a ‘good’ way to go? Most of us have no idea how we are going to shuffle off this mortal coil — it’s probably the only thing that keeps us sane. But now scientists are offering a service to people who’d like a peek into their future. For £125, you can send off a sample of your saliva to a company in America, and in return they’ll send you your full story, including your ancestry and — crucially — a fairly good indication of how you’ll meet your maker. It’s done by mapping your genome, that unique sequence of 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up your DNA, pinpointing the mutations that determine if you’re likely to go gracefully or whether you’re likely to develop the kind of disease that’s a living death. DNA mapping has been brought to public attention after Angelina Jolie’s discovery that she carried the genes that would seriously increase her chances of ovarian and breast cancer. She’s since had a double mastectomy, and this week announced she’d had both ovaries removed, too. The question, for most of us, I suppose, is whether, like Angelina, we’d want to know. Is this a useful guide as to how to live your life, or simply too much information? Daisy's grandmother Eileen, pictured here (left) with Daisy's mother, the writer Jocasta Innes (centre), started to suffer from dementia aged 70 . I’d sent off my sample to the company, 23 And Me, last year because I was thinking of doing a television show about Britain’s genetic make up. It would be interesting, I thought, to find out exactly how British I was, too: my thick, dark hair and brown eyes have always made me wonder. Then, at the beginning of the year, I was sent an email which said my ‘health overview’ was available on the company’s website. But did I want to know if I carried the genes that put me at a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, I wondered? With one click I would have a glimpse of how my life might end — or face terrifying decisions about preventative surgery. 'I spent weeks deciding whether I should find out or not,' says Daisy (pictured left), who eventually decided to learn the truth about her test results after a conversation with her 14-year-old daughter Lydia (pictured right) The results are split into two sections: first are the innocuous ones, then you can click on another button for your genetic risk factors. I checked out the first category and discovered that I carry the genotypes that make me likely to have brown eyes (tick), unlikely to be a world-class sprinter (tick), and that I am more susceptible to caffeine than most people (that’s true, an espresso makes my heart race). Fascinating, even if not exactly earth-shattering. My ancestry was even more mundane: 60 per cent British and the rest Northern European, as it turns out. So not exotic at all. But then there came the health hazards section containing the information that can tell you what you are likely to die of. It may sound foolish, but I spent weeks deciding whether I should find out or not — there’s something terrifying about the idea of knowing for sure that somewhere inside you is a genetic grenade that could go off at any moment. The thing I really dread is Alzheimer’s. My grandmother developed a form of dementia in her early 70s and it was awful to watch a woman who had gained a double-first from Cambridge lose her razor-sharp wits. I wondered if there was any point in knowing you might get something for which there is no cure? Why spend the rest of your life with a shadow hanging over you? Friends and family were evenly split between those who shuddered and said they would never choose to find out and the ones who wanted to know everything. What decided it for me was my 14-year-old daughter Lydia saying: ‘You need to find out Mum, because even if you don’t want to know, I do.’ As she’s the one who will probably have to take care of me when I am old, that seemed fair. So, apprehensively, I logged back on. My heart was racing as I clicked on the ‘genetic risks’ button. I knew I could be opening a Pandora’s box from which there is no return: I knew I could be opening up my death sentence. Daisy's mother Jocasta Innes, pictured here with husband Richard Goodwin, was the author of 70s bestseller, Pauper's Cookbook . At first, all I saw was the good news — I don’t have the mutations that cause breast and ovarian cancer. Parkinson’s didn’t show up either. ‘Hey, I’m doing pretty well at this,’ I thought, thinking my gentle slip into the afterlife, glass of champagne in hand, wasn’t perhaps wide of the mark after all. But then I looked at the Alzheimer’s results — and my complacency fell away. It took a few minutes to realise I was not being given the all-clear, that it said I have one of the genetic variants that is a marker for late-onset Alzheimer’s. This was the news I was dreading. I began shaking and thinking about my grandmother’s last days: I don’t want to be somebody who’s lost all sense of who they are, being cared for in an anonymous home by strangers, but those visions kept coming into my head. My first instinct was to tell my family but I suddenly realised I don’t want to burden them, to express my fears to them. So I sat at the computer feeling wobbly. It was very bad moment. More than a moment — I felt very alone and bleak for several hours. 'Although there is part of me that wishes that I hadn’t clicked that button, now that I have, there is no excuse not to make the most of every healthy day left to me,' says Daisy . My memory is probably my greatest gift (my children call me the human Google), so the thought of losing it makes me shiver. Worse still is the idea of being an insensate burden on my family, someone they have to care for even when the spark of personality has gone. What I really wanted was a stiff drink, but the one thing I do know about Alzheimer’s is that alcohol is not good for potential dementia sufferers — my grandmother’s short-term memory got a lot worse after her nightly gin. So, sober, I fought back the panic and tried to look at things logically. Although I have the variant, that is no guarantee I will develop the disease. And if you’re reading this and panicking because you have a relative with Alzheimer’s — don’t. The two facts are often not linked. 'My memory is probably my greatest gift (my children call me the human Google), so the thought of losing it makes me shiver,' says Daisy, pictured here aged 8 . My mother was still in sound mind when she died two years ago, and my father is extremely spry at 80, so I probably have 25 years or so before I need to worry. There are things that are meant to reduce your chances of getting the disease: avoiding alcohol, keeping your weight down and taking lots of exercise. And who knows, by the time I reach 70 — the age my grandmother began getting symptoms — there may be some way of treating Alzheimer’s. Sergey Brin, one of the geniuses behind Google who is married to the founder of 23 And Me, discovered through his DNA test that he had a genetic risk of Parkinson’s. So he has taken up competitive diving as a way of optimising his chances of staying healthy and he has also given £33 million to fund research into a cure. It’s all about reducing the odds. DNA mapping has been brought to public attention after Angelina Jolie’s discovery that she carried the genes that would seriously increase her chances of ovarian and breast cancer . Although I hesitated about taking the test, now that I know there is a chance I might spend the last years of my life without the mental capacity I currently have, it makes me very determined to use my brain while it is still in good nick. I’m not going to let myself worry about the future. Instead I’m going to learn to play bridge and do cryptic crosswords while I still can. As someone whose house burnt down earlier this year because of low winter sun hitting a make-up mirror, I know just how random life can be. Although there is part of me that wishes that I hadn’t clicked that button, now that I have, there is no excuse not to make the most of every healthy day left to me.","Daisy Goodwin's grandmother developed dementia in her early 70s .

"Glenis Ludlow was awarded £13,500 in compensation after she fell violently ill on a family holiday in Egypt . A pensioner who fell seriously ill along with her granddaughter on a 'nightmare' holiday to Egypt has told how she would never return to the country again. Glenis Ludlow, 71, stayed at the four-star Tropicana Splash Resort, which has now changed its name to the Sea Beach Resort & Aqua Park, in Sharm El-Sheikh, along with her granddaughter Natasha for a summer holiday. However, only three days in the pensioner fell seriously ill with gastric illness that saw her bed-ridden for the majority of the two-week break. The grandmother was one of 73 guests who fell ill at the four-star hotel and have been given a pay-out of £350,000 by tour operator First Choice Holidays and Flights Limited. Ms Ludlow told MailOnline Travel: 'Every year I have my granddaughter who flies in from Spain, and we book a holiday together, often to places with a waterpark,' she said. 'I'm disabled, and so I made sure to ask the operator if they are disabled friendly, which they said the resort was. 'But around the pool for example, there were broken tiles and totally inadequate handrails, not to mention the water was absolutely filthy.' Three days into the holiday, taken at the end of July, 2012, Ms Ludlow became sick, suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea. She explained: 'As soon as we got there I wanted a shower, but when I went in and turned on the water, the smell was horrific, it smelt like a cesspit in there. 'That continued for the whole holiday; the staff poured disinfectant down, but all that did was make the smell in the whole room unbearable. 'There were flies all around the restaurant, birds flying around and leaving droppings, and the toilets in the hotel were absolutely filthy, full of mould and dirt. 'I just think the people who worked there were not properly trained.' Ms Ludlow was awarded £13,500 in compensation, while her granddaughter secured £2,500. Birds were frequently in the restaurant at the Tropicana Splash Resort in Sharm El-Sheikh . Of the 73 holidaymakers affected, a judge at Birmingham County Court approved settlements for 32 children, with some receiving damages of up to £20,000 each. Dozens of people needed medical treatment and some guests contracted serious infections such as Salmonella poisoning and Cryptosporidium. Jatinder Paul, a solicitor and international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell who represented  the holidaymakers, said: 'We received dozens of complaints from holidaymakers who stayed at the Tropicana Sea Beach Splash Resort during 2012 and in seeking to secure them justice for their illnesses and ruined holidays we were able to obtain expert evidence which was supportive to their claims, despite the refusal by First Choice to neither admit or deny liability. 'There were guests that were diagnosed with Salmonella food poisoning and Cryptosporidium, and a number of the guests that suffered illness suffered from symptoms including stomach cramps, diarrhoea, vomiting and lethargy; these illnesses have had a debilitating long term impact on the health of some of our clients. The Tropicana Splash Resort, which has now changed its name to the Sea Beach Resort & Aqua Park, in Sharm El-Sheikh, where 32 children fell ill back in 2012 . 'We understand that First Choice no longer advertises this resort on their website but our clients were unfortunate enough to go there and have terrible experiences as a result. 'Many guests had to seek medical assistance whilst abroad and upon returning home, and they are now understandably relieved to have received compensation for the pain and suffering that they have gone through, re-imbursement of their financial losses and expenses and damages for their ruined holidays. 'Despite First Choice's initial unwillingness to engage constructively with us to resolve these claims, we are delighted that our clients continued to instruct us to fight for them and that we have been able to negotiate a fair financial settlement for them.' Bathroom facilities were not up to scratch during Ms Ludlow's 2012 stay at the Tropicana Splash Resort in Sharm El-Sheikh . Louise Baldwin, 31, from Llanharan, in Mid Glamorgan, also booked a two week holiday at the resort with her husband Darryn and their son Callum to celebrate Louise's 30th birthday and Darryn's 40th. During their stay at the hotel the family were struck with stomach cramps, sickness, diarrhoea and a fever which left them largely confined to their hotel rooms. Catering manager Louise said: 'We booked this holiday to celebrate our milestone birthdays in style but were bitterly disappointed when all three of us suffered from illness during our stay at the hotel. 'We were horrified at the conditions at what was supposed to be a 'luxury' hotel; we were bitterly disappointed as this was meant to be a special holiday for us all and it was completely ruined. 'We had actually pre booked another holiday the following year to the resort, but as a result of our experience there we wanted to change the destination with First Choice and to add insult to injury we were told by the tour operator that we would be charged for this, but we took matters into our own hands and contacted the TV programme X-Ray (the Welsh version of Watchdog) and First Choice eventually waived the charges. 'We are pleased and relieved that with the help of our legal team at Irwin Mitchell that we have now received a settlement and justice for our holiday which was ruined whilst staying at the Tropicana Sea Splash Resort. We can now move forward from this and put the ordeal behind us.'

"Theodore Welp, former CEO of Tucson Electric Power Co (pictured in 1982). He was killed along with his wife and son in what has been described as a 'heinous' crime in rural Idaho . A former Arizona power company executive, his wife and their adult son were identified on Thursday as the victims of a triple homicide in the foothills outside Boise. The Ada County Coroner's office did not release the causes of death of Theodore M. Welp, 80, Delores E. Welp, 77, and their son, 52-year-old Thomas P. Welp. They were found dead on Tuesday. No motive has been released. Idaho authorities said they were working around the clock to find those responsible for a 'heinous' triple murder at a rural home in the Boise foothills. One man has been arrested on theft counts. 'When I say this crime is heinous, that is probably an understatement,' Ada County Sheriff Gary Raney said on Wednesday. 'Somebody who violently, without cause, without any provocation that I know of, killed three innocent people. We are working 24 hours a day with everything we've got to put that person in jail.' The Welps formerly lived in Arizona, where Theodore Welp was the chief of Tuscon Electric Power Co. (TEP) in the 1980s. Welp was in charge of building a facility in the late 1970s and spun-off a TEP subsidiary which made him and few execs millions of dollar, Tucsonnews.com reported. He was blamed by some for the financial downfall of the company. The Arizona attorney general's office launched an investigation into the financial dealings but the probe resulted in no criminal charges. Investigators said no clear conspiracy or fraudulent acts could be proven. Theodore and Elaine Welp were also involved with charitable organizations, including an organization that funds research on vision impairment and blindness.

A police vehicle approaching the home in the Boise foothills. Police wanted to hear from anyone who was near the murder scene between Sunday and Tuesday night . Adam M. Dees was arrested at a Boise electronics store, The Idaho Statesman reported. Sheriff Raney said detectives were searching Dees' home in hopes of finding more evidence. Authorities said Dees had tried to sell a wedding ring in recent days, but they don't know if it's connected to the killings. They asked the public to provide information if possible. He is accused of three felony counts each of grand theft and forgery and a misdemeanor count of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. Dees was scheduled to appear in Ada County Court later on Thursday. Deputies also seized a 2003 black Subaru Legacy with a gold panel that Dees was driving. Adam Dees, 22, is accused of grand theft and forgery but not murder following the killings . Raney declined to speculate on a motive or say if anything was missing from the home. He said the victims were related, and the killings occurred sometime between Sunday evening and Tuesday morning. He said police wanted to hear from anyone who saw the Subaru near the murder scene between Sunday and Tuesday night. 'I want the community to help us put the right person in jail,' the sheriff said. 'It's hard for me to fathom even after 31 years of law enforcement what could possibly motivate somebody to do to these people what they did.' The killings took place in what records say is a three-bedroom, three-bathroom home on about 20 acres with a total value of about $800,000. Authorities said the property has horses and other buildings. He said police responded after a family member called on Tuesday. 'I've probably not seen a bloodier or more violent murder occur,' Raney said. He said other law enforcement agencies were investigating, including the U.S. Marshals Service .

"A stately-home has been transported back to its condition in the Second World War after six months of painstaking restoration. Today, the hard work paid off as the time-capsule building was re-opened by The Great British Bake-off's Mary Berry. Mary opened the Warwickshire stately home to celebrate the house's incredible transformation and to mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the conflict. Mary Berry re-opened Upton House in Warwickshire that has been restored to the state it was in 1939 . Upton House, a National Trust property located in the parish of Ratley and Upton, has been transported back in time to 1939, when London-based bank M.Samuel & Co moved into the building as they were at risk of having their premises demolished in the London Blitz. The house became one of only two country house banks during the war, the other being the Bank of England. Mary, 80, opened the newly-refurbished house after a team of 80 volunteers went to extraordinary lengths to recreate the manor, even sourcing two rolls of 75-year-old toilet paper. Other fastidious details include WW2 toothpaste, oil from that era that would have been used in typewriters and the team even made lipstick from boiled beetroot, which was common practice at the time. London-based bank M.Samuel & Co moved into the property as they were at risk of having their own building demolished in the London Blitz . The house took six months of painstaking restoration to restore it to its former state . Rachael O'Connor-Boyd, head of Museum Collections Manager at Warwickshire County Council who oversaw the project at the National Trust property, said it was essential to include the tiny, everyday objects in the faithful recreation of the house, which took six months. The 37-year-old said: 'We do need the ephemeral details like toilet paper and I got a bit obsessed with 1940s toilet paper. 'We searched high and low and eventually some toilet paper came up on eBay. We did eventually get two rolls of wartime loo roll that I was very happy with.' Mary Berry opened the stately home to celebrate the house's incredible transformation and to mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War . Although Rachael was able to get hold of the hard-to-find product she admits that even when they were available in 1939, not many people would have had access to it. 'It's very rare as, at the time, people would generally not have used it, they would have used scraps of paper or even newspaper in some households.' This level of intricate detail has permeated every aspect of the recreation of Upton House. Sourcing loo rolls: Among the objects bought were two rolls of 75-year-old toilet tissue costing £30 each . Many of the props were sourced online but the team had also received donations from collectors . The bathrooms are stocked with toothpaste and toothbrushes from the era. Even pens and pencils have been found from the 1940s to fill the desks in the house. Rachael says that a lot of the material has been discovered online through six months of research, but they have also been fortunate enough to receive invaluable donations. She said: 'There are some things that you do not know that you want and then when you get them they are perfect. Rachael O'Connor-Boyd who oversaw the project said it was important to gather everyday items . Girl of her time: Mary Berry would have been just four-years-old in 1939 . 'One instance would be 1940s tea that came in a cardboard box in wrapped up packets with hand written notes. They had been in somebody's attic for 70 years and was in a pristine condition. 'A lot of the items we received were from the kindness of strangers.' In order to create a high level of accuracy the team had to be prepared to spend more than one would usually on household items. The toilet paper alone cost £60 for the two rolls. Rachael says that the project wouldn't have been possible without people who had decided to preserve such items. 'There are some glorious people out there that keep everything and if it weren't for people who kept things in their loft or their attics, we wouldn't have these objects and that window into a world that's gone.' She said finding the everyday items for the house was vital to faithfully recreate the home's wartime story. She added: 'I honed onto things like the toilet paper because it's ordinary peoples' lives and that's important to our story because it's a mansion where for that period during the war, ordinary people took over this extraordinary place.'","Mary Berry re-opened Upton House today to celebrate 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War .

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to end the 'obsession of benefit caps' as part of any deal to lock the Tories out of power . The SNP today demanded the end of the £26,000 cap on benefits claims as a price for supporting Labour, as a new poll confirmed a surge in support for the nationalists. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to end the 'obsession of benefit caps' as part of any deal to lock the Tories out of power. A new opinion poll shows a 19-point swing from Labour to the SNP, as pressure grows on Ed Miliband to stem the haemorrhaging of support north of the border. The SNP have vowed to do whatever it takes to keep David Cameron out of Number 10 after the election on May 7. Mr Miliband has ruled out a formal coalition, but could be forced to rely on the support of SNP MPs if, as the polls suggest, he falls short of a majority. Alex Salmond has already vowed to hold a Labour minority government to ransom to secure a £180billion debt-fuelled spending spree in Scotland. Today Ms Sturgeon called for an end to the freeze on benefits payments, and said they should rise by more than inflation, making welfare claimants better off each year. She told BBC Radio Scotland: 'We've got a situation where the poorest in our society are plunged being deeper into poverty, where in-work poverty is on the rise. 'So I don't agree with the obsession of benefit caps. I want to look at how we lift people out of poverty.' She called for the minimum wage to rise to £8.70 per cent hour by 2020, adding the Westminster parties were 'scapegoating and penalising the poorest'. She added: 'I've said repeatedly that we shouldn't be holding benefit increases below the rate of inflation because if you do that, and you continue the freeze that we've seen, you drive people on the lowest incomes deeper into poverty.' A new ComRes opinion poll for ITV News looked at voting in 40 Labour-held seats in Scotland. It found that the SNP is backed by 43 per cent of voters in the seats, up from 18.9 per cent in 2010. At the same time, support for Labour has dropped from 51.3 per cent five years ago to only 37 per cent now. However, 49 per cent of people in the battleground seats want Mr Miliband as Prime Minister, compared to only 29 per cent who want Mr Cameron. A new ComRes opinion poll for ITV News looked at voting in 40 Labour-held seats in Scotland. It found that the SNP is backed by 43 per cent of voters in the seats, up from 18.9 per cent in 2010 . The SNP insists it can end the shared 'ideological commitment to austerity' of both the Conservatives and Labour if enough of its MPs are elected to Westminster. SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said MPs from his party would work together with 'allies from across the UK' such as the Greens and Plaid Cymru to achieve this as he argued swapping the current Conservative-led government for a Labour one would not see a major shift in policy. He said: 'Westminster's obsession with austerity is holding back Scotland's economy and damaging communities across the country - pushing 100,000 more children in Scotland into poverty and seeing a 400 per cent increase in people forced to rely on food banks. 'Austerity is failing on every level and people are crying out for a real alternative. 'The Tories are determined to ignore the fact that their austerity policies have failed even by their own standards - and, despite claims made in recent days, Labour can't hide the fact that they have shamefully backed George Osborne's plans for a further £30 billion of cuts. 'That both these parties are wedded to the same austerity agenda while supporting spending £100 billion on a new generations of weapons of mass destruction isn't just economically illiterate - it is morally indefensible.' Mr Hosie added: 'Under the SNP plans set out by Nicola Sturgeon, we could see a modest increase in public spending, allowing us to protect our NHS budget, invest in education and childcare, and create more job opportunities for our young people. 'A strong team of SNP MPs working with progressive allies from across the UK will put an end to the ideological commitment to austerity of both the Tory and Labour leaderships - delivering real support for businesses, protecting our public services and creating more opportunities for our young people.'","SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon wants to end the 'obsession of benefit caps'

"Ed Miliband’s elections chief Lucy Powell, above, confirmed the party ‘may use some investment borrowing’ to fund its manifesto if it wins . Labour yesterday admitted it will borrow billions more than the Tories – as experts warned the party’s plans would leave a £30billion black hole at the heart of the nation’s finances. Ed Miliband’s elections chief Lucy Powell confirmed the party ‘may use some investment borrowing’ to fund its manifesto if it wins the election. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour’s plans would potentially leave Britain with a permanent budget deficit – piling up massive debts for future generations. The think tank’s director Paul Johnson said Labour’s proposals allowed it to maintain an overall deficit as high as £30billion by 2020 – at a time when the Tories aim to be running a surplus of £7billion to pay off Britain’s debts. He told the BBC: ‘It is clear Labour want to do quite a lot less in terms of the total (deficit). They don’t want to get rid of the deficit altogether, they are happy to borrow to invest. They would be happy with a deficit of £25-30billion, whereas the Conservatives don’t want a deficit at all.’ Miss Powell later said she did not recognise the £30billion. But under pressure, she confirmed Labour would borrow to fund the Government’s investment spending, which is forecast to be about that amount by 2020. ‘We are going to balance the books for current expenditure by the end of the Parliament,’ she said. ‘We may use some investment borrowing for much-needed investment but not for day-to-day spending. 'Those figures are other people’s figures. It depends on what the books are like.’ Tory Treasury minister Priti Patel said Miss Powell had ‘let the cat out of the bag’. She added: ‘Labour have finally had it dragged out of them that they’d borrow more if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street. Add in the fact that they’re refusing to admit which taxes they’d raise and you’ve got a recipe for total economic chaos.’ Miss Powell also clashed with BBC presenter Andrew Neil as he questioned Labour’s claims of an ‘explosion’ in the use of zero hours contracts. She snapped at him: ‘In the real world, Andrew where I live, OK, unlike where you live…’ Mr Neil hit back: ‘You’ve no idea where I live, just answer the question.’ Mr Miliband will use the launch of his party’s business manifesto today to warn that Tory plans for a referendum on Europe could create instability for firms . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told last September’s Labour conference that ‘in our manifesto there will be no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing’. But the fine print of Labour’s pledges show it has left itself flexibility to borrow the Government’s entire capital budget for spending on things such as roads, schools and railways.Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander yesterday warned Labour may set out no more details of its tax and spending plans before the election. Critics point out its deficit reduction programme amounts to less than £1billion of cuts and the reintroduction of the 50p top tax rate, which experts warn may raise nothing. Challenged over Labour’s plans, Mr Alexander said: ‘We have set out our programme.’ Miss Powell said Labour was ‘very clear we can widen the tax base’ – suggesting the party plans to drag more people into paying tax. Labour later insisted this meant getting more people into better paid jobs so they would pay more tax and receive fewer benefits. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told last September’s Labour conference that ‘in our manifesto there will be no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing’ Mr Miliband will use the launch of his party’s business manifesto today to warn that Tory plans for a referendum on Europe could create instability for firms. He is also expected to make a fresh attack on planned Tory cuts. But former Labour health secretary Alan Milburn said he had to reach beyond Labour’s usual supporters to have any hope of winning. Mr Milburn told LBC radio: ‘Instead of going down to your core vote you have got to be reaching out to your non-core vote. Why? For a very pragmatic reason – if you are going to form a majority government you cannot really do it with 32.8 per cent of the vote.’ Meanwhile, the Tories also came under fire over their plans for £12 billion in welfare cuts after Iain Duncan Smith indicated the proposals may not be made public before the election. The Work and Pensions Secretary added: ‘When we are right and we are ready, we will talk about what we plan to do ... ‘(Voters) know for certain that we are going to save that £12 billion. We may, we may not, decide that it’s relevant to put something out there about some of those changes.’ Labour activists were in mutiny last night over this ‘shameful’ £5 mug boasting that the party would put controls on immigration. The red cup, for sale on the fundraising section of Labour’s website, is one of five carrying its key election pledges. Activists dubbed it the ‘Farage mug’, referring to the Ukip leader, and called on Labour to withdraw it and drop all plans to control migration. But the controversy led to a surge in sales. By last night almost 250 of the mugs had been sold compared to just six of the ones promoting Labour’s vow to create a ‘strong economic foundation’. Veteran left-winger Diane Abbott said: ‘This shameful mug is an embarrassment. But the real problem is that immigration controls are one of our pledges at all.’ It comes after Labour was branded patronising for using a pink bus to attract women voters. A party spokesman defended the mugs, saying: ‘Labour has five election pledges. This is one.’","Lucy Powell confirmed party ‘may use investment borrowing’ if it wins .

Liberal-led governments in Australia are 'bad for women', according to the 2015 Boardroom Diversity Index released by Women on Boards . 'It's hard not to conclude that conservative leaning governments are bad for women,' Ms Braund said. 'It is clear to us that the message is starting to hit home in a number of important areas in the economy - in particular superannuation and ASX companies - but unfortunately not with some governments.' Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women Michaelia Cash has called the scorecard results 'false and absurd', the Australian Financial Review reports. The number of women on boards fell by just 0.6 percent from the 91 federal government boards included in the research. the federal, Queensland and Western Australian governments are falling behind, according to Women on Boards director Claire Braund . But Women on Boards also pointed to the 2014 Australian Government Gender Balance on Boards Report that showed the number of female board members was down by two per cent on the previous year across 387 government boards. 'This is a worrying trend that, if it continues, could easily move to five or 10 per cent and erode the excellent work done by the previous federal government to move women into board roles via its Boardlinks program,' Ms Braund said. Queensland posted the biggest loss of with a loss of 13.6 percent in the number of women serving on the boards of state owned corporations, while Western Australia followed with minus 3.2 percent.

Senator Cash said any dip in the number of women in government board roles was a byproduct of bringing 460 boards down to 387 for cost-cutting measures. 'Over 800 board positions were abolished between 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014. This in turn has impacted on the gender balance of government boards,' she said.","Women on Boards released its 2015 Boardroom Diversity Index report .

Runaway: Rehana Islam with husband Azizul and their two children, whose identities are protected . Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, a friend of the mother-of-two took reporters around the house and garden of the family, in Enfield, north London, where she showed them the shed where the children would play. She said: 'She tried as much as possible to raise her child this right way. 'He is a very special boy, at the age of eight he prays, she taught him how to pray, he said she made him go to special school. He goes to an Islamic school. They are nice kids you know.' She said that Mrs Islam was a 'nice person' but that she had seemed 'depressed and moody' before she fled her home, claiming that was going on a two-week break in Wales. The woman said: 'She has got kids and she was like every mother, you know when your kids are misbehaving, you are shouting ""stop this, stop that"". '(She was) moody and depressed. She would keep saying to me, 'this is not me, I wasn’t this person before. I am having this pressure', I think because she was having problems with her marriage. 'Always shouting shouting, shouting, shouting.' When asked if the Mrs Islam had mentioned her plans to go to Syria, the neighbour said: 'No she said she was going to Wales, she needed a two week break. 'Every time the conversation was leading to religion, I would kill it. She was too on the other side. Too extreme. 'She would say the Muslims are being killed as a protest. I said to her ""stop"".' She is believed to have been helped by Syrian Mohammed al-Rashed, who was arrested last week on suspicion of getting the three east London schoolgirls across the border. Her passport details were found on his laptop – showing she and her children have been with Islamic State fanatics for five weeks. Mrs Islam's devastated husband Azizul has previously told reporters he has not stopped crying since police revealed she had travelled to Gaziantep, a popular gateway to Syria for foreign fighters and jihadi brides. Intelligence revealed Mrs Islam's documents were found on Mohammed al-Rashed's laptop, who  was arrested on suspicion of helping Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase (pictured) become jihadi brides . 'It's really hard for me,' said the 36-year-old minicab driver. 'I haven't seen my kids for more than one month. I can't even sleep without my kids. 'My question is why did she go there? She has two kids, she has a family, and this house is in her name. Why has she left everything? This is really unbelievable. 'When the police told me she travelled to Gaziantep – I've seen it in the news, so many British people are trying to travel there – it came into my mind that maybe she's gone to Syria but still I can't believe it.' Turkish intelligence sources revealed her ID documents were found on the laptop of Mohammed al-Rashed. He was arrested on suspicion of helping Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, become jihadi brides in Syria. All three attended Bethnal Green academy in Tower Hamlets. Al-Rashed, 28, is said to have told detectives he has mainly helped British fighters but also South Africans and Australians. The details of two other Britons, aged 19 and 29, were on his laptop. Mr Islam said: 'He must've also helped her to get there. 'I'm worried about my kids, I hope she comes back with my kids. Please. She's going to destroy my two kids' lives. 'IS is killing Muslim people as well. My religion doesn't say anything about killing people. 'If you're Muslim you should know that the Koran doesn't say this. These people are dangerous.' The Bangladeshi-born father said he had no idea how his wife, who suffers from depression, had become radicalised. He did not know that the former RBS clerk posted frequently on Facebook about Islam. But he said she spent a lot of time on her smartphone. Mrs Islam took her laptop with her when she disappeared. Her husband added: 'If I knew anything I would do everything to stop my wife, especially my two kids. I do everything for my kids since they were born. I look after the kids like I'm their mother. Schoolgirls Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and  Amira Abase, 15, (pictured at Gatwick airport) fled to Turkey before crossing the border into Syria where they are believed to have become ISIS jihadi brides . 'I play the role of mother because my wife can't handle them sometimes. When I married her she wasn't religious, she was like a normal girl, she didn't even cover herself. But a couple of years ago she started covering up and praying five times a day.' Mr Islam, who works nights in Enfield, north London, said he suspected his wife was missing when he came home in the early hours. 'I couldn't see anyone in the house but most of the weekends she spends at her sister's house, it's not far, it's round the corner,' he said. 'I tried calling her big sister but she said she wasn't there. We called her friends, relatives and made phone calls, but no one knew so we called the police. 'The police told me she took a flight from Heathrow to Amsterdam, and from Amsterdam to Istanbul. When they found out that she flew to Gaziantep maybe then they thought she went to Syria. I don't have any clue.' Turkish intelligence sources said British authorities did not inform them that Mrs Islam might be travelling to Syria until February 23 – nine days after she landed in the country. Turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with Syria, but has accused European states in turn of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place. There are increasing concerns about the growing numbers of young people being lured to the war zone in Syria and Iraq. Security services estimate that more than 600 Britons have gone to join militant groups since the explosion of violence in the region began. They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become jihadi brides.","Rehana Begum Islam has fled to Syria with son, eight, and daughter, three .

"An elderly couple who had been married for more than 50 years stepped in front of a speeding freight train just minutes after a row with their 50-year-old daughter, an inquest heard. Peter Smith, 80, and his wife Betty, 78, walked a short distance from their bungalow in the picturesque Lincolnshire village of Cherry Willingham, to the unmanned crossing on July 9 last year. Less than half an hour earlier, Mrs Smith and her only child, Jane, who had recently moved back in with her parents, had an disagreement over where she was keeping her belongings. Tragic: Peter Smith, 80, and his wife Betty, 78, walked a short distance from their bungalow in the picturesque Lincolnshire village of Cherry Willingham, to the unmanned crossing, pictured, on July 9 last year . Miss Smith told an inquest that as the couple left the house after the argument, her father turned to her and said: 'Goodbye, you won't see us again'. It was the last time she saw her parents. Yesterday, an inquest into their deaths at Lincoln's Cathedral Centre heard that it had 'not been an easy situation' since Miss Smith and her partner, Tim Evans had moved into the family home. In a statement read to the court, Miss Smith said she and Mr Evans had moved back in two months earlier because there was no running water in their house, The Times has reported. She said that she and her father, a former postmaster, had not had 'the best relationship over the years'. She said: that she and her mother had a disagreement over whether she could store some of her belongings in the spare room. She added: 'Later in the morning my father said that he wanted to go into town. The reason for this was that he wanted to get his glasses altered as they were hurting him. Warning: The inquest heard the couple did not react when the driver of the approaching train sounded his horn. He applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time. Above, the scene where the couple died last year . 'My mother said that she did not want to go but eventually she agreed to accompany him. 'As they left the house my mother walked out with my father behind. 'Once my mother was out of earshot my father turned to me and said ""Goodbye, you won't see us again"". When my mother got to the gate she turned and waved at me. 'They both then turned and walked out of my sight. That was the last time I saw my parents'. The inquest heard the couple did not react when the driver of the approaching train sounded his horn, according to the Times. He applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time. The couple died almost instantly of multiple injuries. The coroner recorded verdicts of suicide. The inquest heard the couple did not have a history of mental health issues and neither had ever been sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Neighbours of the couple paid tribute to the 'beautiful' and 'devoted' pair who had lived in the village for more than 50 years. Joyce Garner, 94, who lived two doors down from the couple, said: 'I just can't believe it.

Margaret Elkington, 81, who lived opposite the couple, added: 'They seemed to be such a happy couple. They would catch the bus into Lincoln every Monday and Saturday. 'They had a daughter but they didn't speak about her very much.'","Peter Smith and his wife Betty stepped in front of speeding freight train .

"An ex-girlfriend of former U.S. Representative Michael Grimm who had pleaded guilty to raising illegal campaign money for the New York politician was sentenced on Tuesday to three months in custody. The sentence for Diana Durand, 48, was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation. The punishment could foreshadow a prison term for Grimm, who pleaded guilty in December to tax felony evasion. He is scheduled to be sentenced by a separate judge in June. Diana Durand, who had pleaded guilty to raising illegal campaign money for two congressional candidates, was sentenced on Tuesday to three months in custody. The punishment was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation . Durand pleaded guilty in September to violating the Federal Election Campaign Act by directing more than $10,000 in campaign contributions to two candidates for the House of Representatives in 2010 through straw donors whom she reimbursed, avoiding federal caps on donations. Her attorney Stuart Kaplan, who is also Grimm's attorney, has confirmed that one of the two candidates was Grimm, with whom she at one time had a personal relationship. Kaplan claimed last May that Durand did not intend to commit a crime and that she was being targeted solely because of her ties to Grimm. 'My client is not a sophisticated woman,' he said, explaining that she did know what she was doing was illegal. ‘She was just trying to help this guy out who she was in a relationship with – nothing more, nothing less,’ he said at another point in April. But in September she copped to the charges for which she was sentenced today. It was not immediately clear whether Durand would serve the three months in jail or in a halfway house. U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson of Brooklyn also ordered Durand to pay a $10,000 fine. She faced up to eight years in prison and a maximum $600,000 fine. Nevertheless, Kaplan said after the hearing he was shocked by the sentence and that he would ask the judge to reconsider. 'This is clearly, to me, a miscarriage of justice,' he said. Grimm is seen here following his guilty plea at the Brooklyn federal court in New York on December 23, 2014 to a tax evasion charge related to a Manhattan health food restaurant he partly owned, Healthalicious. He resigned and formally left office several days later . Durand lives in Houston, where she works as a manager for an oil distributor. She is also a single mother. Grimm, who represented New York City's borough of Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, was elected in 2010. He announced his resignation in December - just a month after winning reelection on the grounds that he was innocent - after first saying he would stay on the job, even after he had pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charge related to a Manhattan health food restaurant he partly owned, Healthalicious. He then made an about-face and left Congress as the new session began on Jan. 5. He had been indicted on 20 counts of fraud, perjury and conspiracy after a federal probe of his fundraising. Prosecutors in that case suggested that judge Pamela K. Chen sentence Grimm to between 24 to 30 months in prison. Kaplan, a former colleague of Grimm's at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and his associates recommended 12 to 18 months.","The sentence for Diana Durand, 48, was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation .

"Two teenage brothers who tried to join the Islamic State, but who were instead detained at Sydney Airport by counter-terrorism authorities, are 'kids, not killers', Immigration Minister Peter Dutton says. The two Australians, aged 16 and 17, from south west Sydney were trying to leave Australia to fight in a conflict zone in the Middle East and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained. Authorities’ suspicions were aroused after the two had booked flights to an unidentified country in the Middle East and their luggage was searched. Scroll down for video . Counter-terrorism authorities accompany the two teenage boys through Sydney Airport after they were stopped from boarding a flight to an undisclosed location in the Middle East . The two teenagers' luggage is searched by security at Sydney Airport . Teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - is one of the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State . The two boys were stopped on Friday night Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton revealed. In a press conference on Sunday Mr Dutton said that matters remained under investigation and he praised the customs officers for their vigilence. 'These two young men ... are kids, not killers, and they shouldn't be allowed to go to a foreign land to fight and to come back to our shores eventually more radicalised,' he said. 'They (customs officers) have potentially saved the lives of these Australians. IS is a cancer and young people are the most susceptible. 'IS is abhorent and should not be tolerated in our society.' Mohamed Elomar left Sydney and has reportedy joined IS in Iraq . The two teenagers were detained at Sydney airport when they tried to board a flight for the Middle East . Mr Dutton said that traditionally, parents of teenage children had to worry about alcohol, drugs, and driving, but this was a new worry. 'Now there is an added threat of the information being delivered to them over the internet, particularly if they're inclined to go and fight in a foreign land,' he said. '[And] most importantly for our country, when they return, they return more radicalised, and [are] a greater threat to the Australian public. 'We have to be absolutely determined to stare down this ever increasing threat.' Their parents were unaware of their plans to travel to the Middle East. The brothers were later issued court attendance notices. Under the new Foreign Fighters Act, customs officers are allowed to detain people where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is intending to commit a Commonwealth offence or is a threat to national security or the security of a foreign country. The Sunday Telegraph reported that Mr Dutton said that the two boys had aroused the suspicion of ‘two alert Customs and Border Protection officers’ who referred them to the terrorism unit. 'What we have here are two teenagers who have been intercepted on their way to a potentially very dangerous situation,' Mr Dutton said. Khaled Sharrouf has already served three years and 11 months in prison . 'As a result of this interception, a Sydney family remains together. 'This highlights afresh the need to work within communities and with parents to disrupt attempts to brainwash our young people. 'It is yet another reminder of the need for parents to remain vigilant against this type of threat.' Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State. Elmir, a former Condell Park High student, was filmed on the banks of the River Tigris in Iraq last October. While Elomar and Sharrouf have appeared regularly in Islamic State videos. One of which included a beheading of a prisoner. Elomar (right) has been seen in a number of IS videos and photographs . Convicted terrorist Sharrouf served three years and 11 months in prison over his role in the 2005 Pendennis terror plot. He left Australia illegally last year and is believed to be fighting with ISIS in Iraq. In a now famous rant aimed at Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Elmir said that the Islamic State would not stop until 'until we put the black flag on top of Buckingham Palace, until we put the black flag on top of the White House.' Elmir (front centre) wants to see a 'black flag on top of the White House' A 22-year-old Gold Coast woman, Amira Karroum, was murdered within days of arriving in Syria last year. Up to 40 Australian women were also known to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to become 'jihadi brides' or work with terrorists.

"A primary school has banned its pupils from watching next week's solar eclipse amid fears the children will be blinded. Whitchurch Primary School in Cardiff said it will not let children watch the natural display outside, even if they have bought special glasses with solar filters. Instead, the primary school will show the eclipse on a live feed inside the school premises. Whitchurch Primary School in Cardiff said it will not let children watch Friday's solar eclipse amid fears they could be blinded . The partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on Friday, March 20, and will be visible for thousands of kilometres. The decision came following an email which was reportedly sent to the schools by Cardiff Council. The memo advised schools  to read a leaflet from the Royal Astronomical Society on how to observe an eclipse safely. Advice in the leaflet states that 'the sun is so bright that just looking at it can blind you, so you'll need to prepare beforehand'. A council spokeswoman said: 'We are not telling schools they should not allow children out. 'We have left that decision to the schools. We are providing schools with a copy of the Royal Astronomical Society's advice.' Cardiff Council sent advice to schools from the Royal Astronimical Society, explaining how the eclipse can be watched safely. Pictured: A solar eclipse in the Faroe Islands . It goes on to state 'there are various ways to observe it (the eclipse) safely, using both everyday materials and telescopes or binoculars'. These can also include eclipse viewers, colanders, pinhole viewers, and mirrors. It is believed the schools were left to provide the equipment themselves. A second school in the area, Fairwater Primary School, said it would not be making any changes to the school day to accommodate the eclipse. Meanwhile, Bryn Hafod Primary School, also in the area, said it needed to do a 'health and safety assessment' before it would make a decision on whether to allow children to watch the eclipse. During the landmark event, the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, casting a deep shadow over the planet's surface in a partial eclipse. Unlike 1999, it will not be a total eclipse over Britain, although that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole. The next similar eclipse will not take place over Britain until August 2026.","Whitchurch Primary  in Cardiff will live stream eclipse inside premises .

"The family of an autistic boy are at loggerheads with their local school district in Sherwood, Oregon, which is refusing to provide a handler to oversee their son's service dog. For the past three months John McDonald, 6, has attended class at Middleton Elementary without his autism service dog, Kai, because of the impasse between the family and Sherwood School District. Parents Jennifer and Scott McDonald's raised $13,500 to purchase Kai to help their son who is nonverbal and has a tendency to run away when he gets anxious. Scroll down for video . John McDonald's parents are at loggerheads with their local school district in Sherwood, Oregon, which is refusing to provide a handler to oversee their son's service dog Kai during class . On Wednesday morning, Jennifer McDonald took her son and Kai to class in the hope that school staff would take Kai's leash and lead them inside . According to mom Jennifer, the 70-pound Labrador helps her son keep calm and allows him to better focus in class. The school originally welcomed the idea of allowing a service dog in class. They replaced carpet with bare floors and paid for the Autism Service Dogs of America to train staff to work with Kai. Then the district told the McDonalds that they required a dog handler be to present at all times and that under the Americans with Disabilities Act they would have to pay. 'I guess I was naive. I thought - it's a service dog, he's allowed to go in public places. He's mandated that he can go with John anywhere,' McDonald told KGW. 'It never occurred to me that it would come up to something like this . The family doesn't believe a handler is necessary and say the district is misinterpreting the regulations. They filed a federal discrimination complaint with the Department of Justice in December. The family's attorneys also point to a recent court case in Florida where a judge ruled that a service dog is no different than helping a blind child deploy a cane, reports The Oregonian. Instead Middleton Principal Jeremiah Patterson told Jennifer that the district is standing by its decision that the family must provide a dog's handler for Kai . John McDonald, 6, has autism and so his parent's raised $13,500 to train Kai, a service dog who helps him to remain calm and safe . Jennifer McDonald says her son is being discriminated against and that the Americans with Disabilities Act states that the school should pay for a dig handler because it is they who claim it is necessary . The judge ruled, 'The (Florida) district's failure to provide an employee to assist the child with the dog's routine care amounted to a failure to accommodate.' The U.S. Department of Justice also issued a statement in the case, saying the school district's failure to make reasonable accommodations to facilities and practices was discriminatory. The family are waiting for a legal verdict,but said that time is also critical as the longer the boy and dog are apart, the more their bond deteriorates. On Wednesday morning, Jennifer McDonald took her son and Kai to class in the hope that school staff would take Kai's leash and lead them inside. Instead Middleton Principal Jeremiah Patterson  told Jennifer that the district is standing by its decision that the family must provide the dog's handler. 'The District communicated to the parents that, under the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the dog is welcome in the classroom as long as either a parent or someone the parents arrange is in the classroom to supervise and care for the dog,' said the school in a statement on Wednesday. 'However, the request of the parents that the District provide supervision and care for the dog involves expenditure of public funds and the assignment of additional staff. These are of great concern to the District, acting as a steward of public funds.'","John McDonald's parents are at loggerheads with their local school district in Sherwood, Oregon, over their son's service dog Kai .

"British Army tanks could soon be allowed to drive at 40mph again on public roads in England and Wales, it has been revealed. They had been driving at this speed since 1977, until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from laws restricting tracked vehicles to 20mph. The top speed was therefore halved to 20mph in October 2013 to comply with the 1984 Road Traffic Regulation Act, but the Department for Transport is now proposing to put it back to 40mph. New limit? Armoured tracked vehicles had been driving at 40mph since 1977, until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from road traffic laws (file picture) Ministers are worried that the 20mph limit is causing more congestion and raising possible safety concerns, as well as preventing proper training of tank crews to operate safely on public roads. They also believe travelling at slow speeds increases the vibrations of some tanks which can harm the health of crews over long periods, as well as causing wear and tear on roads and the vehicles. The DfT, which is now consulting on plans to raise the limit, added that actual operating speeds would still depend on careful risk assessments by the military and specific vehicle capabilities. Tracked vehicles such as the AS90 self-propelled gun and Stormer missile carrier can often be seen on rural roads close to army firing ranges in Wiltshire, Dorset and Pembrokeshire. A DfT spokesman said: ‘The plans under consultation will help address congestion that can be created by slow-moving vehicles on faster roads. ‘Increasing the maximum speed limit to 40mph will also reduce costs of higher fuel consumption and the time taken for training and testing when vehicles are limited to 20mph.’ Frequent sight: Tracked vehicles can often be seen on rural roads close to army firing ranges in Dorset, Pembrokeshire and Wiltshire - where a Challenger tank at Salisbury Plain is pictured in this file image . The consultation runs until April 24. RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘It seems our armed forces need more practice at, literally, rapid deployment. ‘With troops now out of Afghanistan it makes you wonder what target military chiefs are eyeing up next?’ He added: ‘But tank commanders should beware. While they will theoretically be allowed to go faster, congestion might mean they never get near the limit as they are stuck in the same jams as the rest of Britain's 38 million drivers. ‘But at least they'll be in the right vehicles to tackle the potholes that blight the road network.’ The consultation was published last Friday by transport minister Robert Goodwill and Philip Dunne, the defence equipment minister. Last week London Mayor Boris Johnson outlined eight locations in the capital where 20mph speed limits could be introduced, with more possibly following.","Armoured tracked vehicles had been driving at up to 40mph since 1977 .

"A sister who lost her brother in the Afghan War has married the soldier who tried in vain to save his life. Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban. Liam Fisher, 22,  tried valiantly to save his comrade, and was lucky to survive himself after a bullet hit his helmet as he dragged his dying friend into a ditch, before lying on top of him to protect him. Rosie-Ann Stone has married Private Liam Fisher, who risked his own life trying to save her fatally injured brother in Afghanistan . But he could not be saved, and the young soldier died of his wounds at the scene. His sister Rosie-Ann Stone, of Atwick, near Hornsea, East Yorkshire, heard of Pte Fisher's bravery at her brother's inquest and the couple stayed in touch by exchanging Facebook messages. They soon realised they were falling for each other and the couple got engaged last November. The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, was so moved by the story of the family that he granted a special licence for the couple to marry in York Minster in a moving ceremony held yesterday. Leading the service yesterday, the Revd Canon Michael Smith, Pastor of the Minster, told the 40 guests: . 'I know some of you have been to some really dark and painful places. Love is about being prepared to make sacrifices for the person or people we love. Private Gregg Stone (left), 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban.  The Stone family were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, (right) was killed in a car crash . 'We remember those unable to come here today and are not here. We remember in God's presence Gregg and Jennie. 'We remember those lines that ""Love never dies"". 'We remember them and all our loved ones who have died as they share with is this day and our prayers.' The Stone family were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, was killed in a car crash in Fraisthorpe. Rosie-Ann was involved in the fatal incident and prosecuted for causing death through careless driving, but was later unanimously acquitted by a jury at Hull Crown Court. Rosie-Ann said before the wedding: 'We are so happy. Gregg would be giddy. He would be shocked, but he'd be so pleased. Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me.

Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me' Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date . 'When we got together, people were sceptical. 'People thought, ""Is she just looking for comfort?"" or ""Is she just looking for a replacement brother?"" 'But our relationship is founded on merit. I love Liam for everything he is. He is genuine. 'People contact you when there is tragedy, saying they'll support you. Liam was different. 'He just wanted to get to know me. It was really refreshing.' Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date in Bridlington the following August. Pte Fisher at first did not even tell his new love about his Task Force Helmand commander's bravery commendation for trying to save her brother. Describing Gregg's final moments, he said: 'It was chaos. It was jungle. You couldn't see anything. 'The platoon commander told us to keep 10m apart, but I turned to Gregg and said, 'It's 5m for me and you'. Then the rounds came flying.' He added: 'I'm sure Gregg would have sat me down and grilled me. He would have told me to look after his little sister, but he would be pleased.' Rosie-Ann's parents said they were over the moon when the engagement was announced. Her father Bob said: 'I can't put into words, without getting overwhelmed and emotional, how I feel', while mother Angie added: 'We feel we have gained a son.'","Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on mission to rescue an Afghan policeman .

"'The Ripper': Duwayne Henry, pictured, was jailed for life at Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday . A serial rapist who called himself 'the Ripper' was caught after he attacked a woman in a home-made 'torture chamber'. Duwayne Henry selected his victims using an online escort agency and lured them to his flat in Hackney, east London, where they were threatened with knives and repeatedly raped. Police found a knives, a circular saw and a hedge trimmer laid out on the floor of his bedroom when they searched his home. Officers believe he intended to use these weapons on his final victim, but was interrupted by a passer-by who heard her screams. The mystery hero has never been identified. Henry was jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 12 and a half years at Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday. The 34-year-old targeted at least three prostitutes during his 14-month spree, believing their trade meant they were less likely to report his crimes, police said. In the first known assault, which took place in early 2013, Henry repeatedly raped his victim in a brutal three-hour attack before taking a photo of the woman's driving licence. He told her he would use the details to find her and kill her if she went to the police. In the second known attack, in April 2013, Henry gagged the victim with duct-tape before and raped her at knife-point. He then forced her to wash his bedsheets before raping her again on the floor. His final attack took place in February 2014, when Henry booked an escort to meet him outside the flats where he lived. He held a knife to his victim's eye and led her to his bedroom, described by police as a 'torture chamber', where he had laid out a circular saw, seven knives and a hedge trimmer. One of these items was plugged into the mains. As soon as she entered the room, Henry held a knife to the woman's eye. He pushed her over and told her she was going to die. The woman was gagged, tied up, and raped. The rapist was interrupted when a man, alerted by the woman's screams, appeared in the doorway of Henry's bedroom. He untied the woman, who phoned the police. 'Torture chamber': Henry selected his victims using an online escort agency before luring them to his flat in Hackney, east London, pictured. There, the women were threatened, tied up and repeatedly raped . The victim later told officers that Henry threatened her and said: 'I'm invisible, I'm the Ripper'. Officers from the Metropolitan Police found one victim's phone in his flat and managed to track down a second victim. The mystery 'good Samaritan' has never been identified, despite a police appeal last year. Detective Inspector Tony Lynes said: 'Henry's attacks were thoroughly planned. 'He controlled the environment where the attacks took place, avoiding the risk of being disturbed. 'Luckily he did not take into account the courage of his victims or the tenacity of the detectives investigating this case and I am pleased that today he can look forward to a substantial prison sentence. 'The crimes Henry has been convicted of today are appalling but I can't be certain that there aren't more victims out there.' On sentencing, the Judge John Hillen said: 'You are a serial rapist. The terror you instilled in your victims, by use of weapons and words used and restraints do not bear imagining. 'Your crimes are at the highest end of wickedness and are disturbing for the public. 'You present a danger to women and present a significant risk of serious harm to the public.'","Duwayne Henry, 34, lured prostitutes to his home in Hackney, east London .

"A Maine man was found guilty of using a fake Facebook profile to lure a 15-year-old girl to her death during a botched plot to look like a hero. Kyle Dube, 21, or Orono, was convicted of kidnapping and murdering high school sophomore Nichole Cable in May of 2013. It took the jury in Penobscot County Superior Court in Bangor less than an hour to find Dube guilty and the prosecution said the speedy verdict reflected the 'overwhelming' evidence against him. Kyle Dube, 21, (mugshot left) was convicted of kidnapping and murdering 15-year-old high school sophomore Nichole Cable (right) in May of 2013 in Maine . Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber held up a picture of Cable during opening arguments on the first day of Dube's trial at the Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor, Maine . Dube planned to rescue Cable, but she died of asphyxiation and was found after an eight-day search . Dube was found guilty of staging Cable's kidnapping so he could later rescue her and be hailed as a hero. Instead, Cable died of asphyxiation and her remains were found in the woods in Old Town on May 20 after an eight-day search. Dube had covered up her body with leaves and sticks. After the verdict was announced, Cable's father began to applaud, the Bangor Daily News reported. Other friends and family of Cable began to cry, as did Dube's mother and other family members. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Marchese called the crime 'a cautionary tale'. She said. 'It's a cautionary tale to everyone to be careful when you are using social media.' During the two-week trial, the prosecution's case centered on Dube's use of a phony Facebook account to lure Cable out of her home. The profile, under the name of another man who was not involved in Cable's abduction, was traced back to Dube's home. During testimony, that man told jurors he was aware Dube didn't like him. The jury at the Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor came back with a guilty verdict after about 45 minutes . Dube's attorneys professed his innocence and said someone else must have committed the horrid crimes . DNA evidence also tied Dube to Cable's disappearance and several people, including fellow inmates and an ex-girlfriend, testified Dube confessed to the crime. The convicted felon told others that he'd intended to abduct Cable and later come to her rescue, according to police. His plan was to kidnap her while wearing a ski mask and return later without the disguise and find her. Dube's attorneys professed his innocence and said someone else must have committed the kidnapping and murder. Dube, who pleaded not guilty, did not testify. He faces 25 years to life in prison for the murder conviction and up to 30 years for the kidnapping conviction. David Walker, the superintendent of the high school Cable attended, said he has not seen a dramatic change in the way students use social media. He said: 'Hopefully they recognize that the internet isn't always a safe place. 'Everyone is reminding students of the dangers, both parents and teachers.'","Kyle Dube, 21, found guilty of kidnapping and murdering  Nichole Cable .

"Sian Gibson, 51 (pictured), consulted her GP about an unusual freckle she found on her ankle . As a redhead, 51-year-old Sian Gibson was used to having freckles — they’d covered her arms, face and chest since childhood. But in 2008, she noticed a new freckle, darker than usual and larger — the size of a small fingernail — on her ankle. ‘I don’t have many freckles on my legs, so I noticed it straight away,’ says Sian, a mother of three and grandmother of five. ‘My GP told me it was nothing and not to worry about it. But, of course, I did. At the time, there was a campaign about the importance of early detection of skin cancer. Every time I caught sight of the freckle, I would be reminded of how much I wanted to be around for my family.’ However, instead of returning to her GP to ask for a hospital appointment, Sian, from Boston, Lincolnshire, turned to her mobile phone for medical advice. ‘I’d recently got an iPhone and was downloading the apps that were just becoming available,’ she says. ‘One evening, I searched online for “large freckle” and found my way to a free app that claimed to be a mole evaluator that would identify at-risk moles. I thought: “Why not? What have I got to lose?” ’ Sian was ahead of the times. Apps, short for applications — programs that can be downloaded to run on a smartphone — were few and far between in 2008. Today, they’ve become essential to most people’s lives. With 100,000 health apps available in Britain and more launching every week, the medical sector is a market leader — with apps to track calories consumed and kilometres jogged, give first aid advice, provide cognitive behavioural therapy for phobias and remind people to take medication. One in five health apps claims to support a diagnosis, as with Sian’s mole app. One program turns your mobile phone into an electrocardiogram, tracking heart rhythms and emailing the results to a doctor, while others allow patients to record blood pressure or blood sugar. In 2013, the global market for health apps was worth $2.4 billion, according to market research firm research2guidance — and this is predicted to rise to $26 billion by 2017. The NHS has launched the Health and Symptom Checker, and the use of apps in the health service is only set to increase. Last week, it emerged that the NHS is now helping to launch apps to help people cope with depression. ‘We know people are more likely to make healthy choices if they can set their own goals,’ says Bradford GP Dr Shahid Ali, professor of digital health at Salford University. ‘And there’s evidence that with health apps, people are able to have a more grown-up relationship with their doctors and nurses.’ A handful of GPs have welcomed the technology to their practices. Dr Jagdeesh Dhaliwal, a GP in Walsall, West Midlands, says three or four of the 40 or so patients he sees a day bring along their phones to provide information from an app. ‘They might have diabetes or high blood pressure, and we’ll use the app to look at an updated graph of their latest tests to see how well they’re managing the condition.’ But critics say apps need regulation before we encourage doctors — and patients — to use them. There are no rules to regulate health apps. And Sian Gibson’s experience shows why this needs urgent attention. Sian later downloaded a health app that said it would be able to identify at-risk moles (file image) The app Sian had downloaded consisted of several pages of photos of abnormal moles. ‘I remember scrolling through them with a growing feeling of panic,’ she says. ‘But when there was nothing that looked remotely like my freckle, I thought I was off the hook. The app confirmed what the doctor had told me, and I stopped worrying.’ Two years later, though, in summer 2010, Sian scratched her ankle on her staircase and the freckle started to bleed. Yet still she didn’t worry. ‘Even when the scratch didn’t heal properly, I didn’t get alarmed. I thought it must be psoriasis, which I suffer from occasionally,’ she says. A couple of months later, Sian’s new GP caught sight of the messy spot, by then double the size, when she made a routine surgery visit. ‘He said, “That’s rather unsightly, why don’t I remove it?” He made an appointment for me the same week, and later told me he knew straight away it was a skin cancer.’ Tests showed Sian’s ‘freckle’ was the most dangerous form of skin cancer — a malignant melanoma, which was at a stage where the cancer is liable to spread to the rest of the body. ‘I owe my life to that doctor and the fact that he noticed the spot while I was in his consulting room,’ says Sian. She was referred to hospital and, in January 2011, had surgery to remove the tumour. ‘Thankfully, there was no spread. The cancer had been caught, probably just in time. Now, I have a slightly bumpy ankle and a 3 in scar.’ Sian says that there may have been a warning on the health app to check with a doctor — ‘but I didn’t see it and, in the circumstances, I don’t think I would have taken any notice’. Newer versions of mole-checking apps are more sophisticated, allowing users to photograph a mole and using mathematical formulas to check for skin cancer symptoms, such as asymmetry, irregular borders or varied colour. But they still miss two out of three melanomas, according to dermatologists at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre in a study published in 2013 in the journal JAMA Dermatology. The researchers reported this can give users ‘a false sense of security’. ‘This is very dangerous when a lesion can grow deeper and spread to other organs within a matter of months,’ says lead researcher and skin cancer specialist Dr Laura Ferris. And the fact that mole apps have been singled out in this way does not mean they are the only ones causing concern, says Dr Claudia Pagliari, director of the eHealth Interdisciplinary Research Group at Edinburgh University. It wasn't until two years later that Sian (pictured) discovered that the mole was in fact the most dangerous form of skin cancer . ‘Reports of actual harm to consumers are still rare, but this could simply mean the potential for harm hasn’t yet translated into an actual event,’ she says. But attempts by regulators in the U.S. to impose stricter controls have been unsuccessful. So while the manufacturers of Mole Detective, an app that claims to be able to ‘help to detect skin cancer earlier’ (and is downloadable in Britain) has been fined by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for making misleading claims in its advertising, the app is still doing business as normal. So, how can you know which apps you should use? There are guides that can be helpful, says Dr Dhaliwal. He recommends the NHS Health Apps Library (apps.nhs.uk) — though it is limited to less than 100, with a basic rating system. He also recommends myhealthapps.net, an independent website that lists hundreds of apps, with a ‘five heart’ rating system based on reviews by patient groups, consumers and carers globally. NHS England is to unveil a system of awarding kitemarks to trusted health apps later this year. But this will be a tricky enterprise, says Charles Lowe, chair of the Royal Society of Medicine telemedicine and e-health section. Proportion of GPs who use the internet to diagnose patients. ‘Online commerce has found ways of approving apps very quickly as they come on the market,’ he says. ‘Health apps will have to be approved with the same urgency — in days or weeks, rather than months or years, as with new drugs. But there mustn’t be any compromise to safety or efficacy.’ Whether British doctors will welcome the e-health revolution — and their patients brandishing mobile phones in the consulting room — still remains to be seen. A recent survey of family doctors found eight in ten reported patients becoming more anxious as a result of using apps. Dr Martin Scurr, Good Health’s GP, says apps ‘will never be a substitute for an appointment with the doctor’. ‘Patients sometimes email me photographs, asking for an opinion,’ he says. ‘It doesn’t work. They have to come into the surgery and be examined properly.’ Certainly, Sian Gibson has been put off health apps. ‘Obviously, my first GP got it wrong when he told me not to worry about my freckle,’ she says. ‘But on top of that, the app gave me a false sense of security. ‘Thank goodness I now have a good doctor. Thanks to him, all should be well at my five-year check-up next month. But it was a close call.’","In 2008, Sian Gibson noticed a new, larger and darker freckle on her ankle .

"It has been a multi-million pound rescue mission lasting 12 years, but 900-year-old Cardigan Castle, in Wales, is set open its doors to visitors once more in April. Tens of thousands of people are expected to flock to the historic castle, to see the results of the Cadwgan Building Preservation Trust project. It is set to be a lavish affair, with 3,000 daffodils and 1,700 rolls of turf planted in celebration of the occasion. Cardigan Castle is set to open in April, after an £12m renovation. It is hoped that the Castle will become one of west Wales’ top tourist destinations, attracting at least 33,000 visitors in the first year . The castle, which has been unoccupied since 1996, will open its doors to visitors in April, following an extensive £12m restoration project which began in 2011 . The new lease of life for the castle includes the recreation of the paths and lawns of the regency gardens, a  glass restaurant with panoramic views over the River Teifi, and the restoration of the whalebone arch – a popular feature for early 19th Century gardens. The impressive landmark has a fascinating history, from being build as a wooden Iron Age settlement by Gilbert de Clare in 1100, to enduring medieval battles between Normans and Welsh rebels, and hosting Wales' first Eisteddfod in 1176. The last inhabitant was Barbara Wood, who sold the castle in 2001 after residing there for almost 60 years. The redevelopment of the site has included the recreation of the paths and lawns of the Regency gardens and the fitting of a floor-to-ceiling glass restaurant . In 1165, The Lord Rhys and his Welsh army captured the castle and Cardigan became the first town in the country to be occupied by the Welsh . The design of some elements of the stone castle were inspired by the crusades and are the earliest examples of this work in the UK . The summer will feature events including an open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the castle, the people who lived there, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod . The castle was purchased by the council in 2003 and began being repaired as part of the regeneration of Cardigan by the CBPT charity. Jann Tucker, chair of CBPT, who was recently awarded an MBE for her efforts in preserving Welsh heritage, said: 'It's been a long time coming but the finishing post is nearly in sight. We have worked so long and so hard for this. 'The Castle will really put Cardigan on the map.' Through extensive refurbishment, and many hours work from numerous volunteers, the derelict site has been transformed into a high-end heritage attraction, luxury accommodation, restaurant and wedding and events venue. The renovation has transformed the house, previously inhabited by Barbara Wood, and restored the building for guests. Barbara was the last person to live in the castle and moved to the site as a young girl in July 1940 . Situated on raised ground overlooking the River Teifi, the site of Cardigan Castle has been an ideal location for thousands of years. This was confirmed by archaeologists in 2012 when Neolithic flint scrapers were unearthed in the castle’s grounds . Cardigan Castle has seen many battles over the years. A lesser known siege took place in 1138 when the Welsh attacked the Norman base with the help of Viking mercenaries . Cris Tomos, Castle Director, said: 'We're busy putting the finishing touches in place and are looking forward to opening ahead of the May bank holidays and summer school break. 'And there's plenty to attract visitors to the Castle over the summer months, with an exciting programme of events, from open-air theatre to music concerts, and fascinating exhibitions which tell the story of Cardigan, the Castle, the people who lived here, and its role as the birthplace of the Eisteddfod.' Funding for the grand project came from the Heritage Lottery Fund (£6m) and European Regional Development Fund (£4.3m), with the rest provided by other council and heritage trust funds. The grand opening will be Wednesday 15 April 2015. The project has seen the site transformed from a derelict building into a high-end heritage attraction, luxury accommodation, restaurant and wedding and events venue .","Cardigan Castle is  to open after 12 years of renovation on April 15, 2015 .

"The bereaved parents of a Minnesota teen with a severe dairy allergy who died from eating pancakes are suing the small town diner where he was served them. Cindy Johnson, mother of 16-year-old Scott Johnson, says she asked staff at the Minnesota Nice Cafe in Bemidji if their gluten-free pancakes were also dairy-free during a rare dining-out last June for the teen, who'd suffered from the deadly allergy since birth. Johnson was assured the pancakes were safe and watched as her son ate two of them, reads the complaint. Three days later, Scott would be dead. Assured they were okay: The bereaved parents of a teen with a severe dairy allergy who died last year after eating dairy-laced pancakes are suing the diner that served them to him . Severely allergic: 16-year-old Scott Johnson of Bemidji had been to the hospital due to dairy exposure before. His family had learned to be very careful about what and where he ate . 'He had just finished and he said ''we have to go now,""' Cindy Johnson recalled of the moments after Scott, her second of four children, ingested the fatal breakfast. Scott had suffered allergic reactions before, even from the slightest exposure to dairy. Previous trips to the emergency room had taught his family to be extremely cautious. 'If it wasn’t right, we didn’t eat until his was right,' Scott's father Steve Johnson told WCCO. However, the Johnsons say they were assured by staff at Minnesota Nice that everything would be fine. And it just so happened that Scott had forgotten to bring along his life-saving EpiPen and nebulizer that June day. Cindy rushed her son home. But when they got there, the epinephrine and nebulizer failed to calm Scott's short-circuiting immune system. 'I was eighteen miles off the highway when I got the call,' said Steve Johnson, who was two hours away on a construction job when he learned his son was in dire straits. 'Hardest thing for me was I didn’t even get to talk to him.' Special breakfast: The family didn't normally go out to eat, but Scott's sisters wanted to treat him and their mother one morning last June . Communication failure? According to the complaint, the Minnesota Nice Cafe staff assured Cindy that her son's pancakes contained no dairy. Cindy also maintains she told them the grill would have to be cleaned before Scott's pancakes were cooked on it . Doctors told the Johnsons the dairy exposure had led to anaphylaxis so severe that Scott's heart had stopped. Three days after the family breakfast, Scott died. Now the grieving mother and father are facing massive medical bills and want the Minnesota Nice Diner to take responsibility. 'Just one mistake can take someone’s life,' Cindy Johnson said. The Minnesota Nice Cafe owners are not commenting publicly on the pending case. As the case moves forward, a benefit has been organized for July at which a raffle and auction will be held to benefit the Johnsons financially. Friends of the family have also set up a GoFundMe page, where donations can be made to help the family offset the cost of medical bills. Tragic: Scott had forgotten his lifesaving EpiPen and nebulizer that day in June when his immune system went haywire at the Minnesota Nice Cafe . Cindy rushed her son home, but when they arrived his EpiPen and nebulizer didn't seem to work . 'Hardest thing for me was I didn’t even get to talk to him': Steve Johnson was two hours away at a construction job when he learned his son was being airlifted to a Fargo hospital. Three days later, Scott would be dead .","The parents Scott Johnson are suing the Minnesota diner where the 16-year-old ate his deadly last meal .

He has also had to commit to being breath-tested every week, the Gladstone Observer reports. Steve Parnell is banned from entering every single pub in Queensland (stock photo shown) The ban was handed down as one of his bail conditions at Gladstone Magistrates Court (pictured) Magistrate Mark Morrow told him the only establishment he could probably go into now is ‘Hungry Jacks and Maccas’ because they don’t serve booze. Mr Morrow said: ‘My concern is that every time he drinks he seems to become a problem.’ Police were called to Parnell’s home in Tannum Sands, a coastal town on the central east coast of Queensland, on Sunday after receiving noise complaints. The court was told at one point officers used a Taser on Parnell. Parnell will face court again on April 7 when his five charges, including two counts of serious assault will be heard.

"It's a revival of a period drama classic, so the seven million viewers who tune in to BBC1’s new hit Poldark would be forgiven for thinking they had seen some of the characters before. But, as these pictures show, it’s not just the 1970s original that the new cast bear uncanny similarities to... Ross Poldark's first love Elizabeth, as played by Heida Reed, shares the cool beauty and brunette tresses of Dancing On Ice host Christine Bleakley, the fiancee of footballer Frank Lampard. The One Show, which Christine used to present, just became The Two Show... Doubles: Helda Reed, left, who plays Poldark's first love Elizabeth, has stunning similarities to Christine Bleakley (right) Handsome leading man Aidan Turner oozes the same rugged, brooding sex appeal of tragic INXS frontman Michael Hutchence in his portrayal of Captain Ross Poldark. Poldark-a-likes: He's been turning heads as the new Poldark and it's easy to see why when he looks like tragic INXS frontman Michael Hutchence . The Australian rocker may have sung Never Tear Us Apart… but in this case Never Tell Us Apart might be more accurate. He might not be known for having the voice of an angel, but actor Kyle Soller, who plays Francis Poldark, still resembles choirboy-turned-broadcaster Aled Jones. Choirboy faces: Kyle Soller, who plays Francis Poldark (right) is the double of Aled Jones . Just don’t try to imagine him singing Walking In The Air in a dubious Cornish accent... Poldark’s drunken servant Jud Paynter and his buxom wife Prudie have a couple of comedy doppelgangers. What a couple: Podark's servant and his wife look similar to a couple of other familiar characters (below) Albert Steptoe, played by Wilfrid Brambell and Beatie Edney, aka Dawn French, could be mistaken for Poldark characters Jud and Prudie Paynter (above) Phil Davis’s scoundrel resembles sitcom rag-and-bone man Albert Steptoe (Wilfrid Brambell), and Beatie Edney looks like Vicar Of Dibley star Dawn French as she appeared in Lark Rise To Candleford. Edney is actually the daughter of another acting icon – Sylvia Sims. As volatile Captain Blamey, Richard Harrington is a million miles from laid-back charmer Des O’Connor. But put them both in a waistcoat and cravat – as Des wore on stage in The Wizard Of Oz – and the similarities are more obvious. Performers: Not alike in character but Captain Blamey ot Richard Harrington and Des O'Connor are not too different in a waistcoat and cravat . Fiery, flame-haired and prone to scandalising polite society, Poldark temptress Demelza, Eleanor Tomlinson, bears more than a physical similarity to Christine Keeler, the showgirl at the centre of the 1963 Profumo affair. Red-haired beauties: Poldark temptress Demelza, Eleanor Tomlinson (right) looks much like Christine Keeler, the showgirl at the centre of the 1963 Profumo affair .

Handsome hat-wearers Hugh Grant in the 1995 film version of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility looks like Jack Farthing, who plays George Warleggan in the drama . In his last screen role, late acting heavyweight Warren Clarke is positively Churchillian as the imposing patriarch Charles Poldark...though sadly it's the animated insurance-selling dog he resembles rather than Britain's greatest Prime Minister. Oh, no? Oh, yes... Oh yes: Late actor Warren Clarke has a barking similarity to the Churchill the cartoon dog .","Stars from the new hit drama look like other well-known characters .

"Melanie Stoddart, 38, from Prestwich in Greater Manchester, died of compression sickness shortly after arriving in the Maldives . A British tourist struck down by 'the bends' on a scuba diving trip in the Maldives died after it took nine hours to get her to a decompression chamber. An inquest heard Melanie Stoddart, 38, died of decompression sickness shortly after arriving in the Indian Ocean island for a 12-day holiday with her boyfriend. There was a delay in Ms Stoddart receiving medical help because there was initially no boat or plane to take her to hospital. And upon her arrival at hospital, medics did not even treat her for decompression sickness, the inquest into her death was told. Her parents, Peter, 68, and Irene, 64, slammed the 'sheer incompetence' of the authorities in the Maldives and warned other tourists to 'take note' before booking a similar trip. The inquest in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, heard how Ms Stoddart, an experienced diver from Prestwich in Greater Manchester, had arrived in the Maldives on April, 1, 2012 with her boyfriend Steve Greathead. She had been on the same holiday the previous year. On the third day of her organised trip, she was in a party of 12 holidaymakers and two instructors who went to Vaavu Atoll for the last scuba dive of the day just after 3pm. The inquest was told she returned to the surface after about 30 minutes and asked for medical help as she was feeling unwell. Doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive Alimatha Aquatic Resort nearby. When it became clear her condition was deteriorating the resort's doctor said she needed to be taken to a decompression chamber, but there was no transport available. A speed boat only arrived from neighbouring Bandos Island, more than 40 miles away, when insurance checks had been carried out. A doctor sedated Ms Stoddart, but decided she was not stable enough to be put in a decompression chamber. She was then transferred for a second time by boat six miles to the capital of Male where CT scans of her head and chest were taken at the ADK Hospital. But at 2.15am the next morning she went into cardiac arrest and died half an hour later. Doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive Alimatha Aquatic Resort (pictured) nearby . The court heard how Ms Stoddart, an experienced diver, had arrived in the Maldives on April, 1, 2012 with her boyfriend Steve Greathead. She had been on the same holiday the previous year . Initially a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and it took specialist tests carried out on samples of brain tissue to detect damage caused by nitrogen bubbles being present in her blood stream. Divers' disease, or 'the bends', is a condition caused from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. Consultant Pathologist Dr Andrew Hitchcock told the hearing that the minute damage caused by the bubbles and a ruptured left ear drum suggested Ms Stoddart had  decompression syndrome. Her father, Peter Stoddart, of Holmeswood, Derbyshire, told the court his daughter was a qualified diving instructor and member of a club who had dived all over the world. 'Nothing was too much for her, she never failed and was never fazed,' he said. He said the family had spotted 'discrepancies' in the reports from police and tour company Scuba Tours Worldwide which raised serious questions about the safety procedures in place. 'It's my opinion there were no proper safety procedures in place on these islands,' he said. 'For a people and a country that relies on diving for its main income I would assume there would have been. 'The time lapse was nine hours and that is just not acceptable,' he added. 'If she had been in a chamber within an hour she would have been stable enough to deal with it.' Melanie Stoddart was diving from the MV Sea Spirit (pictured) in the Maldives when she was taken ill . The ADK Hospital in the Maldives capital of Male where Ms Stoddart died in the early hours on April 4, 2012 . Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Paul McCandless said: 'Melanie was a practiced and experienced sea diver who took unwell on a dive. Due to a lack of appropriate transport at that time of day there was a delay in taking her to an appropriate facility. 'Once there, there was a partial misdiagnosis that she was not suffering from compression sickness. She was deemed to be too unwell to go into the chamber and was transferred to hospital . 'It is possible that if her condition had been diagnosed sooner that she would not have died when she did.' He added: 'Holidaymakers need to be aware of what emergency procedures are in place should any particular difficulties arise.' After the hearing Melanie's mother Irene, 64, said: 'My daughter's death was down to sheer incompetence. She received no treatment for nine hours, how can that be right?' MailOnline has contacted tour company Scuba Tours Worldwide for a comment.","Melanie Stoddart, 38, died of decompression sickness on Maldives holiday .

"Ed Miliband today admitted the race for Number 10 is 'neck and neck' as he launched Labour's election campaign at the Olympic park. The Labour leader used a speech at the top of the Orbit tower overlooking the London 2012 stadium to urge a 'spirit of optimism' and a belief that 'Britain can do better' He signalled once again that the NHS will be at the heart of his bid for power, announcing a new cap on the profits private firms can make from the health service. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband used a speech at the top of the Orbit tower overlooking the London 2012 stadium to urge a 'spirit of optimism' and a belief that 'Britain can do better' Mr Miliband laid out his pitch for power the morning after his mauling at the hands of Jeremy Paxman in the first TV contest of the campaign. Polls suggested David Cameron secured a narrow victory over his rival, but Labour strategists believe it exposed the Prime Minister's refusal to go head-to-head in a debate. Mr Miliband sought to counter claims his leadership has been too negative, vowing: Britain can do better than this'. He told activists gathered at the top of the 114metre sculpture at the heart of the Olympic Park: 'As we go out to fight this election, just remember: . 'They're the pessimists. We're the optimists. I know this election is going to be tough. 'Like so many races here during the Olympics, it may come down to the wire. Neck and neck. 'I know our opponents will throw everything they have our way.' But he insisted that Labour has 'a better plan, a better future'. Introducing Mr Miliband, deputy leader Harriet Harman said he had 'put us within touching distance of winning this general election'. Mr Miliband laid out his pitch for power the morning after his mauling at the hands of Jeremy Paxman in the first TV contest of the campaign . Mr Miliband announced a Labour government would act to ensure health services are no longer 'threatened' by privatisation . Mr Miliband announced a Labour government would act to ensure health services are no longer 'threatened' by privatisation. But he was forced to defend himself against claims that he was scaremongering by referring to 'privatisation' when no patients are expected to pay for their treatment up front. Under Labour's plans, a new profit cap - usually 5 per cent - would be set on outsourced healthcare contracts worth over £500,000, private companies would be blocked from 'cherry-picking' lucrative treatments and the NHS would become the 'preferred provider' for all services. Mr Miliband said of the profit cap: 'We do think it's right to say, when private sector companies are involved, we don't get excess profits which is draining money away from the National Health Service. 'Look, I think this is going to be common-sense thing that people will think is the right thing to do. I hope other parties adopt this because it's the right thing to do for the future of our NHS.' Mr Miliband set off on his campaign battlebus, urging supporters to be 'optimistic' for the future . Senior shadow minister Ed Balls, Ivan Lewis, Sadiq Khan, Rachel Reeves, Harriet Harman, Tristram Hunt, Yvette Cooper, Douglas Alexander and Chuka Umunna posed with Mr Miliband outside the bus . On people paying for private healthcare, he added: 'What is the real lesson of the past on this - the lesson before 1997 and a lesson I fear for the future if David Cameron were to get back in? 'It's that people end up having the option of either waiting for an unacceptably long time or having to go private - that that becomes the offer on the table for people. 'So I think there is a real fear that that becomes the option for people and you don't have a health service that is properly serving people so there's a big choice at this election and a big choice about the health service on the ballot paper.' Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘If you bankrupt the economy like Labour did last time – then you’ll put our NHS at risk. We can only have a strong NHS if we have a strong economy, but Ed Miliband doesn’t have an economic plan. ‘We all know Labour want to ‘weaponise’ the NHS but this is another policy from Ed Miliband that looks ill-thought through. It risks higher infection rates, higher waiting times and chaos for our NHS. This incompetence is exactly why Ed Miliband is simply not up to the job.’","Labour leader tries to recreate the 'spirit of optimism' of London 2012 .

"Rival fire brigades who turned up to tackle the same blaze started fighting over who should put it out - before police turned up and joined in the brawl. The conflict unfolded when firemen from Mexico's Heroic Fire Department and Ceda Fire Department were dispatched to deal with the brush fire in the capital Mexico City. But tempers frayed when both sides disagreed over who should deal with the situation and a fight broke out. Scroll down for video . Violence: Police arrived to break up a fight between rival fire brigades in Mexico City - only to end up becoming involved in the brawl . Passer-by Atanasio Rivas Matos, 25, who captured the conflict on his mobile phone, said: 'One of the groups of firemen started spraying the other group with water, who retaliated by throwing bricks at them. 'And then the police arrived.' But rather than calming the situation down, the appearance of the officers seemed to fuel the conflict and the firemen quickly turned on the police. Matos said: 'It was really bizarre. Flash point: Officers were brought in to ease tensions, but had to defend themselves after being attacked by fire fighters . 'The police were trying to separate the two groups when they came under attack from the firemen who started punching them, and then more policemen who turned up to stop the fighting were also attacked. 'It was like something out of a very bad comedy.' Now furious city officials have demanded an explanation. A spokesman for the council said: 'This was appalling behaviour from those we employ to safeguard the city. 'Instead of behaving like public officials they behaved like children in a playground. 'An investigation is underway and we will not stop until we have got to the bottom of what went on.' Meanwhile both fire brigades have blamed each other for the fracas and the attack on police.

The US president could have opted for the simpler – and cheaper – option of a live satellite link-up from the White House to appear on the late-night show. Instead he chose to fly to LA in Air Force One to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live – even enlisting aerial support from a futuristic-looking military aircraft on the way. Once in the studio, Mr Obama didn’t even have much to say beyond reading out cruel Twitter jibes and making jokes about how much time he spends on the golf course. However, his appearance on Thursday’s episode of the show was criticised by those who were faced with traffic disruption in the notoriously congested Californian city. Although the President made part of his journey by helicopter in response to previous gripes, locals still vented their fury on Twitter.

Murder suspect Rocco Zuccaro, 30, was captured on Wednesday after escaping from a psychiatric hospital on Monday afternoon . The trial of Zuccaro (right) in the killing of Pratz has been delayed several times because of mental competency issues . The murder suspect, who is originally from Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, about two hours drive from the West Virginia psychiatric hospital (pictured) Pratz, a former medical worker, was killed at his home in McKinleyville, West Virginia, on February 2013. Someone had also tried to set fire to his home before the shooting. The suspect was found incompetent to stand trial in late February.

"Retail manager Boualem Guerbi is being sued, along with Barker shoes', by two saleswomen . The 'sex-obsessed' boss at one of Britain's most exclusive shoemakers hired only 'beautiful girls with nice bodies' – and then molested them, a tribunal heard yesterday. Boualem Guerbi, 60, allegedly forced saleswomen to sit on his lap, tried to hug and kiss them, told them about visiting a nudist beach and bragged about receiving sexual offers from strangers. The married father-of-two made advances to a string of attractive recruits at Barker Shoes, which has made luxury footwear since 1880, and froze out those who dared to spurn him, the tribunal heard. Mr Guerbi even stripped to the waist in front of staff at the brand's flagship store in Regent Street, London, it is alleged. Mehrnoosh Bolhasani, 46, and Agnese Avota, 29, claim they were among his victims. Miss Bolhasani wept as she told the tribunal that he sexually assaulted her in his office and forced a female colleague to sit on his lap. Miss Bolhasani, manager of the Regent Street store, said Mr Guerbi had favourites among the 'eye candy' he hired but that his 'rampant sexual attentions' towards female staff were ignored by Barker, which sells leather shoes for as much as £470. She claimed she was 'subjected to repeated acts of sexual touching and harassment by Mr Guerbi' after joining Barker in 2010, beginning with him trying to hug her in the shop's kitchen while he was topless. She said: 'Subsequently, he often told me about his body, how good he looked and how fit he was for his age. He often told me stories about how girls approached him to talk to him and make him sexual offers. I found his conversation disturbing.' Miss Bolhasani said he also told her about a nudist beach he had discovered, adding: 'He insisted on telling me in detail about the naked people he saw there, and how they looked while they played ball. 'I had thought he was a family man and had respected him. Now I realised he was obsessed with sex.' Mehrnoosh Bolhasani, 46, left, and Agnese Avota, 29, right, pictured outside the employment tribunal where they are suing both Barker Shoes' and manager Boualem Guerbi . Miss Bolhasani claimed that in May 2012, retail manager Mr Guerbi assaulted her after telling her the rest of the staff hated her. She broke down in tears as she described the alleged incident to the Central London Employment Tribunal yesterday and could not go on. But in a witness statement, she said: 'He pulled me to him forcibly and put my legs between his. 'He pulled my face towards him and tried to kiss me. I just managed to get out. I felt traumatised.' She claimed Mr Guerbi again tried to hug her in a staff room in June 2013. She said: 'I pushed him back. I was now really scared.' She claimed she complained to her bosses that Mr Guerbi just employs 'beautiful girls with nice bodies' and said she was told that was why she had been hired. Miss Bolhasani also told how Miss Avota broke down in tears at work over Mr Guerbi's behaviour. She said: 'One day he held her face in his hands and tried to kiss her. She was shocked and tried to free herself … From that point I understood his attitude to her changed and he treated her unfairly. 'I know he approached other girls and those who refused his sexual approaches fared badly.' Mehrnoosh Bolhasani, 46, and Agnese Avota, 29, met Guerbi when they worked at Barker's flagship store on London's Regent Street, pictured . Guerbi, who hid his face as he left the tribunal, denies the pairs 'hurtful' allegations . The two women are each suing Barker and Mr Guerbi for sexual harassment, sex discrimination and victimisation. Iranian Miss Bolhasani is claiming race discrimination after Mr Guerbi allegedly ranted that 'bloody Iranians are all aggressive'. Latvian Miss Avota is also claiming sexual orientation discrimination after Mr Guerbi allegedly told colleagues he thought she was a lesbian when she cut her hair. Miss Bolhasani, of East Dulwich, south-east London, still works for the firm but is off with stress, while Miss Avota, of Hampstead, north-west London, resigned in July 2013. Algeria-born Mr Guerbi, who is a British national, strongly denies the 'hurtful' allegations. Barker is also vigorously denying the claims. Mr Guerbi admits hugging Miss Bolhasani but says that in his culture hugs and kisses on the cheek are a 'common courtesy'. He denies ever embracing Miss Avota, saying she was an 'introvert' who would not have liked it. He also insists he never accused her of being a lesbian. Company chiefs interviewed both women over their complaints but did not uphold their grievances. The tribunal continues.

"Hot off the heels of 3D-printed buildings, clothing and food, a Chinese company has crossed a national printing milestone. Tech firm Sanya Si Hai 3D unveiled China’s debut 3D-printed car on Tuesday, a radiant gold sedan dubbed Shuya. The electric-powered two-seater, which is capable of reaching speeds of up to 40 km/hr, went for a drive on the streets of Hainan province, southern China. Onlookers watch the unveiling of China’s debut 3D-printed car Shuya, capable of reaching speeds of up to 40 km/hr . Shuya’s most distinctive feature is its blazingly orange exterior, a result of the Tyrant Gold filament used to fabricate the car. The frame of the rechargeable battery-powered car was 3D-printed with a composite material, then combined with the conventionally manufactured components. Shuya was printed in five days, at a cost of $1700 (11,000 yuan.) It required 500kg of the Tyrant Gold material at about 10 yuan per kg, with an extra 1000 yuan for electricity and labour. The car is not the first of its kind-that honour belongs to American company Local Motors 3D, who unveiled the Strati back in September. The 50-part car was exhibited at the 2014 International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago.

"She was everything to me: David Robb with wife Briony McRoberts at a social event in 2012 . Nestled with the many photos and mementos of his 35-year marriage lies a letter that Downton Abbey actor David Robb wishes he had never had to read. Written by a stranger, its contents are unimaginable to most of us. Yet for David it has provided some small semblance of comfort following the suicide of his wife Briony McRoberts, recounting, as it does, the last minutes of her life. For, while on screen the distinguished actor has become a global star as Downton's Dr Richard Clarkson – keeping millions of fans guessing if his unrequited love for Isobel Crawley might end in marriage – in private, for the past 18 months he has been struggling to come to terms with Briony's death. On July 17, 2013, the woman he thought of as his rock left home and jumped in front of a train at Fulham Broadway station. She was 56. 'She was the most gentle of people – she hated it if I had even a minor altercation with anyone, so the idea that she could have done this, inflict that on herself, is something I cannot comprehend,' he says softly. Work and the close friendship of the Downton cast members – who have become like a second family to him during the past five years – has helped. 'A little squeeze on the shoulder from Maggie Smith as she leaves the make-up trailer is enough to show me I have wonderful support,' he says. 'Briony would sometimes come to Downton Abbey get-togethers with me, and became friends with the actresses Laura Carmichael and Michelle Dockery. People were attracted to Briony, she was such a vibrant person.' Like so many suicides, there was no note, no inkling of the tragedy to come. Two nights before her death she was at a drinks party swapping numbers with friends. There was even a holiday marked in the diary. 'I certainly don't believe that, when we were at the party, she was thinking she would be dead in a couple of days,' says David, who met his wife in 1975 when she was 18 and they starred together in a West End play. They married in 1978. The letter about Briony's death came from a woman who had witnessed the suicide. 'It was the most beautiful letter from a lady who had been standing beside her on the platform,' recalls David 67. 'She told me that Briony was calm, didn't seem distressed in anyway, looked almost serene. 'As the train came in it seemed as if Briony was looking over the track as if she had lost something, and then she was gone.' The actress's career had taken off when she was 19, playing Wendy Darling in a musical adaptation of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan starring Mia Farrow and Danny Kaye. She went on to star in a string of TV hits including The Professionals, Heartbeat, EastEnders and Scottish drama Take The High Road. On screen: David as Dr Clarkson in Downton Abbey with Penelope Wilton as Isobel Crawley . Briony suffered from anorexia as a teenager – something David attributes to the death of her mother from pneumonia when she was seven. But it wasn't until she turned 50 that her eating disorder returned. Ironically, as David's career flourished with the success of Downton, his wife felt hers was over, something he believes triggered the anorexia. 'It is like alcoholism,' he maintains. 'You can not touch a drink for 50 years, but you are still an alcoholic. It might have gone into mental remission for years but it was still there'. Her close friend, actress Joanna Lumley, warned Briony she would die unless she sought help when her weight dropped to six-and-a-half stone – severely underweight for her 5ft 7in frame. 'Briony felt washed up, that no one remembered her and no matter how much I reassured her she felt worthless, a failure,' David says. 'Of course she wasn't, but that is what this business can do to you, especially if you are a woman.' David admits relations between them had been strained the night before her death. 'We were meeting friends at a pub in Putney and when I arrived Briony had already had a drink,' he says. 'Being anorexic I knew she had to eat before she had a drink otherwise the alcohol was fast-acting so I was policing her for the rest of the evening. 'Walking back home later that evening, she pressed me, trying to have an argument and I wasn't having it so we were a bit sniffy with each other, but it was nothing more serious than that. 'We got up a bit earlier than usual because we had the decorators in, but Briony was doing her usual morning exercises. As she did her sit-ups, I even remember stepping over her at one point to get ready in the bathroom. 'I heard the front door close and assumed she'd gone for a long walk to clear her head. I knew she was going to meet friends to see a matinee performance in Chichester.' David, who recently played Sir Thomas Boleyn in the BBC's adaptation of Wolf Hall, admits he initially became concerned when he heard Briony's mobile phone ring. 'I'd no idea she hadn't taken it with her until I saw a text saying, 'Darling, where are you, we are in the bar?' ' he continues. Then at 4pm the police arrived with the news that Briony was dead. Warning: Briony with close friend and actress Joanna Lumley, who was worried about her friend . 'All she had on her was her wedding ring and my Oyster card [for the Underground],' he recalls. 'I understood what had happened but my heart just couldn't believe she'd done it. I remember thinking who the hell was I living my life with all these years.' The days and months that followed were a blur. 'Initially you are on auto-pilot, my friends and neighbours looked after me – every morning at 8.15am one would arrive with a coffee and a croissant,' David admits. 'Then I began to over-socialise and drink like a fish. Luckily I don't have an addictive gene and I stopped that. There were also days when I had the feeling that I just didn't want to wake up. 'Somehow you settle into a kind of rhythm and you just stagger on.' With his on-screen success, the couple were more financially secure than they'd been for years and David believed they had reached a stage in their life where they could look forward to their future. The guilt, however unwarranted, is relentless. 'It doesn't matter how much I know intellectually that it was not my fault, there is something at the heart of me that believes if I'd maybe told her I loved her more or noticed some small sign, anything...' Sweethearts: David and Briony had starred in a West End play together and were married for 35 years . Slowly David's life is changing to accommodate the new normality forced upon him, and the loss of equilibrium in his life which he is not sure he will ever get back. He is anxious not to be defined by Briony's death and the normally private actor agreed to speak to The Mail on Sunday only to highlight a moving BBC documentary which shows the devastating aftermath for family left behind after a suicide. David, who has volunteered with the Samaritans since 1987, had no doubts about returning to work there six months after Briony's death. 'Initially when I went back I wasn't on the phones, but gradually I started dealing with calls again,' he reveals. 'Maybe I have a greater understanding when someone calls to talk now, I am perhaps more aware of the little triggers.' Sadly, many of his memories of the woman who captured his heart with her charismatic personality and sparkling laughter have started to fade. 'I can't imagine cuddling her any more and I don't feel her presence anywhere – that spiritual connection, it's gone,' he says. David admits to missing the intimacy of a relationship – 'I hate the idea of being a single, old bloke' – but says Briony is an almost impossible act to follow, adding: 'She was everything to me.'","Actor David Robb and actress Briony McRoberts were married for 35 years .

"The spirit of murdered British aid worker David Haines is to live on an uplifting children's tale written by two French journalists held captive alongside him by Islamic State. Nicolas Hénin and Pierre Torres are publishing Papa Hérisson Rentrera-t-il à la Maison? – 'Will Daddy Hedgehog Ever Come Home?', on March 11. The pair, aged 39 and 30, were kidnapped in Raqqa, Syria in June 2013 and released 10 months later. David Haines and Jihadi John, since unmasked as Muhammed Emwazi, in the video of his beheading produced by ISIS (left). An idea of the British aid worker's was the inspiration behind the children's book Hérisson Rentrera-t-il à la Maison? – 'Will Daddy Hedgehog Ever Come Home?' (right) They spent time in captivity with Mr Haines, 44, a former RAF aircraft engineer who was kidnapped in March 2013 while working for an aid agency in Syria. The book's writer Mr Hénin - who has a four-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son - and illustrator Mr Torres, have now paid tribute to Mr Haines as the inspiration behind the sweet tale. It tells the tale of a father hedgehog who is carried off in a picnic basket by humans after falling into a picnic basket while foraging for food for his family. A little boy holds him captive in a box in the garden shed, saying: 'You'll be my favourite animal. I'll teach you tricks and you'll do anything I want.' The hedgehog manages to escape and heads off on a series of adventures with a cast of helpful animals, including a rat, a cat and an eagle, before finally returning home. Mr Hénin, whose five-year old daughter is almost exactly the same age as Mr Haines's youngest, Athea, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The idea was to create poetry from the obscene. 'We had dreamed together about our life after the ordeal and the meeting of our two daughters. French journalists Nicholas Hénin (left) and Pierre Torres (right) spent time with Mr Haines as ISIS captives . 'Even if he didn't write this book, his spirit is in this work. His spark is there.' Though Mr Hénin and Mr Torres both made it back to their families - the French government has denied paying a £12 million ransom for their release - Mr Haines did not as he was savagely beheaded. British militant Jihadi John, since unmasked as west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, carried out the horrific murder in September 2014. Mr Haines' name does not appear in Mr Hénin and Mr Torres' book - written on scraps of paper and card they managed to hide from their captors - but the idea for it came from a game of turning people into animals which started with the former RAF aircraft engineer. Mr Haines with his daughter Athea. Mr Hénin has a five-year old daughter almost exactly the same age . The Frenchmen chose the prickly hedgehog for their book because they are known for finding their way home even if displaced. At one point the main character spots a squashed colleague on the road he is desperately trying to cross - the only one allusion to the death of a fellow hostage. As well as Mr Haines the French pair spent time in captivity with freelance journalist John Cantlie, American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Brit Alan Henning. Mr Cantlie is still being held. Apart from him all but Mr Hénin and Mr Torres were murdered by their jihadi captors. Mr Torres paid tribute to Mr Haines as a 'great judge of character' who was expert at sorting out disputes between cellmates.","Frenchmen Nicolas Hénin and Pierre Torres were in captivity with Haines .

"They are the hands that feed; slicing, dicing, cutting, and crafting the food which sustains us. But the battle-worn fingers and scarred knuckles of the world's top chefs  are rarely on show.

The exhibition is the culmination of a ten-year photographic project to tell the stories of the people who work in the capital's favourite kitchens. From kebab shops and greasy spoons to the city's most rarefied restaurants, and all the everyday eateries in-between, Ms Wilson has captured the intriguing faces and knife and pan-wielding palms of 50 diverse and dedicated chefs. Ms Wilson said: 'I was fascinated by the scars worn with pride on the hands of the chefs I met.'

Laura Jackson of Hackney's Towpath Cafe . Mohammad Tayyab of famous Tayyabs restaurant in Whitechapel . 'It is us Londoners - in all our diversity - who have made this City the serious food capital it has become.' The exhibition is a collaborative work; writer Nellie Blundell has collected stories of the city and its kitchens to sit beside each image, and artist Caroline Hobkinson has created a banquet table revealing the often unlikely foods the featured chefs actually eat while working. Proceeds from the sale of prints at the exhibition will be donated to London-based food charity, FareShare. FareShare rescues good food that would otherwise go to waste and delivers it to other charities to help feed people in need and benefit the planet. Last year they redistributed enough food for 13.2 million meals, feeding 82,100 people every day.

"Only Gordon Ramsay could take asparagus, fructose and shiitake mushrooms and come up with a recipe for teaching his children how to swear without causing offence. The chef, known for his use of expletives, has revealed he is teaching daughters Megan, Matilda and Holly and son Jack ‘some really nice alternatives to curse words’. Ramsay, presenter of The F Word on Channel 4, tells them to say ‘shiitake’ instead of ‘s***’, ‘asparagus’ instead of ‘a**’ and ‘fructose’ in place of ‘f***’.

Ramsay said that he replied: ‘I said: ‘Well it’s a Japanese mushroom, it’s delicious, now f*** off.’’ The chef has long been known for his bad language - but this is the first time that he has admitted that he is teaching the same to his children, who are aged between 12 and 16. In an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live in the US, he said: ‘I tried to teach them some side language. Known for his use of expletives: The chef, who was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland, has gained fame on shows such as Hell's Kitchen and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares . 'So I said: ""Look, cursing is not smart, it’s an industry language and sometimes daddy lets it slip - 20 times a day."" So I come up with some really nice sort of alternatives to curse words. 'So rather than saying the word s***, which you know, is not nice - shiitake. And instead of the F word? Fructose. Rather than saying a**, it’s asparagus.’ Ramsay has admitted to unconventional parenting in the past and has told his children that cooking is a ‘life skill’ - and is more important than passing exams.

"Scandal: D.E. Paulk discovered his father was actually his uncle, the Archbishop of one of America's biggest 'mega-churches', when he was 34 . A mega-church pastor who discovered at the age of 34 that his Archbishop uncle was actually his father has revealed how he found peace: by founding a 'radically inclusive' church that recognises Mohammed as well as Christ. D.E. Paulk, 42, was brought up in the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill. Once the fourth biggest 'mega-church' in the United States, it occupied a purpose-built, $12million building with 7,000 seats, and boasted 12,000 members at its peak in the early Nineties. But a series of sex scandals and financial difficulties brought the church established by D.E.'s parents and uncle to its knees. Speaking to CNN, D.E. has revealed how it was the family's ultimate scandal - the fact his Archbishop uncle was his biological father - which finally gave him the strength to create a church based around his own beliefs. The Spirit and Truth Sanctuary, which D.E founded in 2012, welcomes everyone from Wiccans to atheists, Hindus to Muslims, recognising all gods and prophets, including Mohammed. '[Scandal] has a way of wiping out the things that keep you from being authentic,' he said. 'All you have left is who you are. The games are gone... If there was anything I wanted to say I thought would be unacceptable to the church, now is the time to say it.' After much soul searching, D.E. established his church based around one principle: 'Christ cannot be, and will not be, restricted to Christianity'. He preaches a message of inclusion, and tells his congregation 'the truth' is not limited to the Bible, but can be found in all creation - even other religions. This message has been controversial, however, and many of his former followers have abandoned him. Scroll down for video . Success: Archbishop Earl Paulk, left, was D.E.'s biological father, while his brother, Donnie, right, acted as his father until he was 34. The two brothers set up the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill with Donnie's wife Clariece in 1960, creating one of the first churches to welcome people of all colours . Heir: D.E., the family's only son, pictured leading a service, was always intended to take over the church, but became disillusioned with the institution when he discovered the truth about his parentage . It is likely this particular philosophy would have horrified his uncle, a tyrannical figure who led the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit from its inception in 1960. Set up with his brother Donnie and his wife Clariece, Holy Spirit was one of the first churches to accept both African Americans and whites worshipping together, and at one point was attracting 100 new members a week. It would grow to be the fourth largest church in America, recognised by then-president George Bush for its volunteering work in 1982. By 1991, the church had 12,000 members, and a cathedral with a 245-foot steeple. Its pastors had acted like minor celebrities, travelling by private jet, charging as much as $7,500 per appearance and collecting their own 'groupies', who would reportedly get them dressed and even wipe the sweat from their faces. And D.E., as the only boy born to either of the brothers, was set to inherit it all - a fact which had been impressed on him from the age of nine. Fall from grace: The church, which grew to 12,000 members, was rocked by a series of sex scandals in the early Nineties, causing many of its members to lose their faith . Secrets: Earl would also turn out to be D.E.'s father - a fact the tyranical pastor would continue to deny . But the church began to implode: Earl - now 'Archbishop Earl' - was implicated in a series of sex scandals, some of which were settled out of court. The Archbishop was also accused of slurring a congregant as a lesbian, threatening another with a .38 gun, and pretending never to watch television while hiding one in his cupboard. He could be so ruthless that his secretary, LaDonna Diaz, D.E.'s sister, would often leave his office crying. Then, in 2007, it was revealed D.E.'s father was not Donnie, 76, but Earl. Clariece, who had tried to hide her secret for more than three decades, claimed that 'it was no more than insemination'. Nonetheless, this would mark a turning point for D.E. Pain: After Earl's death in 2009, D.E.went through a great deal of soul-searching and decided to open his own church that recognised all faiths . Earl died in 2009 aged 81, and D.E. sold the cathedral for $17.5million shortly afterwards. Three years later, D.E. opened a new, 'radically inclusive' church, which bills itself as 'the trendiest, friendliest, most radically inclusive worshipping experience in Atlanta'. But it horrified many of D.E.'s conservative Christian followers. D.E. told CNN: 'They can tolerate all the sexual scandals and the lawsuits, but when you invite a Muslim or a gay person to church, that's the scandal you leave for?' The church, which has 700 members, is going from strength to strength.","D.E. Paulk, 42, runs a controversial church where all religions are equal .

"A nine-year-old girl has been praised by police after grabbing the steering wheel and driving her family including her little sister to safety when her mother had a seizure in the driver's seat. Jacey Jones, who is in the fourth grade, was traveling down a curvy road in Bay City, Michigan, with her younger sibling and mother, Samantha Jones, last September when the latter started fitting. As Mrs Jones fell unconscious, Jacey, who was in the back seat of her family's Hyundai, climbed into the front and took hold of the wheel. She then drove the short distance to her school's parking lot. There, she drove the car around in circles until she attracted the attention of a passing parent. The adult then opened the vehicle's door and put it in park, before lifting the girls out and calling 911. Scroll down for video .

"Justice for Steward: Leonardo Espinal, 49, has been sentenced to 20 years to life in prison for killing his 5-year-old son by lacing his children's pizza with rat poison . A New York City man has been sentenced to 20 years to life in prison for killing his 5-year-old son and sickening his 7-year-old daughter with pizza spiked with rat poison because he was angry with his ex-wife. After learning that his former spouse was seeing another man, Leonardo Espinal, 49, took it out on their children in November 2012 by tainting their meal with a deadly poison, Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said Thursday after the sentencing. The little girl, Mia, threw up after eating the pizza. When her brother, Steward, soiled himself, their father took him into the bathroom. He then called Rosaura Abreu and threatened to commit suicide telling her, 'what is about to happen is your fault.' Espinal and Abreu had been together for about a decade before she kicked him out of their apartment two weeks before the domestic drama. The woman made a frantic phone call to Espinal's stepmother, who then contacted police. Officers broke down the bathroom door, only to find Espinal in the tub cradling his son's lifeless, naked body. Steward died from a combination of the poison and being submerged in water. Mia Espinal was found sleeping in her own vomit on the couch. Innocent: Steward Espinal, 5, was found dead in the bathtub from a combination of the poison and being submerged in water in November 2012 . Espinal (center) did not speak in court, but the presiding judge told him she was glad to send him to prison . Impact statement: Assistant District Attorney Jill Starishevsky (right) read aloud an emotional impact statement composed by Steward and Mia's mother . At his sentencing Thursday, Espinal did not speak, but Justice Troy Webber had a strong message for the child killer. 'If only he had ingested that pizza and it had done its job,' she said, according to New York Daily News. The judge wondered aloud how a parent, or any human being, could commit such a heinous crime, and said: 'I'm glad to put you in prison.' Rosaura Abreu delivered an emotional victim impact statement that was written in Spanish, translated into English and read by a prosecutor in court. 'I will never forget the last time I saw my little son. ... He was radiant, happy, content and followed me all around the house. 'When it was time for me to leave, he followed me to the door and I knelt down to talk with him.  It's as if my heart knew that it would be the last time I would see him alive.' On November 6, 2012, Steward told his mother that he loved her as she was about to leave their University Heights apartment. They hugged and she said 'that I loved him from the bottom of my heart, more than own life.' After the crime, Mia Espinal suffered anxiety attacks at the mere mention of returning to the apartment. Crime scene: The murder took place in the family's West 179th Street apartment in The Bronx . 'She never wanted to sleep in the same bed where she slept with her Steward, protecting him from monsters,' their mother said. Therapy has helped them, but is by no means a cure-all. 'Mia suffers a great deal when she goes to parties, when she goes to bed, when she plays with other children, when she sees photos of him, when she sees another boy the same age as him, when she sees me sad because she knows I am thinking of him,' Abreu said. Espinal pleaded guilty last month to murder and attempted murder. 'All we can do,' said Abreu, 'is take it day by day.' Assistant District Attorney Jill Starishevsky stated: 'Mia will have to live the rest of her life with the horrific memory that her own father caused in attempting to kill her,' according to News 12 The Bronx.","Leonardo Espinal, 49, pleaded guilty last month to murder and attempted murder in the death of his son, Steward, in November 2012 .

"It was planned as a publicity stunt to send a strong message that China is cracking down on illegal trade and counterfeiting. But when villagers realised officials in Xuzhou, east China's Jiangsu province, had stockpiled a 35-ton heap of fake goods to burn, they decided to help themselves before dozens of counterfeit designer shoes and clothes went up in flames. Locals fought their way to the vast pile to lay their hands on everything from fake cosmetics and computer parts to soya milk, using iron hooks and bamboo baskets to reach items, according to the People's Daily Online. Villagers descended on a vast pile of counterfeit goods collected in China that was planned to be incinerated, grabbing designer shoes and clothes as well as soya milk and other food from the 35-ton 'mountain' Word soon spread, drawing crowds of people who described the pile as a 'mountain of treasure.' Locals were seen pilfering anything they could from the vast pile, and stuffing goods and dozens of boxes into cars, trucks and even wheelbarrows. Among the items grabbed were food, healthcare products, cosmetics and computer parts. The 35.7 tonnes of counterfeit goods had been stockpiled by authorities in the city of Xuzhou where they were being kept before being destroyed. But when locals heard that the the huge pile worth 285,000 Chinese Juan (£30,500) was to be burned, they went along to have a look. When they saw that many of the items had not been incinerated yet, they started helping themselves. As word spread that many items had not yet gone up in flames, locals descended on the area . Lok Shen, 36, said: 'It was like a mountain of treasure just sitting there. 'There weren't any guards around and it seemed a waste to burn it all, so we took what we wanted.' Word spread and the place was soon swarming with looters grabbing boxes of anything they came across and stuffing them into the backs of cars, trucks and even into wheelbarrows. The public burning was just one of many that have taken place across the country as part of a crackdown on counterfeit goods, with the sign of bulldozers crashing bottles of spirits and counterfeit fireworks being set alight. Dozens of boxes were piled into the back of vans as villagers made off with their spoils, saved from the fire . The 35 ton pile was destined for the incinerator as part of China's crackdown on illegal trade and counterfeiting . Opportunists seized anything they could lay their hands on - including fake food stuffs and soya milk . This publicity stunt was planned to be slightly different, with goods being incinerated to generate energy. It was estimated that for every ton burned 550kwh of electricity would be generated. Officials in Jiangsu attempted to stop any further looting and asked people to return goods they had taken. Many people were unaware of the risks of pilfering fake items, particularly food. A local government spokesman said: 'We are looking at ways of making sure it doesn't happen again.' Boxes containing fake shoes, clothes and other items were grabbed by villagers and loaded onto vans . Locals used anything they could lay their hands on, including sticks of bamboo, to grab fake items . But local man Lok explained: 'If no one else wants them then I don't see why we shouldn't help ourselves. 'They may be fake but they are still good, and this way the counterfeiters aren' t getting any money and we are disposing of the items in a much more environmentally friendly way.' In 2013 Chinese officials set fire to a pile of fake wine, cigarettes, handbags and cosmetics  in Guiyang, southwest China's Guizhou Province.","Officials in Xuzhou collected a 35-ton pile of counterfeit items for burning .

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the money would support a new regional task force designed to target the Islamic extremists in northern Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin area. It came as the Nigerian military said it has destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the money would support a new regional task force designed to target the Islamic extremists in northern Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin area . Mr Hammond said 'important gains' were being made in taking on Boko Haram, as talks were being held in at the UN in New York. Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin will contribute to the task force, which has been authorised by the African Union. Talks are taking place in New York to endorse the unit via a United Nations' security resolution. Mr Hammond said: 'The UK fully supports the efforts of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin to tackle the scourge of Boko Haram. 'I hope that the international community can send an important message of support through the swift adoption of a security council resolution in New York to welcome the force. 'Important gains are already being made on the ground in tackling Boko Haram by the regional partners who will contribute to the task force. 'It will continue to play an important role in fighting this terrorist insurgency. I commend the commitment and bravery of the troops involved. 'The UK continues to stand strong with Nigeria and its neighbours in tackling this heinous group.' Earlier this week it emerged that Boko Haram had abducted hundreds of women and children  from primary schools  to use them as 'human shields'. The Islamic militants took adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak as troops from Niger and Chad approached a month ago, Mike Omeri, the Nigerian spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, confirmed this week. When the soldiers arrived, they found the town largely deserted - with local reports suggesting as many as 500 people were taken in the raids.

Brutal: Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau (pictured) declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August . Today the official Twitter account for the Nigerian Defense Headquarters announced 'FLASH: Troops this morning captured Gwoza destroying the Headquarters of the Terrorists self-styled Caliphate.' It followed with 'Several terrorists died while many are captured. Mopping up of entire #Gwoza and her suburbs is ongoing.' Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August. Earlier this month Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, formally recognising Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their spiritual leader. It was not possible to verify this morning's morale-boosting announcement, which comes just one day before critical presidential elections in Nigeria. The Twitter messages made no mention  of military operations in Sambisa Forest, where Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremist group is believed to have several camps. Warplanes have been bombarding the area for weeks. The forest starts about 20 miles from Gwoza town, which is 80 miles southeast of Maiduguri - the Borno state capital state and Boko Haram's birthplace.","Support for new regional task force designed to target Islamic extremists .

"Fewer families are taking holidays during term time in the wake of a government crackdown on absenteeism, new figures suggest. The number of days missed by holidaying pupils decreased by almost a third in the past year after a ban on taking children out of lessons for trips. Parents have been fined up to £1,000 and even taken to court since the new policy came into force in September 2013. Drop: Figures reveal just 3million school days were missed by pupils last year - down 1.4million on 2012-13 . Yesterday, Department for Education figures showed 3million days were missed for holidays in 2013-14, down from 4.4million in 2012-13. The latest figure represents a decrease of more than two fifths from 2009-10, when 5.3million days were missed. Government statisticians said the drop has been fuelled by a fall in the number of authorised breaks - trips approved by the school. There has been a slight rise in the number of unauthorised holidays - indicating that some parents may be deciding to take their child out of school without permission, and instead run the risk of a fine. The latest figures, for the last academic year, are the first to show the impact of strict new rules on pupil absence introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove. Under the changes, heads are now only able to grant leave in ‘exceptional circumstances’ and parents can be fined £60 per pupil for taking term time holidays without permission. The cost rises to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Fines: The drop is being credited on the new fines system, which sees parents landed with a £60 penalty if they take their children out of school for an 'unauthorised' absence . Those who fail to pay can face prosecution, with a maximum fine, if convicted, of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The National Association of Head Teachers released guidance stating exceptions could be made for family funerals and religious events, but family holidays were unlikely to meet the criterion. Campaigners have said the rules impact the hardest on poorer families who cannot afford high travel costs during school breaks, and families with parents that work shifts on or rosters. Travel companies increase their prices significantly in peak seasons when there is more demand. School Reform Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘Every single lost day counts - which is why as part of our plan for education we have put teachers back in charge so they can clamp down on classroom absence. ‘Fewer school days are being lost than ever before thanks to our reforms - giving children the best possible chance to succeed.’","Three million days missed last year, say Department for Education figures .

"Council worker Maria Spruce, 40, spent £3,500 of taxpayers' money on iPads, phones a laptop for her 'spoilt' son . A disgraced council worker who used taxpayers' cash to go on a £3,500 spending spree on iPads and mobile phones for her 'spoilt' teenage son has been spared jail. Maria Spruce, 40, was trusted with a local authority credit card but used it to buy the top-of-the-range products and a laptop computer. Town hall bosses at Wolverhampton City Council became suspicious while Spruce, an electoral registration assistant, was on a three-week holiday to Australia last November. They discovered that she had made 47 unauthorised purchases on the card, totalling £3,517, over a six-month period last year. Spruce admitted once count of fraud by position but was spared jail when she appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday. She was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. Judge John Warner said: 'You had been trusted with the credit card but used it in a dishonest way. 'I accept that you were under pressure at home in relation to your son but many people have those sorts of pressures but get on with their life without resorting to dishonesty.' The court heard that Spruce, of Bilston, in the West Midlands, bought the items for her son who was 'very controlling and aggressive'. Prosecutor Joanne Barker said: 'A colleague covering the duties of the defendant opened a credit card statement and saw it had been used for purchases that were not legitimate office business. 'She told her employer that she had bought the items for her son who was very controlling and could be aggressive towards her.' Wendy Miller, defending, said: 'This was not a sophisticated fraud and was always going to be detected. 'She was trying to satisfy her only son who is difficult to control. The items bought for herself were few and far between.' Town hall bosses at Wolverhampton City Council (pictured) discovered that Spruce had made 47 unauthorised purchases on the card . Spruce admitted once count of fraud by position and was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years . The court was told that her son is now living with his father and Spruce will have to sell her house because she is unable to pay the mortgage after losing her job. A former neighbour of Spruce said: 'She bent over backwards for her son. He was very spoilt but she never gave him the discipline he needed. 'She probably felt guilty about being a single mum but she allowed herself to be completely manipulated by him.' Speaking after the sentencing, Wolverhampton councillor Paul Sweet said the sentence sent out a 'strong message'. 'The city council operates a zero tolerance policy on fraud and corruption and takes all allegations of fraudulent activity made to us extremely seriously,' he said. 'We will not hesitate to take action if we suspect fraud has been committed against the council - and, as a result, taxpayers - and we will make every effort to recover all monies stolen from the council.'","Maria Spruce, 40, spent £3,500 of taxpayers' money on her 'spoilt' son .

"A woman left her 16-month-old daughter alone in an Ibis hotel room overnight and was arrested for child neglect when she returned at 2.30am with a man . A mother who left her 16-month-old daughter alone in a hotel room while she went for a night out with a friend has been given a police caution for neglect. The Mexican woman left the Ibis hotel at around 7.30pm when she went to meet a friend and left her child alone until she returned at about 2.30am with a man, the family division of the High Court in London heard. Staff heard the little girl, realised that she was alone and called police. The woman was arrested when she returned to the Ibis, and accepted a caution by police. Her daughter was taken into police protection. Details of the case were revealed as a judge made a ruling on a family court dispute between the parents of the young girl. Mr Justice Peter Jackson was told that the woman had become involved in a legal fight with the little girl's English father - her estranged husband - who was also in his early 30s. He said he had been asked to make decisions on the latest stage of that litigation at a family court hearing. The judge said the woman and the child, now two, had been in England visiting the man at the time of the hotel incident last year. He did not say where the hotel was. Mr Justice Jackson said the little girl had been taken into police protection following her mother's arrest - and placed with her father. A judge had subsequently barred the woman from removing the child from the jurisdiction of England and Wales following an application by the father, Mr Justice Jackson was told. Mr Justice Jackson said he had become involved after the woman asked to be allowed to take the little girl back to Mexico. The family division of the High Court heard details of the neglect as a judge refused an application by the girl's mother, who is from Mexico, to take her back to the country. She is currently living with her father . He ruled against her after analysing issues relating to the toddler's 'habitual residence'. The judge concluded that the little girl had not been wrongfully retained in England by the father under the terms of an international legal convention. He was told that the couple had met in Mexico six years ago after the father travelled abroad for work. The judge said the family could not be identified.","Mother left her daughter overnight in an Ibis hotel while she went out .

"Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address the US Congress after accepting an invitation to visit the White House. US President Barack Obama will host the Pope on September 23, after extending an invitation during talks at the Vatican last year. The White House said the president and the pope will continue a dialogue about poverty, the environment, immigration and promoting religious freedom. Papal first: Pope Francis has announced his intention to address the US Congress during a stateside visit in September--which will make him the first pope to ever do so . 'The president looks forward to continuing this conversation with the Holy Father during his first visit to the United States as pope,' a statement said. The 78-year-old leader of the world's Roman Catholics confirmed late last year that he would visit the United States to take part in a Catholic Church congress in Philadelphia. During the trip, he will also address the United Nations in New York and become the first pontiff to address the US Congress. Obama and Francis met for the first time at the Vatican in March last year in talks clouded by disagreements over provisions for contraception included in the US leader's landmark health care reforms. Dialogue: Pope Francis will continue a dialogue about poverty, the environment, immigration and promoting religious freedom . Obama has regularly spoken of his admiration for Francis, repeatedly praising the pontiff for his compassion and modesty. 'As a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us, he carries forth the message of love and compassion that has inspired the world for more than two thousand years - that in each other we see the face of God,' Obama said last year. Francis is also widely credited with helping to kickstart the secret diplomacy between Cuba and the United States which culminated with the two Cold War rivals declaring a historic rapprochement last year. According to a Vatican statement, Francis wrote letters to US and Cuban leaders and 'invited them to resolve humanitarian questions of common interest, including the situation of certain prisoners, in order to initiate a new phase in relations between the two parties.'

"The Phoenix Zoo has confessed to what it's calling an 'em-bear-assing' mistake regarding one of its animals. Park officials were planning to transfer Luka to Nashville, Tennessee, when they discovered that the two-year-old Andean bear is a female, not a male as thought. According to keepers, the species' genitalia are highly undeveloped before the age of two, making it very difficult to determine gender. The Phoenix Zoo was planning to transfer Luka to Nashville, Tennessee, when they recently discovered that the Andean bear is a female, not a male as thought (above pictured in July 2013, left, and a year later, right) Apparently the Andean bear - native to South America - is also particularly difficult to sex because there has been limited captive breeding across the U.S. Many have been incorrectly sexed as cubs at other facilities in the past, the Phonenix Zoo notes. Luka was the first Andean cub successfully born and raised at the park. She was given her first medical exam at four months old when her gender was determined. She hadn't been handled too much since the check-up, as employees felt she was doing 'very well' with her mother, Rio. The animal hadn’t been handled too much since her first check-up at four months old - when her sex was determined - as employees felt she was doing very well with her mother, Rio (pictured together, above) It wasn’t until last week, when Luka underwent a routine examination and health evaluation that it was found 'he' was actually a female bear. The zoo said Luka still might go to Nashville, but now that they know she's a 'she', it opens up other options for the bear's participation in a breeding program. Experts called the mistake 'great news for the management of this rare bear'. The concluded: 'All births are critically important for this species as they are so rare in zoos, and having another young female is beneficial to the entire breeding program and survival of the species.'","Park officials were planning to transfer the animal to Tennessee when they discovered they had got the sex wrong .

"Doctor David Bardens, pictured above, took biologist Stefan Lanka to court and won . A German biologist who offered 100,000 euros to anyone who could provide scientific evidence that the measles virus existed, has been ordered to pay up by a court. Skeptic Stefan Lanka made the undertaking in an advert that he posted online several years ago. Doctor David Bardens attempted to claim the prize after providing the biologist with a  comprehensive study that had been published in a medical journal. Lanka was hauled before a German Court when he failed to uphold his side of the bargain and pay up, reported The Local. A Judge in the regional court in Ravensburg, South Germany, ruled in the favour of Dr Bardens and found that he had met the criteria of the advert. Lanka claims that the illness is not a virus and is psychosomatic, according to the BBC. He has reportedly said that he will now appeal the decision, according to The Local. Germany is currently in the middle of a debate about whether vaccinations should be made compulsory after a recent outbreak of the virus. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and can sometimes lead to serious complications. Scroll down for video . It is now very uncommon in the UK due to the effectiveness of the MMR vaccination, according to the NHS. In the US public health officials are struggling to persuade more parents vaccinate their children. In some states, the number of parents seeking exemptions from school attendance vaccination requirements has been inching up. The rise has come despite unsettling outbreaks of some vaccine-preventable diseases that had nearly disappeared from the United States. 'I think we're all kind of frustrated,' said Stephen Morse, a Columbia University infectious disease expert. In West Africa scientists are warning that hard-to-treat areas that have already been hit by Ebola are now at risk of a measles outbreak. Ebola derailed child immunisations in  Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, leaving hundreds of thousands more children vulnerable to the more routine infections, researchers said. Measles epidemics often follow humanitarian crises because 'measles is so incredibly contagious,' explained Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Justin Lessler, who led the study published in the journal Science. 'Measles is not the only health threat that has been made worse by the Ebola crisis, and may not even be the most dire, but it is one we can do something about,' he added.

"A female NASA astronaut has shared the hair-raising experience of getting a salon trim while floating through space. In a video uploaded to Vine, Italian-born Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, is seen getting a wash and cut courtesy of commander Terry Virts. As her short dark crop is trimmed into shape, she uses a small vacuum to prevent stray hairs from floating away and clogging filters. She also clings tightly to a rail to ensure she maintains a steady position in the microgravity environment. An 'after' photograph of the salon session shows it was a success, with no strands out of place or chunks missing. Virts, 47, of Baltimore, Maryland, joked that he could be gearing up for a 'second career after astronaut'. Scroll down for video . Out of this world: In a video uploaded to Vine, Italian-born Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, is seen getting a wash and cut courtesy of commander Terry Virts - the duo are currently on a six-month mission with Expedition 43 to the International Space Station . He and Cristoforetti are currently on a six-month mission with Expedition 43 to the International Space Station. They are set to return to Earth on May 14. To date the clip of their hairdressing antics has been watched more than 50,000 times. Many fans have thanked them for sharing the behind-the-scenes footage. It's not the first time Virts has cut Cristoforetti's hair. On January 1 he gave the flight engineer a trim to ring in the New Year, with photographs uploaded to Twitter. Luckily her short hair is easy to manage but female astronauts with longer locks often find 'bad hair days' are part of the job. In 2013, Karen Nyberg revealed how it was difficult to wash her long blonde hair in space. The mechanical engineer was on board Expedition 36 to the International Space Station at the time. In a video uploaded to Twitter Ms Nyberg was seen placing water on to her scalp, battling with a few escaping bubbles. Smooth hair: A head shot of Cristoforetti before her space mission .

She then worked leave-in shampoo through her hair. It was seen stood on its end as she worked a comb through it. Her tools were stuck to the wall beside her to prevent them from escaping. To finish, she towel-dried her head dry. She claimed the results left her barnet feeling 'squeaky clean' For men, shaving is the same as it is on Earth. Although, again, they  use a vacuum device so that stray hairs do not to float away. Elsewhere on the grooming front, astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers as water clings to the body instead of running down it in microgravity, . There is a limited supply of water on the International Space Station (ISS)  - no more than 4 liters per wash - so taking sponge baths also saves water. In microgravity, water clings to the body instead of running down it, so astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers. There is a limited supply of water on the International Space Station (ISS) so taking sponge baths also saves water. In space, astronauts use a no-rinse shampoo to wash their hair, and apply the shampoo using a towel, vigorously rub their hair and scalp. They then use a towel to wipe their hair clean. The reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs don't float around the station. 'Astronauts must not let loose hairs fall off the towel because floating hairs can create a safety hazard since they can be inhaled or aggravate an astronauts' eyes,' explained the Canadian Space Agency. 'Loose hair can also clog filters and affect air circulation and filtration.' Shaving in space is similar to shaving on Earth; astronauts just have to be careful not to let stray whiskers escape into the air, like with a haircut. Astronauts shave with foam or an electric razor, but most are said to prefer the latter, because it doesn't require water and automatically collects hair. And, no water is wasted, because as it dries on a person's head, it is collected by the air conditioning system, which turns it into condensate and then into drinking water. Space woman: It's not the first time Virts has cut Cristoforetti's hair - on January 1 he gave a trim to ring in the New Year, with photographs uploaded to Twitter .

As their bodies are not working against the force of gravity, astronauts exert little effort to get around. Therefore, they face bone density and muscle loss if they don't keep their fitness levels in check during missions. To enable them to use gym equipment in zero-g, they wear harnesses and bungee straps. Cristoforetti says training and nutrition is very important to her while working in such tough conditions.","Italian-born Samantha Cristoforetti, 37, is seen getting a wash and cut courtesy of commander Terry Virts .

"Fight: Hannah Kingsley threatened to cut the throat of a 10-year-old girl who argued with her daughter . A mother threatened to cut the throat of a 10-year-old girl who had an argument with her daughter, a court heard. Hannah Kingsley screamed, 'Don't shout at my child' and swore at the girl while holding a knife following an ongoing neighbourhood dispute. The 45-year-old avoided jail over the incident, but was given a 12-month community order at Teesside Crown Court. Prosecutor Shaun Dodds said Kingsley, from Middlesbrough, intervened after the little girl had an argument with her daughter. 'She appears with a knife, shouting at the child,' he said. 'While holding the knife she shouts, ""Don’t ever shout at my child, if you do I will cut your throat,"" and various expletives.' The court heard both sets of parents then became involved, leading to a fight in which Kingsley's partner Cornell Brown brandished a cosh. He was given a suspended jail sentence in a separate set of proceedings. Kingsley pleaded guilty to having a blade in a public place. The court heard she had previous convictions for dishonesty and drugs offending, but no history of violence. Scott Taylor, defending, told the court Kingsley had moved since the incident in July last year and she had no further contact with the family. Recorder Andrew Dallas said: 'There is obviously a background here and she appears to acknowledge the stupidity of what she did. 'Brandishing a knife in a public place in these circumstances was a foolish thing to do. 'It it had gone any further you would have been going to prison today.

"A former soldier is suing a hospital in Romania after he went to have a kidney operation and ended up having his penis amputated. Costica Maroleanu, 55, had gone to the County Hospital in the town of Buzau in eastern Romania suffering from kidney failure. Although the operation, carried out by surgeon Dr Iurie Ciochina, was successful, a nurse subsequently fitted his catheter incorrectly, causing Mr Maroleanu's genitalia to become severely infected and leaving doctors with no option but to remove the penis in order to save his life. Victim: Costica Maroleanu, 55, had gone to the County Hospital in the town of Buzau in eastern Romania suffering from kidney failure but an incorrectly-fitted catheter left his penis severely infected . Speaking of the botched catheter fitting, Mr Maroleanu said: 'After the operation they told me there were some complications. Apparently the nurse had not properly fitted a small plastic pipe to help me urinate, and my penis became red and infected. 'I was moved to intensive care and four days later was moved to the nephrology department where they took a sample, but then they just left me there for 10 days. Eventually they did an operation, but then doctor went on holiday.' Shortly afterwards Mr Maroleanu was transferred to the Bucharest Military Hospital. There he underwent a series of examinations with doctors concluding that the only thing they could do was to amputate the infected penis, otherwise there was a strong possibility he would die. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'The foreskin was stripped away completely and most of the cells in the organ were dead. 'The member was black and the only remaining skin was at the base of the shaft and highly infectious. It was recommended to remove the necrotic elements, meaning amputation.' Surgeon: Although the operation, carried out by Dr Iurie Ciochina (pictured), was successful, a nurse subsequently fitted his catheter incorrectly, causing Mr Maroleanu's genitalia to become severely infected . Speaking of this shock after the operation, Mr Maroleanu said: 'It was totally cut off. Now I urinate through an orifice that doctors made between my anus and my testicles. 'I urinate just like a woman. I'm devastated.' Now the former soldier is demanding £362,450 compensation from the original hospital for malpractice. He said: 'If they hadn't botched things up at the beginning this wouldn't have happened.' But Professor Nicolae Calomfirescu, head of Romania's Sexual Medicine Association said: 'I'm not sure he will win by saying he is devastated and has to go to the toilet like a woman. 'It depends on the patient's image of himself. If you cut my right hand with me being a surgeon, I will be devastated. If you cut the left hand of a violinist, he will be devastated,' he said. 'But should he be devastated by the loss of his penis? I would say the man needs to be evaluated by a psychologist,' he added.","Costica Maroleanu went to County Hospital in  Buzau for kidney surgery .

"Kidney stones are very common — larger stones often need surgery to remove them. John Cousins, 46, a divorced father of two who lives near Southampton, came up with a novel way to help surgeons during his operation, as he tells Angela Epstein. John Cousins (pictured) did not realise he was suffering from kidney stones until he collapsed from an unrelated condition last November . THE PATIENT . My kidney stone took me by surprise — I only discovered I had one after I collapsed with an unrelated condition last November. I run a 3D printing company which makes bones out of plaster of Paris for surgeons to use as practice models for complex orthopaedic operations. During a presentation to surgeons, I was suddenly floored by an agonising pain radiating across my lower stomach. I was taken to Southampton General Hospital, where I was shocked to learn I had an appendicitis. My appendix was removed that night. However, scans also revealed a large stone in my right kidney. Despite its size — 3.5cm by 2.5cm — it had given me none of the usual symptoms, such as pain or blood in the urine. Apparently it had developed because I had a kidney infection, which I didn’t even realise. The doctors said it might grow even bigger, so I was told I’d need further surgery to cut out the stone. It was a lot to take in while also facing having my appendix removed. But I’ve had operations on my knees, back and for hernias, and after my appendix agony I didn’t want even more pain from a growing stone. After they removed my appendix, I began wondering whether 3D technology might be helpful with my kidney operation. I discussed it with my consultant, urological surgeon Bhaskar Somani, suggesting that a life-size model of my kidney with the stone inside might give him accurate information about my operation. After he collapsed, John (pictured) was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he was diagnosed with appendicitis and had his appendix removed . He’d heard of 3D being used in orthopaedic operations such as hip replacements but, as far as he knew, it hadn’t been used with this kind of procedure. He agreed it might help — anything allowing a surgeon to visualise the area in more detail could only make surgery quicker and more accurate. I wasn’t due to have the stone removed until January this year, so, after taking two weeks off work to recover from the appendix operation, I began work on the model. The machine we use for 3D printing, known as an isodo3D, used images of my kidney from CT scans to recreate a model, slice by slice, using layers of plaster of Paris half a millimetre thick. John used images of his kidney from the CT scan to recreate a model, slice by slice using plaster of Paris (pictured). This allows the surgeon to complete surgery faster and more accurately . These layers were then laid on top of each other. The model was made in three coloured parts, so it could be taken apart like Lego pieces. This way, Mr Somani could work out the best angle to go into the kidney with his instruments. This planning can reduce operation times because it means less chance of having to rely on trial and error. The model took four hours to make and I was astonished when I saw the finished product — particularly the size of the stone. I couldn’t understand how something that big hadn’t caused me trouble. When I woke from the three-hour operation, I was a bit sore but was walking around within hours. I was in hospital for five days and had the stitches from my tiny wound taken out two weeks later. The replica of his kidney that John (pictured) created, allowed Mr Somani to work out the best angle to go into the kidney with his instruments . The soreness lasted a few days, but painkillers helped, and I was back in the office within ten days. I don’t know whether that’s because of the kidney model, but I like to think so. I’m planning to make more models for Mr Somani — for ten patients with kidney stones and ten with cancer. They cost £123 — but if it shortens operations and therefore reduces infection risk, it could be of massive benefit to the health service and save money in the long run. THE SURGEON . Bhaskar Somani is a consultant urological surgeon and specialist in endourology at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. Kidney stones occur when waste products removed from the blood form crystals, which over time form hard stones. If they’re not completely blocking tubes in and around the kidneys, they should pass naturally within five weeks. But larger stones can get stuck — they can be extremely painful and lead to infections. John (pictured) is now planning to make more models for Mr Somani, costing £123 a piece . John’s was a large stone that would have been hard to pass and he needed an operation, a keyhole procedure called percutaneous nephrolithotomy. It’s quite complex surgery — there is a risk of bleeding because the kidney has such a rich blood supply. In up to 5 per cent of cases, patients need a transfusion. A CT scan and X-rays are taken beforehand to pinpoint the exact location of a kidney stone. But I felt having a 3D model as well would give us even more detail: I’d be able to hold the model, take it apart, see the exact location of the stone and plan the precise angle of our surgical instruments. I kept the model throughout the surgery to consolidate what I was seeing on screen. We started the procedure by passing a camera — a cystoscope — through the urethra and up into the bladder. This meant I could see the stone on a screen. Then John was turned on his front and I made a 1cm incision on his right-hand side, just below the ribcage in his back. Then we punctured the kidney with a fine needle, which helped create a tract, or tunnel, for us to access the kidney. This was done under X-ray guidance. Next, I passed a hollow tube known as a dilator into this tract, to enlarge it, so we could then insert a telescope, allowing images to be produced on screen. Then, using ultrasound energy pumped through a tiny probe, we broke the stone into fragments, before sucking them out using a pump inserted through the small puncture in the back. Throughout the procedure, having the model as a point of reference was very useful, allowing me to visualise in 3D what was happening at each stage. Typical risks of the procedure include excess bleeding, as well as injuring the structures surrounding the kidney, but having a model helps minimise risks. John has also created a model of a kidney with a cancerous tumour (left). The right-hand picture shows the model of John's own kidney stone . I hope this technology soon becomes widely available. I carry out around 250 kidney-stone procedures a year, around 30 of which are large and complex. The model could speed up procedures like this by 30 minutes as it will take less time to plan how to access the kidney. This in turn could reduce infection time and complication rates. It could be helpful when removing tumours, too. It’s also useful to show the patient a model when explaining the procedure, and it could also help in training the surgeons of tomorrow. ANY DRAWBACKS? ‘There’s no doubt that having a model to study before surgery and then to refer to a during an operation can only increase its success,’ says Christopher Eden, a consultant urologist at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford. ‘Kidney stones — especially large ones — can involve fairly complicated surgery. And, with keyhole surgery, when you are operating with a telescope, you need to plan in a methodical fashion beforehand. A model like this is certainly the way forward for this sort of surgery.’ The surgery costs between £10,000 and £12,000 privately, and is a similar cost to the NHS.","Kidney stones are very common and often larger ones need to be removed .

"The theft of a handwritten letter by the Renaissance master, Michelangelo could only have been an inside job, the former head of the Vatican museums has said. The return of two letters stolen from an archive in 1997, has been offered by a former Vatican employee for between euro 100,000 (£72,000) and 200,000 (£144,000). The Vatican authorities discovered that it was missing from the offices of the Fabbrica of St Peter’s Basilica 18 years ago but did not publicise the theft. The Former director of the Vatican Museums has said the theft of letters written by Michelangelo from its archives must have been carried out by 'an inside man'. Above, a file image of one of its archives . Former director of the Vatican Museums, Franco Buranelli, said: ‘These areas [of the archive] are not easy to access. 'It must have been an inside man working in the archives who knew how to gain possession of the document and be able to get it out without creating havoc.’ He said the letter was of ‘immense’ value although it would be impossible for thieves to sell. ‘Every letter by Michelangelo is of immense value. The loss of any nugget by the great Renaissance masters is serious. ‘There is no realistic prospect of a sale’, he told Rome-based newspaper Il Messaggero. But in any case the value of the letter ‘is difficult to estimate because it depends on ‘the content, intended recipient, period and the presence or not of signatures, sketches, designs or sonnets.’ He said that the letter would probably not have been a family letter but likely referring to art commissioned by the pope. ‘It could be on architectural matters or a service note for the acquisition of materials that he needed to complete a work.’ Mr Buranelli said while the letters could not be sold they were of 'immense value'. A former employee has come forward almost 15 years after they were stolen, claiming he knows where they are . A nun working in the Archivio della Fabbrica, the body set up by Pope Julius II in 1506 to maintain the basilica of St Peter’s informed the then head-Cardinal Noe of the disappearance in 1997. Then a few months ago an ex-Vatican employee contacted its head, Cardinal Angelo Comastri, saying he knew what had become of the letter and wanted a reward. ‘Cardinal Comastri recently received a proposal for the return of the letter in exchange for payment,” Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said. ‘Naturally he refused, as these are documents that have been stolen.’","Letters were kept in an area of the archives which few had access to .

"A subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal criminal charge that it sold over-the-counter infant's and children's liquid medicine containing metal particles. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, of Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, acknowledged failing to take corrective action after discovering the adulterated bottles of Infants' and Children's Tylenol and Children's Motrin. The company agreed to pay $25 million to resolve the case. Metal particles, including nickel, iron and chromium, were introduced during the manufacturing process at McNeil's plant in Fort Washington. Prosecutors said McNeil knew about the problem for nearly a year but failed to take immediate steps to fix it. Admission: McNeil Consumer Healthcare acknowledged failing to take corrective action after discovering adulterated bottles of Infants' and Children's Tylenol and Children's Motrin which contained metal particles . The company and prosecutors said in court Tuesday that no one was injured. 'McNeil's failure to comply with current good manufacturing practices is seriously troubling,' Acting Assistant Attorney General Mizer said in a statement after the judge accepted McNeil's plea. 'The Department of Justice will continue to be aggressive in pursuing and punishing companies such as McNeil that disregard a process designed to assure quality medicines, especially OTC drugs for infants and children,' he said. McNeil is a unit of Johnson & Johnson. The New Brunswick, New Jersey, health care giant has struggled with scores of product recalls since 2009. In this case, McNeil first learned of the particle problem in May 2009, when a consumer complained about black specks inside a bottle of Infants' Tylenol, according to court documents. McNeil subsequently found metal particles during production but continued making the liquid medicines for several more months. Products: Metal particles, including nickel, iron and chromium, were introduced during the manufacturing process at McNeil's plant in Fort Washington . 'There were investigative steps taken, but not all of the steps required under all of our internal operating procedures,' company attorney Michael Schwartz told The Associated Press on Tuesday. McNeill eventually traced the problem to the machinery at its plant in Fort Washington and issued a recall. The Food and Drug Administration said the potential for serious medical problems was remote but advised consumers to stop using the medicine. The suburban Philadelphia plant — which was linked to several recalls of Tylenol and other nonprescription drugs for children and adults — was shuttered in April 2010 and rebuilt from the ground up, but it has yet to reopen. The company is operating under an agreement with the FDA requiring increased inspections and oversight at its factories. McNeil said Tuesday it has significantly improved its procedures. 'McNeil has been implementing enhanced quality and oversight standards across its entire business to ensure we are best able to meet our commitment to consumers, patients and doctors who rely on our products,' company spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said.","McNeil Consumer Healthcare agreed to pay $25 million to resolve the case .

"There is evidence to prove that ISIS is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon in its battle against peshmerga forces in Iraq, Kurdish authorities have claimed. It says peshmerga forces discovered '20 gas canisters' loaded on the back of a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq on January 23. The Kurdistan Region Security Council says the chemical attack took place on a road between Iraq's second largest city of Mosul and the Syrian border. It was here that peshmerga fighters were desperately trying to seize the vital supply line used by the militants when they found the alleged weapons. Biological warfare: Kurdish authorities claim the 20 gas canisters found on board a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq (pictured) is further proof of ISIS using chlorine as a chemical weapon . Revelation: The canisters (pictured) were found on board the truck which exploded into a cloud of yellow gas after peshmerga forces opened fire on it . Explosion: The resulting gas cloud (pictured) left nearby troops feeling nauseous and many had to be treated for vomiting, dizziness and general weakness . Video provided by the council revealed a truck storming down the road with white smoke pouring out of it as peshmerga soldiers opened shot at it. The footage later showed a white, billowing cloud emerging from the truck as it exploded and its remnants scattered across the area. A Kurdish official said dozens of peshmerga fighters were treated for 'dizziness, nausea, vomiting and general weakness' after the attack. Traces of chlorine were discovered after samples of clothing and soil from the site were analysed, the Kurds claim. There have been several previous allegations that Islamic State terrorists have already used weaponised chlorine. In October, Iraqi officials claimed ISIS could have used chlorine-filled cylinders during clashes in the towns of Balad and Duluiya. And reports from the Syrian border-town of Kobani suggested the extremist group added chlorine to an arsenal that already included heavy weapons and tanks looted from captured military bases. The government said in a statement: 'The fact ISIS relies on such tactics demonstrates it has lost the initiative and is resorting to desperate measure. Evidence: Analysis of clothing and soil samples from the scene revealed traces of chlorine, Kurdish authorities claim . Dangerous: Chlorine is hazardous chemical that chokes victims and can long exposure to it can result in death . Chlorine was first used as a chemical weapon at Ypres, Belgium during the First World War to disastrous effect at a time when gas masks were not widely available. Jennifer Cole, Senior Research Fellow at defence think-tank Royal United Services Institute, told MailOnline that although chlorine can be lethal, it does appear that it's being used to spread fear by Isis. She said: 'Chlorine is easily available from a number of industrial sources and is very hazardous – causing breathing difficulties in particular and in extreme cases prolonged exposure can kill. 'Used in roadside bombs such as this, in the open air, it disperses reasonably quickly and so appears to be intended to cause panic rather than serious harm.' Although it has many public and industrial uses, it chokes victims to death when used as a weapon. During the Syrian civil war, a chlorine gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus in 2013 killed hundreds and nearly inspired the US to launch airstrikes against the government . The Americans and the West accused President Bashar Al-Assad's regime for the attack, while Damascus blamed the rebels. Even Al-Qaeda in Iraq - the militant group that eventually became ISIS - used chlorine gas in a suicide attack in May 2007. Insurgents drove tankers into three cities in Anbar province, killing two police officers and forcing over 300 Iraqi civilians and six US troops to seek treatment for gas exposure.","Peshmerga discovered '20 gas canisters' on truck in suicide bomb attack .

"A wind-up iPhone case that can charge a phone simply by spinning a handle on the back could spell the end of 'battery anxiety'. Designers claim the Ampware CrankCase can provide up to three hours of power by winding the handle for just five minutes. It also includes a USB port that allows users to charge accessories, or a friend's mobile phone. Scroll down for video . The Ampware Crankcase (shown above) will be available for the iPhone 5, 5S and 6 models.Designers claim it can provide up to three hours of power by winding the handle for just five minutes . Mark Gabriel, co-founder of Ampware who is based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said he was inspired to develop the device after being separated from his family by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He said: 'I realised that without access to power, there was no way I could stay in touch with my friends and family. 'With millions of people facing the same issue during events like Katrina, and more recently during Hurricane Sandy, I knew there had to be a way to keep people connected regardless of access to a traditional power source. 'CrankCase leverages existing technology in a new way to generate power to keep mobile devices charged without having to depend on traditional power outlets.' CrankCase uses a magnetic dynamo generator to produce  power. Designer Mark Gabriel said he was inspired to develop the device after being separated from his family by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The handle on the back of the case can also be used as a support to prop up the phone for watching videos. Mr Gabriel has  launched a campaign on Indiegogo to help fund development of the case. The team plans to begin shipping the device, which costs $59 (£39.50), in October 2015 . Apple has said that the 'all day' battery in its new Watch lasts 18 hours with 'typical use'. However official tests have revealed this equates to just 90 time checks, 90 notifications, three hours of talk time and 6.5 hours of music playback. Music can be played via apps on the Watch when connected to a phone, and this can be done either using the timepiece's built-in speaker or via Bluetooth headphones. Apple defines the battery on its Watch product page and said a time check typically lasts four seconds. It is likely that a notification illuminates the screen for a similar time. This means 90 time checks and 90 notifications equate to 12 hours of screen activity. When this is added to app use and workout time the total usage is 13 hours and 15 minutes. This leaves 4 hours and 45 minutes on standby. When used just as a watch, Apple said the device will last 48 hours if checked  five times an hour. CrankCase uses a magnetic dynamo generator to produce the power needed to charge the phone. This uses a rare earth metal spinning inside a magentic field to generate electrical current inside a coil of wire spun around the magnet. Mr Gabriel said that spinning the handle on the back of the case for one minute can provide enough battery life for 40 minutes of standby use for an iPhone, and 20 minutes for an iPad mini. He has now launched a  campaign on Indiegogo to help develop commercial products from the prototype he and his colleagues have created. They plan to begin shipping the device, which costs $59 (£39.50), in October 2015.

"There's nothing more destructive than a knee-jerk reaction, whether it’s a trifling disagreement that escalates into a row or a mouthful of cake that becomes a whole slice, decisions made on the hoof can cause us unnecessary anguish. Thanks to the frenetic pace of our lives and the constant juggling of friends, family and work, it can seem impossible to put real thought into our actions. But now a brilliant new book, 4 Seconds, by best-selling leadership coach Peter Bregman, promises to help you break this bad habit once and for all, thanks to a seductively simple technique. Scroll down for video . Thanks to the frenetic pace of our lives and constantly juggling responsibilities, it can seem impossible to put real thought into our actions (picture posed by model) The Four-Second Rule can help you regain control your life, make better decisions and even improve your family relationships and love life. Here’s how you can do it ... STOP SABOTAGING YOURSELF . Our basic needs — fulfilling relationships, success, peace of mind — are surprisingly straightforward to achieve. But in many cases our best efforts to achieve them are built on habits that don’t work. Worse, we don’t even realise we’re sabotaging ourselves. For example, when we feel overwhelmed by a to-do list, our reaction is to work longer hours and pack more into them. We multi-task and work late. Our intention is to reduce stress. But, of course, our actions have exactly the converse effect. Or we say things we think will impress someone, but instead prompt rejection. We try to comfort a friend, but somehow make her more upset. If we feel overwhelmed by a to-do list often our immediate reaction is to work longer hours and do more, intending to relieve stress, but actually the opposite is achieved (picture posed by model) All of these situations could be avoided with just a moment’s pause to consider the consequences of our actions and make a better choice. This is where the Four-Second Rule comes in. WHAT IS THE FOUR-SECOND RULE? The secret to making good decisions that can simplify your life is always to take a single breath — lasting four seconds — before acting. It may sound incredibly simple, but that pause has been proven to be all the time you need to reign back your impulses and find the presence of mind to make the smartest choice. It allows you the space to breathe and to realise that sometimes not following through on something you want to do is a problem, such as not hitting a deadline or not having that difficult conversation. The secret to making good decisions can be a single breath lasting four seconds. The pause this takes may be all the time you need to find the presence of mind to make a good choice (picture posed by model) But other times the problem is that you do follow through on something you don’t want to do, such as speaking instead of listening, or playing politics instead of rising above them. A four-second break teaches you old-fashioned self-control. Each time you manage it, you will be proving to yourself that temptation is only a suggestion. The Four-Second Rule gives you a chance to question your actions and get the right outcome. HOW TO DEAL WITH DISTRACTIONS . If you’ve ever tried meditation, you may recognise how unwanted thoughts drift into your mind, interrupting that longed-for sense of peace. If you've tried meditation, you'll know how unwanted thoughts can appear, when you try the Four-Second Rule identify the impulses that want to take a destructive path rather than ignore them (picture posed by model) Bregman estimates that a new idea will spring into your mind every four seconds, but having an awareness of the way the brain tries to distract itself is valuable. When you try the Four-Second Rule, identify the impulses that want to take a destructive path rather than ignore them. In the four seconds, try to see another way you could respond to the situation at hand. THE POWER OF BEING SILENT . Even when you know that taking that four-second pause can help prevent you from making poor decisions, you may find bad habits get in the way of good decisions. Here’s how to break them: . Stop thinking: Shut down sabotaging conversations that go on in your head before they start. Make a decision about something you want to do during the four seconds and don’t question it. For example, ‘I will work out tomorrow at 6am’ or ‘I will say at least one thing in the next meeting at work’. It’s amazing how effective this is. Do nothing: When you need to regain your balance - in a contentious conversation or a difficult situation - rather than build your momentum, do nothing for a minute. Resetting yourself has the power to help you change your perspective on a situation. Stop thinking and shut down any sabotaging conversations in your head before they start. Make a decision during the four seconds and don't question it later (picture posed by model) Ditch perfection: To get the most important things done without losing your mind, stop trying so hard and aiming for ultra perfection. Instead, make a pact in your four seconds to race through the next phase of work. Trust yourself: The next time that you feel insecure about a task or project and are about to reach out for feedback and approval, ask yourself what you think first. Take four seconds to listen to yourself. Change the view: If you can’t change reality — then look carefully to see it for what it is. Once your perspective changes, so does your ability to respond strategically and productively to the world around you. Don't jump: Beware of jumping into things without thinking them through. Each morning, make the time to ask yourself this question: ‘Am I really prepared for this day?’ You may still be ambushed by circumstances or other people, but you’ll even be more prepared for that, just by asking the question. Once you’ve learnt the Four-Second Rule, you can start creating more meaningful relationships with others. Here’s how: . In the heat of a row with a partner, don’t respond based on how you feel in the moment (use the Four-Second Rule!), but rather based on what the other person needs to resolve the situation. Once they’ve calmed down, you can move forward. Don’t give into your instinct to find flaws in others. Tame your knee-jerk reactions and instead find something about them that impresses you. Resist the impulse to write off someone who has hurt or disappointed you. Most of the time, they aren’t betraying you; they’re just struggling with their own issues. Accept the person and their limitations, and move on. Contrary to our natural urge to defend ourselves and excuse our mistakes, taking the blame is the power move — strengthening your position, not weakening it. ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS . You’ve mastered the Four-Second Rule, how do you make the most of it? If we want to sustain a good habit, it’s not enough just to do it when we remember. We have to improve our lifestyle, too. Many of us start the day with great intentions. But then people start calling and emailing, and soon we can’t remember what we wanted to focus on in the first place. By the end of a week, we’ve forgotten what it was we were hoping to accomplish. And by the end of the year, we’re frustrated that we haven’t moved forwards. MASTER YOUR EMAIL . If you get involved in a heated email exchange, apply the Four-Second Rule before replying. That will let any anger diffuse. To improve productivity, check your e-mail only a few times a day - and resist the temptation to check during off e-mail hours. If you happen to become involved in a tense email conversation, be sure to apply the Four-Second Rule before replying, giving yourself time to let any anger diffuse (picture posed by model) Ask yourself: What’s going on for you? What are you feeling? Take a deep breath and relax into an undistracted moment. STREAMLINE YOUR LIFESTYLE . Identify up to five things that you want to focus on for the year: it could be your work, your relationship or just saving £10 a week. These priorities are where you should spend 95 per cent of your time. Take anything that doesn’t fit into one of those areas of annual focus and get it off your to-do list. Create a to-do list that’s made up of six boxes — one for each of your five areas of focus and the sixth labelled ‘the other 5 per cent’, and pin it to the wall next to a calendar. Find five things you want to focus on  and create a to-do list. You should share this with someone else because saying it out loud creates a deeper level of commitment and accountability (picture posed by model) That other 5 per cent box is like sugar — a little might be OK, but your day should never contain more than 5 per cent of the activities that don’t fit into your five main priority areas.

"One woman got the birthday surprise of a lifetime when she found out that, not only was her boyfriend proposing that very day, he had actually been secretly popping the question every single day for the last year. Dean Smith, from Scottsdale, Arizona, made a video for his girlfriend Jennifer Kessel that showed the 365 days he asked for her hand in marriage. The reveal happened during a large family trip to Aruba, where Jennifer was instructed via a whiteboard held by her sister Jaclyn to go down to the lobby. There her brother and then a friend helped lead Jennifer to the beach, where her father and stepmother were waiting to hand her a device where she could watch the film. Scroll down for video .

'By now you've probably realized that your birthday surprise is in the form of this video,' Smith begins on screen. 'What you don't know is that I've been planning this birthday surprise for over a year now.' The video then cuts to a film Dean made on Jennifer's birthday the previous year. 'I just wanted to make this video to tell you that today is the day that I decided I want to spend the rest of my life with you,' he reveals. But, Dean says in the film, he wanted to find a way to propose to Jennifer that would show her just how much he loved her, and that he thought about her 'literally every moment of every day'.

"An Alabama jury has found a woman guilty of capital murder after she made her  9-year-old granddaughter run for three hours as punishment - causing her to collapse and die. Joyce Hardin Garrard faces the death penalty or life without parole for the February 2012 death of Savannah Hardin, after the verdict was delivered on Friday. Garrard showed no reaction when the verdict was read, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies. She glared toward the audience as she walked out silently. Scroll down for video . Joyce Hardin Garrard is led back to the Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Alabama, after being found guilty of capital murder. She made granddaughter Savannah Hardin, 9, run for three hours as punishment in 2012 . The youngster collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood. She died three days later in hospital . Some of her relatives sitting behind her began to cry. Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict, delivered after about 3½ hours of deliberation. Garrard's husband, Johnny, sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter before the daughter ran from the courtroom sobbing. Garrard is scheduled to be sentenced on Monday. Jurors will hear additional testimony and make a decision on whether to recommend life without parole or death. The final decision is up to the judge. Authorities claimed the 49-year-old woman forced Savannah to run and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy. Savannah eventually had a seizure and died three days later in a hospital. The defense denied the woman meant the girl any harm, but jurors rejected that claim. Garrard had testified she only made the girl pick up sticks in her yard as punishment the day of her collapse. Garrard testified that the girl did run, but only as practice for races at school. Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise. In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson. Garrard walks to the Etowah County Judicial Building on Friday to prepare for a hearing. She now faces the death penalty or life without parole . Assistant District Attorney Carol Griffith said Garrard killed the child intentionally by berating her and making her run around the yard picking up sticks . 'She was tortured,' Griffith said. Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9-year-old Savannah while the girl's father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department. Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said. But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day. The 49-year-old walks in handcuffs around her feet, waist and arms, accompanied by two officers . He said, 'I think we have all had the thought: ""If it was that bad, why didn't they do something?'' He said witnesses didn't notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support. 'Then it becomes ""Oh yeah, I witnessed boot camp. I witnessed the drill sergeant from hell"",' he said. Garrard was the final witness to testify on Wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments Friday afternoon. Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence. Savannah's stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin has also been charged with her murder, which carries a life sentence. The girl was in the care of her stepmother and grandmother while her father was away. Hardin, who is awaiting trial, gave birth while in custody in February 2012. A 911 operator told the court Garrard asked 'for a smoke' while the girl was unconscious outside their home .","Joyce Hardin Garrad, 49, was convicted for the 2012 of Savannah Hardin .

"This is the excruciating moment a woman appears to snap a bone in her leg while using gym equipment. The unidentified woman cries in pain as her bone apparently snaps, moments after she lifts a heavy weight using a leg press. A leg press is a machine used in strength or resistance training. It requires a person to push weight away therefore engaging their leg muscles. But when the woman she is halfway through her second repetition, having already lifted the weight, she relaxes her leg while it is extended, rather than keeping her knee bent to support the weight. The unidentified woman screams in agony as her leg bone snaps. She was using a leg press machine at the gym, in which she was pushing away weights with her leg muscles . But the weight is too heavy and bears down on her leg, forcing it to bend the wrong way. The force causes a painful injury to her leg. While the woman writhes in agony, a man standing nearby in a suit watching her workout rushes to help. While it is unclear what exactly injury she sustained, an expert told MailOnline she could have fractured the tibia (the bone between the knee and ankle) or the femur (bone that extends from the pelvis to the knee). It is also possible she sustained an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament, the strongest ligament in the knee. Sammy Margo, a chartered physiotherapist said: ‘On the second repetition, her leg went into hyperextension, which means the ligaments go beyond themselves and the knee has bent back on itself. ‘She could have torn her posterior cruciate ligament,' she said. 'The ligament prevents the knee joint from what physios call ""posterior instability"". 'This means it prevents the tibia from moving too much and going behind the femur - the knee buckling back on itself. ‘It’s also possible she pulled the ligament off the leg bones and they fractured. She would have dislocated her knee.’ Fitness experts today warned of the dangers of carrying out exercises such as a leg press without the proper training or supervision. Sit on the machine with the back and head against the padded support. Place feet on the foot plate about hip width apart, ensuring the heels are flat against the platform. The legs should form a 90 degree angle at the knee and the knees should be in line with the feet. Brace the abdominal muscles and push the platform away with heels. Don't lock the knees or relax when the leg is extended. Slowly allow the platform to lower back to its starting position by bending the knees in a controlled manner. Make sure heels are always touching the plate, the knees are not bowing outwards or inwards and ensure the head is steady. Start with a modest weight and progress to a higher weight if comfortable. Some said that resistance machines such as the leg press are dangerous because they isolate muscles in a way that does not mimic 'real life' movement, while others warned a person should always concentrate when carrying out such exercise. Will Longhurst, fitness manager at Reebok Sports Club, London, said: 'This video is an extreme example of what could happen during exercise when not performed correctly, however that is a underlying point that should be addressed. 'A number of people visit the gym with little or no experience of how to use the equipment effectively and more importantly safely. 'Often gym-goers will lift weights that are too heavy or use machines with poor technique as highlighted in the video. 'If it is your first time in the gym or you are starting out with a new routine you should try, where possible, to consult a fitness professional or coach who will be able to show you the how the machine or equipment should be used properly. 'Personal trainers are an invaluable source of expertise and to make a positive start to somebody’s experience of gyms it is worth using a good personal trainer to teach all the basics in the gym. 'There are countless exercises that can be performed in the gym but they do all generally revolve around similar movement patterns, such as the push, pull, hip hinge or squat. 'A good understanding of these moves basic moves with good technique, posture and body alignment will assist every gym-goer with most of the beginner and intermediate exercises. 'By having the understanding of what good technique looks and feels like, gym goers will be able to perform their exercises in a safe manner and make progress quickly to more advanced exercises.' Helle Hammonds, founder of GymClass, London, said machines such as a leg press can be dangerous as they isolate muscles in a way that does not mimic how a person would normally move. After lifting the weight for the second time, the woman relaxed her legs instead of keeping them bent. This meant the weight bore down on her legs, forcing them to bend the wrong way and snapping her bone . She said: ‘The problem with leg press machines and many other weight machines is that they create a way of moving weights whilst isolating certain muscles and joints. ‘The body is not supposed to move like this. Instead when the human body moves an object we tend to use a whole bunch of different muscles and joints to get the job done. ‘These weight machines create an unreal environment, using inappropriately heavy weights and incorrect form can, as the video shows, cause problems. ‘I have seen many injuries to people's lower backs from leg press machines in particular, as they lift weights that are too heavy. ‘Through research the fitness industry has now moved away from sending clients on this kind of machine and I would recommend people use free weights to do exercise such as a squat, spilt lunge or a waking lunge.’ Tom Eastham, a trainer for Push Mind and Body retreat, added that concentrating while lifting weights is key. He said: 'You should never relax your legs in a fully extended position due to the risk of hyperextension. 'If she is using a heavy load, she should be mentally focused at the task in hand, this would ensure her muscles are switched on and functioning properly. 'She could also be new to strength training and as a result her joints might not be used to being under heavy stress. 'If she is hypermobile she might be at even greater risk of injury as these peoples muscles do not know when to stop movements and can have serious injuries as a result. 'Golden rules for the leg press or any other strength based exercises would be: focus, brace then contract.'","Woman is lifting weights with her legs using a leg press machine .

"Many couples decide to tie the knot in an intimate setting with just close family on the guest list. And now a retired minister from Virginia has built his own travelling wedding chapel measuring just 100 square feet offering wedding services for as little as $100 (£66). Bil Malbon, 59, came up with the idea for building the chapel on wheels after he retired in 2013 after stumbling across a website dedicated to building tiny houses. Scroll down for video . The Tiny Chapel built by retired minister Bil Malbon, which he plans on taking on the road, offering cut-price wedding services to couples . The inside of the Tiny Chapel measures just 100 square feet, with couples able to invite up to 25 guests, with packages starting from $100 . Over the next few months Mr Malbon, who has been officiating weddings since 1992, began attending housing workshops. He then began building the chapel in April 2014, and completed his first ceremony, renewing the vows of Thom and Midge Stanton, in October. The chapel even features a retractable spire, which can be removed when the building is on the road. Wedding packages start from $100 with hour-long full wedding services on a weekend costing $500 (£330). Mr Malbon first started working on building the chapel in 2014 after attending several workshops on how to build your own tiny house . Mr Malbon, right, says the chapel even features a detractable spire so it can be removed when he is driving it on the road . The chapel in the process of being built by Mr Malbon. This weekend the building will host its first full wedding ceremony in Richmond, Virginia . Mr Malbon said: 'A little over ten years ago I started thinking about about what I wanted to do when I retired from state government. 'I'd been officiating weddings since 1992 and decided I would build a grand wedding chapel. 'This is just our first year of business and the wedding season hasn't really started yet. 'We have a few bookings already and out hopes are that as the weather warms up, more couples planning tiny weddings give us a call.' On Saturday, the chapel will host its full wedding service in Richmond, Virginia, when Patricia Moran and Josh Farrar tie the knot. After being completed late last year, the first service to be held by Mr Malbon in the chapel was the vow renewal of couple Thom and Midge Stanton, pictured . Mr Malbon, pictured with Mr and Mrs Stanton. The retired minister says that although it is their first year of business, the chapel has already had many bookings for the summer . Miss Moran said: 'We knew from the beginning we wanted a small, intimate wedding with a guest list of only close family members. 'Our search was coming up empty as I refused to pay over $500 to rent an over-sized location. 'Then we found the Tiny Chapel and I knew it was perfect.'","Minister Bil Malbon decided to build a small chapel on wheels after reading up on constructing tiny houses .

"Only two lines long and dashed off with a typically witty flourish, the scribbled note scarcely amounts to a hard day’s work. But even a hastily scribbled postcard can become a valuable artefact when written by Sir Paul McCartney. The greeting, sent by the Beatles star from his farmhouse on the Mull of Kintyre, fetched almost £1,000 at auction earlier this week. This postcard, featuring a Scotty dog with a tartan border and the message 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot?' was sent by Paul McCartney from his farmhouse on the Mull of Kintyre . Posted to his London housekeeper Rose, the brief handwritten message read: 'With love from the “four Macs”. Now on tour in Scotland.’ Sir Paul spent weeks at his bolthole with wife Linda and daughters Heather and Mary after the band split in 1970. But he kept in touch with his London housekeeper, Rose Martin, sending a card featuring a Scotty dog, tartan, lucky white heather and the lyrics ‘Should auld acquaintance be forgot?’. A brief note on the back reads: ‘With love from the “four Macs”. Now on tour in Scotland.’ With a Campbeltown postmark and an upside-down stamp, it went under the hammer in Warrington, near the band’s native Liverpool, as part of a sale of Beatles memorabilia on Tuesday. Organiser Omega Auctions had valued it at between £250 and £350 – but it went for £950. Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: ‘Such intimate, personal and unique things give Beatles and Paul McCartney collectors an insight into how life was for him back then, and very rarely come up for sale.’ Sir Paul spent weeks at his bolthole with wife Linda (pictured with him at the farmhouse) and daughters Heather and Mary after the band split in 1970 . Sir Paul, now 72, bought 600-acre High Park Farm on the Kintyre peninsula in 1966 at the height of The Beatles’ success, while living with actress Jane Asher. He has said he was inspired to write The Beatles hit The Long And Winding Road by the estate’s ‘wandering single-track roads and sense of solace’. After he married Linda Eastman in 1969, the couple turned the modest farmhouse into a holiday retreat. When the band broke up, the McCartneys headed there to get away from the limelight. The couple later immortalised their love of the area in the hit song Mull Of Kintyre, which took their band Wings to the Christmas No 1 spot in 1977. The most successful single of his solo career, it went on to sell 2.5 million copies. Sir Paul once said of the track: ‘It was a love song, really, about how I enjoyed being there and imagining I was travelling away and wanting to get back.’","A postcard sent by Paul McCartney has been sold for £1,000 at auction .

"A holiday turned to horror yesterday when a coach full of elderly tourists overturned in strong winds and careered down an embankment at a beauty spot. More than 20 people were injured - five seriously - as the bus left the main A83 road at the Rest and Be Thankful in Argyll, did a 360 degree roll, and narrowly avoided plunging into Loch Restil. The coach was taking a party of 32 pensioners from Kent back to their hotel after a day trip when it suddenly veered off the road shortly after 2pm. Five people were seriously injured after a coach carrying elderly tourists veered off the A83 near Argyll, Scotland, today before rolling down the embankment . The coach, which left a deep gash in the ground after the accident, was just feet from plunging into Loch Restil when it came to a stop (pictured) It is not thought any other vehicles were involved in the crash, which happened in an area notorious for its freak high winds. Firefighters armed with cutting equipment had to remove one side of the bus in order to free the passengers trapped inside. Police said a Royal Navy helicopter was scrambled from HMS Gannet to take five casualties to Southern General Hospital in Glasgow and the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. All have serious injuries, including suspected spinal injuries, which are not thought to be life-threatening. A Lossiemouth RAF helicopter was also on the ground after flying a mountain rescue team to the scene with a winch man paramedic. A further 25 people were described as 'walking wounded' and were taken to a makeshift rest centre at the 'Three Villages Hall' in the nearby town of Arrochar. One horrified onlooker, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It's incredible no one died. 'The bus came down a steep embankment and came to rest very close to the loch. The bus was literally half a metre from the water. 'If it had gone a bit further, it would have been a completely different scenario. 'When I was at the scene, all the windows were broken and the curtains were flying in the wind. 'I don't know what caused the crash, but it is very, very windy. You can hardly stand still.' The A83 was still closed several hours after the accident and a lengthy diversion had been set up along the A82. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said it had sent 'multiple resources' to the incident, including a Special Operations Team, an air ambulance helicopter and two emergency medical retrieval teams, who worked alongside the police and fire crews from Lochgilphead, Arrochar and Inveraray. The coach, operated by Lochs and Glens Holidays, was returning from trip to Inverarayand were heading back to one of the group's seven Scottish hotels when the accident happened. In total 20 people were injured in the accident, with another 25 being treated as 'walking wounded' by ambulance crews who arrived at the scene . It is not thought any other vehicles were involved in the crash, which happened in an area notorious for its freak high winds . A spokesman for the group refused to confirm which hotel the group were staying at, but said: 'We are providing all necessary support for those passengers . who were on board and the relatives of those who have been injured. The driver and the company are co-operating fully with the police investigation to establish the exact cause.' By early evening, many of the passengers were still receiving treatment at the triage centre in Arrochar and a number were helped into waiting ambulances and taken to hospital. The accident happened at a spot renowned locally for freak winds. Donald Clark, owner of The George Hotel in Inveraray, said: 'I had friends coming up an hour before the accident happened and they said it was very blustery. 'It's a dangerous spot, there have been a lot of accidents there. There was a Mercedes Sprinter van blown over about six weeks ago. 'There is a gulley there and there is a funny wind pattern, there is a bit of a freak wind that comes, there has been a pattern of accidents there.' He added that a road worker had told him it was believed that the wind caught the coach and blew it over the bank, where it had rolled within six metres of Loch Restil, a fresh water loch. Local councillor Bruce Marshall said it was 'very very lucky' the outcome had not been far worse. He said: 'It's terrible. Obviously this is a very serious accident and I just hope that people all recover. 'It's in a very remote part of my ward and nobody lives there. It's in an area where the winds are very strong and might pose a risk to high-sided vehicles but the weather has been fairly good. The Scottish ambulance service said it had sent two rescue vehicles, an air ambulance, and a Special Operations Team to the crash after being called at 2pm . The A83 was still closed several hours after the accident and a lengthy diversion had been set up . 'Thank goodness the emergency services were on the scene very quickly. It will be sad for the operators and everyone involved.' Transport Minister Derek Mackay said last night: 'Scottish Ministers have been kept fully informed of this serious incident across the afternoon and our immediate thoughts are with the passengers who have been transported to hospital. 'The emergency services have been working closely with helicopters from both Prestwick and Lossiemouth as well as mountain rescue teams and 'The A83, at The Rest and Be Thankful, remains closed to allow the investigation into what caused the accident to get underway.' A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Around 2.10pm, a coach with tourists overturned on the A83 Rest and Be Thankful. 'It is understood that 32 people were on board of which five are believed to be seriously injured. 'They are being taken by ambulance/medivac to either the Southern or the RAH in Paisley for treatment. Twenty five people are described as 'walking wounded'. 'Emergency Services are at the scene. The A83 is closed with local diversions in place.'","Coach was taking 32 pensioners from Kent back to hotel after day trip .

"The latest intake of Metropolitan Police officers today passed out in front of Boris Johnson and Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe. But the mayor and police chief may have been less than impressed by the lack of Black and Minority Ethnic candidates on the parade ground. Having set an  ambitious target of having 40 per cent of all officers from Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds, only 18 per cent met that criteria. Some 219 new police officers joined the ranks of the Metropolitan Police after today's Passing Out Parade . More than one-third of the recruits who graduated from the Police Training College in Hendon were women . Of the new officers, 18 per cent are from Black or Minority Ethnic backgrounds, according to new figures . Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, left and Mayor Boris Johnson, right, both attended the ceremony . Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe both attended today's ceremony and praised the growing number of non-white officers within the force, despite missing their own diversity target by more than 50 per cent. Only 39 of the 216 officers graduating from Hendon Police Training College were from BME backgrounds, despite the Metropolitan Police accepting that at least 40 per cent - or 86 officers should have been from non-white backgrounds. According to a report published by the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee in December 2014, before the most recent recruitment campaign, only 11 per cent of officers serving in the Met were from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic background, compared with approximately 40 per cent of the population of London. The current BME figure in the Met is now 12 per cent. Only three per cent of female officers with the Met are from minority backgrounds. Mayor Johnson today said that the number of BME officers in the Met has increased to 12 per cent. In an effort to boost BME numbers in the force, the Metropolitan Police is only considering applications from candidates who live within the Greater London area. The Metropolitan Police has set an ambitious target of recruiting 40 per cent of officers from BME backrounds . Only 12 per cent of officers serving with the Met are currently from a BME background . Since this policy has been introduced, 35 per cent of people who have expressed an interest in joining the Met have been from a BME background. Mayor Johnson said: 'London is one of the most diverse cities in the world and we are now beginning to see the creation of a police force that truly reflects the city that it serves. 'By taking tough decisions on the budget, we've been able to recruit additional officers and put more of them out on the streets, driving down crime and keeping Londoners safe. 'There's more to be done but with more officers from every community in the capital, using the best technology we can provide, I believe we are well on the way to creating the force we need to tackle 21st century crime and protect London for years to come.' Deputy Director of Training Superintendent Robyn Williams, left, inspected the new recruits . The new recruits have boosted the strength of the Met to almost 32,000 despite significant budget pressure . Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe said: 'Today we're celebrating reacting the target we set of 32,000 officers, the most we've had since the Olympics. 'Other forces have had to cut their numbers, but the Met has worked hard to find savings and protect the frontline. 'This will continue to be our approach. 'I'm pleased to have more officers from minorities joining the Met and pleased by the rise in female officers too. We'll keep working hard to reflect the London we serve.'","More than 200 officers joined the ranks of the Met Police today .

"If rollerskates are too retro and skateboarding too restrictive, there’s a new hydrid vehicle to master. The Post Modern Skateboard is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates, and allows riders to perform effortless-looking spins... with a lot of practice. It comprises two 10-inch wheels, which riders position their feet inside, instead of balancing on a conventional board. Scroll down for video . The Post Modern Skateboard (pictured) is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates, and allows riders to perform effortless-looking spins... with a lot of practice. The wheels can be joined together with a pole, to make the experience more like skateboarding, or kept separate, to be used more like in-line skates. ‘The annular skates… are propelled by leaning side to side, allowing you to skateboard without having to push off the ground,’ according to the entry in the Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue. ‘Riders simply place their feet on the two platforms and lean side-to-side to rotate the rubber wheels around the feet, propelling riders forward in a serpentine motion similar to longboard skateboarding.’ The wheels can be joined together with a pole (pictured), to make the experience more like skateboarding, or kept separate, to be used more like in-line skates . When the wheels are connected by a metal pole, the toy is most similar to a casterboard (pictured), which is a narrow, flexible skateboard with a metal 'spine' and two wheels that can travel in any direction . Composition: Two 10-inch wheels, which riders position their feet inside. The wheels can be used independently as skates, or joined with a metal bar to form a 'board'. How to use it: Annular skates are propelled by leaning side to side, to let a user skateboard without pushing off the ground - like using a casterboard. Tricks: When the toy is used like inline skates, riders can perform 720° spins. Price: $100 (£67) When the wheels are connected by a metal pole, the toy is most similar to a casterboard, which is a skateboard with two wheels that can travel in any direction. ‘The included extendable rod can be connected to both wheels, providing stability to novices and hastening the learning period,’ the catalogue says. When the wheels are not connected and work more like inline skates, ‘riders can easily perform 720° spins and turn on a dime’. Riders stop by placing their toes on the ground. The wheels of the ‘board’ measure 10 inches in diameter (25cm) so that it can be used on uneven road surfaces and grass. It costs $100 (£67) and is designed to be used by ages eight and upwards. ‘Riders simply place their feet on the two platforms and lean side-to-side to rotate the rubber wheels around the feet, propelling riders forward in a serpentine motion similar to  skateboarding,’ the catalogue says . A motorised skateboard with just one wheel has been created by a firm in San Francisco. Called the Onewheel, the $1300 gadget has a single air filled tyre taken from a go-kart. It can reach speeds on 12mph (19km/h), and turn 360 degrees within the length of the board - all while balancing itself using the same motion sensing technology found in a smartphone.

'Onewheel represents a huge shift in the typically stagnant, technology starved world of boardsports,' said Kyle Doerksen, who invented the board. Riders can accelerate up to 12mph (19km/h) by leaning towards their front foot. Leaning back slows down, or even reverses, and regenerative braking recharges the battery during deceleration. Mr Doerksen says riding one is like flying. 'The first thing you'll notice when you get on Onewheel is that it's simultaneously familiar and unlike anything you've ever ridden. 'The technology enables it to ride much more smoothly than a skateboard and carve turns like on snow or a surfboard.'","Post Modern Skateboard is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates .

"David Cameron is seen enjoying a meal at home with his family and watching his son play football in the Conservative Party's first general election broadcast. The theme of the film is children and features a number of parents outlining their hopes for their offspring. At the end, the prime minister says what he wants for his own children, he also wants for every child in Britain. Scroll down for video . David Cameron is seen watching his son play football in the Conservative Party's first general election broadcast . The prime minister says that what he wants for his own children, he also wants for every child in Britain . He says: 'Like every parent, I have hopes for my children and dreams for their future. 'What I want for them, I want for every child in this country - a good education, a decent job, great public services, a home of their own and overall, a chance to make the most out of their life. 'So that is what our plan for Britain is all about, securing a better future for your family and for all our children and grandchildren.' The broadcast is the first of five to be released over the course of the election campaign. A Conservative Party spokeswoman confirmed all those featured in the clip - including in the voice overs - are real people rather than actors. The film also features David Cameron enjoying a meal at home with his wife Samantha (pictured) and children . The broadcast is the first of five to be released over the course of the election campaign . In it, the party pledges to clear the deficit, back businesses so they can keep creating jobs and opportunities, keep investing in the NHS, deliver three million apprenticeships, deliver a good primary school place for every child, extend Help to Buy, continue to increase the state pension and protect pensioner benefits. Yesterday, it emerged Hollywood actor Martin Freeman is fronting a Labour election broadcast in which he praises the party's values and attacks the Conservatives for having 'sod-all to offer the young'. The Tories mocked the omission of any mention of party leader Ed Miliband during the film and criticised the decision to engage Freeman after controversy over his partner Amanda Abbington's tax affairs.","Theme of film is children and features parents talking about their offspring .

"The diverse genetic ancestry of North and South America has been mapped in unprecedented detail revealing key events the history books missed. The study compared the DNA of current Africans and Europeans using more than 4,000 DNA samples to reveal the genetic fingerprints of the slave trade and colonisation. It also highlighted previously unidentified ancestry, such as Basque lineages in South America, along with a ‘surprising’ degree of variation in the ancestry of modern-day Americans. The diverse genetic ancestry of North and South America has been mapped in unprecedented detail, revealing key events the history books missed. The study compared the genes of current Africans and Europeans using more than 4,000 DNA samples to reveal the genetic fingerprints of the slave trade and colonisation. This map reveals the location of donor and recipient populations analysed . The Oxford University team first grouped subsets of people in Africa and Europe who were genetically similar. They were able to separate European genomes into 37 groups. They then compared the data with the genomes from 2,500 people of mixed ancestry from the Americas. The method helped them identify detailed ancestry sources, such as Basque DNA patterns from Spain, rather than France. Overall the group, which also included researchers from University College London and the Universita' del Sacro Cuore of Rome, used DNA sample from 64 different populations. They included people in Barbados, Columbia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Puerto Rico and African-Americans in the USA. The study, led by Oxford University, compared the 'donor' African and European DNA with 'recipient' American populations to see where their ancestors came from. 'It was interesting to find so much complexity in the ancestry of American people,’ Professor Cristian Capelli from Oxford University told DailyMail.com. Professor Capellii, who is Italian, was particularly suprised to find evidence of the Basques in Colombia and the Italians in Puerto Rico, as well as the fact that some part of Spain, but not others, contributed Spanish DNA to the Americas . He explained how his team first grouped subsets of people in Africa and Europe who were genetically similar. Using something known as a 'haplotype-based' DNA technique, researchers were able to separate European genomes into 37 groups. They then compared the data with the genomes from 2,500 people of mixed ancestry from the Americas. The method helped them identify detailed ancestry sources, such as Basque DNA patterns from Spain, rather than France. In total, the group, which also included researchers from University College London and the Universita' del Sacro Cuore of Rome, used DNA sample from 64 different populations . They included people in Barbados, Columbia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Puerto Rico and African-Americans in the USA. The study found that while Spaniards provide the majority of European ancestry in continental American Hispanic/Latino populations, the most common European genetic source in African-Americans and Barbadians comes from the UK. The Basques, a distinct ethnic group spread across current-day Spain and France, provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current-day Continental South American populations, including the Maya in Mexico. Meanwhile, the Caribbean Islands of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic are genetically similar to each other and distinct from the other populations. The left image shows how much European ancestry is in the Americas, while the left image relates to American ancestry. The bars are colour coded to match the map above.  The Basques (light), a distinct ethnic group spread across current-day Spain and France, provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current-day Continental South American populations, including the Maya in Mexico .

The researchers say this probably reflects a different migration pattern between the Caribbean and mainland America. Compared to South Americans, people from Caribbean countries, such as the Barbados, had a larger genetic contribution from Africa. The ancestors of current-day Yoruba people from West Africa - which is one of the largest African ethnic groups - provided the largest contribution of genes from Africa to all current-day American populations. 'We can see the huge genetic impact that the slave trade had on American populations and our data match historical records', said study author Dr Garrett Hellenthal from the UCL Genetics Institute, . 'The majority of African Americans have ancestry similar to the Yoruba people in West Africa, confirming that most African slaves came from this region. ‘In areas of the Americas historically under Spanish rule, populations also have ancestry related to what is now Senegal and Gambia. Records show that around a third of the slaves sent to Spanish America in the 17th Century came from this region, and we can see the genetic evidence of this in modern Americans really clearly.' Researchers also found that the proportion of African ancestry varied across the continent, from virtually zero in the Maya people from Mexico to 87 per cent in current-day Barbados. South Italy and Sicily also provided a significant European genetic contribution to Colombia and Puerto Rico, in line with the known history of Italian emigrants to the Americas in the late 19th and early 20th century . One of the African-American groups from the USA had French ancestry, in agreement with historical French immigration into the colonial Southern United States. The proportion of genes from European versus African sources varied greatly from individual to individual within recipient populations. These genetic findings also uncover previously unknown migration. 'We found a clear genetic contribution from the Basques in modern-day Maya in Mexico', said Oxford University's Professor Cristian Capelli. 'This suggests that the Basque also took part in the colonisation of the Americas, coming over either with the Spanish conquistadores or in later waves of migration. 'The differences in European ancestry between the Caribbean islands and mainland American population that we found were also previously unknown. ‘It is likely that these differences reflect different patterns of migration between the Caribbean and mainland America. 'These results show just how powerful a genetic approach can be when it comes to uncovering hidden patterns of ancestry,’ added Professor Capelli. The team now hopes to use the same approach to look at other populations with diverse genetic contributions, such as Brazilians. Professor Capellii, who is Italian, was particularly suprised to find evidence of e Italians in Puerto Rico (bottom right), as well as the fact that some part of Spain, but not others, contributed Spanish DNA to the Americas.

"The grieving family of a Turkish prosecutor who died after being shot in the head and chest during courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral today. Thousands of people gathered on the streets of Istanbul to pay their respects to Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who died yesterday after the six-hour stand-off. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul. Mr Kiraz died in hospital after the members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots. Scroll down for video . Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grive over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15 . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group were holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Respect: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in Istanbul . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-Left. Police chief Selami Altınok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. Standing guard: Members of security forces stand outside the main courthouse in Istanbul during the siege . Horror: The prosecutor was leading an investigation into the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan . Protesters: Turkish police use water cannons to disperse protesters who expressed support for an alleged militant member of the banned leftist group DHKP-C group who took Turkish Mehmet Selim Kiraz hostage . In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head. They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. Emergency: An ambulance leaves the courthouse after police storm the building. Mr Kiraz was taken to hospital where he died from his injuries . Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. Moving in: Armed police massed outside the Istanbul courthouse . Rushed to safety: Court officials were seen being escorted to safety by armed police . Gunshots: According to the Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul. Innocent: Berkin was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister .

"A popular Chinese reality television show featuring celebrities paired with animals has been criticised by animal rights activists for its 'cruel' tasks. Hunan TV Station's animal reality show 'Wonderful Friends' - where stars perform tasks with animals in a south China zoo - became an instant hit when 20 million people tuned into the first episode. But the weekly show, which saw a chimpanzee start throwing things and in clear distress when separated from his son, has caused uproar amongst animal rights groups. Unnatural: A young orangutan is dressed in human clothes for the hit realilty show in China . An elephant is given a pedicure by Chinese actor Huang Xuan and a chimpanzee is forced to wear a Superman costume, in some of the show's more unusual scenes, dubbed 'cruel' by experts talking to People's Daily Online. Wildlife experts argue the programme is exploiting the animals, with many reacting in ways that show they are stressed. Cruel: Chinese actor Huang Xuan gives an elephant a pedicure in a bizarre task in a Chinese reality show . One expert, Miss Jiao, said that people are mistaking the creature's distressed reactions as cute. For example, a chimpanzee that appears to be 'grinning' is actually showing signs of of 'anxiety, fear and threat'. Pictures which show a young orangutan being dressed in human clothes could lead to alienation with other orangutans likely to ignore it, she warned. One part of the show saw a celebrity taking a young chimpanzee to 'Find its Father' which led to the father suddenly becoming emotional and violent. The creatures are known to chase, stomp and bite unknown chimpanzees or even commit infanticide, leading to worries about the impact the tasks are having on the wild animals. Angry: An adult male chimpanzee became emotional and violent during a game called 'Find its Father' where it was separated from its baby . Heartless: A young chimp is dressed in clothes while an elephant received a pedicure as part of the 'reality' tv show making waves in China . Producers have also been accused of courting disaster by placing potentially dangerous animals including lions, elephants and zebras alongside inexperienced celebrity zookeepers. Chang Jiwen, deputy head of the Development Research Centre of Resources and Environmental Policy Institute, said animals should not be used for the sake of entertainment and called for tougher legislation. 'We cannot use our emotions to design and manipulate the animals, animals are not there to be harassed for the entertainment of people,' he said. 'We should not start from the emotional needs of ourselves or for effect or for ratings of the show to interfere with the lives of animals. 'When they see these strangers, they might become afraid and take action because of the stress, which is very dangerous to human beings,' said wildlife activist Wang Hui, from Animals Asia, a Hong Kong-based campaigning group. She complained animals were being forced to live side-by-side with those from different continents with how orangutans, which are native to South-east Asia, put next to baby chimpanzees, which hail from Africa. She said there would be little left of the show if the inappropriate parts were lost and was particularly concerned about the unnatural and stressful tasks for the creatures such as making lions socialise with celebrities and having chimpanzees go clothes shopping. Critics also argue it is setting a bad example when in January, the State Forestry Administration issued a notice, forbidding tourists to have close contact with endangered wild animals. Not babies: Critics have hit out at the unnatural tasks animals are being forced to do like chimps being taken shopping, pictured above . It follows a trip by the Duke of Cambridge to China earlier this month where he wanted to highlight the fight to conserve and save endangered species in the country. But the makers of the show hit back, saying it was fully complicit with the laws of the State . A spokesman said: 'We strictly abide by all laws and regulations set out by the State. 'Contact with the animals is a serious issue and when we were creating the show, we did so with the knowledge of the laws and regulations.' It went on to say that the regulations set by the State Forestry Administration were referring to 'rare and endangered wild animals'.","20 million tune in for first episode of reality show 'Wonderful Friends'

"The Croatian city of Zadar is famous for the magical sounds that emanate from its shoreline overlooking the Adriatic Sea. The work of architect Nikola Basic and expert Dalmatian stone carvers, the musical sea organ (morske orgulje) was created in 2005 and is the first of its kind in the world. Carved into the white stone, the aerophone is 70 meters long and contains a total of 35 organ pipes built under the concrete. The movement of the sea pushes air through each of the individual organ pipes via a plastic tube submerged in the water. And depending on the size and power of the wave, unique musical chords are played through each of the whistle openings on the quayside above. As the sea forces are unpredictable in terms of tidal power, the organ provides a never-ending composition that features numerous musical variations. The sea organ itself was built as part of a music project that looked to repair Zadar, which had suffered much damage during the Second World War. The musical sea organ is the work of architect Nikola Basic and expert Dalmatian stone carvers . The aerophone is 70 meters long and contains a total of 35 organ pipes, which are built under the concrete . It was opened to the public in April 2005 in a bid to redesign the new city coast by having the waves interact with the organ and thus with the people on the shore via the medium of music. The sea organ was awarded with the prize ex-aequo of the fourth edition of the European Prize for Urban Public Space in 2006. Zadar is the centre of its namesake county – a part of the wider northern Dalmatian region. Director Alfred Hitchcock is believed to have said that Zadar has the most beautiful sunset in the world, which can be seen from the exact spot of where the organ is today.

"Chilling new images have emerged of three men accused of homosexuality and blasphemy being forced to their knees and publicly beheaded by a sword-wielding Islamic State executioner. Photographs of the barbaric murders show the blindfolded men kneeling in the centre of what appears to be a traffic roundabout with a crowd of people looking on as a masked executioner stands by with a long, rusty blade. After an elderly man uses a microphone to read to the crowd from his notes, the executioner then steps forward with the blade poised above the men's heads in the unnamed city in northern Iraq. The executioner stands with the sword poised above the man's head as a large crowd gathers to watch . The beheading appears to take place at a traffic roundabout in northern Iraq's Nineveh province . One of the blindfolded victims kneels with his head forward immediately prior to the beheading. Messages accompanying the images claimed two men were accused of homosexuality and a third of blasphemy . An elderly man reads to the crowd from his notes in the moments leading up to the three men's deaths . Accompanying captions said the trio were then beheaded - two for engaging in homosexual acts and the third for alleged blasphemy - but there were no images released of the actual beheading. The jihadist group, which controls swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria, has carried out hundreds of barbaric executions as it has imposed its brutal version of Islamic law, many of which are photographed or videotaped. The photos were said to have been taken in Nineveh province - the first to fall to a sweeping IS-led offensive last June - but the exact location was not specified. Many young men have also been thrown from the roofs of buildings throughout ISIS-controlled areas after being accused of engaging in homosexual acts. The stomach-churning photographs usually show a blindfolded victim being dragged to the top of a building by black-masked militants. As crowds gather at street level the men are thrown to their death, while jihadis and members of the public use mobile phones to film the gruesome murders. Iraqi troops and militia are battling to push the jihadists back with support from a US-led coalition and Iran. But retaking Nineveh and its capital Mosul poses a major challenge for Baghdad's forces, as the militants have had more than nine months to dig in. Iraqi forces launched a huge operation last week aimed at retaking the city of Tikrit that, if successful, would serve as a stepping stone towards Mosul. A crowd gathers around the outskirts of the traffic roundabout to view the bloody spectacle . Images of the bloodthirsty group's latest execution come amid claims a former member of ISIS claimed he witnessed the British graduate dubbed Jihadi John behead a Japanese hostage. The man, named only as Saleh, said the masked militant who appears in several beheading videos was a senior figure in the extremist organisation responsible for murdering foreign captives. Jihadi John, who was recently unmasked as 26-year-old Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was last seen in a video posted online which appeared to show Japanese hostage Kenji Goto lying dead. Saleh, who worked as a translator, also revealed that ISIS routinely subjected hostages to mock executions so that when their beheading did finally come they were not expecting to die, according to Sky News.","Masked jihadi executioner is filmed standing over men with huge sword .

Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of Sophia Walker after she was found unresponsive in the early hours of Saturday. Her mother Patricia Hodgdon, 34, wrote a series of messages on Facebook saying: 'Me and Chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak. 'I want her back. Please please. Why why please say I'm dreaming plz.' Ambulance crews rushed to the home in Dundee after receiving reports of the  sudden death, but they were unable to revive the baby. It is understood that Sophia was born premature in late December and lived with her mother and father, Charles Walker, at the home in Kirkton. Both the parents were being comforted by friends and relatives today and flowers were laid at the gate of the house. Police Scotland confirmed an investigation has been launched into the death and that it is being treated as unexplained. A spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained. Inquiries are at an early stage and as is standard practice a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.' Neighbour Dexylee Mullady, 19, said she was shocked and saddened that the baby had died. She said: 'I have only ever seen pictures of her on Facebook and never seen her outside. She looked like she was a tiny little thing - I can't believe this has happened. 'This is really horrible - we can't imagine what the family must be going through.' She said police had been outside the home in Dundee all weekend. A police van  was outside the home in Dundee all weekend and friends left flowers and tributes at the gate .","Three month-old Sophia Walker was found dead at her home in Dundee .

"A Norwegian man could be imprisoned for cutting off his own beard and gluing it to another man's head to create a toupee. He claims the recipient of the home-made hairpiece - who had a restraining order against him - wanted it because he was bald, according to the prosecutor in the case. The man in his 40s is also being tried for a string of other petty crimes including burglary and theft following the alleged attack which took place in Hordaland county on Norway's west coast on Friday. Bad hair day: A Norwegian man in his 40s could be imprisoned for cutting off his own beard and gluing to another man's head (file photo) Harald Bilberg told the Bergens Tidende newspaper: 'He was bald, so the accused claims that they had agreed to create a toupee for the aggrieved party. 'These incidents happened a long way out in the police district, and we therefore believe it is important that those who live there are protected.' 'We are not talking about serious crimes, but it's more of a nuisance. I must admit that I have never encountered such a case in my career.' The man who has already been convicted of seven crimes and fined 13 times was in breach of a restraining order imposed to protect the recipient of the toupee. Hordaland country's remoteness on Norway's west coast makes it very difficult for the police to access quickly during an emergency. Mr Bilberg said the frequency of the man's offences should be judged accordingly so he does not go on to commit new crimes.

"David Cameron has been told that he can stay in Downing Street even if he loses the election while other parties try to piece together a coalition. He will remain Prime Minister until an alternative is found, and ministers who lose their seats could continue to serve in a caretaker government for weeks. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the country's top civil servant, insisted that Mr Cameron must remain in Number 10 until there can be a 'smooth transition' to a new government. David Cameron will remain Prime Minister until an alternative is found, and ministers who lose their seats could continue to serve in a caretaker government for weeks . In 2010, Gordon Brown was accused of 'squatting' in Downing Street while the Tories and Lib Dems negotiated the details of their coalition pact. But Sir Jeremy, the Cabinet Secretary, insisted that it was the right thing to do to ensure the wheels of government kept turning. Five years ago the coalition deal was agreed in just five days, but with a hung parliament likely again, it is expected that any power-sharing agreement could take much longer, possibly even several weeks. Sir Jeremy told the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee: 'The reality is what Gordon Brown did last time I think was generally applauded, not in every single quarter. 'But the idea that you would stay in Downing Street until it was pretty clear who would be better placed than you to form another government, that's what he did, that's what happened and we ended up with a very smooth transition. 'I would certainly urge a future prime minister in the same position to adopt a similar approach.' Sir Jeremy Heywood, the country's top civil servant, insisted that Mr Cameron must remain in Number 10 until there can be a 'smooth transition' to a new government . Polls suggest both Labour and the Tories will fall short of securing an overall majority at the general election on May 7. With the SNP on the rise in Scotland, the Lib Dems defending 57 seats and Ukip predicting they will win more than 10 seats, it is possible that no two parties would be able to form a majority. A coalition deal between three or more parties would take much longer to agree, and could prove unstable. Sir Jeremy added: 'I think it would be very unfair, particularly if it took slightly longer next time than just the five days it took last time, it would be very unfair if the incumbent prime minister was criticised for staying around in Downing Street when he was simply doing what most people would regard as the expectation placed upon him.' In 2010, Gordon Brown was accused of 'squatting' in Downing Street while the Tories and Lib Dems negotiated the details of their coalition pact . Sir Jeremy said it would be a 'bad mistake to drag' the Queen into any decisions or negotiations that would need to be taken if no party has a clear majority after the election, even if there if two coalitions were formed of equal numbers, telling the committee it was a decision for politicians. Asked if the ministers who have been kicked out by voters would be able to remain part of a caretaker government, he replied: 'Yes, they can'. Sir Jeremy told the committee he has talked to David Cameron about the role of the civil service during any coalition negotiations after May 7. 'I have discussed it with the Prime Minister and he is agreed in principle that the civil service should play the same role in 2015, if it is needed, as was played in 2010 but we haven't yet got into any detail,' he said. Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have all introduced new processes since the last election to take factor in the possibility of a hung parliament.","Top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood reveals post-election planning .

"Surgeons often describe the tricky operation to remove a brain tumour as ‘trying to pluck a spider out of jelly’. Take out too little and the cancerous ‘legs’ remain and regrow – but take out too much and there is a risk of cutting away healthy tissue and leaving the patient disabled. Now a British hospital is trialling a laser that bleeps like a parking sensor on a car when the scalpel gets to the edge of the cancerous areas, letting surgeons know their margins for error. In a world first, neurosurgeons at London’s Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust have started using the pen-like probe, called the Core, which shines a near-infrared light on to a tumour and scans for subtle differences between healthy and cancerous tissue. The device can read the differences in less than a second, and gives a warning sound if the surgeon is close to healthy tissue. About 16,000 Britons are diagnosed with a brain tumour every year, and more children and adults under 40 die from the condition than from any other cancer. There are more than 120 types. Surgeons hope the Core, which has already proved successful in skin-cancer surgery in Canada, will allow them to remove as much of the cancerous growth as possible and also speed up operating times. The probe was used for the first time during brain surgery at Imperial last week as part of a trial that will involve 30 patients over the next year. Senior neurosurgical trainee Babar Vaqas, who spearheaded the project to bring the Core to the UK, says: ‘There really is nothing like this at the moment. ‘Brain surgery is a very complex operation – sometimes even taking just a millimetre too much can cause real damage, such as paralysis or problems with speech. Having something that will make surgery safer and more accurate could be a real game-changer.’ One of the major obstacles at present is that the boundary between the tumour and healthy brain tissue is very hard to distinguish, even with an operating microscope. Currently, surgeons must rely on taking several tiny cuttings of tissue to ensure they are only taking away that which is cancerous. It can take up to 90 minutes for these biopsies to be tested and for results to be fed back to surgeons, all while the patient remains in the operating theatre. Surgeons believe the pen-like probe could shave up to 30 minutes off the average three-hour surgery time (picture posed by models) Instead of taking a physical sample, a surgeon holds the Core over the area being operated on and a beam is emitted from the tip of the probe, scanning for changes in the chemical composition of brain tissue. A tumour molecule vibrates differently from healthy molecules under laser light, causing the light to bounce back in a different way. This is picked up by the probe, and the signal is then interpreted by a computer, giving an instant reading of whether the tissue is cancerous. Mr Vaqas believes using the Core could shave up to 30 minutes off the average three-hour surgery time. ‘Having a device that takes less than a second to tell the difference between healthy and cancerous tissue means we could potentially avoid taking unnecessary biopsies, and also perform more surgeries in a day,’ he says. The Core’s makers, Canadian company Verisante Technology, hopes the work at Imperial will replicate the success of a similar trial used to detect skin cancer on 1,000 patients at a hospital in Vancouver. The Imperial trial is being part-funded by charity Brain Tumour Research Campaign, which claims research into diagnostics and treatment is ‘woefully underfunded’. Founder Wendy Fulcher says: ‘Taking away healthy tissue can have disastrous consequences, so this probe is hugely exciting.’","British surgeons use pen-like probe to spot brain tumours for the first time .

"DNA molecules extracted from fish sperm is being used to develop new types of flame retardant materials. Scientists recently discovered that DNA is highly resistant to fire. And in a series of experiments, the researchers coated cloth in the DNA  from herring sperm cells and found it converts to a ceramic-like material when exposed to extreme heat. Cotton layered with DNA molecules resists burning as the genetic material forms a ceramic-like coating over the fabric, shown in the bottom image in the photograph above, while untreated cotton will burn readily (top) This char-like foam then helps to prevent the flames from catching alight on the material. Researchers behind the work believe DNA could provide a natural and environmentally-friendly way of protecting fabrics from fire. DNA was thought to be a delicate and easily damaged material. However, in recent years scientists have discovered it can survive the harsh conditions of space and even the heat of reentry. Scientists who attached small double strands of DNA to the outer casing of a rocket said they were 'completely surprised' when more than half the samples remained intact. This was despite temperatures soaring to more than 1,000°C (1,800°F) during the short flight to sub-orbital space and back, and it raises the possibility of extraterrestrial life molecules arriving on Earth from space. The Texus-49 sub-orbital mission launched from the European base of Esrange in Kiruna, northern Sweden, and was originally intended to study the influence of gravity on the genes of human cells carried inside the rocket. But scientists decided, in addition, to test the effects space travel has on DNA when carried at three positions on the rocket's outer casing - and found it survived. Currently many materials including furniture, such as sofas, are coated in chemical flame retardants that have been found to be accumulating in the environment and have been linked to infertility, cancers and birth defects. Professor Giulio Malucelli, a materials scientist at the Polytechnic University of Turin, Italy, has been leading the research. Speaking to Mail Online, he said: 'DNA has a peculiar chemical structure that is intumescent-like. 'This means that it possesses some flame retardant features that could be exploited for conferring fire resistance to fabrics and also to low melting plastics.' He added that DNA could be particularly useful as a way of making textiles flame retardant. Writing in the journal Polymer, he and his colleagues said: 'We have explored its flame retardant activity by applying as a surface coating on cotton fabrics and observed that on exposure to heat, the DNA was able to form a foamed char on the surface of the fabric. 'DNA has proven to be an efficient renewable, natural flame suppressant and retardant, due to its intrinsic intumescent features.' Biologists have known for some time that DNA is extremely sensitive to heat as it the helical structure can deform out of shape when it is heated even gently. Professor Malucelli and his colleagues, however, found that when it is exposed to temperatures above 200°C (392°F), its properties change causing it to form a foam. Their findings were highlighted by io9.com. The researchers found that layers of DNA applied to cotton could reduce the amount of heat released by fire by 40 per cent and limits the availability of oxygen to the flames. And in a more recent paper, published in the journal Polymer Degradation and Stability, they found that DNA changes chemically to have this effect. Researchers behind the work believe DNA could provide a natural and environmentally-friendly way of protecting fabrics from fire. For the study they used DNA extracted from the sperm of herring (pictured above) to protect pieces of cotton . The images above show cotton coated with DNA before burning (b and c) and after it has burned (d and e). So-called deoxyribose groups in DNA release water when they are set alight and form a gel that chars and acts as a protective shield to the rest of the material. This process is known as an 'itnumescent effect' The deoxyribose groups in the DNA release water when they are set alight and form a foaming gel that chars and acts as a protective shield to the rest of the material. This process is known as an 'itnumescent effect'. The water also combines with phosphoric acid created from the phosphate groups that form part of the backbone of the DNA molecule to create a flame retardant residue. Nitrogen in each of the DNA bases also form ammonia when heated - another flame retardant. Dr Jenny Alongi, a researcher also at the Polytechnic University of Turin who has been working on the study with Professor Malucelli, said DNA appeared to become intumescent at relatively low temperatures compared to other fire retardant materials. Sperm cells, shown above approaching an egg, could provide DNA for use in future flame retardant materials . In cells DNA binds itself together to form chromosomes (shown above) but when heated it rapidly denatures . She said: 'This may be the reason for the DNA high fire retardant effectiveness particularly when DNA is layered onto polymer surface. 'The intumescent fire protection screen is thus formed at a lower temperature than that at which thermal decomposition of organic polymers occurs. 'Furthermore, the chemical composition of the intumescent residue on heat exposure is converted into a highly thermally stable ceramic-like material which is resistant to thermal oxidation. 'Thus, the fire protection built by DNA decomposition can withstand fire exposure for longer time than traditional intumescent fire retardants.' The researchers also recently found that some proteins found in biological cells have similar fire resistant  properties - raising the prospect of a new generation of biological flame retardants.","Researchers at the Polytechnic University of Turin are using DNA extracted from herring sperm cells to develop new types of flame retardant materials .

"Living legend Candice Bergen says at 68 she is happy being fat and lives to eat . At 68 and after a full and varied career which has taken in modeling for Vogue, an Oscar-nomination and countless Emmys for her hit TV show Murphy Brown, Candice Bergen says she is happy being fat and now lives to eat. In her new memoir, A Fine Romance, the living legend estimates she has put on 30 pounds in the past 15 years, but says she simply doesn't care. 'In the past 15 years... I have put on 30 pounds. I live to eat. None of this ""eat to live"" stuff for me. I am a champion eater. No carb is safe — no fat, either,' she readily admits. 'At a recent dinner party I shared bread and olive oil, followed by chocolate ice cream with my husband. A woman near me looked at me, appalled, and I thought, ""I don't care,""' she writes. Women over 50 typically have to choose between preserving either their face or their butts and she writes that she has happily chosen the former. 'Dieting is out of my purview,' she confesses. 'I crave cookies... all the things that dilate my pupils.' Her skinny friends and their constant battles to remain thin only reinforce her belief that she is doing what is right for her. 'They maintain their weight by routinely vomiting after major meals consisting of a slice of steak or a filet of fish,' she writes. 'I am incapable of this.' In her new book, A Fine Romance, Candice Bergen talks at her joy at playing feisty TV reporter Murphy Brown for 10 seasons.  'She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless,' she writes . The brutally honest appraisal of her current weight is just one of the topics up for discussioin in her new book, which comes out on April 7, reports Vogue. The follow-up to her 1984 memoir Knock Wood, A Fine Romance focuses on her 15-year marriage to French director Louis Malle who died of cancer in 1995 and her career-defining role as funny, feisty career woman and TV news reporter Murphy Brown. The hit TV show ran for ten seasons between 1989 and 1998 and Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five. After her fifth win, Bergen declined future nominations for the role. Initially she writes that she wasn't thrilled at the idea of acting in a TV show, but after reading the script she realized it was 'written for me.' 'The lead was a television news reporter. She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless. 'Smart, fast-paced, and funny, the dialogue was similar to the great comedies of the 1940s. Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five, for her role as Murphy Brown, left. In the 1960s she had also modeled for Vogue as her acting career was taking off, right . 'There was something in the writing of the Murphy character that hooked me, as she eventually hooked many women. 'Is it that she was, in many ways, who we wished we could be as women? Successful in a field dominated by men? Free of the need to please? Impolitic, impolite, yet in some weird way, irresistible?' Despite the network initially trying to have the role rewritten for a younger actress such as Heather Locklear, writer-producer Diane English insisted it had to be about a 40-something woman fresh out of the Betty Ford clinic. 'The character fit me like a glove. I was instantly comfortable with the writing,' recalls Bergen. 'Diane had created a complex, original, endearing, feisty, take-no-prisoners woman. And more surprisingly, a woman who cared not a whit what others thought of her. That character gave me permission to be my brattiest, bawdiest self.' Bergen writes that the character was the first time she felt able to thrown myself into a role 'with such abandon and joy.' Bergen won acclaim early in her acting career for roles in movies such as The Adventurers, left, and has a new autobiography, A Fine Romance, out in April . After working as a fashion model and featuring on the cover of Vogue, Bergen's acting career began in the mid-60s with films such as The Sand Pebbles and The Adventurers. In 1979 she received best supporting Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Starting Over. But while her big screen roles had played on her 'glacial Nordic looks', the role of Murphy Brown allowed her to express must more range. 'What I had going for me was the element of surprise. No one ever expected me to be funny, not least because of my glacial Nordic looks and affect,' she writes. 'I'd mostly been reviled in my acting career. My Oscar nomination for Starting Over was an anomaly; basically I'd had fifteen years of bad notices by the time Murphy came along.' As well as receiving recognition for her acting talent, Bergen said the role also saw her receive recognition as a style icon. 'I wanted every outfit to be an event. And in a way, they were. Women loved what Murphy wore,' she writes. Bergen even lays claim to inventing the open-backed baseball cap. Bergen was married for 15 years to French director Louis Malle before he died of cancer in 1995 . 'When I wanted to wear a baseball cap with a high ponytail, we couldn't find one with an opening in the back, so Judy McGiveney, our wardrobe woman, made one by cutting a hole in the back,' she writes. 'A couple of months after the show aired, you could buy them in any store. Now they're standard.' Bergen writes that she enjoyed ten years of 'insane fun' playing Brown. 'Yet I never wanted it to end; doing Murphy Brown was insanely fun. When the writing was good, it was a giddy, joyous experience. I was the most comfortable and confident I'd ever been,' she writes. 'The part was a godsend—a fantastic role that completely suited me. My friends were all happy for me; it was unusual for a woman my age to get that role and that success.' Since the show ended in 1998, Bergen has appeared in movies including Miss Congeniality and Sweet Home Alabama, as well as staring in Boston Legal for five seasons. She has also made guest appearances on many other TV shows, including Seinfeld, Law & Order, Family Guy, Will & Grace and Sex and the City. Bergen is now married to New York real estate magnate and philanthropist Marshall Rose.","Candice Bergen says at 68 she is happy being fat and lives to eat .

"The financial details of members of Vladimir Putin's inner circle could be published by ministers to expose the rampant corruption and wealth of his henchmen and allies. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he was interested in the idea of publicising what is known by the government about the ruling Russian elite. Such a move would expose how those close to the President were exploiting their positions to obtain enormous wealth, and embarrass them in front of the Russian people. Asked if there was an argument for the 'interesting' financial arrangements of members of Putin's inner circle to be published by ministers, Mr Hammond replied: 'There might be'. Philip Hammond labelled Vladimir Putin as potentially the 'single greatest threat' to Britain's security . 'When we talk about having further steps that we can take, increasing the pressure on Russia, one the headings that we regularly review is strategic communication: how can we message the Russian people and to people that Russia is seeking to influence about what is really going on? 'It is an interesting thought and I will make sure the strategic communications people are thinking precisely about that.' In a speech in Westminster yesterday Mr Hammond labelled President Putin as potentially the 'single greatest threat' to Britain's security. He labelled the Russian military's stance 'increasingly aggressive' and warned of the 'rapid pace' of Russia's efforts to modernise her military in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute in London. 'We are in familiar territory for anyone over the age of about 50, with Russia's behaviour a stark reminder that it has the potential to pose the single greatest threat to our security. 'Hence, continuing to gather intelligence on Russia's capabilities and intentions will remain a vital part of intelligence effort for the foreseeable future. It is no coincidence that all of our agencies are recruiting Russian speakers again.' Mr Hammond labelled the Russian military's stance 'increasingly aggressive' and warned of the 'rapid pace' of Russia's efforts to modernise her military in a speech in London . Later Mr Hammond told the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Britain would consider arming the Ukranians if it 'crumbled' in the face of Russian aggression. 'If the Ukranian army crumbled or if there was clear evidence the Ukranian army was under sustained attack and not holding the line because of inadequacy of equipment and weapons we would certainly consider again.' 'The PM made clear we are keeping our options open but we do not think there is a military solution to this conflict.'","The rampant corruption of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle could be exposed .

"Lord Mandelson said there was almost certainly going to be a 'stalemate hung Parliament' Former Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson has dismissed Labour's chances of winning a majority at the election. The Labour peer said there was almost certainly going to be a 'stalemate hung Parliament'. Lord Mandelson also stopped well short of offering his enthusiastic endorsement of Ed Miliband and once again attacked Labour's proposed 'mansion tax' on expensive homes. He said the tax on properties worth over £2million would not 'in a month of Sundays' raise the £1.2 billion a year predicted by the Labour leader. Asked if the party would be doing better under another leader, the peer said: 'Do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping? It depends what you think people are voting for.' The Tories seized on the former business secretary's comments as proof that Labour is relying on support from the Scottish National Party to propel Mr Miliband into 10 Downing Street. Looking ahead to the election during a speech at the Retail Week Live conference in London, Lord Mandelson said: 'People basically are unhappy with what is on offer. 'They are therefore shopping around in politics in a way that the large parties are ill-equipped to deal with and which will almost certainly deliver us a stalemate hung Parliament in two months' time.' Answering questions after the speech, Lord Mandelson was asked if Labour would be doing better in the polls 'if it had a leader the public liked better'. After a long pause, the Labour peer replied: 'Do you think your product would be better if you changed the wrapping? 'It depends what you think people are voting for. People are voting for more than simply the personification of a party. 'Of course that is important, but they are voting for the party's values and the party's relevance, the quality of that product and whether they think that product - or in our case as politicians, that policy - will do for them. 'Of course, the leader has a responsibility for being the chief brand carrier of that product or policy. 'I think you will see that, as the real election campaign gets under way, the leader of the Labour Party will have the opportunities as well as the pressure to explain, get his message across and to draw others more towards him and the party in order to shape their voting decision.' Lord Mandelson stopped well short of offering his enthusiastic endorsement of Ed Miliband in a question and answer session today . Speaking later at a Fabian conference in Westminster, Lord Mandelson said he had been trying to make the point that people should not become 'infatuated with personality-driven media-obsessed politics' which focus entirely on the identity of the leader. Discussing the mansion tax, he said: 'Not in a month of Sundays will it raise the amount of money that is projected. Everyone knows that it won't.' Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Lord Mandelson is confirming what we now all know - the only way Miliband will get into Downing Street is if he's carried there in Alex Salmond's pocket. 'That would mean more borrowing, higher taxes and weaker defences. Hard-working taxpayers would pay the price for the resulting economic chaos and a weak leader who simply isn't up to the job of being Prime Minister.' Michael Fallon wrote to the Labour leader demanding that he formally rule out a deal with the Scottish nationalists . Ed Miliband is facing mounting pressure to rule out negotiating with the SNP over Britain's Trident weapons system – after ministers announced £285million of new cash for the next generation of nuclear submarines. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon wrote to the Labour leader demanding that he formally rule out a deal with the Scottish nationalists. Mr Fallon said the Labour leader could only make it to Number 10 with the support of the SNP, who want the next government to scrap Britain's nuclear deterrent.

"A clueless criminal who spent 15 years behind bars for robbing a children's shoe shore has admitted targeting the outlet again a day after his release... and the same shop assistant was behind the counter. In 1999, Christopher Miller - then 25 - was arrested after he forced employees into the back room of the Stride Rite shoe store in New Jersey in the U.S., tied them up and fled with cash. After serving a 15-year sentence, Miller was released  from South Woods State Prison in March last year. Clueless criminal: Christopher Miller (pictured in 1999, left, and more recently, right) robbed the same store twice . Police said Miller, then 40, entered the store at about 4.20pm the following day and demanded cash, telling the workers - a 17-year-old boy and 43-year-old woman - to go to the back room. He was not believed to be armed and the workers refused to follow his orders. He became agitated, according to police, and took the cash register drawer, which contained $389 (£260). He then took the workers' mobile phones and the store phone, and fled on foot. Police said they found Miller a few blocks away, with the cash stashed in a gutter and the phones in a garbage can. The clerk had been notified about Miller's release and identified the suspect as the same person who had robbed the store in 1999. At the time, Toms River Police Chief Mitchell Little said he wondered whether Miller considers prison his home. Shoe store: The shop assistant had been notified about Miller's release and identified the suspect as the same person who had robbed the store in 1999 . 'Maybe that's the only life he knows, and the only thing he could think of was going back to the same store and doing the same crime again - getting caught and going back where he was taken care of and told what to do and getting meals and shelter and everything else,' he said. Miller was charged with robbery - again - and was held on $100,000 (£668,000) bail. On Monday, he pleaded guilty to second-degree robbery. He faces a prison term of between 10 and 20 years when he is sentenced in May. In 1999, Miller was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a total of three armed robberies in New Jersey, as well as theft, criminal restraint and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.","Christopher Miller, 41, has admitted robbing the same U.S. shoe store twice .

"Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. will be released from a federal prison on Thursday and will serve out the remainder of his term in a Washington, D.C., halfway house, former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy told The Associated Press after visiting Jackson behind bars. Kennedy said he spoke with Jackson at the minimum security federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, where the son of the civil rights leader has been serving a 2 ½-year sentence after pleading guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on more than 3,000 personal items. The expenditures included fur capes, lavish interior decorations for his home and rock music memorabilia. Jackson's plea deal was arranged just two days after he was re-elected to represent his Illinois congressional district. At the time Republicans cried foul, noting that they would have had a chance to win hsi seat if news had emerged before Election Day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former Illinois Rep Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife, Sandra, were both convicted of federal crimes in a scheme that involved spending mroe than $750,000 of his campaign money on more than 3,000 personal items . BIG HOUSE: Jackson sered his time at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex outside of Raleigh, North Carolina – the same prison where investment fraudster Bernie Madoff is incarcerated . Jackson Jr.'s father, Rev. Jesse Jackson (left) and his wife Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (right) attended court sessions in 2013 and were present for their son's sentencing . Jackson began the sentence on Nov. 1, 2013. The Bureau of Prisons lists his final release date as Sept. 20, 2015. The disgraced lawmaker's crime was officially described as wire and mail fraud, catch-all federal criminal categories frequently used as placeholders for financial corruption. His wife, Sandra, was also sentenced to a year in prison in connection with the corruption scheme. She pleaded guilty to a single charge of filing a false tax return in an attempt to hide the fraud. Court documents showed that Sandra, a Chicago city councilwoman when she was charged, had spent her husband's campaign funds on vacations, electronics and furs. She was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, in addition to the $750,000 her husband had to pay back. The U.S. Marshals Service seized all the items purchased illegally and auctioned everything to repay what they stole. Also sold was their richly decorated Washington, D.C. townhouse. The haul included one of the late singer Michael Jackson's fedoras and a guitar reportedly signed by both Michael Jackson and rock star Eddie Van Halen. In an unusual arrangement, a federal judge allowed Mrs. Jackson to avoid reporting to prison until her husband's release so that their children would not lose both parents at once. She will likely begin serving her sentence in September. Jesse Jackson Jr. sold his Washington, D.C. town house (pictured) to help pay a $750,000 forfeiture he owed after his guilty plea . The US Marshals Service auctioned off some of the Jacksons' ill-gotten goods – including these two furs . Kennedy said he was in the area giving a speech on children's mental health and decided to visit Jackson on Monday. 'You can imagine my surprise when I'm there, and I'm talking to him, and he says, ""I'm leaving Thursday morning"",' Kennedy said. He said Jackson, 50, told him he would be picked up from prison by his wife, Sandra; his two children; his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and his mother, Jacqueline Jackson. His family will then take him to the halfway house. 'He said he'd have to report with his probation officer and he'd have to get some kind of job and start to put his life back together,' Kennedy said. Kennedy said he had not seen Jackson since August 2012, when he visited him at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota after Jackson took a leave from Congress and checked himself in for bipolar disorder. Kennedy has been an outspoken advocate on mental health issues. The two men served as Democrats in Congress together, and both have famous fathers. Kennedy's father was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. SUMPTUOUS: Jackson's Washington, DC house got a decorator's touch, courtesy of his campaign donors . Among the items auctioned by the US Marshals Service was this framed and autographed cymbal from Michael Jackson's last concert tour . Bureau of Prisons spokesman Edmond Ross said he could not confirm that Jackson would be released to a halfway house, saying the bureau does not consider such plans public information. The Rev. Jesse Jackson directed inquiries to the Bureau of Prisons. He confirmed that Kennedy had met with his son. Messages left for attorneys for Jackson Jr. were not immediately returned. Kennedy said Jackson's mental health is much better than the last time he saw him at the Mayo Clinic. Kennedy said Jackson had even put a positive spin on his time in prison, saying it had allowed him to 'unplug' from the world. 'He's a lot more at ease with his role and responsibility with what got him into jail,' Kennedy said. He added that Jackson 'feels he's done his time.' Kennedy said they also talked about what's next. 'He's also very excited about what lies ahead for him in the future, which I think is very hopeful,' he said.","Former congressman pleaded guilty in 2013 to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on himself and his wife – buying more than 3,000 items .

"Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has offered to cover the cost of life imprisonment for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan if Indonesia agrees to call of their executions. Ms Bishop made the offer in a letter written to her Indonesian counterpart, Retno Marsudi, on March 5 saying Australia would pay the bill if the country rejected a prisoner swap offer. The letter, reportedly addressed 'My dear Retno', formally made the one-off offer to swap three convicted Indonesian drug smugglers for Chan and Sukumaran. Scroll down for video . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has offered to cover the cost of life imprisonment for Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan if Indonesia agrees to call of their executions . Ms Bishop (pictured at a vigil for the two Bali Nine ringleaders in Canberra) made the offer in a letter written to her Indonesian counterpart, Retno Marsudi, on March 5 . Ms Bishop noted the Indonesian prisoners were convicted of importing 390kg of heroin to Australia - 47 times the amount Chan and Sukumaran's co-convicted were caught trying to smuggle out of Indonesia. 'As discussed, the Australian Government would be prepared to cover the costs of the ongoing life imprisonment of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran should a transfer not be possible,' she wrote. 'The vast majority of Australians very strongly support the government's efforts to seek clemency for Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. 'We would not want to see their execution compromise the strong ties we have worked so hard to foster over many years.' Ms Marsudi, in a letter of reply dated March 8, rejected the possibility of a prisoner exchange but did not touch on the reimbursement offer. 'Let me reiterate that there is no legal basis within the Indonesian law that would allow for such exchange to take place,' she said. Sukumaran (centre) and Chan are in quarantine conditions on Nusakambangan island off Java awaiting execution after they were transferred from Bali's Kerobokan prison . The letter, reportedly addressed 'My dear Retno', formally made the one-off offer to swap three convicted Indonesian drug smugglers for Chan (pictured) and Sukumaran . Indonesian President Joko Widodo previously ruled out a prisoner swap arrangement. Ms Bishop also listed alleged corruption from judges in the trial as one of the reasons their executions should be stopped, according to the West Australian. 'A Judicial Commission has invited Mr Chan, Mr Sukumaran and their original lawyer to make statements in a matter relating to alleged corruption of the trial judges,' she wrote. 'These are serious allegations and I request that your Government accord due legal process and institute a pause in the execution preparations.' Diplomatic tension has been high regarding the case with an Indonesian minister threatening to release a 'human tsunami' of asylum seekers towards Australia if the government continued to fight for a stay of execution for the Bali Nine duo. The warning came from the coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs -Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno - to remind the government who was working to keep asylum seekers away from Australian shores, according to Fairfax Media. Retno Marsudi, in a letter of reply dated March 8, rejected the possibility of a prisoner exchange but did not touch on the reimbursement offer . 'Bali Nine' enforcer Myuran Sukumaran (left) and ringleader Andrew Chan were locked up in Bali for 10 years before being moved to their place of execution by firing squad . Ms Bishop also listed alleged corruption from judges in the trial as one of the reasons their executions should be stopped . It comes after Indonesian government officials took offence to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's comments about Australia donating $1 billion in aid to help recovery after the Boxing Day tsunami along with threatening to discourage visitors to Bali. The Bali Nine ringleaders are in quarantine conditions on Nusakambangan island off Java awaiting execution, with their lawyers returning next week after their appeal hearing was adjourned. The men's Australian lawyer, Peter Morrissey, described Ms Bishop's offer as attractive but raised doubts about whether Indonesian authorities would take it up. 'Whether that on its own will do the trick, I doubt,' Mr Morrissey told the Seven Network. Andrew's mother Helen Chan was accompanied by Myuran's brother Chintu and mother Raji as they visited the island prison on Wednesday. They were joined by  Australian Consul-General to Bali, Majell Hind . Andrew Chan's fiancee Febyanti Herewila visited the convicted drug smuggler for the first time since his transfer to Nusakambangan in Central Java on Wednesday . Andrew Chan's mother, Helen, was pictured leaving after visiting her son at Nusakambangan prison island, off central Java on Wednesday . 'I think Indonesia will consider the whole range of things that Julie Bishop and Tony Abbott have put forward.' Meanwhile, Australia's most senior Muslim leader has flown to Jakarta to make a personal plea for mercy for the duo. The Grand Mufti of Australia Ibrahim Abu Mohammed told Indonesian leaders forgiveness lay at the heart of Islam, and touched on the 'heritage of mercy' in their shared religion. Virgin founder Richard Branson also wrote a heartfelt letter to Indonesian President Joko Widodo pleading for him to save the lives of those facing the death penalty. The British businessman, who's also a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, said he was willing to go to Indonesia in an effort to save those facing execution.

Bonnie Harris, who owns Lexington Vintage in Athens, reported the crime to authorities on Saturday morning after she discovered the colorful animal sculpture had gone. She also launched an appeal via social media. Because the rooster was worth an estimated $3,000, the culprit could face felony charges with a maximum of ten years in jail. On the run: Police in Georgia are hunting for a thief who made off with a 10ft-tall, 300lb metal rooster (pictured) installed outside a local business . Harris told The Athens Banner-Herald that the rooster's installation two weeks ago involved anchoring it into the ground with rebar stakes. She said her husband thinks some type of tool was used to cut the big bird away because part of one foot was left in the ground. It's believed the burglary occurred sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning. Harris, who opened her store last November, said she was 'angry' and 'saddened' by the theft because the rooster was a one-of-a-kind, specially commissioned piece.

"Suit: Chia Hong is suing Facebook, accusing her former boss Anil wilson (photographed) of discrimination and harassment based on sex and race . Does Facebook lean forward? Not so much, claims one former employee who is suing the social networking giant for gender and race discrimination. Despite employing Sheryl Sandberg, one of the nation's leading advocates for working mothers, Chia Hong claims she was belittled by her boss for taking time off to volunteer at her children's school, forced to served drinks to male co-workers and told she should have just stayed home to take care of her child. Hong filed a lawsuit with the San Mateo County Superior Court Monday against the social networking giant claiming that her former boss, Anil Wilson, harassed and 'belittled' her for being a woman and for being Taiwanese. In the lawsuit, Hong claims that Wilson regularly 'ignored' and 'belittled' her opinions and input during group meetings where she was one of few women present. Wilson once allegedly asked Hong why she didn't 'just stay home and take care of her child instead of having a career' and scolded her for taking one day off each month to volunteer at her child's school -- a practice permitted by the company. A Facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and told Recode that the company has made progress in matters related to gender, diversity, and equality. 'In this case we have substantive disagreements on the facts,' the spokesperson said 'and we believe the record shows the employee was treated fairly.' Hong alleges that she was told she was not part of 'the team' because 'she looks different and talks differently than other team members.' As of 2014, 69 percent of Facebook's employees world-wide are male and 31 percent are female, according to Tech Republic. Fair Treatment: A Facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and said that Hong was treated fairly . A diversity report showed that more than half of the company's employees identify as white. She claims she was ordered to 'organize parties and serve drinks to her male colleagues' -- actions neither part of her job description nor requested of males at the company. The mother says she experienced much harassment  and, after she filed a complaint, the company fired her in October 2013 replacing her with an Indian male who, she claims, is 'less qualified' and 'less experienced,' Fox reports. The suit states that Hong, who began working for the company in 2010, received good performance reviews, pay raises, and even a promotion. But once she filed the harassment complaint, she received a negative performance evaluation and was fired. High-Profile: Hong is being represented by Lawless & Lawless, the San Francisco firm representing Ellen Pao (photographed) in the high-profile gender discrimination case against Silicon Valley's venture capital firm . Hong is suing the company for damages stemming from sex and race harassment and discrimination, retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, discharge in violation of public policy, legal fees, and punitive damages. The suit states that the amount demanded exceeds $25,000. She is seeking a jury trial as well. Hong is being represented by Lawless & Lawless, the San Francisco firm representing Ellen Pao in the high-profile gender discrimination case against Silicon Valley's venture capital firm. Some speculate that the Pao case will serve as precedent for other cases and may encourage women to come forward with similar claims, according to Recode. Wilson did not immediately respond to request for comment from Daily Mail Online.","Chia Hong, a former Facebook employee, is suing the social media company for discriminating against her because she is a woman and Taiwanese .

"An online shopper got the fright of his life when a live mouse leapt out of his grocery bags and ran around his kitchen. Nick Bain was unpacking his Tesco shopping at his home in Clacton, Essex, when he noticed something stirring in one of the bags. The 41-year-old was shocked to then see a mouse dart out from one of the plastic bags and scurry across the floor. After he phoned Tesco to complain, the supermarket sent a team of pest control experts whose trap later caught the creature. Scroll down for video . An online shopper in Essex captured this footage of a mouse escaping from this shopping bag last week . Bosses have refunded and replaced the shopping and sent Mr Bain's wife a large bouquet of flowers to apologise as she is petrified of mice. It was one of the first times Mr Bain and his wife, Hayley, 28, had used Tesco's online delivery service. The car salesman said: 'I was going through the bag and I didn't realise it was there but when I put my hand in I saw something move. 'I told my wife there was a mouse in the bag and she jumped off the floor. It was just so fast. It's the last thing you expect with a delivery.' Mr Bain managed to film the mouse on his mobile phone shortly after it emerged from the rubbish. In the footage he captured, the mouse can be seen darting across the floor of the kitchen, which is currently being re-fitted. The couple were worried about their two Staffordshire bull terriers, Max and Bruno, eating the mouse in case it was diseased. The mouse was later caught in a trap after 'scratching for two nights solid'. The animal ran around the couple's kitchen and disappeared into a hole before being caught by pest control . Mr Bain said the  incident left him wondering what might have happened to other people's shopping which was also on the delivery van. He added: 'It disgusted my wife and it makes you think if it was in the van, whose other bags had it been in and whose other food had it urinated on. 'To be fair to Tesco, they gave us some flowers and some treats for the dogs and sent Rentokil around, they've been pretty good.' The shopping was delivered last Thursday and the mouse was captured in a trap on Saturday. A Tesco spokesman said: 'We've apologised to Mr Bain and the local online food shopping manager has visited him to deliver flowers, a replacement order and a gesture of goodwill. 'A thorough check of the store by pest control found no evidence of further problems, so we're still investigating to find out exactly what happened.' Tesco, which sent in pest control experts, has apologised and replaced the £85 worth of shopping. File photo .","Couple  recently ordered their shopping to be delivered for the first time .

"A British ISIS fighter, who used to live at home with his mother and work as a security guard in Morrisons, appears to be living as a hopeless loner in Syria. According to his social media page, Omar Hussain, has real difficulty completing the most basic daily jobs including peeling potatoes for his dinner and washing his clothes. Avidly recording his mundane life through an array of pictures and essays, Hussein seems to be a lonely, bored fighter, scrounging off ISIS without ever fighting on the frontline. Known as Abu Saeed al-Britani or Awlaki, Omar Hussain told BBC Newsnight last August: 'I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.' Pathetic attempt: Hussain admits it took him an astonishing 50 minutes to peel just 10 minuscule potatoes. One social media user said his mum could peel all of Syria's potatoes in that time. The pampered extremist appears to have a sweet tooth, showing off his first Ferrero Rocher chocolate in years. The bearded jihadi creepily stands behind a group of well armed young girls, indoctrinated by the radical teachings of ISIS. The bumbling radical revealed how he battles with peeling potatoes without a peeler rather than fighting the Assad regime. In one photo, several measly peeled potatoes are shown, with Hussain admitting it took him an astonishing 50 minutes to peel just 10 minuscule potatoes. The failed fighter wrote: 'Life can't go on like this, I need a Sabi (servant) :(' He confessed that he had to cut up the potatoes the next morning after tiring himself out with the peeling process. One social media user mocked Hussein, joking that his mum could peel all of Syria's potatoes in the time it took him. His most recently difficulty has been washing his clothes, with the jihadi revealing how he gets flustered when it begins to rain and he has to bring his washing in from the line. A number of photos show the fighter doting on his pet cat, Lucy, who appears to be one of his only friends in Syria.

His most recently difficulty has been washing his clothes, with the jihadi revealing how he gets flustered when it begins to rain and he has to bring his washing in from the line. Such a task is a serious challenge for Hussein, who appears unused to such an easy task. Hussein has also posted a picture of his local gym, which he appears to have once visited. He also showed off his photos of himself lazily lounging by a swimming pool in Syria. Hussain has also posted a picture of his local gym, which he appears to have once visited.

"Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has defended the company's ridiculed 'Race Together' campaign as 'very genuine'. The campaign is encouraging workers to write 'Race Together' on cups and strike up conversations about race as they serve customers their coffee. The company is also preparing a guide with questions to pose, such as: 'How have your racial views evolved from those of your parents?' After the campaign was announced earlier this week, the coffee chain was slammed on social media and was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line. But during Starbucks' annual shareholders meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, Schultz defended the campaign and said the company is simply trying to use its massive reach for good. Defense: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told Good Morning America, pictured, that he is simply trying to use the company's reach for good with its new 'Race Together' campaign . 'Some in the media will criticize Starbucks for having a political agenda,' he said. 'Our intentions are pure.' Speaking on CBS This Morning on Thursday, he added: 'This is a highly charged, highly emotional issue, we understand that. 'We've tried to be very thoughtful, very genuine, very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores, potentially, we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference.' He said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company's workers can 'elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day', he will be satisfied. After the campaign was announced, Twitter ruthlessly mocked Starbucks. One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.' Standing firm: He also addressed the massive social media backlash during the company's annual shareholder's meeting in Seattle on Wednesday (pictured), saying: 'Our intentions are pure' Support: Schultz was joined on stage at the annual meeting by rapper Common, who also spoke about the importance of engaging with people from different backgrounds in support of the campaign . Controversial: The new campaign encourages workers to write 'Race Together' on customer's cups and to strike up conversations about race. Pictured, customer Matt Ullman shows off one of the new stickers . Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life ""white man's burden"" crisis.' An executive on Starbucks' communications team, Corey duBrowa, even blocked people on Twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign. DuBrowa later said in a post on Medium that he felt he was being 'personally attacked in a cascade of negativity' and that he had gotten overwhelmed, but later reactivated the account. When Good Morning America asked Schultz about some of the scathing criticism on Thursday, Schultz responded: 'Well, you know what I say to that - no good deed goes unpunished.' He has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign, and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they don't like the message. Ridiculed: After the campaign was announced, Twitter users slammed the idea as naive . Questions: Another Twitter user pointed out the lack of diversity in the campaign material . Inserting itself into national issues is not new territory for Starbucks Corp. In late 2012, the chain asked workers to write 'Come together' on cups to send a message to lawmakers about stalled budget negotiations. And in 2013, the chain placed newspaper ads saying that firearms were not welcome in its cafes after they became the site of gun rallies. But the company stopped short of an outright ban. Schultz said at the time that Starbucks was neither for nor against guns, underscoring that even a company that wants a voice in national conversations has to be careful about alienating customers.

"If recent pictures are anything to go by, Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are set to become pop's biggest power couple. After a month of rumours about a possible romance, the twosome were spotted hanging out in Whole Foods in Nashville, Tennessee earlier this week. But if 31-year-old DJ Calvin is to become the new Mr Taylor Swift then he should be aware that he might end up becoming the subject of one of her songs. Scroll down for video .

Taylor herself even admits that her relationships do inspire her musically. However, she's always careful not to go into specifics. She once said: 'For me, I have a really strict personal policy that I never name names. So anybody saying that a song is about a specific person is purely speculating. And they’re going to do that.' Here we look back over her previous relationships... and the songs they were thought to have inspired.

'Those feelings were obviously not well-received. I did not end the conversation. Someone else did. 'Phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk. A phone call can be pretty short when someone else ends the call. 'The only difference in this conversation was that I shared something the other person did not want to hear.

She said in an interview: 'I don't know how to have a normal relationship because I try to act normal, love from a normal place and live a normal life.

"The 15-year-old Washington boy charged who was charged with trying to kidnap a toddler was linked to a similar incident nine months ago. The unnamed teenager, who will be tried in juvenile court for the attempted abduction of 22-month old Owen Wright a week ago, was also accused of trying to lure a child last June. He does not have a criminal history, and has pleaded not guilty to second degree kidnapping after being caught on video attempting to run off with a child in broad daylight while wearing a fake mustache and glasses. Scroll down for video . Similar incident: The suspect who was caught on video (pictured) allegedly snatched a 22-month-old from a park was accused of trying to lure a 11-year-old last year . Lincoln County Prosecutor Jeff Barkdull said that prosecutors were forwarded a report accusing the boy of luring an 11-year-old last year. Attorneys decided not to file charges in that case because 'It did not meet the elements of luring,' according to Mr Barkdull. The child's mother questioned him and the suspect let go, the report said. Mr Barkdull said he stood by the decision not to pursue the previous incident  in Sprague, a farm town of around 500 people located about 40 miles west of Spokane along Interstate 90. Prior to the boy's arrest, the man captured on video was identified as a 30-year-old man. However, two brave teens who helped thwart the kidnapping by running after the abductor later recognized the suspect as their disguised school classmate. Misidentified: Witnesses originally said the kidnapper was around 30-years-old, 6-foot-2 and had a mustache . 'I do know the person': Andrew Crain, 15, along with his 16-year-old friend Isaac Yow gave chase after an unidentified minor allegedly snatched a 22-month-old toddler from a city park . Andrew Crain, 15, along with his 16-year-old friend Isaac Yow, gave chase after they saw an unidentified minor allegedly take a toddler from a city park. They helped get the child home safely. 'I'm feeling happy, I'm feeling angry at the same time. I do know the person,' Crain told KXLY. Residents of the tiny town of Sprague expressed relief Thursday that an arrest has been made in the attempted kidnapping — an incident that drew wide attention because of the video. 'They're so relieved,' said Dorothy Giddings, an antique store owner in Sprague who was involved in the rescue of the toddler on Sunday. 'The only sad part is it is a young boy who lives here in town.' Dramatic surveillance video footage showed the suspect running down a sidewalk with the toddler in his arms last Sunday. The child's two siblings screamed and chased him before Crain and Yow joined the chase. The abductor fled after putting down the toddler. who was not hurt. Loner? Crain's friend Isaac Yow, 16, helped stop the kidnapping. Residents of the small Washington town say the suspect lived in Sprague but didn't associate much with other teens . 'They have a motherly instinct,' Michael Wright told The Spokesman-Review about his two older children. 'We're going to watch each other closer and even more diligently than we did before.' Giddings said the 15-year-old suspect lived with his family, but did not socialize much with other teenagers. He apparently wore a disguise during the attempted abduction to mask his identity. The identity of the youth was being withheld because he is a juvenile. The dramatic surveillance video footage showed a male running down a sidewalk with the toddler in his arms last Sunday. The incident began after Michael Wright left his three children with a baby sitter in Sprague on Sunday while he went to work. The children — Brenden, 10, Delicia, 8, and the toddler Owen — were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house. Sheriff's deputies said the suspect talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. Owen's two siblings screamed and chased their brother. Delicia's cries alerted Ms Giddings, who was working at her antique store downtown. Ms Giddings said she realized what was happening and sent her grandson Crain, 15, and his friend Yow, 16, to chase the kidnapper. The scene ended after two teenage boys rushed towards the disguised man, who put down the toddler and fled. The toddler was not hurt. One of Owen's young siblings also positively identified the suspect. Siblings: Owen's older sister Delicia, left, and brother Brenden, right, were also captured on security video footage as they gave chase after the man who had taken their younger brother Owen . Reunited: Nicole and Michael Wright hold their 22-month-old son Owen who was abducted from Sprague City Park on Sunday. Owen's sister Delicia, 8, and brother Brenden, 10, alerted a pair of teenage boys . Heroes: Delicia said that the kidnapper told them he was nice to kids and had been babysitting for a long time. She didn't believe him and her screams helped raise the alarm . No vehicle was seen with the kidnapper, who was initially described by the sheriff's office as about 30 years old, 6-foot to 6-foot-2, with a thin build, brown hair and a mustache. Authorities announced the arrest on Wednesday afternoon, culminating a tense four days in the small Washington town. Police had gone to Sprague High School and watched the suspect, who had a similar gait to the then-unidentified man caught on video. The 15-year-old suspect originally denied any connection with the attempted abduction, but a jacket matching the one in the surveillance footage was later found in his room. He was denied bail on Friday. Lincoln County Judge John Strohmaier said that he was worried about the boy's safety in the small community, according to the Spokesman Review.

"For groom Neil McElwee and his bride Yanan Sun, their white wedding was to be their best day ever. Chinese-born Yanan Sun – six months pregnant with their first baby – had splashed out £1,000 on a stunning dress. And the happy couple had invited over 70 guests to celebrate at a £6,000 hotel reception. But their perfect day turned into a nightmare when moments before they were due to say 'I do', they were both arrested – after suspicions they were having a sham marriage. Neil McElwee and his Chinese fiancée Yanan Sun saw their painstakingly planned wedding day  transformed into a nightmare when they were arrested in front of 50 guests and accused of embarking on a sham marriage . The besotted couple, who had spent months honing the details of their special day, were forced into separate prison vans and held for five hours . This week the couple from Derry, Northern Ireland, were awarded £21,000 compensation over the blunder – which also led to four police officers being disciplined. But although they have since wed, Yanan Sun, 22, said last night: 'A wedding day is supposed to be the best day of any woman's life. But this turned out to be the worst day of mine. 'All the money in the world can never make up for spoiling my wedding day.' And her husband Neil, 28, a chef, said: 'While we feel justice has been done we can't ever erase the memories of that terrible day. There was no excuse for the way we were both treated. I don't think we will ever get over it.' The McElwees, who now have two daughters, Isabel, three, and Sybil, one, first met through friends in 2010 when Yanan Sun came to the UK from Shenyang, China to study English. Says Yanan Sun: 'A friend set us up on a blind date. There was an immediate attraction between us and when Neil asked if I wanted to go to the beach for a day out I said yes. 'Within weeks we were a couple and talking about spending the rest of our lives together. We set a date to marry in the summer 2012.' But in February 2011 Yanan Sun discovered she was pregnant and the couple decided to bring their wedding forward. She says: 'When about four weeks after I found out, Neil woke up one morning and said he thought we should get married earlier, I was thrilled. We are both quite traditional and wanted our baby to be born within wedlock.' They were released without charge, and eventually the couple were able to join the rest of their party - whom they had instructed to carry on without them - and bravely smile for photos . A registry office ceremony was booked at the Guildhall in Derry for July 19th 2011. Meanwhile, invitations were sent to over 70 friends and relatives to attend a buffet. Yanan Sun said: 'I spent around £1,000 on a beautiful long white wedding dress and had my hair and make up professionally done for my special day. We arranged for a wedding cake to be made, caterers to prepare a buffet – which included Champagne and strawberries - hired a BMW and taxis to drive the ourselves and the wedding party to the reception, paid for flowers with a florist, hired a photographer and a DJ. 'Neil and I spent hours choosing place mats and table decorations, agonising over tiny details such as which tables guest would sit on. We even had our wedding rings personally engraved with matching love hearts. Like any young couple, we didn't have a lot of money to spend but we'd saved up enough. And we were determined it would be a perfect day.' As she was about to walk up the aisle, Yanan Sun gave a little wave to Neil who'd been waiting. She recalls: 'I was so excited when I got there. I couldn't wait to marry Neil and get on with enjoying the day we'd spent months planning.' However, as they stepped into the hall, they were asked by the Registrar to go into a small side room. Neil says: 'I was expecting a chat about the ceremony or something simple such as not throwing confetti everywhere. So I was shocked to find four plain clothes Police officers waiting behind the door. 'And when one of them said we were both being arrested on suspicion of carrying out a sham wedding I was stunned. 'I protested our papers were in order – our solicitor was even a guest at the wedding – but no-one was interested in listening.' Yanan Sun recalls: 'When the officer said I had to accompany them to the station and change out of my dress I burst into tears. Even my big pregnancy bump didn't seem to convince them we weren't genuinely in love. I couldn't believe anyone could be so cruel.' The couple were taken to the local Police station where they were kept in separate cells. Recalls Yanan Sun: 'I was forced to wear forensic police clothing.' As they sat in their separate cells, and the hours ticked by, both realised their wedding day was not going to happen. Neil says: 'The feeling of helplessness – knowing my pregnant bride to be was sat on her own in a cell – was awful. It was sheer torment.' They later discovered Police found out after only 40 minutes they'd realised the arrests were a terrible mistake – but it was to be four hours before their solicitor managed to get them released. It was too late for their wedding ceremony but the McElwees bravely decided to go to their hotel reception and posed for photos. Neil says: 'I'd told my best man to carry on without us – after all, it was all paid for, the buffet was all prepared. We didn't want to let guests down, some of whom had travelled miles. Recalls Yanan Sun: 'Neil asked me if I wanted to the reception and at first I said no. I was so upset I couldn't face it. I just wanted to go home. But then I didn't want it to go to waste. 'I even changed back into my wedding dress for photos. But I couldn't bear to wear my wedding ring. And although I was smiling, inside I was devastated. In hindsight I don't know how I managed to get through it.' The couple eventually married the next day, in an understated ceremony in casual clothes . When the following morning the Registrar rang them to apologise and asked if there was anything she could do, they asked if they could still marry. Yanan Sun says: 'The Registrar said we could go in later that day. By then guests had gone back to work so we just wore our casual clothes, exchanged a few vows and signed our names on the documents. We were married but it was terrible - it was not the magical day I'd always dreamt it would be.' The McElwees tried to put the incident behind them. In November their daughter Isabel was born. And they have since had second baby, Sybil in February last year. However Yanan Sun could not get over what had happened. 'When I saw our wedding photos I just felt upset. Although we were smiling on them, they were just fake smiles. They became a reminder of the trauma we'd gone through.' Worse she began to panic whenever someone came to the door. 'I knew it was ridiculous but I kept thinking I was going to be arrested. I felt I couldn't trust anyone. In the end I needed counselling.' Three of the four officers who arrested the couple were disciplined and magistrates awarded Yanan Sun £12,500 and her husband £9,000 after the McElwees sued the Police Service of Northern Ireland for unlawful arrest. They now have two daughters . Neil was so angry he made a complaint to the Police. He says: 'I couldn't understand why when the Police knew they'd made an error after just 40 minutes, they didn't immediately release us. Had they done so, we might still have been able to go ahead with our wedding as arranged.' In June 2012 the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland upheld the McElwees' complaint. A police officer later claimed he had carried out the arrest after receiving a letter from the UK Border agency that morning. But he had failed to check the McElwee's documents before making unlawful arrests and detaining them unlawfully. Three Police officers were disciplined over the arrests and the pair went on to take civil action against the Chief Constable of the PSNI for their unlawful arrest. This week Derry magistrates court ordered that Yanan Sun should be awarded £12,500 and Neil should get £9,000. But while the couple say they are 'satisfied justice has been done,' they have struggled to move on. Neil admits: 'Most couples will reminisce about their wedding day but we never talk about it.' And Yanan Sun says: 'No amount of money will truly compensate for my ruined big day. Sadly, we can never turn the clock back and undo those memories.'","Neil McElwee and Chinese fiancée Yanan Sun arrested on wedding day .

Camp site: The killing took place at the Rainbow Family of Living Light's annual gathering. The event was shut down in the wake of the death . Sheriff's deputies in Franklin County, Florida, named Clark Mayers, 39, as the alleged shooter. He was being watched over in hospital to be questioned when he recovered. The attack took place in Florida's Apalachicola National Forest at around 2:30am on March 5, according to the Apalachicola Times. Hundreds of members had assembled in the woods for the group's annual Rainbow Family Gathering. It was supposed to last several weeks, but was shut down after the killing. According witnesses, Mayers was seen driving down a dirt path in the forest, firing out the window. It is not clear whether these shots were the ones which hit the victims.

"Lee Craig Richardson, 41, (pictured) left his neighbour with a punctured lung after stabbing him just below the heart in a row over wheelie bins . A drunk man who stabbed his neighbour in the chest in a row over wheelie bins has been jailed for five years. Lee Craig Richardson flew into a rage after being confronted when he kicked his neighbour's bins in anger outside his home in Whinney Banks, Middlesbrough. The 41-year-old stabbed the victim, who has not been named, just below the heart causing him to suffer a punctured lung. Richardson told police there had been a long-running feud between him and his neighbours over 'quite petty' issues and said he had initially kicked the bins because he was annoyed. The victim was left needing a blood transfusion and could have died in the attack, Teesside Crown Court was told. He was forced to spend six days in hospital to recover. Richardson admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, assault by beating and possession of a bladed article on Friday and was jailed for five years. Prosecutor Emma Atkinson told the court that there had been previous disputes between Richardson and his neighbours leading up to the attack on November 11 last year. She said: 'There's been a great deal of animosity between the two parties, more recently in relation to wheelie bins.' She told the court how Richardson was drunk when he came out of his home in the early hours and kicked his neighbours' bins. He was confronted by the woman who lived next door to him and responded by kicking her in the shin, the court heard. Her partner then followed her outside to calm the commotion and was knifed in the lower chest by Richardson. The neighbour did not realise what had happened to him at first and did not see a knife. He punched Richardson to the floor before he went inside, the court heard. Ms Atkinson told the court: 'As he got into his kitchen he became acutely aware of the fact that he had in fact been stabbed.' Police were called and officers found Richardson in his living room with a cut to his temple. He was persuaded to let go of an eight-inch knife which he was holding, and another five-inch blade was found in his pocket. He told officers there had been 'quite petty' issues between the neighbours but said he could not remember exactly what happened. Robert Mochrie, defending, said: 'There is no escaping the fact that this could have ended up being a murder charge. It's perhaps the good fortune of both the complainant and the defendant that the heart wasn't touched by the blade.' Mr Mochrie said there was a high degree of 'slow-burn provocation' where Richardson was 'pushed and pushed and pushed'. Richardson admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, assault by beating and possession of a bladed article when he appeared at Teesside Crown Court (pictured above) and was jailed for five years . He claimed Richardson's life was made 'a living misery for many, many months' with anti-social behaviour, verbal threats and one allegation of physical assault. He told the court it built up upset and frustration in a man of good standing who had worked to make something of himself. He said Richardson petulantly kicked the bins and that matters had simply spiralled out of control. Mr Mochrie also told the court how Richardson took the kitchen knife 'in case there was any confrontation', not to seek out the victim and stab him, and acted on the spur of the moment without thinking. 'It's a real tragedy that he has landed himself if this position but he knows there's no escaping that,' Mr Mochrie said. The judge, Recorder Jamie Hill QC, heard how it was the first offences committed by Richardson in 13 years before jailing him. He said: 'This is a classic and appalling example of what can happen when neighbour disputes get out of hand. It's a mercy that [the victim] wasn't killed and that you're not facing a murder charge quite frankly.' He said there was no provocation for the assault itself as Richardson started the chain of events that night with his 'childish action'. 'I accept that you are genuinely remorseful for everything that's happened,' the judge added.","Lee Craig Richardson, 41, stabbed neighbour just below the heart in row .

"For all those fascinated by the colourful world beneath the sea, but who can't afford to visit the far reaches of the globe, London's Natural History Museum is here to help. Beginning March 27, and running through September 13, underwater enthusiasts will be able to get up close and personal with some spectacular seascapes - without ever having to don a wetsuit. The exhibit, Coral Reefs: Secret Cities of the Sea, will feature a live coral reef, a 360-degree immersive virtual dive experience and specimens of over 200 types of coral, fish and fossils, some of which have never been seen before. Scroll down for video . Beginning March 27, London's Natural History Museum will open a new exhibit called Coral Reefs: Secret Cities of the Sea . Coral reefs are primarily found in the shallow waters of the tropics and are home to almost a quarter of all living species in the sea. But they offer many more benefits than simply being beautiful. The reefs also home to ample fishing, tourism and even storm protection opportunities, and are estimated to be worth more than £200 billion each year. Dr Ken Johnson, coral reef researcher at the Natural History Museum, said: 'Coral reefs are not simply beautiful environments. They provide food, income and storm protection for many millions of people around the world.' The exhibition will feature a live coral reef and hundreds of specimens of animals and fossils . Best of all? Guests will be able to experience a 360-degree immersive virtual dive in the museum's gallery . 'The Museum has an exceptional collection of corals from ancient and modern reefs that we have been studying, to understand how these animals, and the diverse habitats they create, have responded to changes in the ocean,' he continued. 'Climate change, pollution and overfishing have had a major effect. 'A quarter of coral reefs around the world are sadly damaged beyond repair and many more are still under serious threat.' In partnership with Catlin Seaview Survey, stunning  footage has been captured from around the world . Filmed with specially-designed cameras, the images have been stitched together for a panoramic experience . The 'Google Street View' footage from the sea was filmed everywhere from Australia to Indonesia . Thankfully, new technology, like that used by Catlin Seaview Survey, a  project that monitors coral reef health, provides scientists and sea lovers alike with more insight than ever. Think 'Google Street View' but for the sea, the virtual dive footage will take over the Museum's gallery space for its must-see debut, exploring different reefs around the world. From Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef to the breathtaking Tubbataha Reef in the Philippines and Komodo Island National Park in Indonesia, the videos were captured by Catlin divers on specially-designed cameras that record images every three to six seconds. Stitched together, the images create a stunning panoramic view. Sound and light effects will also be used to further replicate the feeling of being underwater for visitors. Sound and light effects will also be used to really help guests feel fully immersed in the undersea views . The museum hopes that the breathtaking exhibit will leave guests feeling 'surprised, amazed and emotional' Felicity Paynter, the curator of the exhibition, told the Sunday Telegraph that she hoped guests would leave feeling 'surprised, amazed and emotional.' 'I had to think about what visitors might already know, what they don't know and what questions we might be able to answer for them. 'On the one hand, there are lots of very cool, weird and wonderful creatures that live on coral reefs, but there are also some really difficult and abstract concepts.'","Coral reef exhibition will open at the Natural History Museum on March 27 .

"Captain Edwin Tritschler (pictured) has been convicted of forging the signature of Lieutenant Commander Christopher Bovill . A captain in the Royal Navy 'deceitfully' forged the signature of an officer who accused him of harassment and bullying in order to 'protect himself' from future complaints. Captain Edwin Tritschler, 48, of Yeovilton, Somerset, forged the signature of Lieutenant Commander Christopher Bovill on documents to bring an end to the 'never-ending' list of complaints against him. He has now been convicted of two counts of forgery and cleared of a further count by a board of five male captains at at Portsmouth Military Court Centre. Tritschler was given a severe reprimand, a full forfeiture of seniority and was fined £5,000 for his 'deliberate' and 'deceitful' actions. The court heard he used a scanner and a computer to help forge LC Bovill's signature on three separate documents. The forged appraisal forms were created by Tritschler to show the complaint department he had given clear management advice to Bovill. The court heard how the pair had a 'difficult' relationship when they were both working on HMS Illustrious from July 4, 2007, when it was based in New York. Captain Tritschler thought Bovill's performance was 'substandard' while on board the Invincible-class aircraft carrier, Portsmouth Military Court Centre in Hampshire heard. Meanwhile, Lt Commander Bovill believed Captain Tritschler to be 'abrupt', 'blunt' and accused him of being a 'bully'. Their feud resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill - who left his Major rank in the Army in 2006 to transfer to the Navy - pursuing the complaint service in the Royal Navy. Lt Cdr Bovill joined the Navy as senior air engineering officer and was working under Captain Tritschler - who was then a Commander. Captain Tritschler denied three counts of forgery, but has now been convicted on two counts and cleared of the last charge. The court heard  the pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were working on HMS Illustrious (pictured) David Richards, prosecuting, said: 'It was clear the two men had a very difficult relationship. 'Captain Tritschler thought Bovill's performance was substandard. Bovill found Tritschler to be officious, abrupt and bullying. 'The disagreement between the two men resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill pursuing the complaint service.' The court then heard Captain Tritschler - who was head of engineering on board HMS Illustrious - forged Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. Mr Richards added: 'What the documents appear to show is regular manager advice from Captain Tritschler to Bovill. 'And the documents bear signatures of both men. 'However, the signatures of Bovill were not put there by Bovill. Rather they are copied and forged, possibly using a scanner. Tritschler was convicted of two counts of forgery and cleared of a further count by a board of five male captains at at Portsmouth Military Court Centre (HM Naval Centre pictured) 'It was deliberate and deceitful and was quite out of character for a man who has the rank Captain Tritschler does.' The court heard that when Bovill joined the navy he 'struggled' to cope and noticed Captain Tritschler had an 'abrupt management style'. Lt Cdr Bovill, who is based at RNAS Culdrose, Cornwall, told the board of five male captains he thought Tritschler was 'blunt'. When he realised the signatures on the documents were forged, he reported it and Captain Tritschler was subsequently interviewed. Mr Richards said: 'Tritschler denied forging the documents and said that Bovill signed them in his presence and that when he signed there were no other witnesses. 'He kept a copy (of the documents) and said it was a 'gypsy warning' to protect himself from other complaints. 'Captain Tritschler generated these false documents in an attempt to bring an end what seemed like a never-ending complaint process.'","Captain Edwin Tritschler, 48, was accused of three counts of forgery .

"Former U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr has been released from an Alabama prison, a year and a half after  his guilty plea to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on  furs, home decor, rock memorabilia and vacations. His father, Reverend Jesse Jackson, confirmed to WGN that he was with his son and they were on their way to a halfway house in Washington D.C. The 50-year-old Jackson will serve the remainder of his sentence at the halfway house. He began serving a two and a half-year sentence in 2013. Jackson's wife must serve a related, yearlong term after her husband completes his sentence. Scroll down for video . A police vehicle, right, escorts a van and SUV, carrying family members of Jesse Jackson Jr., into Maxwell Air Force Base on Thursday in Montgomery, Alabama. The Rev. Jesse Jackson said his son, former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr, has been released and will serve the remainder of his sentence at a D.C. halfway house . Former Illinois Rep Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife, Sandra, were both convicted of spending more than $750,000 campaign funds on personal items. He was released from prison on Thursday . Jackson served his time at the Butner Federal Correctional Complex outside of Raleigh, North Carolina – the same prison where investment fraudster Bernie Madoff is incarcerated . Jackson Jr.'s father, Rev. Jesse Jackson (left) and his wife Jacqueline Lavinia Brown (right) attended court sessions in 2013 (pictured). Rev Jackson confirmed to WGN that he is with his son and they are on their way to a halfway house in Washington D.C. Jackson's plea deal was arranged just two days after he was re-elected to represent his Illinois congressional district. At the time Republicans cried foul, noting that they would have had a chance to win his seat if news had emerged before Election Day. Jackson began the sentence on November 1, 2013. The Bureau of Prisons lists his final release date as September 20, 2015. The disgraced lawmaker's crime was officially described as wire and mail fraud, catch-all federal criminal categories frequently used as placeholders for financial corruption. His wife, Sandra, was also sentenced to a year in prison in connection with the corruption scheme. She pleaded guilty to a single charge of filing a false tax return in an attempt to hide the fraud. Court documents showed that Sandra, a Chicago city councilwoman when she was charged, had spent her husband's campaign funds on vacations, electronics and furs. She was ordered to pay $22,000 in restitution, in addition to the $750,000 her husband had to pay back. The U.S. Marshals Service seized all the items purchased illegally and auctioned everything to repay what they stole. Also sold was their richly decorated Washington, D.C. townhouse. The haul included one of the late singer Michael Jackson's fedoras and a guitar reportedly signed by both Michael Jackson and rock star Eddie Van Halen. In an unusual arrangement, a federal judge allowed Mrs. Jackson to avoid reporting to prison until her husband's release so that their children would not lose both parents at once. She will likely begin serving her sentence in September. Jesse Jackson Jr. sold his Washington, D.C. town house (pictured) to help pay a $750,000 forfeiture he owed after his guilty plea . The US Marshals Service auctioned off some of the Jacksons' ill-gotten goods – including these two furs . Kennedy said he was in the area giving a speech on children's mental health and decided to visit Jackson on Monday. 'You can imagine my surprise when I'm there, and I'm talking to him, and he says, 'I'm leaving Thursday morning',' Kennedy said. He said Jackson, 50, told him he would be picked up from prison by his wife, Sandra; his two children; his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and his mother, Jacqueline Jackson. His family will then take him to the halfway house. 'He said he'd have to report with his probation officer and he'd have to get some kind of job and start to put his life back together,' Kennedy said. Kennedy said he had not seen Jackson since August 2012, when he visited him at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota after Jackson took a leave from Congress and checked himself in for bipolar disorder. Kennedy has been an outspoken advocate on mental health issues. The two men served as Democrats in Congress together, and both have famous fathers. Kennedy's father was the late Sen. Edward Kennedy.

Rock history: Among the items auctioned by the US Marshals Service was this framed and autographed cymbal from Michael Jackson's last concert tour . Bureau of Prisons spokesman Edmond Ross said he could not confirm that Jackson would be released to a halfway house, saying the bureau does not consider such plans public information. The Rev. Jesse Jackson directed inquiries to the Bureau of Prisons. He confirmed that Kennedy had met with his son. Messages left for attorneys for Jackson Jr. were not immediately returned. Kennedy said Jackson's mental health is much better than the last time he saw him at the Mayo Clinic. Kennedy said Jackson had even put a positive spin on his time in prison, saying it had allowed him to 'unplug' from the world. 'He's a lot more at ease with his role and responsibility with what got him into jail,' Kennedy said. He added that Jackson 'feels he's done his time.' Kennedy said they also talked about what's next. 'He's also very excited about what lies ahead for him in the future, which I think is very hopeful,' he said.","Former congressman pleaded guilty in 2013 to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on himself and his wife – buying more than 3,000 items .

"Two years ago, Wu Mu Xiang was inconsolable following the death of her 26-year-old son. But after the heartbreak of losing her only child, the 57-year-old became a mother again after giving to twin babies, the People's Daily reported. In a rare move for China - which enforces a one-child policy - a hospital agreed to give Mrs Wu and her 60-year-old husband IVF treatment.

"In a cryptic tweet, Elon Musk has announced the launch of a 'major' new line of products. Tesla's billionaire founder today fuelled speculation by saying it 'not a car' and added the product will be revealed at the company's California, Design Studio on April 30 at 8 p.m. PT.

In a cryptic tweet, Elon Musk has announced the launch of a 'major' new line of products. The launch date coincides with the arrival of the stationary battery pack designed to power an entire home . The launch date coincides with the arrival of the stationary battery pack designed to power an entire home, according to The Verge. Last month, Musk said the unit would be ready for a public debut within months and that it should start going into production by the summer. It is likely to build on the power packs used in Tesla’s range of electric cars such as the Model S. ‘We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people’s houses or businesses fairly soon,’ Mr Musk told analysts. Tesla's billionaire founder today fuelled speculation by saying it 'not a car' and added the product will be revealed at the company's California, Design Studio on April 30 at 8 p.m. PT . ‘We have the design done, and it should start going into production in about six months or so.’ The Mirai features the Toyota Fuel Cell System, which combines fuel cell technology with hybrid technology. The firm said it can serve as a 'high capacity power supply during emergencies'. The Mirai converts the DC power from the CHAdeMO power socket in the boot to AC power, using an attachment. Toyota calls it a vehicle-to-home system. Tesla's home battery could work in a similar way, or be a standalone battery. He didn’t reveal what a home battery would be used for, but it could act as a generator during a power cut, for example. Rival car manufacturer Toyota already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its Mirai car that can be removed and used to power a home. According to the Japanese car maker, the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a $5billion ‘Gigafactory’ designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this.

"Scientists believe they may have uncovered evidence of a two-million-year-old playground in China. Researchers found more than 700 stone artefacts in an area of less than six square metres in the Nihewan Basin, Hebei province. Experts working at the Heitugou site have suggested the items were toys made by early hominids between 1.77million and 1.95million years ago. Discovery: Scientists believe they may have uncovered evidence of a two-million-year-old playground in China (file picture) The leader of the project, paleoanthropologist Wei Qi, has described the discovery as ‘amazing’. The South China Morning Post quotes the Chinese Academy of Sciences expert as saying: ‘The site is a treasure chamber that may hold some useful clues to answer a lot of important questions, from the social structure of the early hominids to whether, when and how they arrived in Asia all the way from Africa.’ Close to 20,000 fragmented pieces but larger items – the majority between 20 and 50mm long - are believed to have been made by women and children. Wei said one ‘finely made and beautifully shaped’ item was possibly a gift made by a mother for her child adding that ‘you can almost feel the maker’s love and passion’. Researchers said the lack of evidence of animal remains and large stone tools added weight to the argument that the area was used by children rather than adults. Scientists dated the site, discovered in 2002, using a special geochronological tool. Researchers found more than 700 stone artefacts in an area of less than six square metres in the Nihewan Basin (pictured), Hebei province . The items have been excavated and documented with the findings due to be published in an archaeological journal in China. Nihewan Basin used to be a huge lake and it is thought the items were buried in a sudden landslide. However, a debate has surfaced over the findings and researcher Gao Xing of the CAS Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology said it was important to determine whether the artefacts were all hand made. The South China Morning Post report him as saying: ‘It is difficult to rule out the possibility that they were just stone fragments created by natural forces. ‘To determine whether they were hand-made artefacts may go beyond the limit of science today.’","More than 700 items found at the Nihewan Basin in China's Hebei province .

"Humans started dominating the planet causing irreversible damage around the year 1610, scientists claim. Experts have been divided on when mankind caused a lasting impact on the Earth's geology with some suggesting 1964 when the fallout from atomic testing became apparent. But British researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the New and Old Worlds. British researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the New and Old Worlds . The Anthropocene is the name of a proposed geological epoch that may soon enter the official Geologic Time Scale. It refers to a time in which human permanently changed the planet. According to the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS),  we are officially in the Holocene epoch, which began 11,700 years ago after the last major ice age. Some experts argue we should now change the name to 'Anthropocene'. This is from from anthropo, for 'man,' and cene, for 'new'. But up until now, experts have been divided on when mankind caused a lasting impact on the Earth's geology with some suggesting 1964 when the fallout from atomic testing became apparent. Researchers at UCL said that 1610 - when William Shakespeare's Cymbeline was first performed - marked the start of the human-dominated geological epoch known as the Anthropocene. Previous epochs began and ended due meteorite strikes, sustained volcanic eruptions and the shifting of the continents. The study, published in Nature, said human actions are now changing the planet producing a new geological epoch. But to define an epoch scientists must pinpoint and date a global environmental change that has been captured in natural material, such as rocks, ancient ice or sediment from the ocean floor. Such a marker - like the chemical signature left by the meteorite strike that wiped out the dinosaurs - is called a golden spike. Comparing the major environmental impacts of human activity over the past 50,000 years against these two formal requirements just two dates were in the running - 1610 when the impact of the discovery of The Americas began to be felt and 1964. Scientists said the 1492 arrival of Europeans in the Americas, and subsequent global trade, moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level, resulting in a global re-ordering of life on Earth. They also found a golden spike that can be dated to the same time - a pronounced dip in atmospheric carbon dioxide centred on 1610 and captured in Antarctic ice-core records. Geologists have named the 1610 dip in carbon dioxide the 'Orbis Spike'. They chose the Latin word for 'world' because this golden spike was caused by once-disconnected peoples becoming globally linked. According to the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), we are officially in the Holocene epoch, which began 11,700 years ago after the last major ice age . Humans started dominating the planet causing irreversible changes during the reign of King James I (right) and the era of Shakespeare (left), scientists claim . Dr Simon Lewis said: 'In a hundred thousand years scientists will look at the environmental record and know something remarkable happened in the second half of the second millennium. 'They will be in no doubt that these global changes to Earth were caused by their own species. 'Today we can say when those changes began and why. 'The Anthropocene probably began when species jumped continents, starting when the Old World met the New. 'We humans are now a geological power in our own right - as Earth-changing as a meteorite strike. 'Historically, the collision of the Old and New Worlds marks the beginning of the modern world. 'Many historians regard agricultural imports into Europe from the vast new lands of the Americas, alongside the availability of coal, as the two essential precursors of the Industrial Revolution, which in turn unleashed further waves of global environmental changes. 'Geologically, this boundary also marks Earth's last globally synchronous cool moment before the onset of the long-term global warmth of the Anthropocene.' He added while 1964 saw a peak in radioactive fallout following nuclear weapons testing, it was not - in geological terms - an Earth-changing event. An official decision on whether to formally recognise the Anthropocene, including when it began, will be triggered by a recommendation of the Anthropocene Working Group of the Subcommission of Quaternary Stratigraphy, due in 2016. Scientists said the 1492 arrival of Europeans in the Americas (pictured), and global trade, moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level, resulting in a global re-ordering of life on Earth .","Date was decided on because of the impact felt by the transfer of crops .

"A young female kangaroo was left to die a lingering and painful death after being trapped in a snare . The sight of a young female kangaroo that was left to die a lingering and painful death after being trapped in a snare is one of the latest victims to come under attack. The stricken eastern grey was spotted by a nearby resident after struggling to forage through bushland at Mountain Creek Road in Captains Flat, south of Queanbeyan, NSW. Wildcare rescuer Diane Hinton told Daily Mail Australia she was called to a property after reports of a severely-injured kangaroo but when she arrived, the terrified marsupial hopped away to finding a hiding place. ‘She was still hopping around so I couldn’t get close to her but I could see she had a broken arm,’ Ms Hinton told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I thought I’d wait a few more days but when I finally got to her on Thursday, she had a snare wrapped around her body and she looked really sick and poorly infected.’ The rescuer was forced to put the youngster down because she had endured too much pain from the metal wire, which had cut through her body cavity and ribs after being tangled as she tried to release herself from the trap. ‘I’ve been rescuing animals for a long time and have seen many horrendous things but it was nothing horrendous like this – it's the worst I’ve ever seen,’ Ms Hinton said. ‘She was ripped apart and you could see into her chest. There were maggots crawling out of her – she had been fly-blown. ‘It made me feel physically ill, disbelieving and horrified that people could do that and think it’s ok. The rescuer was forced to put the roo down because she had endured too much pain from the metal wire . The snare was wrapped around her neck and back as she struggled to release herself from the metal wire . Ms Hinton said she doesn't know where the snare was set up but believes it could be just kilometres away . Ms Hinton said it was difficult to know where the snare had come from but believed there was a small possibility it was an ‘accidental capture’. ‘It’s obvious someone had set it up to specifically trap wildlife animals,’ Ms Hinton said. ‘It’s inhumane for someone to do that and it makes me feel fearful because if someone could do that to an animal – what makes it any different to take out a farmer’s life? ‘We’ve also heard stories about people chasing them [kangaroos] around in their cars until they get exhausted and collapse, then people would run or reverse over them until they die. ‘There's been times where I’ve stopped to rescue animals on the side of the road and then I see cars and motorbikes go out of their way to run them down – it’s horrible and it needs to stop.’ A young male kangaroo was found with a hunting arrow pierced through the jaw and into the shoulder . The Wildcare rescuers managed to save the youngster and remove the arrow from his shoulder this week . He is currently being taken care of and on the road to recovery before being released back into the wild . The brutal attack comes just days after a young male kangaroo was found with a hunting arrow pierced through the jaw and into the shoulder at Greenleigh in Queanbeyan on Tuesday. The still-mobile eastern grey had collapsed on a driveway but was safely tranquilised by rescuers before being transported to West Queanbeyan veterinary hospital where the arrow was removed. The sharp object had only torn through his skin of the shoulder and had missed his bone and muscle. Wildcare macropod coordinator Helen Stevens told Daily Mail Australia the youngster is on the road to recovery and will be under supervision before releasing him back into the wild. ‘He’s recovering well but we’re angry that people could inflict such pain and suffering on animals,’ Ms Stevens told Daily Mail Australia. ‘It’s been a distressing week for us and you just feel sorry for the animals yourself when you see how stressed they are after being attacked. ‘I’m amazed to see unique wildlife living here but what amazes me more are people’s attitudes towards them – shooting or hurting animals is not correct.’ Anyone found guilty of attacking  animals could face a hefty fine of up to $22,000 or six months in prison . Ms Stevens has called on for more education in schools and the community in a bid to raise awareness and put a stop to animal cruelty. ‘We are trying to educate people so everyone can live alongside wildlife animals,’ Ms Stevens said. ‘Animal cruelty is an unexceptional behaviour.’ Anyone who is found guilty of attacking wildlife animals could face a hefty fine of up to $22,000 or six months imprisonment. ‘There are laws put in place for cats and dogs but it shouldn’t be any different to wildlife animals,’ Ms Stevens said.","Two kangaroos have been brutally attacked this week in Queanbeyan, NSW .

"Saturday is the day when love of math and a hankering for pastry come full circle. Saturday is Pi Day, a once-in-a-year calendar date that this time squares the fun with a once-in-a-century twist. Math nerds all over the world will be celebrating with pizza specials, romantic outings, and mathtastic special events. Saturday is 3-14-15, the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi: 3.141592653. Pi day!: Students from the Maurice J. Tobin School makes a human Pi symbol at the school in Boston during a celebration of Pi Day in 2007 . The best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds, morning and evening. The next time that happens is in March 2115. 'It's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics,' said University of California Berkeley mathematician and author Edward Frenkel. 'Pi is special.' Pi is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle, as in pi times the radius squared, but it appears all over other parts of mathematics. It 'is kind of a basic atomic building block"" for math, said Temple University mathematician and author John Paulos, who was interviewed at precisely 3:14:15 p.m. In some places, Pi Day is celebrated with the edible type of pie. eat your numbers: To celebrate Pi day (the math constant and March 14 or 3-14), Wanda's Pie in the Sky, owned by Wanda Beaver made these pies in 2011 . 'It's a real exciting moment for math enthusiasm,' said Nathan Kaplan, a Yale University math professor, who called it a time for people to 'remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school.' Kaplan acknowledged that most people don't really recall math as fun, blaming that on how it's taught: 'There's fun stuff out there in the quantitative world.' One interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational, which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns. Yet in 1897, a bill before the Indiana legislature tried to round it up to 3.2. It fell flat. 'We cannot change it. It's not subject to opinion or taste or time,' Frenkel said. 'How many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space?' Celebration: A pi-adorned Dominic Vitale watches a performance at Hanover High School during the 2011 celebration of Pi day . The wall Street Journal reports that Dana Emanuel and Byron Clarke decided to hold their wedding on the special day. The date won't come around again for 100 years, so the couple decided  to send circular wedding invitations to  family and friends. The nuptials are even in unison which their engagement date on June 28 last year — 6.28, or two pi. 'The guests are really getting into and are able to laugh about it,' said Clarke. 'It kind of plays into our personalities and humor will hopefully be a big part of the day.' Baked goods: Hanover High School students participate in Pi Day activities in 2012 and made this tasty and dorktastic creation . Nice crust!: To celebrate Pi day (the math constant and March 14 or 3-14), Wanda's Pie in the Sky also made this baked good several years ago . 'Our friends are wacky like we are,' joked Emanuel. Pie even coincides with some of the couple's earliest dating memories, reports The New York Daily News. 'We won a dessert-making competition at a fundraiser for Blue Sky Bakery in October 2013 — and the prize was two pies! Which, when written mathematically, is 6.28…' the couple writes on their wedding website. In New York, Chicago, and other culinary states will be offering pizza deals on their 'pies.'

"A New York man has been arrested for allegedly conning desperate parents out of thousands of dollars by falsely promising to recover children who had been kidnapped and sold into child trafficking. According to the FBI, Peter Senese, 49, ran a sham non-profit called the I CARE Foundation where he purported he could reunite families with their children. In one particular incident, the alleged fraudster and pathological liar collected roughly $60,000 from a New York client whose child was abducted to India. However, the youngster was reportedly never recovered. Senese now faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of wire fraud. According to the FBI, Peter Senese, 49, (pictured) ran a sham non-profit called the I CARE Foundation where he purported he could reunite families with their children . He was arrested on Tuesday morning near his home in Brooklyn with his first court appearance due later that day. According to a Facebook fan page, Senese established the I CARE Foundation in 2011. However, a Tampa Bay Times article, alleges that Senese was already active in the child abduction business and operating as a 'master con' in May 2010. He went on to promote his group through the websites www.stopchildabduction.org and www.petersenese.com. He also built a presence on social media via Twitter and YouTube. According to the complaint, Senese told potential clients that he could recover children using former soldiers he knew from his days as a member of the U.S. Army's Delta Force. 'In fact, he could do no such thing, but that didn't stop him from allegedly repeatedly reaching out to the parents for more money to fund his non-existent rescue mission,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. In the India case, which took place in November 2013, Senese apparently claimed he had traveled to the country to seek out the perpetrators. He then sent several emails and text messages falsely assuring the family that the child's rescue was only days or even hours away. Documents also say he demanded more money to cover expenses - usually $3,000 to $5,000 a month. But investigators found that when Senese claimed he was overseas, he was really in New York, Miami or Los Angeles and hadn't traveled outside of the U.S. since 2007. They also found no records showing he was ever in the military and that I CARE was registered as a non-profit. There was also a second victim allegedly swindled out of $5,000 but Senese dropped the client after they wanted to arrange a meeting with an attorney. The name of Senese's attorney wasn't immediately available.","According to the FBI, Peter Senese ran a sham non-profit called the I CARE Foundation where he purported he could reunite families with their children .

"The President and First Lady both filmed TV appearances in Burbank, California on Thursday - but billed taxpayers for two separate private flights to get there. Barack Obama took Air Force One to LAX, at a cost of more than $1million, so he could be on Jimmy Kimmel Live. But, rather than ride with him, Michelle Obama chartered a different, earlier plane for a slot on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, filmed in the same LA suburb as Kimmel's program. Scroll down for video . Obamas' day out: The president goofed around on-screen with Jimmy Kimmel, left, while the First Lady flew to California to give Ellen DeGeneres a hug (right) Busting moves on our dime: Michelle Obama took a different flight to her husband to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres show and dance to Uptown Funk . Tough at the top: Barack Obama took some time to read insulting tweets about himself on the show . Despite the closeness, the White House has insisted that the pair's schedules 'were not in sync', CNN reported. The Commander-in-Chief used his time on the airwaves to read out mean tweets about himself, while Mrs Obama busted dance moves alongside DeGeneres to the tune of Uptown Funk. Obama's episode of Kimmel has aired already, while the full DeGeneres show is due on Monday. White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz defended the arrangement to a group of reporters on Air Force One. No room for Michelle: The president took Air Force One for the TV appearance, at an estimated cost of more than $1million . Low-key: Obama took Marine One, background, from LAX to Burbank airport . He said: 'I believe on this occasion the schedules were not in sync to travel together... I'm not even sure they overlapped.' Obama's visit was also occasion for a host of obvious - and expensive - security measures. When the president took a helicopter from LAX to Burbank airport, he was accompanied by three military choppers. A team of snipers was also dispatched to Los Angles to guard the president, who took a 40-car motorcade from Burbank's airport to Kimmel's studio. Entourage: These black-clad security men were on the tarmac in Los Angeles as part of Obama's detail . The Obamas are not thought to have seen one other at all in California. The president flew on to Phoenix on Friday afternoon, while the First Lady returned to the White House Thursday. Air Force One costs more than $200,000 an hour to fly, meaning the tab for Obama's flight to Los Angeles will have passed the $1million mark by itself. The specifics of the First Lady's travel arrangements are not clear, though it is likely to have stacked tens of thousands of dollars on to the overall cost. It is not the first time the First Family has come under scrutiny for drafting multiple planes for very similar trips. A 2011 summer jaunt to Martha's Vineyard saw the President take Air Force One solo to the famous golfing spot. Michelle, Sasha and Malia followed in a separate jet just four hours later - likely costing tens of thousands extra again. The Obama family went to even greater lengths to fly apart earlier that year. The annual presidential retreat to Hawaii saw Michelle and the children set off several days before the president, taking an 'office in the sky' jet designed for military commanders, at an estimated cost of at $63,000.","Barack Obama took Air Force One to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live .

"Are you a messy eater, who always ends up with bits of food or stains splattered on their clothing? Then perhaps a new pocket washing machine - believed to be the world's smallest - is the answer to your problems. The newly designed Coton handy washer, produced by Chinese electronics firm Haier, is the same-size as an electric shaver and can remove anything from dirt to those dreaded red wine stains, according to People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video . The handy device can be fitted in a pocket and targets those troublesome stains such as blood, dirt and wine . The Coton device is 176mm high and weighs 200g - the pocket-size gadget is powered by three AAA batteries . It is powered by three AAA batteries and aims to prevent those frustratingly long waits in the dry cleaners by targeting troublesome stains such as coffee, grass or oil. The device, created by AQUA (a subsidiary of Haier Group in China), is already flying off the shelves in Japan where it costs 10,800 Yen or £60. The portable gadget - which weighs just 200g - uses a method called 'squeeze washing' which removes stains in 30 seconds. It works by first applying liquid detergent on a piece of kitchen paper, before washing over it with the nozzle of the Coton device. It then pumps a small amount of water over the stain at 700 beats a minute. The newly designed gadget has already gone on sale in Japan, where it is proving very popular on the market . The hand held device uses a method called 'squeeze washing' which removes stains in 30 seconds . Although this pocket-sized device is thought to be the smallest washing machine created, it is not the first invention aimed at cleaning clothes on the go. In 2013, Australian Ash Newland created the 'Scrubba', a small bag that can wash laundry in just five minutes. The £41 wash bag, which looks like nothing more than an average canvas bag, is made from a waterproof material and contains a flexible washboard which cleans away any dirt. When three litres of water, liquid soap, and dirty washing are added to the bag, a user has to simply fold and fasten it closed, and rub it to clean the clothes inside.","Pocket sized Coton handy washer targets troublesome stains on clothing .

"A British dance teacher shot dead by his son-in-law, who was also his former lover, may have molested at least four boys while running a dance school in Suffolk, it has emerged. Police have investigated four alleged victims who say they were abused in the 1980s and 1990s by Scott Rogers, who was killed in the US after becoming a local television celebrity there. Three of the men claiming that Rogers attacked them have only come forward after he was shot dead in August by Mathew Hodgkinson, who also killed himself. Investigation: Scott Rogers is accused of molesting at least four young boys while living in Britain . Rogers - known as Richard Scott-Rogers when he lived in Britain - was charged with abusing the other boy more than 20 years ago, but was cleared in 1993 after a trial. Before he moved to the US, Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, which was described as a 'supposedly religious cult' by the local council. Rogers allegedly held 'sleepovers' with young students, where he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags', according to parents. He then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he hosted a weekend morning TV show called Around Town, making him a minor celebrity in the area. But in August last year, Rogers, 52, was murdered by Mathew Hodgkinson, a former lover of his who had married his daughter Kimmy as part of an immigration scam. School: Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983 . Hodgkinson, 36, then turned the gun on himself, and died in hospital eight days later. After Rogers' death, Suffolk Police appealed for any victims to come forward, and were contacted by three men who said they were abused at the dance school in Bury St Edmunds. Killer: Rogers was shot dead in August by his son-in-law and ex-lover Mathew Hodgkinson, pictured . The force, working with officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, recorded their claims and referred them to specialist agencies which support child abuse victims. However, they will not be able to take any further action because Rogers' death means the investigation has now been closed. A Suffolk Police crime report uncovered by a MailOnline freedom of information request said: 'Three new victims of child abuse reported to the Suffolk police sexual abuse by Richard Scott-Rogers. 'These historic incidents were recorded as notifiable crimes. Police provided support to these victims. There are no further lines of enquiry to complete in relation to the investigation with no other parties involvement. 'Given the suspect had died these crimes are therefore finalised in accordance with Home Office crime recording outcomes.' The three new victims brings the total number of British complainants to four, including the boy who made the original abuse claims in the 1990s. Following Rogers' death, it emerged that the authorities had recently taken away his adopted 10-year-old son and two-year-old foster son after finding out about his past. He was due to give evidence to a grand jury on the day he was killed, after police discovered that he had lied on the forms he used to apply to become a foster parent. Note: Hodgkinson left this note after killing Rogers and then shooting himself . Hodgkinson wrote an apparent suicide note found in the home he shared with his wife and father-in-law, saying: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.' Soon after Rogers was killed, two anonymous British men appeared on a radio show and accused him of molesting them when they were young boys. One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been abused from the age of 13. It is not known whether the men who made those claims are the same as the complainants who have contacted the police.","EXCLUSIVE: Scott Rogers was shot dead by his ex-lover  in August .

They are being advertised in a wide-reaching campaign alongside three other Red Bull Editions drinks, including a new yellow-colored Tropical flavor that was briefly tested last summer. The other two flavors, Cranberry (red) and Blueberry (blue), were launched two years ago. In a bid to promote its new flavors and zero-calorie editions, Red Bull and its longtime agency, Kastner and Partners, are displaying the colorful cans on more than 3,000 billboards nationwide. These include boards in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. The drinks are being pictured alongside swirling rays of light, Red Bull's logo and slogans such as 'Wings For Every Taste'. Red Bull is also advertising its new drinks online. It has paid for takeover adds on Pandora and continues to release videos of millennials consuming the drinks on Twitter, Adweek.com reported.

He added that he hopes the bright adverts would appeal to millennials. 'It feels like it's familiar to an audience that loves the festival scene and the idea of music and light going together,' he said.

But in reality, she was sharing her Darlington home with boyfriend Mark Briscoe - a former soldier working in private security in the Middle East. In one year, he was able to deposit £9,000 into his 33-year-old girlfriend's account - all the while claiming benefits, using them as a 'financial safety net'. It also enabled her to pay for family holidays to Majorca and Bulgaria, as well as a £1,000-plus sofa, fridge, washing machine, flooring and a Sky subscription. Her deception was discovered in 2013, although she initially denied being in a relationship with Mr Briscoe. However, her neighbours knew they were a couple, and Teesside Crown Court heard Mr Briscoe also had his car registered at the Darlington property, and his pension correspondence from the army went there. Eventually, Whiting admitted two charges of failing to notify a change in circumstances, and yesterday she was given a two-month suspended prison sentence. The judge, Recorder Martin Bethel, QC, described her dishonesty as 'blatant' and also ordered Whiting, of Chestnut Drive, to pay £400 costs. Penny Bottomley, mitigating, told the court that the fathers of Whiting's first two children 'contributed very little to their upbringing'. She added: 'Her explanation to the Probation Service for continuing to claim benefits is it was a financial safety net for her and her children. 'That's somewhat understandable given she had spent the past 11 years receiving very little money from their fathers. 'She accepts it was wrong.' Miss Bottomley told the judge that unemployed Whiting had struggled with a gambling addiction at one point, but that was 'now being managed'. The youngest of the defendant's three children - Mr Briscoe is the father - is three, and the others are aged seven and 11, the court was told. Prosecutor Nigel Soppitt said the allegation was she claimed more than £11,800 over 18 months, but the defence case is that it was £5,000 over nine months.","Melissa Whiting claimed she was a single mother in order to claim benefits .
But Whiting was actually in a relationship with former soldier Mark Briscoe .
The private security worker was depositing thousands into her account .
So mother-of-three used benefits as a 'safety net' while spending lavishly .
Defence say is 'understandable' due to lack of child support from fathers ."
"From their heavy build and short limbs, to the shape of their skull and teeth, there are many ways that the anatomy of Neanderthals differed to our own. Now experts say that even a small bone in their ears are dissimilar to one in modern humans, raising the prospect that our extinct ancient relatives heard differently to us too. Researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a Neanderthal child, whose remains were discovered in France 40 years ago. Researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a Neanderthal child, whose remains were discovered in France 40 years ago to make the discovery. The entirety of the auditory ossicle is shown . The remains from a two-year-old child, which are known as La Ferrassie 8, were discovered at La Ferrassie in the Dordogne, south western France, between 1970 and 1973. Excavations at the rock shelter in south west France began in the early 20th century. They yielded the remains of female and male adults to provide scientists with the first evidence of sexual dimorphism in Neanderthals, according to the Smithsonian. A total of eight individuals at all stages of life were purposefully buried at the site, including children and two foetuses. The skull of Ferrassie 1 is the most complete Neanderthal skull ever found and includes traits such as the low, sloping forehead and large nostrils. The site yielded seven Neanderthal skeletons ranging from foetuses to almost complete skeletons of adults, thought to be between 70,000 and 50,000 years old. Over 40 years on, they are shedding new light on the anatomy of the extinct species, which inhabited Europe and parts of western Asia between 230,000 and 28,000 years ago. Asier Gómez-Olivencia, an Ikerbasque researcher at the University of the Basque Country in northern Spain, produced a 3D computer reconstruction of the remains. His work, published in The Journal of Human Evolution, reveals another anatomical difference between the Neanderthals and modern humans in the smallest ossicles of the body. Among La Ferrassie 8’s bones – including a skull, jaw, vertebrae, ribs and hand phalanges – is a very complete left temporal bone with an auditory ossicle inside – a complete stapes. Neanderthals inhabited Europe and parts of western Asia between 230,000 and 28,000 years ago. A stock image is shown. The bone comes from a two-year-old of the extinct species . The La Ferrassie site (marked on the map) yielded seven Neanderthal skeletons ranging from foetuses to almost complete skeletons of adults . The bone, which lies in the middle ear of humans and other mammals is involved in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear. It is the most complete example in the Neanderthal record. Dr Gómez-Olivencia made a computer model so he could virtually ‘extract’ the bone to study its shape closely. He found that the shape of the Neanderthal stapes differs from our own, meaning they may have heard sounds differently too. He explained: ‘We do not yet know the relation between these morphological differences and hearing in the Neanderthals. ‘This would constitute a new challenge for the future’. Female Neanderthals did the household chores as well as hunting alongside males (illustrated), according to a study which analysed their teeth . Female Neanderthals did the household chores as well as hunting alongside males, according to a recent study which analysed their teeth. It suggests that women in the group were responsible for looking after furs and adjusting garments, while men had the task of improving stone tools. Scientists at Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid analysed 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 Neanderthals found at sites in Spain, France and Belgium. The fossils in Spain dated back 100,000 years, in France 50,000 years, and in Belgium the ancient teeth were believed to be 44,000 years old. Regardless of age, Neanderthals had dental grooves. 'This is due to the custom of these societies to use the mouth as a third hand, as in some current populations, for tasks such as preparing the furs or chopping meat, for instance,' said Antonio Rosas, CSIC researcher. But the study found grooves present in the female fossils followed the same pattern, and were different to those found in male individuals. 'What we have now discovered is that the grooves detected in the teeth of adult women are longer than those found in adult men,' said Professor Rosas. 'Therefore we assume that the tasks performed were different'. The tiny nicks of the teeth enamel were also analysed. Male individuals show a greater number of nicks in the enamel and dentin of the upper parts, while in female individuals these imperfections appear in the lower parts. It is still unclear which activities corresponded to women and which ones to men. However, the authors of the study note that, as in modern hunter-gatherer societies, women may have been responsible for the preparation of furs and the elaboration of garments. Researchers state that the retouching of the edges of stone tools seems to have been a male task.","Bone was found among remains of a two-year-old Neanderthal child .

"Convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan proposed to his girlfriend of three years when he discovered his clemency bid had been rejected by Indonesian authorities. The 31-year-old Australian, who is currently awaiting execution on the island of Nusakambangan, asked his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila if she would be his wife when she visited him in Kerobokan prison in February. Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death by Indonesian president Joko Widodo. Febyanti and Chan met each other in Kerobokan prison in 2012 after a friend introduced the pair. The Indonesian had been visiting the prison as part of her role as a pastor and Chan was carrying out theological studies in the hope of becoming a minister. Since then they have dreamed of his release, even talking about plans to have children together one day. Convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan proposed to his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila (pictured with ring) of three years when he discovered his clemency bid had been rejected by Indonesian authorities. Febyanti Herewila Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph Febyanti claimed she is totally in love with Chan and she did not accept his proposal out of pity for the Bali Nine prisoner. 'I love him for who he is. And I see what he does for other people and that makes me love him more,' Febyanti said. 'If you ask me why do I love him, it's because he also has weaknesses as well but he also has a lot of good things about him. I accept him the way he is. I am also very proud of him.' Chan was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.2kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years and got a new lease of life in 2012 when he met the love of his life. Febyanti pictured here with Andrew Chan's brother, Michael Chan, was turned away from visiting Kerobokan Prison just before the Bali Nine duo were escorted to Nusakambangan to await their execution .

Last Valentine's Day, Chan sent Febyanti red roses and a teddy bear and when she visited the jail they would chat about their dreams of one day opening a centre for unprivileged kids. On the day Chan proposed, the happy couple sat around the prison eating cake and celebrating by praying for his release. Febyanti and Chan's brother attempted to visit him one last time in Kerobokan prison last Wednesday before his transfer to the Indonesian 'death island' but were denied access. On Monday, Febyanti was one of a selected number of family members who visited Chan on Nusakambangan island. Along with fellow Bali nine prisoner Myuran Sukumaran they hold out desperate hope that a last ditch legal appeal will bring them mercy. The family members were driven in a motorcade from the airport in Cilacap before climbing aboard a small boat, assisted by embassy officials, to visit the Nusakambangan prison island. The motorcade of family members of Australian death row prisoners, Chan and Sukumaran, arrives for a visit at the entrance of Nusakambangan prison island . Today was the first time the family members saw Chan and Sukumaran since they were moved from Bali . Michael Chan, the brother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, and Chintu Sukumaran, the brother of Myuran Sukumaran spoke to journalists at Wijayapura port. Hopeful that it won’t be the last time they see their loved-ones, Chan's mother Helen and Sukumaran's parents Sam and Raji and his sister Brintha also made the emotional journey. The Age reports Chinthu told reporters: 'My mum, sister and I have been waiting and counting down the days. We have been told he is doing well but we just want to see for ourselves, just make sure to go and see him, to let him know that we love him.' Michael said: 'Mum is fairly excited to see Andy today and it's been a few days, you know. We are looking forward to seeing him when we get over there.' Lawyers for the death row inmates say there are positive signs in a grim situation. Michael Chan (right) and Chinthu Sukumaran  arrive for a visit at the entrance of Nusakambangan prison island . Helen and Michael Chan, the family of Andrew Chan arrive in Yogyakarta, Indonesia,  on Thursday, March 5 . The legal team will be back in court on Thursday where they will present a high level argument that Indonesia's president is subject to Indonesian law. Their fresh appeal for clemency for the pair will be heard in an administrative court in Jakarta. ‘The main promising thing for us is that they're not dead,’ lawyer Peter Morrissey told ABC radio on Monday. ‘The way some officials were talking, they should have been dead weeks ago.’ Jakarta has indicated it plans to wait for the result of legal appeals of some of the 10 drug felons waiting for the firing squad. The heartbreaking video shows Andrew Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail . On Sunday, footage emerged of doomed Bali Nine ringleader Chan speaking about second chances just hours after the first round of executions on January 18. The heartbreaking video shows Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail. Behind him prison bars are visible as he looks tearily into the camera and talks in soft spoken tones. The 30-second video was aired on Channel Seven's Sunday Night. 'My name's Andrew Chan,' the convicted drug smuggler said.

'It's a day - pretty much a few hours - after the execution of six innocent lives. 'Guess what runs through my head is about how precious life really is.' On January 18, five people were executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island - in Central Java. Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, Malawi's Namaona Denis and Indonesia's Rani Adriani were killed that day.

Kerobokan prison had been the Bali Nine duo's home for 10 years after they were found guilty of drug smuggling . Another woman Tran Bich Hanh, from Vietnam, was also put to death nearby. Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance? 'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you’re a convicted criminal.' Sukuraman also admitted on Sunday Night he had thought about hanging himself or getting someone else to shoot him. 'I don't really think I'll enjoy the process of being dragged in front of a firing squad,' he said.","Bali Nine convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan proposed in February .

"A teen who lost her hair while battling a rare form of kidney cancer was surprised by a celebrity hairstylist who arrived on her doorstep to gift her a new wig and a complete makeover just hours before her senior prom. When doctors told 18-year-old Hannah Tate from Maryville, Tennessee, she was well enough to attend her prom, she took to Instagram to get in touch with hairstylist Tokyo Stylez, who has worked with Rihanna, Naomi Campbell, and Gabrielle Union, in the hopes that he would send her one of his custom-made wigs. But Tokyo took his generosity one step further and secretly began working with Hannah's mother LaVetta Spann in order to personally deliver and style the wig before the Alcoa High School dance. Scroll down for video . Unforgettable moment: Hannah Tate, who is battling a rare kidney cancer, posed for a pre-prom photo after a celebrity hairstylist gave her a complete makeover before the high school dance last Saturday . So grateful: The next day, the 18-year-old, who goes by the Twitter name Molly Copeland, took to Twitter to thank everyone who had helped her get to her senior prom . Hannah was diagnosed with cancer last November and lost her hair after chemotherapy and radiation treatments. She spent most of her senior year of high school undergoing treatment at St. Jude Regional Children’s Hospital in Memphis and missed out on basketball games, track meets, and dance competitions. But she was thrilled that she was able to go to her senior prom with all of her friends.

"A burglar who stole a pet parrot worth £600 left a shocking ransom note in his cage, threatening to kill the bird if his owner went to police. Cara Cosson, 45, of Oakley, Bedford, was out at work when a raider kicked in the back door of her three-bedroom home and stole JoeJoe the African grey - but took nothing else. The unknown criminal left a menacing note made from letters cut from magazines, saying: ‘Want your bird back alive text [phone number]. Contact police bird dies a slow agonising death!’ Bizarre: The unknown criminal left a menacing note made from letters cut from magazines, saying: 'Want your bird back alive text [phone number]. Contact police bird dies a slow agonising death!' Miss Cosson ignored the threat and called police, who arrested a man in his 40s before bailing him. But JoeJoe, 16, is still missing and she fears she will never see her pet again. Now, she has made the ransom note public in a bid to highlight her case - and said fellow animal-lovers have offered to hire a private investigator to track down the bird. Contracts officer Miss Cosson said: ‘Everybody in the bird world knows about it and there has been no sign of a bird like JoeJoe being sold. I think the person who stole him still has him. This is not a conventional bird theft. 'I released the letter because I thought if people saw the circumstances they would realise just how serious this is. It is getting harder as time goes on. It is things like going home and him not saying anything. 'The house is so quiet without him. I am even considering moving house now because of the memories that I have of the theft - but I am never going to give up on JoeJoe.’ Miss Cosson has had a pet bird since she was a child and is well-known locally as a parrot breeder. She has owned JoeJoe since he was 14 weeks old - and said he loves reggae and Motown music. Parrot: Cara Cosson was out at work when a raider entered her home and stole JoeJoe the African grey . JoeJoe dances along to music and his favourite songs are  Needle in a Haystack by The Whispers and Heat Wave by Martha and the Vandellas, according to Miss Cosson. His owner, who lives alone, said he whistles the tune of Summertime by Nina Simone, meows like a cat and enjoys drinking Earl Grey tea. She has even consulted a clairvoyant who said that the bird could be returned to her by May. Miss Cosson added: ‘JoeJoe is not a pet, he is family. He is a real character and everyone who had met him loves him. It feels to me that my child has been kidnapped, to want of a better word. People will think it is just a bird but he’s not.’ The burglary took place on February 20 and Miss Cosson believes she knows who was behind it - because nothing else was touched. She suspects JoeJoe is being held in Rushden or Kettering in Northamptonshire and is offering a £1,500 reward for his safe return. Bedfordshire Police said a man in his 40s was arrested in relation to the theft and bailed. A spokesman added: ‘Unfortunately at this stage the parrot has not been recovered and the police investigation is continuing.’ The African Grey is regarded as one of the most intelligent animals in the world, on a par with dolphins and chimpanzees, and the species can live until they are 70 years old. They can develop human emotions and bored African Greys can literally become sick as distress causes them to pluck out their own feathers.","Cara Cosson was at work when raider  stole JoeJoe the African grey .

"A pet pig who lives in a pub with her owners has been banned from the bar after she started stealing pints and headbutting customers. The micro-pig, who goes by the name of Frances Bacon, eats, sleeps and drinks at the Conquering Hero in south London. But the four-year-old soon started polishing off the dregs from customers' discarded beer glasses and breaking into the bar's snack supply. Frances Bacon the pig, pictured with her owners Ian and Vicky Taylor-Ross, has been banned from her local pub after stealing pints and headbutting customers . The micro-pig eats, sleeps and drinks at her owner's inn, the Conquering Hero in West Norwood, London . But she soon started finishing off the dregs from discarded beer glasses and helping herself to the pork scratchings . The pig has a penchant for pork scratchings - but 'doesn't have a clue that between pork scratchings are her relatives', according to Mrs Taylor-Ross . Customers at the West Norwood establishment had also started letting the Vietnamese Pot-Belly take a sip from their beer or cider. The pig, who must be kept on a strictly vegetarian diet, even recently broke into the bar and ate a big bag of dry-roasted peanuts, making her thirsty for days. Landlords Ian and Vicky Taylor-Ross only realised what was going on when the animal - who has her own space in the beer garden - started headbutting customers in the legs. The couple has now warned customers not to serve the pig any alcohol in a bid to help  clamp down on her drinking. They have also had to put their pork scratchings, crisps and peanuts on a higher shelf under lock and key in case Frances attempts to snuffle them.

"Jane Lu’s success started like many others. She got up early each morning, put on a suit, waved goodbye to her supportive parents and left for work. The only difference was that the 28-year-old didn’t have an office to go to, a formal job title or a boss to report to. Keeping her ventures a secret in fear that her parents wouldn't approve, Ms Lu would venture into the city each day under the guise that she was still working hard as an accountant and sit down in a cafe or the State Library and secretly contact wholesalers, organise marketing campaigns and find new, affordable fashion as she built her online shopping empire. Scroll down for video . Business is booming: Ms Lu's online shopping business has turned over $10 million in the last calendar year . Ms Lu’s story is one of perseverance, determination and achievement with her successful online shopping venture ShowPo.com reportedly turning over $10 million in the past calendar year. She distributes clothing to 45 countries, has 420,000 followers on Instagram and 464,000 friends on Facebook, attributing her success to dominating the social media platforms. Ms Lu said even though she may not have been completely honest with her parents at the start of her career, she knows they are beyond proud of her accomplishments. ‘At first they said ‘I don’t understand how you had the guts to do this’ but in reality it was them who left everything to take their young family to Australia,’ she said. 'They quit their great jobs to work as cleaners and in factories, now that is gutsy,’ she added. She said she knows it was their initial investment and support that helped her put herself out there and maintains that she doesn't know anyone that's worked as hard as them. Ms Lu completed a business degree and gained an elusive graduate position before throwing it all away for her dream . After reading about her triumphs it will surprise you to know that her road to success was paved with a few failures. Ms Lu would be the first to admit that things don’t always work out the first time you give it a crack. She started her professional life in corporate finance first securing an elusive graduate position with KPMG and then moving on to accounting firm Ernst & Young. After spending some time pondering her future life as a corporate go-getter, she said she was left feeling unfulfilled. ‘I wasn’t getting much out of my day to day and a uni friend said they wanted to start a business so I quit my job and blindly followed,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Lu took advantage of social media saying it was the perfect marketing opportunity for someone without much capital . ‘The small quick and nimble can really dominate a market like that because big business didn’t know how to capitalise on it' Ms Lu’s family, in a show of unwavering support, lent her money for the start up venture, a pop-up fashion shop in the city. It took some time but eventually Ms Lu saw that the business wasn't taking off and she was left with $50,000 of debt. ‘It was really devastating when my first attempt failed. I’d quit my job so I couldn’t really go crawling back to my old employers. 'It was also right in the middle of the global financial crisis so I really had no other option but to continue on,’ she said. Being faced with the option of flight or fight, Ms Lu secretly soldiered on in the hopes that she would have better news to give her parents soon. From humble beginnings: Ms Tu worked on bended knee scrubbing out her first warehouse,right, and she put in the hard yards before getting her first office, left. ‘My parents lent me money to start up my first business and after it failed it felt really hard to justify to them why I didn’t want to go back to business, which was their dream job for me. 'Selling clothes online was completely foreign to them. They don’t even use email,’ she said. In a few short years Ms Lu has managed to take her business from a dream to cold hard reality. She said if she had given up when she first failed she would have never achieved what she has today. Ms Lu now has 10 employees and says she loves that she has the opportunity to have fun each and every day . Try and try again: ‘So many young people have a fear of failure but having failed, I can tell you it’s really not as bad or as scary as it seems' ‘So many young people have a fear of failure but having failed, I can tell you it’s really not as bad or as scary as it seems. ‘It is worth the risk and you should always back yourself,’ she added. Ms Lu said although she could have spent a lot more time on the couch after her first disappointment she found it really motivating to get up every day with purpose, as if she had a boss to report to, and work for the job she really wanted. ‘It can be so easy to sit at home and watch TV or go to the beach with other friends who aren’t working but you can’t let yourself do that. It's about being productive every day.’ After being brought up in a ‘very academically focused’ environment Ms Tu said she wasn’t once taught how to be successful if you pursue a creative career. Ms Lu said she saw a gap in the online shopping market for affordable garments . Even after becoming a front runner in Australian online business Ms Tu said she still finds it ‘bizarre’ to think of herself as a role model . ‘Life is long and people have to stop thinking that you can’t spend some of that time time when you are young to investing in yourself and what makes you happy.’ ‘Your work life pretty much takes up the majority of your life so why not work to live instead of live to work,’ she added. After taking the online shopping market by storm Ms Tu said it was social media that catapulted her to success. Her online community and small group of staff became the unofficial face of her brand as she encouraged clients to post photographs of themselves wearing their recent purchases to further showcase the latest merchandise. Her social media reach was only further extended each time a satisfied customer posts a picture on Instagram and Facebook. ‘Basically, I had no money when I started the business so I needed social media to get the brand out to our community.’ Coming into a market where big businesses hadn’t quite grasped the power of social media Ms Lu said there was a huge marketing sector that could be taken advantage of. ‘It was really devastating when my first attempt failed. I’d quit my job so I couldn’t really go crawling back to my old employers' ‘The small quick and nimble can really dominate a market like that because big business didn’t know how to capitalise on it.' She said while she was starting out social media remained relatively unknown with big businesses blowing it off as ‘a fad’. ‘It’s about building a loyal community who are genuinely interested instead of paying for advertising to just make sales.’ Ms Lu used Facebook to start her social media campaign but says a lot of consumers are migrating to Insagram . Ms Lu was born in China, left, and was eight-years-old when she first moved to Australia, right. Ms Lu said she came from a 'very academic' environment with her parents dreaming she would find a job where she could be financially stable . Ms Lu’s family immigrated from China during political unrest in 1994 when she was eight years old and she said it was that initial sacrifice which gave her the opportunity to flourish in Australia. Even after becoming a front runner in Australian online business Ms Lu said she still finds it ‘bizarre’ to think of herself as a role model for women who are out there working hard to achieve their dream. ‘It is so bizarre, I mean, I don’t really have any experience, my first business failed so really if I can do it, anyone can do it.’ Her positive attitude caught the attention of The League of Extraordinary Women and they asked Ms Lu to take her story to the 'Run the World' conference where several of Australia’s most successful entrepreneurs will tell of their trials and tribulations in the hopes of motivating a new generation of young female go-getters. Winners are grinners: Ms Lu said she has an amazing team who have become a huge part of her sucess . Chiquita Searle, general manager of the League, told Daily Mail Australia that they knew they wanted Ms Lu to speak after hearing of her overwhelming perseverance in the face of crushing adversity. ‘It’s so important for young entrepreneurs to see someone in Jane’s position who didn’t have the perfect run. ‘It really wasn’t an easy journey for her, she quit her job, her first business failed leaving her with $50,000 of debt and she spent years working before she gained any traction,’ Ms Searle said. Ms Lu said throughout all her academic pursuits she was never once told she could be successful by chasing a creative dream .","Jane Lu quit her job and started Show Pony after a failed business venture .

"A Sky TV reporter has revealed he was 'devastated' by the suicide of a woman who killed herself days after he exposed her as one of the Twitter trolls who abused the McCann family. Brenda Leyland, 63, from Burton Overy, Leicestersire, died in  October days after being approached on camera by Martin Brunt. The reporter confronted her on the subject of hundreds of posts she had written about the McCann family, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007. At an inquest into her death today Mr Brunt said he was 'devastated' when told she had been found dead days later. Brenda Leyland died days after being exposed by Sky News journalist Martin Brunt as one of the Twitter users posting negative messages about the McCann family . 'I was devastated, I still am and the enormity of what’s happened will always be with me.' He approached the woman on September 30 last year after being given a list of the names of people who had been trolling the family. Among some 400 posts written by Mrs Leyland, she described Kate and Gerry McCann as the 'worst of humankind'. After tracking the divorcee down to the village in Leicestershire, Mr Brunt and his camera crew approached her outside her house. Introducing himself as a Sky News reporter, he asked her why she had been using Twitter to 'attack' the family. Mrs Leyland responded: 'I'm entitled to do that,' before saying that a Scotland Yard investigation into  the tweets was 'fair enough'. She died days later after checking in to a hotel in nearby Enderby. Today Mr Brunt said he was surprised she had engaged with him at all in the days beforehand. 'I was rather surprised that she did speak to me and did engage with me,' he said. Following their filmed exchange Mrs Leyland got in to a parked car and drove away. Later she returned to the house and invited the reporter inside. 'After she left, we stayed in the village and I did a piece to camera. We were just packing up to go when she returned,' Mr Brunt added. The 63-year-old was approached by a Sky News team over her use of Twitter to write messages about the McCann family . 'We approached her again as she walked up to her house and she said ""Come in Martin"". I went in and spoke to her for about half an hour. 'Once in the house she seemed very relaxed. I said I had caught her on the hop and asked if she would be willing to do an interview in her house, but she wasn't interested. 'I said I hoped I hadn't ruined her day, and she said I hadn't ruined her day - but her life.' He added the woman was 'at pains' to explain why she had written the negative messages about the McCann family. 'She said she had concerns about the fundraising and was concerned they had left Madeleine with her siblings alone. 'She said, ""I have questions for the McCanns"". 'She said she thought Twitter was a means to express opinions and hoped she had not done anything unlawful.' Mr Brunt added he explained the police were in discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service. 'She acknowledged she was (the Twitter user) ""sweepyface"" and said ""I probably won’t ever tweet again""'. The following day Mrs Leyland contacted Mr Brunt on the phone number he had given her during their visit and asked whether she would be identified in the broadcast. 'I did say I would keep her informed because I am aware of the impact such a confrontation can have on somebody,' he told the inquest. . The pair spoke again the night before the clip was shown. Asked whether he could detect any concern for her life during their conversation, Mr Brunt said: 'No, but when I asked her how she was, she said ""Oh I have thought about ending it all but I am feeling better - I have had a drink and spoken to my son.' He added he thought her comments were a throwaway remark and that he had no knowledge of her battle with depression at the time. The inquest heard how Mrs Leyland had previously grappled with mental illness and had tried to take her own life once before. In a statement her son Ben, who lives in America, said the encounter had left his mother 'panicked'. 'On September 30 she called me and it was clear to me from her tone of voice that she was panicking,' it read. 'She said ""I have been tweeting about the McCanns, I have had a reporter from Sky News here and a report has gone to Scotland Yard""'. 'We discussed what action to take to avoid her name and picture appearing in the media. Mrs Leyland had posted more than 400 tweets about Kate and Gerry McCann (above) whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007 . 'On October 2, I was aware the story had broken. I tried to contact my mother without success, I discussed with my dad and brothers going round to check she was OK. 'I got an email from mum on Wednesday saying she felt ""cheerier"". 'My mum has always struggled with depression and has undergone therapy and psychiatric treatment. 'I have been thinking a lot and have no doubt of the panic and fear in her voice, and think the Sky News report was the final straw.' Recording a verdict of suicide, Senior Leicester Coroner Catherine Mason described Mrs Leyland as an 'intelligent and loving person'. 'She was aware she had come into the public eye. I have heard all guidelines were followed by Sky and Brenda invited Mr Brunt into her property. 'She was also kept informed of how the story would be run. I am satisfied that although Brenda Leyland did have a medical health history, others wouldn't necessarily have known she was suffering. 'Although she did mention wanting to take her own life, she then dismissed it.' 'She was upset by her public exposure in the media. She planned (her death) independently and had insight into her actions, so I therefore conclude a verdict of suicide.' The cause of her death was given as asphyxiation due to gas inhalation. A former psychiatric consultant of Mrs Leyland, Dr Kajetan Zakrewski, said the risk of self-harm had 'always' existed due to her state of mental health. Following the coroner's verdict Sky News issued a statement expressing its condolences. 'The team at Sky News followed its editorial guidelines and pursued a story in a responsible manner that we believed was firmly in the public interest,' it read. 'Brenda Leyland's tragic death highlights the unforeseeable human impact that the stories we pursue can have, and Sky News would like to extend its sincere condolences to her family.'

"Education: David Cameron and his wife Samantha have accepted a place at a Church of England academy a short walk from Downing Street for their daughter Nancy . David Cameron is to become the first Conservative prime minister to send a child to a state secondary school after accepting a place at a Church of England academy a short walk from Downing Street. The Prime Minister has been privately worshipping at a London church once a week, often on a weekday morning, for several years. Now he and wife Samantha have decided to send daughter Nancy, 11, to the Grey Coat Hospital, a CofE school in Westminster, from September. It is a significant break from tradition for a Tory leader – and for the Camerons personally, given that the Prime Minister was educated privately at Eton and his wife at Marlborough College. Grey Coat Hospital is thought to have been the family’s second choice for Nancy, after another church school in West London. Like hundreds of thousands of parents, the Camerons heard this week from their local authority which of several applications had been successful. A family friend has revealed that they have now accepted a place at Grey Coat Hospital – a choice which will be seen as an indication of Mr Cameron’s confidence that he will still be in power later this year, given its proximity to Number Ten. The school is rated outstanding by education watchdog Ofsted and is one of the most sought-after state schools in the area, with seven applications for every place. Tory chief whip Michael Gove sent his daughter Beatrice there last year, when he was Education Secretary. Featuring recently in Tatler’s guide to the best state schools, its sixth-formers produced 71 per cent A* to B A-level grades last year. Many went on to Oxbridge and other elite universities. School down for video . The school is ethnically mixed, with only around a third of its pupils being white. It also prides itself on being a social melting pot, with children from council estates mingling with those of middle-class professionals. Headteacher Sian Maddrell insists on strict discipline, with pupils placed in detention if they forget books, are disruptive or even glance at the clock during lessons. They are barred from using detention time to do homework, instead being expected to read an ‘improving book’. The school’s official uniform outfitter is John Lewis, including its upmarket London department store Peter Jones. It admits girls aged 11 to 18 and boys only in the sixth form, with 151 places allocated for this year’s intake. A total of 116 are reserved for girls from practising church families, preferably with attendance for at least 40 weeks of the year for the previous five years. A further 15 go to pupils with an aptitude for languages, with remaining places filled on an open basis, with preference given to those living nearby and attending ‘feeder’ schools. Second choice: The school is rated outstanding by Ofsted and is one of the most sought-after state schools in the area, with seven applications for every place . The school was founded on St Andrew’s Day in 1698 to educate poor boys and girls so they could be ‘loyal citizens, useful workers and solid Christians’. After a colourful history which included a murder in 1773 and a rebellion against the ‘dreadful conditions’ in 1801, it became a girls’ day school in 1874. It is not clear on what basis Nancy has been admitted, but Mr Cameron is understood to have been paying regular private visits to worship at a London church for several years. He and his family sometimes attend on a Sunday, but more often he blocks out part of his diary on a weekday morning to worship alone, friends say. The Camerons also applied to Lady Margaret School, a Church academy in Fulham, West London, which is rated ‘outstanding’, but are not thought to have been offered a place there. The Prime Minister sent his children to a Church state primary school in Kensington, which also reserves most of its places for families who are regular churchgoers. Political leaders have in the past attracted controversy for sending their children to high-performing faith schools, such as the strict Catholic London Oratory in West London chosen by Nick Clegg and Tony Blair for their children.","David Cameron accepts place at a CofE academy for daughter Nancy, 11 .

"Gllery manager Geraldine Hassler (pictured) had mistakenly sold the painting while the gallery was storing it for the customer . An art gallery manager sold a customer’s £5,000 painting to somebody else by mistake – before commissioning an ‘ugly copy’ to try to con its owner. The Envie d’art gallery, in South Kensington, London, had been asked to look after the painting while the home of the customer who purchased it was undergoing renovations. But when the art lover asked for it to be delivered three years later, the gallery gave him an apparent imitation - and then tried to convince him it was his original. The Evening Standard reports that gallery manager Geraldine Hassler had mistakenly sold the painting while they were storing it for the customer. The newspaper quotes a source as saying that the gallery initially said it was having trouble locating the painting and asked the customer whether he had a picture of the artwork to help them trace it. He did not have an image – but weeks later he was informed it had been found in Envie d’art’s Paris gallery. Once it had been picked up in London, the customer spotted differences and asked if the artist had carried out any extra work on the painting. After being told this had not happened, he took his purchase home, only to find that the artist’s signature was dated three years after he bought it. The Evening Standard quotes the source as saying that the customer eventually found an email picture of his original and saw that he had been given a ‘rather ugly copy’. The source said the gallery manager had ‘panicked’ when the customer asked for his painting back and ordered a new commission that was ‘in the spirit’ of the original ‘for a new client’. After being threatened with legal action, the gallery eventually admitted its error.

He said: ‘She really thought at the beginning he would be happy with the new painting and she lied instead of telling the truth.’ He said he had apologised for her ‘huge mistake’ and offered compensation. The newspaper said Ms Hassler ‘did not contradict’ Mr Bombard’s description of what had happened but said she had nothing more to add.

"Dads struggling to find clean and safe places to change their youngsters' nappies are advocating to have baby change tables put into male public toilets. Sparked by a number of fathers' groups in Melbourne, Victoria, the aim of the campaign is to have more accessible areas for male parents to change nappies. Most baby change tables are found in the female bathrooms. The debate comes just weeks after Ashton Kutcher posted on Facebook about his struggle to find anywhere with men's baby changing facilities in the US. Australians dads, such as Jason Cranage, 39, pictured here with daughter Bella, 2, are campaigning to have baby change tables put into male restrooms . George Kanjere, 31, is the primary carer for his nine-month-old daughter Ottalie and said he struggles to find public facilities where he can change her . 'I don’t see any negative to it; it’s just about creating an opportunity in an ever changing society,' Jason Cranage, founder of Dads of Newport and Surrounds (DONS) told Daily Mail Australia. 'People within our dads group have voiced their opinion that there’d be no down side to it,' he continued. Mr Cranage, father to Andy, 8, Paul, 6, and Bella, 2, said as his kids have grown up he has struggled to find places to change them, and had to settle for some less than ideal locations. 'Anywhere from the backs of cars to under trees, anywhere you can create a soft environment,' the 39-year-old said. 'Re-configuring the inside of your car, or even laying down the front seat. 'I've had to take my jumper off and use it as a pillow,' Mr Cranage revealed. Mr Cranage, father to Andy, 8, Paul, 6, and Bella, 2, said as his kids have grown up he has struggled to find places to change them. Also pictured is his wife Lucy (right) Earlier this month American actor Ashton Kutcher took to social media to vent his frustrations about the lack of male-friendly facilities . 'I've had to take my jumper off and use it as a pillow,' Mr Cranage revealed, speaking of difficulties he's faced trying to find a place to change his kids' nappies . He said he and other dads within the group, based in Melbourne's south-west, have struggled with the issue for some time, which is even more prevalent for fathers who are primary carers. 'I don’t think men would feel that comfortable going into a female toilet to change a baby’s nappy,' Mr Cranage said. The father-of-three said they would like to see businesses get on board and install something as simple as a plastic change tray like the ones installed in most female restrooms. George Kanjere, a member of Northern Dads Group, also in Victoria, is the primary carer for his nine-month-old daughter Ottalie. Mr Kanjere said it is difficult when his daughter Ottalie needs changing when they're our in public, and often changes her in the park or on a bench . He said there needs to be more accessible facilities for dads everywhere . He said the lack of facilities has been a problem since his daughter was born, but has become more prevalent in recent months after his partner went back to work. 'It’s been an issue the whole time, but more recently it’s become an issue when I became the primary carer,' Mr Kanjere told Daily Mail Australia. The 31-year-old, from Prestons north of Melbourne, said he makes sure he is always fully equipped when he leaves the house, but was most surprised when he discovered his university didn't seem to have a family room. He said that it was not only difficult for him, but unpleasant for those around him should he need to change Ottalie in public. Mr Kanjere also said other dads he knew were forced to change their children's nappies on the floor of the men's toilets because they had no other choice . Mr Kanjere also said other dads he knew were forced to change their children's nappies on the floor of the men's toilets because they had no other choice. 'I don't really think it’s that expensive to install one of those change tables that screw into the wall. '(And) I don’t want to go into the women’s bathroom because that’s the women’s space,' the dad added. Both men agreed that the shift needed to be made to keep up with changing roles of men and women in society, and the implementation of the change tables had no negatives. 'I think this could benefit everyone,' Mr Kanjere said, adding that while some places had family and parents' rooms, there were not nearly enough available. 'It’s all just about creating new opportunities,' Mr Cranage said.","Dads are advocating to have baby change tablets in male restrooms .

"The horrifying moment a drunk driver slammed head-on into a car was caught on video. Sam Salas left a bar in DeKlab, Illinois and was so intoxicated that patrons of the bar tried to stop him, something he allegedly ignored. And so one of those patrons, Ryan Taylor, decided to shoot cell phone video should anything happen as Salas, 43, and the woman he was with drove away.

"Prince Andrew’s chances of appearing in a US court over ‘sex slave’ allegations receded last night, after authorities mounted a legal challenge against the woman who claims she slept with him. Prosecutors have asked a judge in Florida to reject Virginia Roberts’s plea to join a seven-year legal battle being waged by two other women. They are suing the US Government over the lenient treatment of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, jailed for 18 months in 2008. Virginia Roberts photographed with Prince Andrew in early 2001. The chances of the Prince having to appear in court over her allegation she was forced to sleep with him look to be receding . The women, identified as ‘Jane Does 1 and 2’, claim their rights as victims were breached when they were not consulted over a controversial deal signed by prosecutors with billionaire Epstein, which granted him and others immunity from prosecution over dozens of cases of underage sexual abuse. In return, Epstein, 62, a former friend of the Prince, pledged to pay compensation to his victims. In the new filing at Palm Beach County Court, prosecutors say Roberts was happy to receive an out-of-court settlement from Epstein, knowing the non-prosecution agreement had been signed. If the US authorities win the case, Andrew will be spared having to give evidence or make a witness statement. It will also mean Roberts, 32 will no longer be able to repeat any of her claims without fear of being sued. Legal experts said prosecutors had a strong case and believe it is likely a judge will side with them. US lawyer Charles Hayes said: ‘The government just have to prove Roberts was aware of the [immunity] agreement and a judge will favour them. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly kept Virginia Roberts as a 'sex slave' 'There has to be a very good reason to allow another party to join a long-running legal action and I don’t see one here.’ The Prince was named in papers filed by Roberts earlier this year. She identified him as one of the men she was forced to sleep with while being kept as a ‘sex slave’ by Epstein. She also claimed that Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell, and Epstein’s girlfriend, recruited her into the financier’s employment as a ‘masseuse’. Roberts said she was ‘loaned’ to Epstein’s wealthy friends after being groomed over a number of years by him. Roberts claimed she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions, including taking part in an orgy on Epstein’s private Caribbean island. Andrew has strenuously denied any sexual relationship with Roberts, who was 17 when they met. Ms Maxwell has also denied any wrongdoing. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

"James Bond may like his Martini shaken, not stirred, but the fictional spy hasn't had  to contend with zero gravity when sipping his favourite tipple. Making cocktails in space is a difficult business, but now there’s a specially designed ‘glass’ in the pipeline that promises to force liquid to stay put. Grooves in the 3D printed vessel will let astronauts enjoy the aroma of a beverage and keep the fluid in place so they can drink in a way they are used to on Earth. Scroll down for videos . A Californian company has designed a martini glass (pictured alongside a cup) intended for zero gravity that has ridges to ensure liquid stays inside it and can be sipped by an astronaut . A company called Cosmic Lifestyle Corp (CLC) in Oakland, California came up with the design - which is a work in progress - to solve the problem of drinking in space. Nasa once developed ‘parabolic sherry’ and astronauts have been known to have a swig of vodka, but drinking from a conventional glass is difficult. This is because liquid becomes sticky and clumps together in blobs in zero gravity. If a glob of water is broken, for example, it splits into many smaller blobs that scatter everywhere and are hard to clean up. To solve this problem, liquid is typically kept in bags with attachment for straws, but while this is practical, it’s not an elegant solution and means astronauts can’t smell the liquid, which is naturally less pungent and tasteless in zero gravity. The start-up chose to 3D print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly – with each design taking around 15 hours to print. Because there is already a printer on the ISS, the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away, without the need to transport the delicate vessels. Image shows early versions . In the 1979 film, Moonraker, James Bond, played by Roger Moore (a poster is shown), has a space adventure but doesn't attempt to drink his signature martini in space . The first step is drop the glass inside a 102ft-tall lift at Portland State University, to produce two seconds of weightlessness, so that the durability of the glass and how different fluids react, can be tested. Experts will use a high speed camera to look at what is happening and refine the design. Researchers will then conduct live tests with humans on a parabolic aircraft or ‘vomit comet’. One unofficial test has already taken place. The ultimate goal is to 3D print a ‘glass’ on the ISS. ‘The Zero Gravity Cocktail Project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment,’ the company said. ‘We are creating an open air drinking container that allows you to enjoy the aroma of the drink, yet keep the fluids under control. ‘Your mouth completes the connection like a straw and you can suck the drink into your mouth.’ The ‘glass,’ which is said to ‘combine the beauty of a classic martini glass with the physics of space science’ has grooves that force liquid to flow towards the drinker’s mouth, in one direction. The start-up chose to 3D print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly – with each design taking around 15 hours to print. Because there is already a printer on the International Space Station (ISS), the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away, without the need to transport the delicate vessels. ‘The Zero Gravity Cocktail Project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment,’ the company said. It hopes that products including the glass could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists in the future . Researchers at the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science at Portland State University recently unveiled a zero gravity espresso cup, which has a series of channels to simulate pouring. 'Its geometry is the 'smart' part, which provides the fluids-control system without requiring pumps or centrifugal forces,' said Drew Wollman, who developed the system. 'The shape of the container can passively drive fluids to desired locations without moving parts—exploiting the passive forces of wetting and surface tension.' Researchers at the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science at Portland State University recently unveiled a zero gravity espresso cup (pictured), which has a series of channels to simulate pouring . The new design makes possible the enjoyment of espresso and other drinks in the low-gravity environments of spacecraft. Without the pull of gravity, fluids behave very differently than on Earth. Instead of 'pouring,' a liquid retains a more globular shape held together by its own surface tension. This phenomenon complicates even the most basic of maneuvers such as drinking a cup of coffee. Drinks have typically bee consumed in plastic pouches in space. This image shows a pouch of coffee attached to the ISS' new espresso machine . The 3D-printed espresso cup is designed to cheat low-gravity by channeling liquid along a specifically-calculated contour in the vessel to exploit capillary forces that simulate the action of pouring. Experiments related to the development of the zero-gravity cups have been officially dubbed the Capillary Beverage Experiment by Nasa. Related tests to be performed onboard ISS this year include simple drinks such as clear juices, to complex drinks such as cocoa and peach mango smoothies. Last year one Italian astronaut took an ISSpresso machine with her to perk up the crew. It’s one of several projects planned by the group who envisage its lifestyle products could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists. ‘We are hoping to inspire the idea of a future when space hotels are in orbit and settlements are on other planets that people can relax and enjoy the experience of a quality drink, no matter what the gravity,’ the company said. It has created a Kickstarter campaign to continue developing the cup and raise $30,000 (£20,000) to eventually print it on the ISS. ‘This campaign will help us test the glass in real weightless environments, which is very difficult to simulate on Earth,’ CLC said. There have been many attempts to create cups capable of drinking liquids normally in space. Here, astronaut Greg Olsen uses a hose to blast droplets of water into his mouth . The 'glass' can be pre-ordered from the crowd funding website for $400 (£263) and $500 (£329) for a colourful version, and is due to ship in February next year. Earlier this year, researchers revealed a 3D printed design that will let astronauts sip coffee from a strangely-shaped cup. It too uses a series of channels to simulate the pouring needed to create the perfect drink. While a martini glass may be useful, arguably champagne and carbonated drinks remain the final frontier in space drinks because bubbles aren't buoyant in zero gravity conditions as they are on Earth and so behave in a strange way. They remain randomly distributed throughout a fluid – even after someone has swallowed them and small bubbles can join up to make large ones, resulting in digestion problems.","Zero Gravity Cocktail Project in California is developing the 'glass'

"Remembered in history by some as a murderous tyrant, few people may want to be related to Richard III. But the historian who confirmed the identity of the old king’s remains when they were discovered in a Leicester car park has found a direct link between the former Plantagenet monarch and English actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Professor Kevin Schürer said that the pair are second cousins, 16 times removed. Scroll down for video . Actor Benedict Cumberbatch (shown) is as closely related to Richard III as the Queen, a genealogist has claimed. Professor Kevin Schürer - the historian who confirmed the identity of the old king’s remains when they were discovered in a Leicester car park - said that the pair are second cousins, 16 times removed . The actor will play Richard III in a forth-coming television programme and it's not the first time the actor's ancestry has revealed surprising parallels with his roles, as genealogists claimed he was related to codebreaker Alan Turing, who he played in 'The Imitation Game'. It has been estimated that between one million and 17 million people in the UK are related in some way related to the former Plantagenet monarch, although not as closely as Cumberbatch. Professor Schürer said: ‘Benedict is Richard III’s second cousin, 16 removed. ‘He is linked in several ways, but in terms of number of generations, the shortest is via Richard’s mother, Cecily Neville’s grandmother Joan Beaufort. A family tree showing how the actor and former Plantagenet monarch are related is pictured. Professor Schürer first announced a link between the actor and the late king earlier this year, but at the time said that they were third cousins. He has since revised this . It has been estimated that between one million and 17 million people in the UK are in some way related to Richard III (illustrated left), although not as closely as Mr Cumberbatch (pictured right) Tomorrow, Richard III's coffin, containing his mortal remains, will be lowered into a specially made tomb of Swaledale stone in Leicester Cathedral. The historic moment will be witnessed by the Countess of Wessex, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, presiding. Benedict Cumberbatch will read a poem called 'Richard' written by Carol Ann Duffy. It is reported the Queen has written a tribute in the order of service acknowledging Richard’s role in British history. Last Sunday, thousands of people watched a procession of the king's coffin through Leicester city centre. ‘He also has more indirect links to both Queen Elizabeth II and Lady Jane Grey through other ancestors in his tree.’ Professor Schürer first announced a link between the actor and the late king earlier this year, but at the time said that they were third cousins. He has since revised this. Oscar-nominated Cumberbatch will take part in Thursday’s service of reinterment of King Richard III at Leicester Cathedral. He will read a specially commissioned poem entitled ‘Richard’, by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. The 38-year-old Sherlock actor will additionally star as the English king in BBC's The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses, an adaptation of four of Shakespeare's historical plays. Cumberbatch family genealogist, Bob Cumberbatch, said: 'Personally, I think it's fabulous. 'My colleague Andrew Millard estimates that there is a probability greater than 99 per cent that a modern English person is descended from Edward III.' However, he added that finding documentary evidence of this connection is a completely different matter. The 38-year-old Sherlock actor will star as the English king in BBC's The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses, an adaptation of four of Shakespeare's historical plays, a shot is shown . 'Miriam Silverman, of Ancestry UK, discovered a connection between Cumberbatch and Alan Turing and now the Leicester team have extended this to reveal a connection to Richard III. 'If Andrew Millard's conclusions are right then it seems highly probable that Benedict may indeed be related to many characters he has played and will play in future with some exceptions such as Sherlock.' Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 - ending the Wars of the Roses and the Plantagenet dynasty. His body was taken to Leicester by supporters of the victorious Henry VII and buried in Greyfriars church. In February 2013 a skeleton discovered beneath a Leicester car park was confirmed as that of the English king. Mr Cumberbatch is believed to be as closely related to Richard III (right) as the Queen, Professor Schürer said . On Sunday, 35,000 people lined the route of a procession high in symbolism through the Leicestershire countryside taking Richard back to near the spot where he fell at Bosworth field, where prayers were said for all the dead of that battle. Later, he was carried through the city centre on a horse-drawn gun carriage before being borne inside the cathedral where he was welcomed as 'our brother, Richard' by Bishop of Leicester, the Rt Rev Tim Stevens. The cathedral has said the week of ceremony offers the king the 'dignity and honour' he was denied immediately after his death. Members of the public are able to view the monarch's coffin (pictured) until his reburial tomorrow, at a mass which will be led by Justin Welby . In 2012, the University of Leicester in collaboration with the Richard III Society and Leicester City Council, began searching for the king's body. The excavation uncovered not only the friary of Grey Friars but also a battle-scarred skeleton (shown) with spinal curvature. It was unveiled as King Richard III in February 2013 . A crown sits on top of Richard III's coffin, as he lies in repose at the cathedral until his formal reburial . Tomorrow, Richard III's coffin, containing his mortal remains, will be lowered into a specially made tomb of Swaledale stone in Leicester Cathedral. It is reported that the Queen has written a tribute in the order of service acknowledging Richard’s role in British history. The historic moment will be witnessed by the Countess of Wessex, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, presiding. The Bishop of Leicester said tomorrow’s service would be 'solemn, but hopeful' and mark the 'extraordinary moment' in English history that Richard’s death on August 22 1485 represented. 'It is a major national and international occasion with a lot of ceremony,' he said. 'The peers from Bosworth families, descendants of those who fought on both sides of the battle, will be here.' 'The coffin will be borne into the sanctuary of the cathedral where it will be committed to the ground, into the vault which has been prepared.' A piece of music has been written for the occasion by the Master of the Queen’s Music Judith Weir, while Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy penned the 14-line poem entitled Richard to be read by Cumberbatch. Tomorrow, Richard III's coffin, containing his mortal remains, will be lowered into a specially made tomb of Swaledale stone in Leicester Cathedral. Thousands of people watched the procession of the former king's coffin (pictured), through the city centre, on Sunday . The spot (circled in red) where archaeologists found the remains of the 15th century monarch . The poem is described as a meditation on the impact of the discovery of Richard’s remains under a council car park in 2012, and the legacy of his story. It includes the line, 'grant me the carving of my name', in reference to carvings on his tomb which read Richard III, together with his symbol, the white boar. Ms Duffy said: 'It is a privilege to be involved, in a small way, in this unique event.' Professor Schurer, who played a key role in identifying Richard's modern day relations, published a paper  showing there was a 99.999 per cent probability that the remains were those of the king. Cumberbatch also shares a common 15th century ancestor, John Beaufort, the Earl of Somerset, with Second World War codebreaker Alan Turing, making them 17th cousins. Mr Turing helped alter the course of the war after he created a machine that allowed the Allies to read secret German messages. The star, who won plaudits for playing a slave owner in 12 Years A Slave last year, is also descended from a long line of slave owners in Barbados. Earlier this year, a New York City commissioner Stacey Cumberbatch, claimed she gained her distinctive surname because her ancestors were owned by the star's fifth great-grandfather on a sugar plantation. Mr Cumberbatch once said his part in another anti-slavery film – Amazing Grace – was a sort of apology' for his ancestry. He also revealed that his mother, the actress Wanda Ventham, once urged him not to use his real surname professionally in case it made him a target for reparation claims by the descendants of slaves. A plastic facial model made from the skull of England's King Richard III . Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared, Rumours claimed the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, although rumours of a withered arm haven't been verfied form the bones found in the Leicester car park last year. Last year scientists discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after finding large numbers of the parasite's eggs in soil taken from Richard III's pelvic region. The find suggests that the king's intestines were infected with roundworm during his life.","Mr Cumberbatch and Richard III are second cousins, 16 times removed .

"Under fire: The British military are not doing enough to stop migratory birds in the Mediterranean being killed by nets or traps, according to a conservation group . The British military are not doing enough to stop migratory birds in the Mediterranean being killed by nets or traps, a conservation group has claimed. More than two million migratory birds were deliberately killed in Cyprus last autumn, according to new data. The birds, which cost 80 euros (£86) for a dozen, are a local delicacy known as ambelopoulia. The illegal activity has now caused a drastic drop in the numbers of blackcaps, robins and songbirds and has been dubbed 'out of control'. A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a partner of Birdlife Cyprus, described the issue as 'trapping on an industrial level'. He said: 'We are hoping that we can begin to get a grip and would like the British base of Dhekelia to help clear the acacia, which trappers plant to lure in birds. 'It is so obvious when it is taking place. It is easy to detect and easy to see where it has been planted. We accept it is a difficult job but we would like to see some commitment to a timetable. 'Unfortunately last year the action the British military took was too late because it was after the trapping season. 'At the moment the Ministry of Defence are arguing with our figures but everybody needs to work together. 'Trapping itself has been illegal since 1974 and it is against the laws and regulations of the base area.' The birds are caught by trappers using netting or limesticks - twigs covered in sticky lime or glue. Nearly ten miles of net supports and more than 6,000 limesticks were discovered between September and October last year, according to Birdlife Cyprus. Nearly ten miles of net supports (above) and more than 6,000 limesticks - twigs covered in glue - were found between September and October last year, according to Birdlife Cyprus . The birds, which cost 80 euros (£86) for a dozen and can be grilled or pickled, are a local delicacy known as ambelopoulia . Trappers, who like to use the area around Dhekelia, also play birdsong through loudspeakers hidden in the bushes to lure more in and throw gravel to force birds towards their nets. Nearly 4,000 poachers are believed to be involved in the autumn trapping season - much higher than in summer because the birds are plumper. Clairie Papazoglou, Birdlife Cyprus' chief, said poaching was a 'serious, persistent and growing problem'. She added that it 'has been the worst year with the highest trapping levels since the start of the monitoring programme in 2002'. The trappers connect MP3 players or CD players to car batteries and speakers hidden in the bushes. They then play birdsong and lure birds into hidden nets . An official checks a huge haul of hundreds of dead birds taken from trappers in Cyprus . Birdlife Cyprus has also called for tougher sentencing but admitted attitudes towards killing and eating migratory birds would have to change to make a difference. Poachers that are caught can currently receive penalties of up to three years in jail and fines as high as 17,000 euros (£12,215). A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: 'We do not accept the report’s unverified claims about loss of bird life during this period, which was based upon data collected from a very short period. 'We are committed to tackling poaching which is why we arrested nearly 50 poachers and seized 450 nets and 286 piece of poaching equipment during the last migration period. When we catch poachers we can fine them €17,000, or send them to prison for up to 3 years. 'We continue to work with local organisations to discuss how we can work as effectively as possible.'","The birds can be sold for 80 euros a dozen to restaurants and cafes .

"Found: Police say they have found missing 10-year-old Malakhi Chijiutomi-Ghosh . A seriously-ill ten-year-old who sparked a huge hunt when he went missing this morning has been found miles from his home. Malakhi Chijiutomi-Ghosh, who suffers from Adrenal Hyperplasia, left his home in Thornton Heath, south London at around 6am this morning. He was this afternoon found by an off-duty police officer in Hertfordshire. A police spokesman said: 'Malakhi Chijiutomi-Ghosh has been found this afternoon by an off duty police officer in Hertfordshire. 'He has been taken to hospital as a precautionary measure.' Earlier today, police urgently appealed for anyone who may have seen the runaway to come forward. His disappearance was said to be completely out of character and his family were 'distraught'. Their worry had been made all the worse by the fact that Malakhi suffers from Adrenal Hyperplasia which requires medication three times per day. A boy matching his description had been seen at a bus stop in Streatham Common at 8am, an hour after CCTV spotted him in Thornton Heath High Street heading towards the railway station. A Scotland Yard spokesman had said earlier today: 'It is vital that he is found so that medication can be administered. Having received no medication today there is a very real chance that he may have already fallen into a coma.' Police officers were seen searching parks in south London before the news came through that he had been found. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (COH) is a genetic condition causing swelling of the adrenal glands. It leads to a decrease in the blood level of cortisol, the stress hormone, and an increase in the levels of other hormones. Scroll down for video . Lacking cortisol means that the body is less able to cope with stress, either emotionally or physically, which can be life threatening. Children with CAH need to have their hormone levels regularly monitored and are prescribed drugs to replacement cortisol and aldosterone, which they take every day for the rest of their lives. CAH affects between one in 10,000 and one in 18,000 children born each year. Hunt: Police searched a park in south London today as the search for the missing 10-year-old was stepped up .

"A bowling alley faces $45,000 in fines after an employee died when his hooded sweatshirt became tangled in a pin-setting machine during repair work. Northwest Lanes in Fairfield, Ohio was cited for eight violations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration following the death of 53-year-old maintenance worker David Geiger in November. Mr Geiger, who was married with children and a grandchild, worked at the bowling alley for 30 years.

Northwest Lanes has requested a conference with the agency after it was slapped with $45,500 in fines. Daily Mail Online was awaiting comment from Northwest Lanes on Tuesday. The bowling alley had no history of workplace violations before Mr Geiger's death. Mr Geiger was pulled into the machine on November 7 around 2pm. Dozens of bowlers were inside the alley at the time but no one saw the accident take place.

"Jack Straw has said 'a lot of white politicians' prefer to keep silent about the segregation of our communities for fear of being dubbed racist. The former Labour home secretary said it was the responsibility of politicians to get such issues out in the open, but said there was a 'polite society' which meant that such issues are not talked about. And Ann Cryer, the former Labour MP for Keighley, said it had been difficult for her to raise the issue of grooming by Asian men in her West Yorkshire constituency 'without being called a racist'. Jack Straw, Labour MP for Blackburn has said 'a lot of white politicians' prefer to keep silent about the segregation of our communities for fear of being dubbed racist . She said friends of hers in the Labour Party had known about the abuse for years, but said nothing about it. The two politicians made their comments on a documentary to be screened on Thursday and presented by Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. It comes days after Mr Philllips said in an article that Britain is silencing debate on race issues by 'intimidating' those who dare to ask questions. He said far too many people felt unable to speak their minds out of a fear they would be branded racist, and that people would have to become 'more ready to offend each other' as the price of free speech. The comments come 10 years after he warned that Britain was 'sleepwalking to segregation' – comments which attracted a welter of criticism. But one politician who did not condemn the comments at the time was Mr Straw, home secretary from 1997 and 2001 and foreign secretary until 2006. The MP for Blackburn, one of Britain's most segregated constituencies, said: 'It is a fact of life that people tend to want to live where people like them live. 'If you got a map I could say the people in that area some from this part of India, the people in that area come from another Indian area but not very far away by the way, and this is a Pakistani area and these people come from here and these people come from there,' he said. Asked Mr Phillips why it is that the UK is not comfortable talking about segregation, Mr Straw said: 'There is a sort of polite society in which people aren't comfortable about talking about this. 'But I think that in politics you have a responsibility to get things out in the open. I am concerned about the effects of people living wholly separate lives of course, but you can't direct where people live.' Ann Cryer, the former Labour MP for Keighley, said it had been difficult for her to raise the issue of grooming by Asian men in her West Yorkshire constituency 'without being called a racist' Mr Phillips then asked him why he thinks there is 'essentially such a silence on these questions'. Mr Straw said: 'I think that a lot of white politicians are nervous about this. They lack confidence about what their views are – and think that somebody will criticise them if they come out with them.' When Mr Phillips suggested: 'Somebody will call them racist?', Mr Straw replied: 'Racist or some nonsense like that.' Mrs Cryer also spoke to the programme about how she felt 'politically inhibited' when she tried to raise the subject of child grooming in her Keighley constituency in 2002. 'It was difficult for me to make these arguments without being called a racist,' she said. 'And I just couldn't interest either Bradford Social Services or West Yorkshire Police, and it was very distressing for me, so the last resort was to go public.' She said the victims of abuse were aged 12 or 13, but neither the mothers or the girls themselves could get any interest from the local police. 'Their mothers knew what was going on, that there was sexual activity with girls who were underage,' she said. 'Not entirely – but nearly always – the gangs are from the Mirpuri Pakistani community. 'These seven women were saying: 'It's not fair, we've told West Yorkshire Police about it. We've told Social Services about it and no one will do anything. 'Totally absurd: I mean, friends of mine in the Labour Party, they'd known about it for years and they never mentioned it to me.'

"An amazing image revealing some mysterious phenomena in a gigantic galaxy-cluster collision has been revealed. In the region, where clusters of hundreds of galaxies are colliding, a rich variety of objects are visible only to radio telescopes. Scientists created a ‘true colour’ image of the region to reveal what it would look like if humans could see radio waves, rather than just visible light. Researchers have released an amazing image of Abell 2566. In the annotated image (move the slider to see the markings), the point sources (examples in red) are galaxies like ours. Blue objects are radio galaxies with streams of plasma, and in green is the 'Large Relic', which could be a shockwave as the clusters collide. Researchers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) made the image using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico. In the image, red colouration shows longer radio waves, moving down to blue, which is composed of shorter radio waves. The region is known as Abell 2256, and is about 800 million light-years from Earth and about four million light-years across. The image covers an area in the sky almost as large as the full moon. In the image, the multiple ‘dots’ that can be seen are ‘normal, everyday galaxies’ as big as the Milky Way, Dr Jean Eilek of the NRAO told MailOnline. A radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous at radio wavelengths. It is usually composed of two jets being expelled from a large elliptical galaxy. Radio galaxies can be detected at large distances, which makes then useful tools in studying the structure of the universe. ‘Star formation in such galaxies is a strong source of radio waves, which come from supernova remnants and cosmic rays that are energised in the star formation regions.’ There is also a handful of objects known as radio galaxies, which each have a massive central black hole that emits jets of plasma. ‘In clusters like this the unusual shapes of the radio galaxies are due to the interaction of those jets with the cluster atmosphere,’ Dr Eilek continued. ‘We don't yet understand just why each of those sources have the shapes they have - we’re still working on that. ‘But these are definitely radio galaxies in the cluster; we think the merger happening in the cluster has something to do with the large number and unusual shapes of these radio galaxies.’ Resarchers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) made the image using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, shown here. The VLA is at an altitude of 6970ft (2125 metres) and consists of 27 independent antennae . Two of these, towards the right-hand side of the image, have long trails with them. This may be due to them speeding very fast through the cluster, with their plasma left behind in a tail. Perhaps the most notable part of the image is, as Dr Eilek calls it, the ‘big fuzzy thing’ to the upper right. This is known as the Large Relic, and it is a million light-years across but its formation is a mystery. ‘One possibility is that this is a huge shockwave, caused when the two clusters ram together supersonically,’ said Dr Eilek. However, she notes that it could also be a ‘reconnection layer’, where magnetic fields are pushed together until they annihilate. This same process is thought to drive solar flares in our sun, and also Earth’s aurorae.","Researchers in New Mexico have released an amazing galactic image .

"An interior designer who was cut out of her mother’s £2.5million will has won a legal fight with her brother to keep her home. Sunita Day, 45, who once dated Sir Terence Conran, was disinherited by her gambling-addict mother Pamela Russell. But a judge ruled yesterday that she was entitled to keep an £800,000 flat she had been given in 1995. Sunita Day, 45, (left) was disinherited by her mother Pamela Russell before her death in 2013 and everything was left to her brother Rajan Russell (right) The court heard that restaurateur Mrs Russell, who died in 2013, underwent a personality change after being diagnosed with cancer. She frittered away much of her fortune in casinos and turned against her daughter. Mrs Russell left her entire estate to Mrs Day’s older brother, investment banker Rajan Russell. He maintained the estate included his sister’s flat in Battersea, South West London. Mrs Day, who made headlines when she was in her 20s for ‘stepping out’ with designer Sir Terence, 38 years her senior, said the flat had been a gift to get her on the property ladder. Before her illness her mother, to whom she had been very close, often showered her with presents, she told Central London County Court. ‘She was always buying me things like mink coats and jewellery – you name it I had it,’ Mrs Day said. ‘I was spoilt... the flat just followed.’ But she said her mother’s gambling addiction turned her into ‘a harridan with a capital H’ and at one point she feared Mrs Russell would have her ‘bumped off’ to get the flat back. Her mother had given her a luxury £800,000 flat in Battersea, south London (pictured) 20 years ago but Mr Russell claimed it was part of his mother's estate . During her final years, her mother had visited casinos every night and even resorted to stealing gambling chips, Mrs Day claimed. She said she lived in fear of her multi-millionaire brother, whom she called ‘bully boy Raj’, and that he was jealous of anything their mother gave her. Mr Russell, 47, denied his sister’s claims. But after a four-day hearing, Judge Marc Dight ruled that Mrs Day was entitled to keep the flat, which had been ‘freely gifted’. He rejected Mr Russell’s claim that she merely held the flat as a trustee and ruled he was entitled to only a £55,000 stake in the property to reflect a mortgage paid off by his mother. Judge Dight also ordered Mr Russell to pay most of his sister’s six-figure legal bill. However he rejected Mrs Day’s claims that she had been put under ‘duress or undue influence’ by her brother and mother. He said Mrs Russell’s personality had changed after her cancer diagnosis in March 2010. In a document she wrote in May 2012 explaining why she had disinherited her daughter, she claimed Mrs Day ‘never came to see me while I had breast cancer and has been very disagreeable all her life since the age of 14. I feel like I have done three life sentences with Sunita’. The judge said: ‘By the end of her life, and certainly from the time she was diagnosed with cancer, Mrs Russell had a deep-rooted and unhealthy gambling habit. ‘She was very unwell. The evidence satisfies me that she was unkind to those around her, including Mrs Day. She was manipulative with her relatives and many of her friends.’ Judge Dight said Mrs Russell had tried to pressure and manipulate her daughter into giving her back the flat but Mrs Day had a ‘feisty’ determination to hold on to the property. Mrs Day (right, outside court this week) 'stepped out' with Sir Terence Conran (left) when she was in her 20s and previously gave an interview to a magazine which 'dealt' with their relationship .","Sunita Day, 45, was disinherited by her mother Pamela Russell in her will .

"This Irish setter, named Jagger, is feared to have been murdered at the Crufts dog competition . The world of dog breeding was rocked by scandal last night amid allegations that a prize-winner at this year's Crufts was deliberately poisoned. In a plot straight from the pages of a detective drama, a breeder claimed her £50,000 Irish setter died after he was fed meat laced with toxins. But she believes the poisoner mistakenly targeted the wrong dog and had intended to kill another of her Irish setters that looks very similar. In what could become the biggest scandal in Crufts' 124-year history, three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died on Friday, the day after coming second in his class at the world's most famous dog show. Tests found that Jagger – pedigree name Thendara Satisfaction – had eaten cubed beef laced with up to three poisons. However co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott believes the intended victim was four-year-old Noodle, pedigree name Thendara Pot Noodle, who won best of breed on the day Jagger competed. The two almost identical looking dogs had switched places on the benches where entrants sit before and after going in the show ring at the NEC in Birmingham. Jagger died in the arms of joint owner Alexandra Lauwers at her home in Belgium. She reported his death to police and animal welfare officials there, and to the Kennel Club, which runs Crufts. CCTV footage from the NEC is being reviewed but West Midlands Police and the RSPCA here have yet to be informed officially. The target? Noodle, pedigree name Thendara Pot Noodle, at Crufts with co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott . There has been controversy over the increasing number of foreign dogs allowed to compete at Crufts, which attracts more than 20,000 entries from 200 breeds. This year's competition ended last night with Knopa, a foreign-owned Scottish terrier, being named best in show. But Jagger's owners say he could have been fed the poisoned meat by a 'random psychopathic dog hater' or a jealous rival breeder. The Kennel Club said it had not heard of such an incident before and promised to assist any police inquiries. Last night Mrs Milligan-Bott, 56, said she had 'done nothing but cry' over Jagger's death. She said: 'We think this is the work of some random psychopathic dog hater who decided to visit Crufts with one thing in mind, rather than any sort of targeted attack.' Mrs Milligan-Bott, who breeds and shows Afghan hounds and Irish setters with her husband Jeremy Bott, 66, said tests showed Jagger had been killed by a 'pesticide-type' poison. She said: 'Some sadistic person out there poisoned our dog. Crufts is a high-profile event and we live in a very anti-dog society.' The holding area where dogs are 'benched' before and after competing is open to the public, although they are asked not to touch the animals. In what could become the biggest scandal in Crufts' 124-year history, three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died on Friday, the day after coming second in his class at the world's most famous dog show . Clare Balding posted a message on Twitter about the incident after it was confirmed that a dog had died . She plans to inform West Midlands Police of the circumstances surrounding Jagger's death when she receives the written toxicology report later this week. Mrs Milligan-Bott said she had heard of rumours of skullduggery involving other breeders at shows but had not come across anything like this in 30 years of competing. 'I don't believe it had anything to do with other competitors,' she said. 'We have had so many calls [from other breeders who were at the show]... everybody has been pulling together and offering support.' She is convinced Jagger was fed poisoned meat when he was on the bench on one of the handful of occasions he was left on his own for up to 15 minutes – the only times he was unattended. She is unsure if that was before or after he entered the show ring. She told Dog World magazine's website that nothing appeared untoward until both dogs returned to her home in Kilsby, Northamptonshire, after competing on the first day of the show on Thursday. 'All the dogs were all running and playing together and Jagger seemed a bit tired, unable to keep up with the others,' she said. 'Three or four hours later, after getting back to Belgium, he collapsed and by the time the vet arrived he was dead. The post-mortem showed that two or three different poisons were used and that it is likely it was administered on Thursday morning. 'We're now waiting for exact toxicology reports. Whoever did this knew what they were doing, trying to get exactly the right type of poison with a slow release.' The animal had won second in his class when he was at Crufts and his owner think he was poisoned there . The dogs had changed places on the bench after one became agitated about being near a bitch in season, it is understood. In another twist, Mrs Milligan-Bott said the best of breed and challenge certificates won by Noodle had mysteriously been taken from the benches at some point. 'And at Richmond last year someone let one of my dogs off its bench and he went missing, before being found on someone else's bench,' she added. 'It's been suggested that someone's really got it in for us, and to not let it get to us. There do seem to be too many coincidences.' Mrs Milligan-Bott, whose setters were named Thendara after her kennels, which has a worldwide reputation for breeding champion show dogs, added: 'It's turning into such a nasty sport. I went back to Crufts on Saturday but I was like a zombie – I just thought, 'I don't want to do this any more'.' A post on her Facebook page outlined the death of 'our beautiful boy' Jagger and warned other competitors not to leave their dogs unattended at Crufts. At her home in Tongeren, near Liege, Mrs Lauwers, 34, a full-time breeder who takes her dogs to see the elderly in residential homes, said: 'They have not only taken away a dog, or merely a pet, they have taken away a family member. 'It should be a hobby and nothing more. To think he may have been poisoned by a rival at a dog show just makes it even harder to take. 'How people can resort to killing a helpless animal from jealousy or hate for a dog in a competition is too much to comprehend. I know people take it seriously but If you want to target me, smash my windows or something – don't go and kill my pet dog. Jagger took part in the competition on Thursday and achieved second place in his class at Crufts . The dog's owners said he appeared to be following the footsteps of 2010 best of breed winner Mr Jingles . Jagger fell ill when he returned to his other owners in Belgium and died before a vet was able to get to him . The title of best in show was won last night by a five-year-old Scottish terrier named Knopa. Bred in the US and owned by Russians, Knopa, who competes under the name McVan's To Russia With Love, was shown by American Rebecca Cross, who said it marked Knopa's retirement as a show dog. Dublin, a flat-coated retriever from Sweden which had won the gundog category, was overall runner-up. The ceremony was temporarily halted when the stage was stormed by a protester waving a sign saying: 'Mutts against Crufts.' 'He could have been targeted for being a foreign dog, there's a lot of ill feeling from some camps towards them for some reason. 'But first and foremost he was our pet and we are absolutely distraught. He died right in front of me in my arms, there was nothing we could do. My little boy is only nine, he is devastated.' Mrs Lauwers took Jagger's body to a clinic. She said they found 'green and black substances inside cubes of beef' in his stomach. 'Jagger loved people and he loved food - he would have just trusted whoever gave it to him,' she said. On her Facebook page, she added: 'To the person who has done it, hope you can sleep well knowing you have killed our love, family member and best friend to our son.' She is due to give a full statement to police today and toxicology reports are due to be completed on Wednesday or Thursday. Jagger cost around £850 as a puppy and won best of breed at the Ladies' Kennel Association show at the NEC in December. Because of his pedigree, success in shows and value as a stud dog, he could have commanded a price of up to £50,000, experts said. Jagger was not insured for any particular sum of money, however, only by normal pet insurance which covers vets' fees. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: 'The Kennel Club is deeply shocked and saddened to hear that Jagger the Irish setter died some 26 hours after leaving Crufts. 'We have spoken to his owners and our heartfelt sympathies go out to them. We understand that the toxicology report is due next week and until that time we cannot know the cause of this tragic incident.' Jagger was the son of Mr Jingles, the dog which won Crufts Best in Breed 2010 .","Irish setter competed in Crufts on Thursday and came second in class .

"A spaghetti bolognese dinner between two flatmates turned nasty when one drunkenly attacked the other with a meat cleaver. Peter McKay, 35, had been living with Leslie Bidgood for around six months in Sheppey, Kent, when he savagely attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner. Both men had been drinking vodka and McKay was also taking sedatives when he struck his friend of four years with the meat cleaver, causing injuries to his head and neck and leaving him 'lucky to be alive'. Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) heard Peter McKay had been living with Leslie Bidgood for around six months in Sheppey, Kent, when he attacked his friend while chopping ingredients for their dinner . Mr Bidgood, who was watching television when the attack took place on September 18 last year, managed to run from the flat covered in blood. But he was pursued by McKay, who held him up against a fence and shouted: 'What's my name?' before punching him in the head. McKay also threatened witnesses who tried to help the victim. The men had previously downed several vodka red bulls each and McKay was also taking sedative tablets. Maidstone Crown Court heard McKay emerged from the kitchen 'growling' before attacking Mr Bidgood. Mark Mullins, prosecuting, said: 'He went up to Mr Bidgood and started hitting him around the neck and head. 'Mr Bidgood saw blood on his hands. He felt it dripping down from his face.' 'He tried to push him away. He said: ""We are mates. We are both on the same side"". Mr McKay didn't stop. He just kept growling.' McKay had been preparing a spaghetti bolognese for their dinner when he turned on his flatmate . 'The victim could not remember anything else until he woke up in hospital with cuts to his neck, behind his left ear and above his left eye, which needed stitches.' Mr Mullins told the jury the 'very nasty attack' could have had much more serious consequences. McKay claimed he was intoxicated due to the consumption of the tablets and alcohol which led to a state of 'automatism'. But Mr Mullins said: 'The prosecution say it was a voluntary act on his part. 'This is not a case of someone who suddenly lost their inhibitions and didn't know what he was doing. 'When he stabbed him he intended to cause him grievous bodily harm. Someone who stabs someone multiple times with a meat cleaver intends to do someone really serious harm.' Giving evidence Mr Bidgood told the court he got on well with McKay, there were no issues between the pair and they would often enjoy watching television and playing video games together. He said: 'Even on medication, he was always happy. 'We were together all day. We went to the shop to get some drink and some mince for spaghetti bolognese. 'I don't remember how much we had to drink before we went. I think I had a couple of vodkas and Red Bull. When we got back I went onto my tablet and played a game. 'He did the same. We had a chat and a laugh. I don't know how much we had to drink. He was pouring them. I would say a fair bit. I am not really a drinker. 'He was in the kitchen preparing dinner. I could hear him cutting up onion. He was popping in and out and chatting. There was nothing to indicate all was not well with his mind. 'I remember him coming in and saying ""It's all your fault"". 'I tried to calm him down and told him we are mates. He was holding a meat cleaver. 'I got up and said: ""What's going on"". I just don't remember much. It is blurred. I don't remember being attacked, but I know I was. 'All I know is I wanted to get out of the flat. I don't remember going downstairs. I know I felt it. I don't remember him hitting me. I just came round at the hospital.' Mr Bidford needed three stitches by his Adam's apple, seven on the side of his head and butterfly stitches on his eye. 'They have all healed up,' he added. 'There is a little scar.' McKay denied causing grievous bodily harm but was found guilty by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court and will be sentenced on April 27. Detective Constable Mark Silk from Kent Police said: 'There is no doubt a substantial amount of alcohol, combined with a number of sedative pills proved to be a potent cocktail and played a part in McKay's state of mind that night. 'However, that should in no way be used as an excuse. He was fully conscious and had in his possession a lethal weapon and using it meant he fully intended to cause harm. 'It must have been a terrifying shock and ordeal to have seen someone change in that way and see them attacking you. 'In fact, the victim was incredibly lucky the attack was not fatal. 'I am pleased the jury were able to see the seriousness of the offence and convict him on the comprehensive evidence put before them.'","Peter McKay, 35, attacked his flatmate Leslie Bidgood with a meat cleaver .

"The flamboyant floral designer whose sudden departure from the White House is blooming into a political intrigue is pictured for the first time - as supporters blamed 'jealous' rivals for her abrupt exit. Laura Dowling spent six years as the Obama administration's chief florist before quitting last month amid rumors of a rift with the First Lady. Her departure only became public six weeks later after a Washington Post gossip column claimed that the 55-year-old was 'escorted from the building' after her employment ended without notice. Mrs Obama's office released a belated statement praising the designer's 'lively and colorful' arrangements - while high-powered lawyers hired by Ms Dowling insisted she had resigned to take on 'exciting new opportunities'. The French-trained artisan, pictured outside her Alexandria, Virginia home in a patterned peach raincoat, matching tote, floppy hat and pink trousers, has refused to comment further. Scroll down for video . Out: Laura Dowling, seen for the first time since she was marched out of the White House by security. She had been chief florist to the Obamas for six years . Upset: Friends said that 'jealousy' was at the bottom of her sudden enforced departure from the East Wing . Inner circle: As florist, Laura Dowling (right) was close to Michelle Obama, who is in charge of the East Wing . However sources close to Ms Dowling suggested she was upset at having to leave and blamed her demise on the intense rivalry that exists within the small coterie of decorators and designers that serve the White House. 'She is very sad about leaving the White House,' the source told Daily Mail Online, on condition of anonymity. 'She was very proud to work there and this has come as a shock. It's all about jealousy - Laura has not put a foot wrong. 'She was very hardworking and she has always been professional and passionate about her work. She and her husband have said they can't talk about it now. 'But they've said that when the time comes they will reveal what really happened.' Ms Dowling's muted departure was in stark contrast to tributes afforded to other departing White House fixtures such as the Obamas' personal chef, Sam Kass, who was praised for his 'extraordinary legacy' when he left last December. Her celebrated predecessor, Nancy Clarke, lasted more than 30 years as chief florist, serving six presidential administrations. Ms Dowling took over the top job in 2009 after competing against several leading designers to create a lavish arrangement for a mock state dinner. She described her style as 'new floral aesthetic' with a 'chic look of elegance' inspired by woods, meadows, forests and gardens. Her website promises arrangements that transcend 'fads and trends', however rival florists who continue to provide bouquets to the White House told The Washington Post her 'fussy style' fell out of favor with Mrs Obama. Francophile: When Dowling was first appointed she was highly regarded for her organic and less formal 'French look'. Her arrangements were found in the formal parts of the White House . Modern and clean aesthetic: Just days before Dowling's departure, the Old Family Dining Room at the White House had been re-opened after being refurbished by the first lady to showcase modern art and design . They pointed to the recent refurbishment of the White House Family Dining room, which includes abstract paintings and a 1950s-inspired carpet, as an illustration of how the First Lady's tastes have moved on. Ms Dowling is said to have resigned on February 13 - just days after the 'thoroughly modernized' room was unveiled. She was escorted from the White House by security, sources said. It wasn't until six weeks later that Mrs Obama's office issued an official statement to say: 'As chief florist, Laura Dowling and her team treated guests of the White House to their beautiful floral arrangements. 'Ms Dowling's creations were always lively and colorful, reflecting not only the season but the unique and historic rooms which they graced. 'No two arrangements were ever the same and each one left guests with a lasting impression of the elegance and history of the People's House. 'We are grateful for her contribution over the years and wish her well.' The first lady's office released a statement on Tuesday which praised the work of florist Laura Dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before . Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations at the White House for six years, is now spending time at home in Alexandria, Virginia (right) and has retained lawyers. Within an hour of the First Lady's official confirmation, Ms Dowling release a statement about her sudden departure through heavyweight law firm Sidley Austin, immediately igniting rumors of an impeding legal action. 'After almost six years as Chief Floral Designer at the White House, I have resigned in order to pursue exciting new opportunities and explore my passion for floral artistry and design,' she said. 'Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author, speaker, instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships I've formed during my tenure there. 'It's been such an honor to work at the White House and I will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity.' Ms Dowling and her husband Robert Weinhagen, 70, live just outside Washington D.C. in Alexandria's wealthy Old Town neighborhood. Asked if he could elaborate on his wife's sudden departure from the White House, Mr Weinhagen said on the steps of their smart $900,000 townhouse: 'No, not really'. A neighbor told Daily Mail Online: 'I certainly had not heard that she was sacked or escorted from the premises until it came out in the newspaper. 'They are quite private but they are really nice people. They have a very nice garden, obviously.'","Laura Dowling was head florist for the Obamas until last month when she was taken out of the East Wing by security .

"The British Museum has once again topped the pile when it comes to the UK's most popular tourist attractions. Based on data collected by Visit England, this handy infographic shows the top 50 places to visit; whether it's stunning countryside, historic sites or man-made attractions. And the list is far from dominated by locations in London; featured among other is the Eden Project in Cornwall, Flamingo Land in Yorkshire, and of course Stonehenge. The British Museum recorded just over 6.7 million visitors in 2013, and with just over 6 million visits, it was fellow London attraction the National Gallery that was the second most popular. In fact nine of the top ten sites were in the capital. Brighton Pier in sixth spot with 4 million visitors was the sole entry from outside London. Scott Fairhurst, director of Perfect Stays, who designed the infographic, told MailOnline Travel: 'It comes as no surprise that London's great museums and galleries are so popular with visitors. 'However, it's great to see other regional institutions - Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry and Cornwall's world-famous Eden Project to name a few - also making the list.

"A two-year-old boy with a condition so rare that doctors have never seen it before has celebrated Christmas three months late after being too ill to mark the festive period. Milo Browne suffers from a condition that is so unique there is no diagnosis and he spent Christmas in the Great North Children's Hospital at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary fighting for his life. However, the family were determined to wait until Milo was home before they celebrated Christmas, meaning presents have remained unopened and the decorations have stayed up. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Milo Browne, laughs as he finally welcomes Santa Claus to his home, three months late after being too ill to mark the festive period . Milo's family including his parents Stephen and Laura and older siblings Mia and Felix, left their presents unopened until he was home to open them with them . But after finally being allowed to go home, the family from North Shields in North Tyneside have now celebrated by opening presents and even welcoming Santa Claus to their home, even thought it is March. Milo along with his siblings Mia, 7 and Felix, 3 unwrapped a whole host of presents yesterday including Frozen toys for Mia, cars and tractors for Felix and sensory toys for Milo. Milo's father Stephen, 29, said: 'I have had to give up my job to become a full time carer for Milo but it's days like this that make it worthwhile. 'Santa made the day even more special and the kids were all in awe that he knew so much about them. 'Milo is home for now but we have to take him back to the hospital in six weeks time. Milo suffers from a condition that is so unique there is no diagnosis and he spent Christmas in the Great North Children's Hospital at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary fighting for his life . His father Stephen, left, has had to give up his job to become a full-time carer for his son who has problems including vision delay and severe development delay . 'It's a constant waiting game and with no one knowing what it is that's wrong with him it's even harder to deal with.' Doctors had previously only gave Milo a few hours to live after he fell ill last year. But the toddler was determined to prove them wrong and since then he has continued to baffle doctors across the country. His rare condition means he has vision delay and severe development delay. He also has to be fed directly through his stomach via a machine, his arms and legs are stiffer than normal and his co-ordination is poor. The two-year-old also suffers from central hypotonia which leaves him unable to hold his weight. Milo pictured in hospital in Newcastle over Christmas. The family have set up a website to raise funds for his treatment and equipment . But despite all this, his parents couldn't be prouder of their youngest son. Mother Laura Davidson, 30, said: 'Milo lights up every room. 'He is such a happy boy and is always smiling despite what he's going through.' The family have set up a website to raise funds for Milo's treatment and equipment and have built a huge support network up of people inspired by their son. Mr Browne added: 'For a child that was expected to live only a few hours he has showed determination not to give up. 'We take everyday as a blessing. We aren't naïve, we know Milo will not always be here but we will make sure Milo will live on long after all of us are gone.'","Toddler Milo Browne's condition is so rare that there is no diagnosis for it .

"A gunman killed one person and wounded five others on Wednesday in a rampage that included a motel shooting, a carjacking and a home invasion and ended with his arrest at a nearby apartment in suburban Phoenix. The suspect was taken into custody after officers spotted him on an apartment balcony and shocked him with a stun gun. Numerous officers led the handcuffed man to a truck parked outside an apartment complex. Police later identified the man as Ryan Giroux, a 41-year-old ex-convict who has served three stints in state prison since 1994. Scroll down for video . Ryan E. Giroux, the suspect in a Mesa mass shooting that left one person dead, is a former Arizona Department of Corrections inmate with a history of police assaults and illegal drug use. His latest mug shot, right, shows that he has had some of his white supremacist tatoos removed compared to a previous photo, left . Caught: Police are seen leading the suspect in the Mesa, Arizona, shooting spree dressed in a white hazmat suit  (left and right) Giroux served prison terms totaling more than eight years for burglary, theft, attempted aggravated assault and a marijuana violation, the Arizona Department of Corrections said. He was first incarcerated in 1994 and returned to prison in late 1995 before being released about a year later. He then returned to prison in mid-2007 before being released in late 2013. Last year, a Maricopa County Superior Court judge allowed Giroux to remain on probation despite an unspecified probation violation. Giroux is a member of Hammerskin Nation, a notoriously violent racist skinhead group, and an associate of the Aryan Brotherhood, a national prison gang, reports ABC7. Although his latest mugshot shows that some of his tattoos have been removed, an earlier police photo shows him with the words 'SKIN' and 'HEAD' where his shaven eyebrows used to be. His left temple also featured the number '88,' which is neo-Nazi code for Heil Hitler (because H is the eighth letter of the alphabet). His chin also featured a Celtic cross, which for white supremacists represents the white race. Crime spree: A police officer keeps watch outside a room at the Tri-City Inn, the first scene of a multiple-location shooting in Mesa that left one dead and five others wounded . Active shooter: Heavily armed SWAT officers scoured the Phoenix suburb of Mesa searching for the gunman . Hammerskin Nation is the same hate group that Wade Page joined prior to his attack on a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis. Page killed six people during an assault on the temple near Milwaukee that occurred in August 2012. According to a May 2014 probation officer report, 'by the defendant's own admission, he has the propensity to become violent when he is either intoxicated or use illegal drugs.' The report also noted that Giroux's mental health 'appears to be stable until he uses methamphetamine.' The probation officer wrote that Giroux 'wants to change his life around.' He had begun to have tattoos removed from his face and hands, reports AZCentral. Police said Wednesday's shootings started with an argument inside a motel room that spilled outside, leaving one man dead and two women wounded, Mesa police Detective Esteban Flores said. The gunman then shot a man working at a nearby restaurant. The adult student at the nearby East Valley Institute of Technology was able to run across the street to emergency responders already at the motel, Flores said. The school said in a statement that the victim was one of seven students and an instructor working at Bistro 13 restaurant. The student was treated at a hospital and released. The gunman got away by carjacking the instructor's car. Police say the man then went to an apartment complex about two miles away, where he entered an apartment and shot a man. That victim will survive, police said. A police officer found another man in a neighboring apartment building with multiple gunshot wounds, Flores said. He was listed in critical condition.

The shootings prompted an intense hunt for the gunman as Mesa police searched the trunks of cars, interviewed witnesses and brought in SWAT and canine units from other agencies. Flores warned people in the neighborhood to remain indoors. Several buildings in the area were placed on lockdown amid a heavy law enforcement presence. The Arizona Department of Public Safety sent its SWAT team to Mesa to assist with the effort, DPS spokesman Bart Graves said. Scottsdale police also sent SWAT and canine units. East Valley Institute of Technology officials said the school went into lockdown as soon as gunshots were heard. The lockdown lasted more than an hour, according to students. Afternoon classes convened but were made optional. A nearby Mesa Community College campus issued an emergency alert, saying it was on lockdown and anyone there should proceed to the safest location. The campus remained closed on Wednesday.

Dee, from Birmingham, said she won't throw her hat into the political ring just yet as she wants to wait for a time when she will be voted for based on her policies and not her celebrity status. She said: 'It's something I want to do because I'm passionate it about it and if my policies are good. I want to get in because of my policies, not because I'm topical.' She told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden she would be a good candidate to represent constituents because she has the 'right ideas' and 'feel for what real people are like'.

She said: 'It's a touchy subject, I have always said you have people who are happy on benefits and that's why hard workers get annoyed but for others, it's not a choice, it's where they are at that particular time. 'People still tell me to get a job.' Dee admitted despite now having an income, she's not sure what her job title is.

She said losing weight has made her feel happier and healthier so she wants to share the secret to her success with others. Dee pictured on Channel 4's Benefits Street.

'For my children, it's nice for them to see their mum feeling better in themselves, then you can give more to your children.' She admitted that her swift rise to fame has been 'surreal'. 'I still describe life as unreal,' she said. 'I still walk the same streets, I have the same friends and my children are at same schools but I am stopped all the time, it's surreal.

"A talented Chinese lawyer who was banned from working in California because of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act has been finally granted a license, 89 years after his death. 'It was also a blow to countless others who, like Chang, aspired to become a lawyer only to have their dream deferred on account of their race, alienage, or nationality,' the unanimous court decision reads. 'It is past time to acknowledge that the discriminatory exclusion of Chang from the State Bar of California was a grievous wrong.' Struggle: Hong Yen Chang, from  Guangdong Province, China, travelled to the U.S. in 1872 when he was 12 years old. He studied law at Colombia, graduating in 1886 with 'high markings from the examiners'. But he was banned from practising in California as he was 'a person of Mongolian nativity' Defiant: In later life, Hong served as a banker and a diplomat, and was awarded a doctorate of law by the Chinese government. But he was never granted a license to practise law in California . Hong Yen Chang, from Xiangshan, Guangdong Province, was chosen to travel to the U.S. in 1872 when he was 12 years old, as part of a Chinese Educational Mission. He studied law at Yale and Colombia, from where he graduated in 1886 with 'high markings from the examiners'. However, for the rest of his life he faced a struggle to practise law, as under 19th Century legislation 'a person of Mongolian nativity' would not be accepted to the bar. In 1888, after long deliberations, New York State passed An Act for the Relief of Hong Yen Chang, which waived the Chinese Exclusion Act in the state, allowing him to receive a license to practise law in New York. But the Californian authorities said that they did not recognise the New York ruling, leaving Hong unable to work there. On Monday, the California Supreme Court granted a . posthumous law license to Hong, known as America's first Chinese-born lawyer. This came in response to petitions made by Hong's descendants, as well as the Asian Pacific American Law Students . Association (APALSA) at the University of California. 'Even if we cannot undo history, we can acknowledge it and, . in so doing, accord a full measure of recognition to Chang's . pathbreaking efforts to become the first lawyer of Chinese . descent in the United States,' the court said in its unanimous . ruling. 'More than a century later, the legal and policy . underpinnings of our 1890 decision have been discredited.' The California high court blamed hostility toward Chinese, . cultural tensions and xenophobia for Hong's plight, as well as a range of state . laws designed 'to disadvantage Chinese immigrants' who moved to . California with other immigrants following the Gold Rush of the . mid-1800s. In later life, Hong served as a banker and a diplomat, and was awarded a doctorate of law by the Chinese government. He was Director of Chinese naval students at Berkeley, California, until his retirement in 1920. He died in 1926, after which his family began the fight to have him recognised in the state. Hong's grand-niece, Rachelle Chong, is also a lawyer. She made history as the first Asian-American to be appointed to the Federal Communications Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission. Three of Hong's other descendants are lawyers. 'We are absolutely thrilled with the ruling,' said Chong. The longstanding injustice, she said had been a sore spot among Hong's extended family for decades.","Hong Yen Chang, who died in 1926, was a talented lawyer who graduated with top marks from Colombia .

"Police were probing a link between murder suspect Robert Durst and the cold case of a college student who vanished 44 years ago. Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, when Durst, owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. Real estate scion Durst, who is awaiting extradition to California to face a murder . charge for the 2000 execution-style killing of his friend Susan Berman, was denied bail on Monday in New Orleans. 'We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead,' police said in a statement, adding they were releasing no further details. Vermont police confirmed this week that they were looking into a link between Lynne Schulze, who vanished in Middlebury in 1971 (left) and Robert Durst (pictured last week), who owned a health food store in town at the time . The missing college student was the latest suspicious case to be linked to Durst who has also been dogged by questions about his first wife's disappearance in New York . Miss Schulze, who was a freshman at Middlebury College, was last across the street from Durst's store and the Vermont bus station around 2pm on December 10, 1971, the Burlington Free Press reported. At 12.30pm, she was seen outside All Good Things, eating dried prunes that she had bought inside. The Schulze case had been reopened in 1992 but police would not say why. Durst was being looked at in connection with five deaths or disappearances. Two women disappeared in California, his first wife vanished in New York, another woman went missing in Texas and now the latest, a teen college student in Vermont. Durst, who recently featured in the HBO documentary 'The Jinx: . The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,' must remain in Louisiana . on weapons charges until his next court date on April 2, . Magistrate Judge Harry Cantrell ruled, finding him a likely . flight risk and a potential danger to others. Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail but argued . his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier . this month in New Orleans were improper, and that investigators . wrongly interviewed him without counsel present. Durst's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to Los . Angeles County, where he has been charged with the 2000 murder . of longtime friend Susan Berman and could face the death . penalty. The HBO documentary broadcast Durst being presented with . evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's . likely killer. The 71-year-old Durst's voice was subsequently captured on a . microphone saying that he had 'killed them all.' Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen . Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the . dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. The final HBO episode aired one day after Durst's arrest at . a New Orleans hotel, where he was staying under an alias and had . over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask . that could fit over his neck and head with salt and pepper hair, authorities have said. FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the . country, the agency has said. Durst, long estranged from his powerful family with its . major New York real estate holdings, appeared in court on Monday . with his head shaved, revealing a long scar on the right side of . his head. He was being held in a prison psych ward in New Orleans where officials have deemed him a suicide risk. James O'Hern, an investigator for the local district . attorney's office, testified that authorities tracked Durst down . after he placed two calls from a phone at the hotel to the . voicemail on his personal phone. Also in his room was a scribbled tracking number for a . package that authorities later seized, which contained $117,000, . O'Hern said. Former Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, . who reopened an investigation in 2000 into the disappearance of . Durst's wife, was also in court.

"This is the moment a terrified driver desperately clung to windscreen wipers as he was carried along a busy dual carriageway on a car bonnet. Raymond Turner was forced to hang on for a mile before being thrown into the road in Camberley, Surrey, after fellow motorist Grzegorz Musial drove into him following a minor collision in a car park. Musial, 28, had clipped his wing mirror, and they exchanged details. But Musial admitted having no insurance - saying he would pay for the damage in cash - and got back into his Ford Focus estate. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Raymond Turner was forced to hang on for a mile before being thrown into the road in Camberley, Surrey, after fellow motorist Grzegorz Musial drove into him following a minor collision in a car park . However, Mr Turner was unhappy with this and said he would call police. Musial tried to drive off and hit him as attempted to call officers, leaving him prone on the bonnet and clinging to the wipers. Musial, of New Malden, south-west London, did not stop - instead embarking on a journey from near a Screwfix store in the town, along the A331 dual carriageway towards the M3 motorway. Witnesses reported seeing his car braking sharply and weaving from side to side in an attempt to throw the victim off. After Musial drove through a red light, the victim finally fell off into the road. He suffered ankle injuries, a broken nose and numerous cuts and bruises in the incident on October 14 last year. Musial drove off, but later called police to report that he feared he had hurt someone. In a statement read in court, Mr Turner said: ‘I was very frightened. I was worried that if he shook me off he would then run over me. ‘As the car was continuing to pick up speed I decided it would be a good idea to get off. As I fell I rolled up into a ball. I came to a rest on the dual carriageway next to the central reservation. Sentenced: Musial (left), of New Malden, south-west London, was jailed for 14 months. Witnesses reported seeing his car (right) braking sharply and weaving from side to side in an attempt to throw the victim off . One-mile distance: Musial embarked on a journey from near a Screwfix store in Camberley, Surrey, along the A331 dual carriageway towards the M3 motorway until he was close to a Sainsbury's . ‘The next thing I remember a lady was standing over me with an umbrella. I was badly hurt and in a great deal of pain - my face, right ankle, back and arm. All caused by the journey.’ Musial pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and failing to stop at the scene of an accident. He was jailed for 14 months and banned from driving for 18 months at Guildford Crown Court last week. Mrs Recorder Ann Mulligan told him: ‘You were calm, you engaged but a point came where you took off. At that point you did something completely unacceptable. ‘The reality is it’s just good fortune that matters were not even worse. Very serious injuries were sustained, including fractures.’ After the sentencing, Detective Sergeant Yahya Aslam of Surrey Police said: ‘This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim who was lucky to be alive after literally clinging on for his life through the streets of Camberley. ‘You should simply not be driving if you don’t have any insurance or a licence as you put yourself and other road users at risk. If he had sorted out insurance for himself, Musial may never have had to take the actions he did that day.’","Raymond Turner was eventually thrown into road in Camberley, Surrey .

At the time of the incident, his son Chirag, who paid for him to fly over from the small Indian village of Pij, told AL.com: 'This is a good neighborhood. I didn't expect anything to happen. 'He was just walking on the sidewalk as he does all the time. They put him to the ground.' 'It is a dream for me because I came from a very poor family and I worked so hard here.' Hank Sherrod, an attorney for the family, also told the site following the incident: 'This is broad daylight, walking down the street. There is nothing suspicious about Mr. Patel other than he has brown skin. His son Chirag, who paid for him to fly over from the small Indian village of Pij, said bringing his father over to the US was a dream. He was surprised at the attack as he believes its a good neighborhood . The clothes his father had laid out on his bed in preparation for his stay are left folded up . 'This is just one of those things that doesn't need to happen.' Patel has recently made progress by taking a few steps using a walker but remains in a rehab center in Huntsville. Sherrod said the man and his family were 'very pleased by the prompt and decisive action' of federal prosecutors. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley previously apologized to the Indian government for the treatment of Patel, calling it a case of 'excessive force.' The police chief in Madison, a suburb of Huntsville in the Tennessee Valley of north Alabama, also has apologized for what happened to Patel. Officers initially responded to a complaint a 'suspicious person' was looking in garages around the neighborhood.

"Violet Burton, 79, was found dead in a ditch a quarter of a mile from Stoke Mandeville Hospital . An elderly patient suffering from dementia who wandered out of a scandal-hit hospital was found dead in a ditch the next day. Violet Burton’s body was discovered only a quarter of a mile from the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital. She appears to have died from hypothermia, although the cause of death has not yet been made public. The hospital has begun an urgent investigation into how Mrs Burton, 79, said to be a ‘known wanderer’, was able to walk out of the hospital, wearing only a cardigan and trousers. She was reportedly seen by a member of staff but not stopped. The hospital’s latest Care Quality Commission report said it ‘required improvement’ in a number of areas, including in caring for those with dementia. The watchdog’s report, following an inspection in June 2014, stated: ‘The support for patients living with dementia or who may have a learning disability was inconsistent.’ It also raised concerns about staff levels, saying there was a ‘heavy reliance’ on agency staff which, in some instances, ‘affected the delivery and continuity of patient care’. Last month, the hospital, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was criticised in a scathing report into the actions of Jimmy Savile. It found that the disgraced BBC disc jockey had been allowed to abuse 68 victims there, including a boy of eight. Savile joined the hospital as a porter in 1968 and effectively lived there for more than 30 years. The report found that ten complaints were made about him, but none was ‘taken seriously’. Those who tried to blow the whistle were rebuked because senior managers thought Savile was an asset to the hospital. Mrs Burton, known as Vi Ann, was admitted to the hospital on March 7 after she was reportedly found wandering in her home village of Aston Clinton, which is near the hospital. She was described as a ‘sweet lady’ and was well known in the area, where she was often seen walking her 17-year-old dog. Stoke Mandeville (pictured), run by Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, said it had launched an internal review into the incident . She was apparently seen by a member of staff leaving the Medicine for Older People area of the hospital on Monday. Thames Valley Police issued an appeal for information, but Mrs Burton’s body was found in the ditch at noon on Tuesday. She was awaiting an assessment by Buckinghamshire County Council’s social services team when she went missing. A hospital source told The Independent: ‘Her death couldn’t have happened at a worse time. The CQC had issues they were concerned about so they’ve come back for a visit and one of the things they’re looking at is patient safety. The hospital still has serious problems.’ An independent investigation into the abuse by Jimmy Savile found he had sexually abused more than 50 people at Stoke Mandeville, including staff, patients and visitors with the youngest victim aged just eight . Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: ‘Our deepest sympathies are with Mrs Burton’s family at this very difficult time. We respect the family’s privacy and it would be inappropriate for us to share information about any care Mrs Burton was receiving. ‘Stoke Mandeville is a general, open hospital and, as with other district general hospitals, patients are free to move around the site. We have security measures that are appropriate for each clinical environment and processes in place should an alarm be raised.’ Police said they were not treating her death as suspicious. A file has been passed to the coroner.","Violet Burton, 79, was seen leaving the unit by a staff member on Monday .

"Eight teenage girls from the same school have been radicalised under the noses of their teachers, it emerged last night. Four girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London have already run away to Syria to join Islamic State. Now four more from the same school have expressed an interest in Islamic extremism. The worrying rise in fanaticism among girls at the school was laid bare at the High Court yesterday. All eight girls attended the Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets, east London . Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, from their homes in east London in February . A judge banned five girls – three of whom are 16 and two 15 – from travelling abroad after they showed an interest in going to Syria. He ordered their passports to be taken off them and for them to be made wards of the court. Four of the girls, from Bethnal Green Academy, are associated with the four girls who have already joined IS to become ‘jihadi brides’. The fifth is schooled at home. Concerns for their welfare were raised by police after classmates Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, fled to Syria last month. Lured to jihad: Kadiza Sultana, 16, left, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and Amira Abase, 15, right, at Gatwick . The trio followed in the footsteps of 15-year-old Sharmeena Begum, also from Bethnal Green Academy, who left for Syria in December. Mr Justice Hayden made the move to bar travel following an application from Tower Hamlets social services. He was told social workers had raised concerns that the girls might flee to areas controlled by IS. A number of adults involved in their care have also had their passports seized. There was evidence to suggest family members had not been ‘full and frank’ with social services, the judge said, and the girls were becoming ‘more radicalised’. The judge said the identity of the five girls should not be revealed but the name of the school could be published because most staff and pupils would know who they were.","Five teenage girls given travel bans all went to Bethnal Green Academy .

"This morning observers across Europe were treated to a rare solar eclipse as the moon passed across the face of the sun and obscured it almost entirely from view. But while many, in the UK especially, had to contend with clouds, plenty of images captured the event – and an odd black spot on the sun. While it might have looked like a speck of dust at first, this was actually a sunspot on the solar surface, caused by a concentration of magnetic fields. Scroll down for video . People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning. But several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun (shown). These were sunspots, caused by concentrations of magnetic fields. They are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares . Sunspots are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings. They range hugely in size, from just 10 miles (16km) to 100,000 miles (160,000km) - big enough to be seen from Earth without a telescope, and more than ten times the size of our planet. Sunspots are regions where powerful magnetic fields emanate from the sun . These magnetic fields can get wound up so tightly that they rise up from inside the Sun, and the sunspots mark the points where this happens. They are much colder than the rest of the sun's surface and usually last a few days before disappearing. They have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200°C (4,890 to 7,590°F), compared to 5,500°C (9,930°F) for the surrounding solar material, which is why they are so visible. Sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun, namely solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), all of which are linked to magnetic fields. The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. Sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes, regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface. Sunspots (previous Nasa image shown) are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings . Some observers took to Twitter to express their views on the sunspots, which were spotted in live footage showing the moon passing across the face of the sun . Others bemoaned the cloud coverage in the UK, which meant that many observers were unable to actually see the event at all. There were more than 10,000 mentions of the eclipse per minute on Twitter, according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch . The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. In this Nasa image, multiple sunspots can be seen across the solar surface . This morning, millions across Britain stopped to watch the country's first solar eclipse this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine explains: . 'When a solar eclipse occurs, what you’re witnessing is Earth, moon and the sun aligning. 'Eclipses can only really happen at a new moon. With this in mind, it’s quite easy to think that we should get an eclipse every month but because the moon’s orbit around  Earth is tilted by around five degrees to that of our planet’s, our natural satellite’s shadow usually misses the Earth’s surface by passing above or below it. 'It’s only really at least twice a year that the geometry lines up just right to make an eclipse for observers in a particular part of the world. 'The sun is roughly 400 times bigger than the moon but it is also around 400 times further away from us. As a result, the sun and the moon have the same size in the sky to make a partial or total eclipse. 'There are two types of eclipse - a partial and a total. During a partial solar eclipse, only some of the sun’s surface gets blocked out by our lunar companion. 'With a total eclipse, all of the Sun’s surface gets covered by the moon, creating a shadow that is projected onto  Earth. Day turns into darkness for a few minutes for observers in this shadow. 'However, when the moon passes in front of the sun, we don’t always get a total eclipse. 'Instead, we get an annular eclipse, also known as a ‘ring of fire’ - that’s when the Moon is at a further distance from the Earth in its orbit and therefore appears smaller, unable to cover the Sun’s disc entirely. 'At a distance of around 220,000 miles (357,000 kilometres) on 20 March though, the sun’s disc was sufficiently covered.' Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. The sun's light was almost totally concealed, casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night, but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes. In the Hebrides the sun was practically invisible as the Isle of Lewis experienced a 98 per cent eclipse, while the Faroe Islands saw a total eclipse. But cloud coverage meant that millions across Britain were unable to see anything at all of the eclipse, the like of which will not be seen again for several more decades. The last solar eclipse of such significance occurred on August 11 1999, and was 'total' - with 100 per cent of the sun covered when seen from Cornwall. Another 'deep' partial eclipse visible in the UK will not occur until August 12 2026, and the next total eclipse not until September 2090. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic and covers only two land masses, the Faroe Islands between Scotland and Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Away from this path the sun was partly obscured. A partial eclipse was visible across a large part of the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. More than 100 people flocked to the 5,000-year-old Callanish Stones on the Isle of Lewis to witness the solar eclipse. And they were rewarded most of the time by a break in the clouds - almost to the point of near totality. Lewis had been billed as the prime place in Britain to see the solar phenomenon. Caroline Pritchard, 58, and her partner Laurence McCallum, 50, travelled 905 miles in a 21 hour car and ferry journey - together with their three dogs - to see the event. This morning, millions across Britain stopped to watch the country's first solar eclipse this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness . 'This is the end of the age of Aquarius and we wanted to get here to see the eclipse,' said Mr McCallum, who works in a fine food business. 'I took the week off work unpaid and it has been worth it. It was fantastic. We arrived on Tuesday and unfortunately missed the other great astronomical event here this week - the Northern Lights. But the eclipse more than made up for it.' Ms Pritchard agreed: 'I am a spiritual person and I was drawn here to see the eclipse. I believe in powers greater than ourselves.' Islander Linda Vaughan, 62, from Crossbost, rang a Tibetan bowl to herald the eclipse as it created dusk - with temperatures noticeably plunging with the sun's infra red blocked out. 'The sound resonates with the stones. This is a spiritual and sacred place.. It is about creating the right harmony,' she said. The sun's light was almost totally concealed, casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night, but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes. Instead, solar eclipse glasses (shown) helped people observe the event . Four intrepid shadow seekers even boarded a special boat trip with Kilda Cruises from Leverburgh on the Isle of Harris at 5am to witness the eclipse at remote St Kilda. The archipelago, 41 miles (66km) west of the main Outer Hebrides, was forecast to be cloud free at the time of the event. Donny Mackay, president of the Stornoway Astronomical Society, said it received over 500 inquiries by email - as well as 100 phone calls - from all over the UK as well as far away as Germany. 'I was a bit worried when I saw the cloud early this morning but it turned out as good as we could have hoped for. It was really memorable,' he said.","People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning .

"A Labour candidate has turned down a £100,000 donation from Tony Blair . A Labour candidate for Parliament has rejected a £1,000 donation to her campaign from Tony Blair. The former Prime Minister had promised more than £100,000 to help the party, with the money going to key battleground seats. Mr Blair made a donation of £1,000 to the local campaigns in 106 target constituencies, saying they were 'where the election will be won for Labour'. But Dundee East candidate Lesley Brennan said her constituency would not be accepting the money. Writing on Twitter she said: 'Received donation from Tony Blair. Instinct was to not accept. Discussed with team. Dundee East is not accepting the £1000.' When the donation was announced last week a Labour spokesman said the party was 'delighted' that Mr Blair had put his own money behind the effort to get Ed Miliband into Downing Street. In a letter to the 106 candidates - including Ms Brennan - Mr Blair said: 'As the final countdown to the general election begins, I am writing to wish you every success in your efforts to be elected and also to make a donation to your campaign. 'I know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign, but for you, in one of our 106 battleground seats, it is even more vital. This is where the election will be won for Labour and that is why I am making a donation to all 106 campaigns. 'As one of our key seat candidates you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face, but I have every confidence that with your drive, determination and organisational skills, you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government. 'So, good luck and here's to a Labour victory on May 7.' Mr Blair is in a position to donate £100,000 after making a fortune since leaving Downing Street in 2007. Leaked documents published today revealed how he proposed a £30million contract to advise the United Arab Emirates while working as the Middle East peace envoy. Leaked documents published today revealed how Tony Blair proposed a £30million contract to advise the United Arab Emirates while working as the Middle East peace envoy. The 25-page document provides an insight into how much money he charges international regimes for his services. It promises the 'intense involvement of Tony Blair' with a commitment to spend 'two to three days a month' in the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi. Mr Blair has represented the Middle East Quartet since 2007, achieving little diplomatic success while building up a fortune as a business consultant. But a spokesman for Mr Blair denied that there was a conflict of interest. He told the Sunday Times there were discussions about working with the UAE, but there was no contract with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. None was planned, and the document 'was not cleared' by Blair.","Former Prime Minister promised more than £100,000 to help Labour .

"A British soldier has been found dead in a street in Miami while on holiday for a dance music festival. The 22-year-old, named locally as Private Shaun Cole, was on holiday in the city in Florida when it is thought he suffered a trauma to his head, caused by a blunt instrument.. His body was discovered by a shopper early Sunday morning, and a major investigation has now been launched to establish how he died. The body of Private Shaun Cole was found by a shopper in a Miami street on Sunday. A member of the Royal Scot Borderers, he had recently returned from a military operation in Sierra Leone to help support the fight against Ebola . Eyewitnesses reported seeing the Scottish soldier, who had served two tours in Afghanistan, running along the street with blood pouring from his head before collapsing in a heap. He had recently returned from a tour of Sierra Leone in west Africa, supporting the fight against Ebola. Miami resident Oscar Aguilera, who found Private Cole's body, said: 'When I saw him not moving and a puddle of blood, yeah, I kind of knew he wasn't doing all right. 'It's not the best way to start a Sunday.' The 22-year-old had been staying at in room 9 of nearby Royal Budget Inn, a cheap motel in a run down area of Miami, for the weekend with two friends. The sprawling urban area is a known hot spot for drugs and cheap roadside accommodation, and the street where his body was discovered has now been cordoned off by police hunting for clues. Officers are also making enquiries at the motel, according to The Daily Record, while the owner of the hotel Mrs Patel told local media that Private Cole had died from a blunt trauma to the head. Private Shaun Cole and his two friends were staying at the Royal Budget Inn in Miami, pictured. The hotel is located in an area of Florida which is a known hot spot for drugs .

"Outspoken Labour MP Austin Mitchell has been told off by the party’s high command for poking fun at Ed Miliband’s two kitchens. Mr Mitchell, 80, who is standing down as an MP in May, last week mischievously tweeted a picture of his own kitchen – complete with an unpacked bag of shopping and half-full glass of wine on the table – under the heading ‘this is what a real Labour kitchen looks like’. Yesterday he was sent a rebuke by Karl Turner, the shadow solicitor general, for the ‘attack’ on the party leader, warning him ‘if you can’t say anything supportive, keep your opinion to yourself’. Austin Mitchell tweeted this photograph with the caption: 'This is what a real Labour kitchen looks like' It is just the latest twist in the drama about Mr Miliband’s domestic set-up after he and wife Justine were filmed for a BBC interview having tea in a very small, empty kitchen with no seating area. In response to criticism, a family friend tweeted that the kitchen in the Milibands’ £2million North London townhouse was ‘lovely’ and that this was a ‘functional kitchenette’ for making ‘tea and snacks’. While most Labour MPs have resisted comment on the issue, Mr Mitchell fuelled the fire this weekend by tweeting: ‘Labour’s new pledge card promises two kitchens for all by 2030, two toilets by 2035.’ Last week, in a jibe at the Conservatives’ so-called bedroom tax, the veteran MP for Great Grimsby, had said: ‘Tories to introduce spare kitchen tax’. Mr Turner wrote him a letter, which Mr Mitchell duly published on his website yesterday, which read: ‘You’re a joke Austin. It’s very sad to see it but it’s becoming increasingly apparent. You think it clever to attack us. 'It’s not clever and you’ve had plenty out of the Party. Stop attacking us. ‘I am reluctant to pull you up publicly because you love the attention so very much. If you can’t say anything supportive just keep your opinion to yourself. 'We need to retain Grimsby. You’ve done little to help with that. And I doubt you’ve ever had a kitchen in Grimsby.’ It is just the latest twist in the drama about Mr Miliband’s domestic set-up after he and wife Justine were filmed for a BBC interview having tea in a very small, empty kitchen with no seating area . Mr Turner, the MP for Hull East, added that Mr Miliband ‘has one in Donny [his constituency in Doncaster] and mine’s massive in East Hull.’ It is a reference to Labour MPs’ thinking that Mr Mitchell has done little to help them campaign to keep the seat. It is the only Labour seat in the country which pollsters believe Ukip has a chance of winning. The veteran MP, who is an outspoken Eurosceptic, has also infuriated the leadership by claiming in a recent article that his party was promoting too many young women. He said Labour, which has used all-women shortlists to boost their numbers of female MPs, was ‘undergoing the biggest process of feminisation and rejuvenation embarked on since fabulous pink Camay soap promised to make us look a little lovelier every day.’ Mr Mitchell claimed that as a result, Labour was becoming more ‘family- friendly, gentler’ but ‘less prepared for all-night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind’. He also claimed that ‘ageism is rampant’ in the party, and that while he was standing down because ‘I’d rather not die in public’ other Labour MPs over 60, were being ‘carried out kicking and screaming’.","Austin Mitchell mischievously tweeted a picture of his kitchen last week .

"A high-flying academic who travels the world as a Government adviser is set to be deported from Britain under 'barmy' new visa laws - because she is out of the country more than 180 days a year. Dr Miwa Hirono, 38, is originally from Japan but has been living in the UK since becoming a lecturer at the University of Nottingham seven years ago. The world-renowned academic's work - which helps the UK Government to set foreign policy - requires her to spend long spells working in China and Africa. Set to be deported: Miwa Hirono with her husband, Peter Trebilco, 61, and one-year-old son Tada, must leave Britain under 'barmy' new visa laws . In 2009 and 2010 she spent around 200 days abroad researching China's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. But Home Office immigration laws now state that people working in the UK on a migrant visa cannot be out of the country for more than 180 days each year. And despite the fact Dr Hirono does research for a Government-funded organisation and her baby son was born in Britain, the Home Office has decided to deport her. Her university colleagues have slammed the decision as 'vindictive and bone-headed' but the Home Office has refused to back down. Today, Dr Hirono, who lives in Beeston, Notts., with her husband Peter Trebilco, 61, and their one-year-old son Tada, said: 'It came as a massive, utter shock. 'My Australian husband quit his job to join me in the UK as a family. I bought a house in Beeston two years ago and gave birth to my son here. 'I have my life here, everything is here but I have to give up everything. Battle: Dr Hirono's university colleagues have slammed the decision as 'vindictive and bone-headed' 'It is idiocy. The Government funded my research and now they are penalising me for hard work and contributing to their policies. 'I have one published paper which is uploaded on the UK embassy in Beijing's website. They changed the visa rule in 2012 and have applied it retrospectively to my travel in 2009 and 2010. 'What has happened to me is absolutely wrong and everyone understands my point except the Home Office. 'I thought this was a democratic country with natural justice but it doesn't seem that way.' Dr Hirono, an expert in international relations, has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it 'impractical'. Instead she has taken a job at a university in Kyoto, Japan, and the family are leaving the UK on March 29. Her husband Peter said the Home Office decision has caused the family to uproot their whole life. Left with no choice: Dr Hirono, an expert in international relations, has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it 'impractical' He added: 'It tears at your heart because we've gone to great lengths to make good friends in the neighbourhood and we're very supportive and contribute to the community. 'We're having to tear our son out of nursery, give up a home we've established, with neighbours we're very fond of, and none of that is our doing. 'It's an inflexibility - the law does not have the capacity to deal with individual situations. It's our whole life.' Dr Hirono came to the University of Nottingham in 2008 on a prestigious five-year Research Council UK fellowship, which then became a permanent role. But when applying to extend her visa last March, she was banned and told she would be deported because of the foreign travel aspect of her job. University bosses even wrote to the Home Office to tell officials that the trips were part of her job. In December, Dr Hirono won an appeal against the Home Office with a judge suggesting it would not be in the national interest to deport someone who had 'made a significant and profound contribution to the academic framework of higher education in this country'. But that ruling was later overturned and immigration bosses confiscated the family's passports a year ago. Professor Mathew Humphrey said Dr Hirono's research had had a significant impact on policy towards China, including on the UK's co-operation programme with the country. Unsympathetic: Government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the UK via skype after ruling her private life should be given 'little weight' Philip Cowley, professor of parliamentary government at the university, said: 'It is pure madness for the government to be driving out an expert on what is probably the most important foreign policy challenge of the next decade. 'Both from a human perspective and from the interests of the UK, this is indefensible.' Dr Hirono's local MP, Anna Soubry, even wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May asking her to consider the decision, but no action was taken. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'Ms Hirono's application for indefinite leave to remain was refused in July 2014 because she had spent more than 180 days outside the UK.' Government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the UK via skype after ruling her private life should be given 'little weight'. Dr Hirono said she believes her case will have a wider impact on the UK's ability to hire foreign professionals. She added: 'This could mean the UK loses its capacity to hire any foreign professional on a permanent basis. 'Who would want to stop their live elsewhere and move everything to the UK only to be kicked out after five years.'","Dr Miwa Hirono has been a lecturer at University of Nottingham for 7 years .

One in seven people in employment now work for themselves, compared to one in eight before the recession. The Bank said ‘large numbers’ of people had chosen to go freelance or set up their own business, in recent years, but the rise was particularly noticeable among women. While self-employment among men has remained ‘roughly flat’, more women now work for themselves so they can better juggle childcare, they said. A report by the Bank noted ‘growing self-employment among female workers’, pushing up the overall rate in the U K. ‘Part of this rise could reflect the desire to maintain a work-family balance and flexibility of hours’, they said. The Bank also reported a significant rise in so-called ‘silver entrepreneurs’, as more over 65s remained in the workforce. They said: ‘Older workers are more likely to be self-employed than younger workers. ‘This is perhaps because they have accumulated more knowledge or experience to start businesses. ‘Or it could be because they prefer the greater flexibility that self-employment offers. Growing numbers are now working well into their 70s as Britons live for longer. The number of older workers increased after the default retirement age was abolished in 2011, making it illegal for employers to force staff to retire at 65. The Bank said that around half the increase in self-employment in the last 10 years was associated with ‘the ageing of the workforce’. Improvements in computer technology have made it easier for people to start their own business, the Bank said, with entrepreneurs able to sell their goods online instead of the ‘need for traditional bricks and mortar stores’. Previously, critics have suggested the rise in self-employment was because those who lost their jobs during the economic crisis had been unable to find new ones. But the Bank dismissed this theory and said the increase actually reflected a ‘longer-term trend’ in Britain. It said: ‘While the recession may have pushed some workers into self-employment where they might otherwise have been unemployed, there is little evidence to suggest this was a major factor in the rise of self-employment.’ There was also a rise in the number of over 65s who are still in work, according to the figures (file image) The Trades Union Congress said the most common part-time self-employed jobs for women were hairdressers and cleaners, which are typically low-paid. They claimed that, while many women choose to work part-time, there had been ‘a marked increase in the number of women moving into part-time jobs since the recession because they couldn’t find full-time employment’. Shadow Business Secretary and Labour MP Chuka Umunna also claimed self-employed people had been the hardest hit by the cost-of-living crisis and that incomes had fallen. The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed yesterday disputed this bleak picture, however, and welcomed the Bank’s report. Simon McVicker, of IPSE, said: ‘With the report categorically stating that the increase in those working for themselves has not happened out of economic necessity, it is hoped the report will sway those, most notably the Labour Party, still clinging to the belief that the rise of self-employment represents increased insecurity in the labour market. ‘The report supports the findings of our own research that has repeatedly shown the UK’s independent professionals to be masters of their own destiny rather than becoming their own boss out of enforced or hidden unemployment. ‘The self-employed now constitute almost 15 per cent of the workforce and have been the catalyst for economic growth and recovery in the UK and it is high time they are celebrated for this fact.’","One in seven people who are in employment work for themselves .

"A stand-up comedian has sparked outrage for the way he reacted to an audience member's silent protest at his joke about rape during one of recent his shows in Melbourne. Ray Badran was on stage when a woman became offended by his comments and came off her seat and sat under the table during his show, The Age reports. Cecelia Devlin has told of how the comedian stopped his show and walked off the stage to tell her that she's 'a piece of s*** and I hope you die'. Scroll down for video . Ray Badran (pictured) has sparked outrage for the way he reacted to an audience member's silent protest at his joke about rape during one of recent his shows in Melbourne . The comedian was reportedly on stage when a woman became offended by his comments and slid off her chair and sat under the table during his show . Ms Devlin says Mr Badran's joke about looking like a rapist during his third-last act was what tipped her over the edge. She told The Age that Mr Badran joked: 'So you know how gay people can make jokes about being gay, and black people can make jokes about being black, well I can make jokes about rape.' When the outraged audience member staged her silent protest, Mr Badran reportedly said in the middle of his act: 'Seriously, what's this girl's problem? Oh wait, you probably shouldn't ask someone whose just called out a rape joke what their problem is.' Ms Devlin believes Mr Badran became distracted by her actions, which prompted him to stop the show and walk up to her to say:  'Good on you for taking a stand, but you're a piece of s*** and I hope you die.' Those who were outraged by Mr Badran's actions took to social media and criticised the comedian . One woman agreed with Ms Devlin and couldn't see the humour in the comedian's joke about domestic violence. 'Ray Badran told a woman who felt uncomfortable about his rape joke he wished she would die. That's not exactly funny now is it?' she tweeted. Another criticised Mr Badran for his poor response to the silent protest. 'Regardless of what the joke was (or intended to be) you can't talk like that to people. Dumb move,' she tweeted. However a fellow comedian, Chris Wainhouse, responded to the tweets in defence of Mr Badran. 'The joke in question isn't even about rape. It was about people being being stereotyped,' he wrote. A fellow comedian, Chris Wainhouse, responded to a series of tweets in defence of Mr Badran . Ms Devlin says she is seeking an apology from the comedian. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Badran for comment but in a statement he issued to The Age, he said the joke is one he's been performing for two years and never received a complaint until now. Mr Bradan further said US comedian Chris Rock praised him for the same joke during one of his previous shows. Mr Badran is currently staging shows at Melbourne International Comedy Festival, however it is believed the particular incident was part of an unrelated program. It is reportedly Badran's first appearance at the festival, which runs from March 25 to April 19, where he will stage 22 shows.","Ray Badran reportedly made several jokes about rape at a show in Melbourne .

"Should fast food outlets be forced to put tobacco-style health warnings on their packaging? That's one controversial and extreme measure being proposed by an Australian healthy food advocate, as he ramps up his campaign to change the way fast food outlets advertise to children. Aaron Schultz – founder of the Game Changer movement to get rid of unhealthy food ads in sport – says consumers have the right to more detailed information about what goes into the fast food they buy, and the effect it can have on their health. Scroll down for video . Health food campaigner Aaron Schultz wants to get people fired up about labelling on fast food . Mr Schultz - a father of two from Tasmania - with his sons Sam (left), 14 and Jed (right), 10 . 'We're heading down the wrong path at a rapid rate. Certainly food labelling is a key step to people making informed decisions on what they're eating,' Mr Schultz said. 'We don't have the capacity for people to make informed decisions because there's no labelling. 'Certainly if you look at, say, a piece of fried chicken you would find that there would be a lot more than the chicken and the nine herbs and spices associated with that.' Mr Schultz posted an image of a Big Mac box labelled with the words 'BIG MACS MAKE BIG CHILDREN' and a picture of two overweight kids to his Game Changer Facebook page in an attempt to fire up debate. 'Just like a cigarette packet demonstrates the causes of cigarette smoking and its damages, this image demonstrates what the fast food product can do to the human body,' he said. Mr Schultz has also run campaigns to change the way fast food outlets can advertise at sports matches . The most recent ABS statistics show that one-quarter of all Australian children aged 5-17 are overweight or obese. Mr Schultz said plain packaging was an eventual goal, but as a first step he wants to see detailed ingredients lists included on fast food packaging and information about where the food has come from and if it has been treated with chemicals or growth hormones. 'Later on [plain packing] can come. Ingredients have to be explained as a first step,' he said. Mr Schultz, a father of two from Tasmania, first got involved in health food campaigning as a concerned parent trying to limit fast food marketing to his kids at sports matches. 'I'm just a normal dad that's got concerns about unhealthy products being pushed to my children,' he said. 'They can't go to a game of sport without being influenced to consume unhealthy products. 'My main focus is to get unhealthy advertising out of sport but it's grown a lot more to address things at a greater level.' He wants to see detailed ingredients lists on fast food packaging, including where ingredients come from . James Paterson, deputy executive director at the Institute of Public Affairs, said consumers have the right to be informed about what goes into their food, but he did not think that governments should force companies to include health warnings. 'The only reason you'd have government impose it is if you believe people are too stupid and they don't know that you shouldn't eat junk food all the time,' he said. 'If you're the sort of person who already ignores advice about what's healthy and what's unhealthy then a warning label is not going to help you improve your diet, you've already made bad choices.' He added that it is unclear whether plain packaging is effective. 'Rates of smoking have fallen, but shortly after plain packaging was introduced there was really substantial increase on the tax on cigarettes,' he said. 'It's not clear if the people who stopped smoking have done it because of plain packaging or the price increase.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted McDonald's for comment.","Aaron Schultz is founder of a movement to get rid of unhealthy ads in sport .

"A former-supermodel-turned-parliamentary candidate is under investigation for allegedly throttling a bus driver in a row over luggage. Turkish model Tugba Ozay, 37, had flown to the city of Antalya in south-western Turkey where she went to get an airline coach to transfer to a resort two hours away. But the trip was disrupted when she and the bus driver broke out in a heated row over where she could put her luggage. A Turkish bus driver claims former supermodel Tugba Ozay (pictured) throttled him during an argument . Bus driver Halil Kizliyer said he attempted to put her bags in the undercarriage like everyone else's when the row broke out . Driver Halil Kizilyer, 28, said: 'I went to put her bags in the undercarriage holdall like everyone else's and she started getting angry saying she wanted to keep it on her. 'I explained that she had too many bags and they wouldn't fit on the coach and she went ballistic. 'She grabbed me by the throat and started squeezing my neck and screaming that she was going to have me fired.' Passenger Ahmet Buze, 27, said: 'I of course recognised her straight-away as she's very famous. 'But she seemed to think that she was entitled to special privileges and when she attacked the driver I was completely shocked. 'I took out my phone and began videoing it but then one of her security people or whoever he was came over and made me delete it.' Ozay, who was the highest paid model in Turkey at the height of her career, is now running for parliament with the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP). When questioned by local media over the incident, she said: 'The matter is not important. We have also filed a complaint against him.'

"Bacteria growing on particles of magnetic crystal may form natural rechargeable batteries, according to new research. Scientists at the University of Tübingen in Germany have found that colonies of two types of bacteria can grow on a mineral called magnetite. They found one species of bacteria could dump electrons onto the crystals while another harvested the electrons from them depending on the amount of sunlight they received. Scientists have found that colonies of two types of bacteria can grow on a mineral called magnetite. Magnetite is an iron (III) oxide mineral that forms smooth black crystals, like those shown above, in rock. One species of bacteria dumped electrons while another harvested  from them depending on levels of sunlight . The scientists said that in the wild this may allow the magnetite crystals to act like natural rechargeable batteries for the bacteria. The findings has raised hopes that these 'batteries' could be used to help develop new sources of energy, although the charge they currently hold is minute. Life has been discovered nearly a mile and half underground, raising hopes bacteria might be able to survive deep beneath the surface of other planets. Researchers found the single-celled organisms living inside coal beds more than 8,000ft (2,440 metres) below the seabed off the coast of Japan. It is the deepest life has yet been found beneath the ocean. At those depths the spherical microbes have to survive huge pressures that would crush most organisms while having no access to light or oxygen often needed for life. Instead, the bacteria scavenge the chemicals they need to survive by breaking down the hydrocarbon compounds in the coal around them. The findings have raised the prospect that life may still be clinging on deep underground on planets such as Mars, where there was once thought to be flowing water on the surface. Dr James Byrne, who led the work at the University of Tübingen, said bacteria could be genetically engineered to increase this activity. 'In our study we only looked at iron metabolising bacteria, but we speculate that it might be possible for other non-iron metabolising organisms to use magnetite as a battery as well - or if they can be made to use it, through genetic engineering,' he said. 'Could engineering the bacteria increase the energy production or is it limited by the magnetite itself? 'The magnetite itself will only hold a maximum number of electrons, which is one of the limiting factors. 'However, the bacteria access these electrons through specialized enzymes known as cyctochromes. 'In principle, if the bacteria could be engineered with more of these electron carriers, then it could increase the speed at which they use the magnetite as a battery. 'It is probably not something that could be used for an application in the immediate future though.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Science, incubated a species of purple bacteria called Rhodopseudomonas palustris, which is found in soil, and another bacterium called Geobacter sulfurreducens. This graph shows the percentage change in charge on the magnetite caused during daylight and nighttime conditions. Rhodopseudomonas palustris removed electrons from the magnetite, causing the charge to fall while Geobacter sulfurreducens added electrons to increase charge on the mineral during the night . These were grown on nano-sized crystals of magnetite - an iron oxide based mineral found in rock formations that was used to make lodestones. The research team then varied the light levels to simulate the effect of night and day. They found that during the 'day time' Rhodopseudomonas bacteria harvested electrons from the magnetite, reducing its electric charge. During the night, the Geobacter took over and dumped electrons back onto the magnetite crystals, recharging it. Geobacter adds electrons to the iron in the crystals while metabolising other organic material. The researchers grew the bacteria on nano-sized magnetic particles of magnetite (left), which can be seen gathering on the inside of the bottle beside the magnet on the right in a solution of purple bacteria . Dr Byrne said the findings suggest a way in which bacteria could survive in extreme environments deep under ground. He said: 'The geochemistry is interesting in itself, but there are also potentially useful implications which may derive form this work. 'The flow of electrons is critical to the existence of all life and the fact that magnetite can be considered to be redox active opens up the possibility of bacteria being able to exist or survive in environments where other redox active compounds are in short supply in comparison to magnetite.' The researchers also believe the findings could also be used to help clear up toxic metal pollution, using bacteria coated magnetite to convert the metal into safer forms. There are a number of species of bacteria that have been found to eat electrons by harvesting them from metallic particles and others that spit them out. This diagram shows the conditions that the scientists believe leads to the bacteria (marked in pink) adding or removing electrons to the magnetite (the black circle) according to water levels and sunlight available . These are generally found on seabeds and river beds, using energy in its purest form to power the reactions inside their cells. Most living species use a complex cascade of biochemical reactions to release the energy they need from their food. For example, most vertebrate cells break down glucose sugar to release packets of energy in the form of molecules known as ATP. These bacteria, however, appear to harvest energy directly from the electrons freed as they grow on the surface of iron minerals. Rhodopseudomonas palustris (above) harvests electrons to power the metabolic processes inside its cells. Most living species use a complex cascade of biochemical reactions to release the energy they need from their food but the studied bacteria appear to harvest energy directly from the electrons as they grow . Professor Andreas Kappler, another of the authors of the study and secretary of the European Association of Geochemistry, said: 'This may have some interesting geochemical applications. 'There has been considerable recent work on using magnetite to clean up toxic metals. 'For example, magnetite can reduce the toxic form of chromium, chromium VI, to the less toxic chromium (III), which can then be incorporated into a magnetite crystal. 'The fact that this magnetite may then be exposed to these reducing bacteria could potentially enhance its remediation capacity. 'But we are still at an early stage of understanding the bioengineering implications of this discovery.'","Scientists at University of Tübingen, Germany, grew bacteria on magnetite .

"It is the first feature film to tell the story of the ordinary British women at the turn of the last century who risked everything in the fight for equality and the right to vote. So it seems only right that the cast behind movie Suffragette, which focuses on the role Emmeline Pankhurst played in that movement, should get together to mark International Women's Day. Posing in a specially released photograph, actresses Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter, who star in the film, set to be released in September, are joined by relatives of the woman considered the leader of the Suffragettes. Scroll down for video . Celebrating International Women's Day: Top row l-r - Sarah Gavron (Director), Helen Pankhurst (Great-granddaughter of Emmeline), Laura Pankhurst (Great-great-granddaughter of Emmeline), Alison Owen (Producer). Bottom row l-r Abi Morgan (Screenwriter), Anne-Marie Duff (Actor), Meryl Streep (Actor), Carey Mulligan (Actor), Helena Bonham Carter (Actor), Faye Ward (Producer) The photograph, taken by Brigitte Lacombe, also features Helen and Laura Pankhurst, the great-grand-daughter and great-great-granddaughter of Emmeline, as well as director of the movie Sarah Gavron, screenwriter Abi Morgan, producer Alison Owen and actors Anne-Marie Duff and Carey Mulligan. The film will bring to life the the British women's suffrage movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, with famed suffragette Emmeline (played by Streep) among the main characters. Meryl, 64, makes her grand appearance as Emmeline, the political firebrand who paved the way for women to get the vote by supporting the war effort during the First World War, and who ultimately ran for office as a parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party. The actress commented: 'Every daughter should know this history, every son write it on his own heart.' Both Helena Bonham Carter and Carey Mulligan have been spotted filming for the movie outside Holloway Prison in London. A picture of the late Emmeline Pankhurst using a polling booth in circa 1910. Emmeline was the leader of the movement and fought tirelessly for women's right to vote . The actresses were shooting scenes  at Her Majesty’s prison in Islington, which held some of the biggest figures of the Suffrage movement. Carey plays one of the female foot soldiers in the women’s rights movement, and sees to visiting the suffragettes who were arrested and incarcerated during that period. Helena too wears the badge of the suffrage movement, carrying small bouquets of flowers in the green, white and violet colours of the Women's Social and Political Union. Meryl Streep dressed as Emmeline Pankhurst, and Helena Bonham Carter, right, during filming for Suffragette . Holloway Prison was opened in 1852 as a mixed prison, and became female-only in 1903, but it isn’t the only prison being used to capture scenes for the film as camera crews descended on Ruthin Gaol in Wales to film extras dressed as wardens and prisoners. The site was used to replicate interior shots of HM Holloway Prison where 27 women were locked up after Emmeline Pankhurst led a protest march of 300 on Parliament Square, now known as Black Friday. Two years later Pankhurst was convicted of conspiracy to commit property damage she led another militant protest after the Conciliation Bills (which would give women the vote) were put in jeopardy. Inside Holloway, Emmeline staged her first hunger strike to improve conditions for other suffragettes in nearby cells and spoke about the horrible conditions of the female-only prison in her autobiography: . ‘Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office.’ Pankhurst was arrested numerous times but was frequently released after several days because of her ill-health from hunger strikes, but was re-incarcerated under the ‘Cat and Mouse’ Act of 1913. Other notable suffragettes who were imprisoned at Holloway were Anne Miller Fraser, Constance Markeivicz, Charlotte Despard, Mary Richardson, Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Norah Elam. The Houses of Parliament have also opened their doors to the movie, which is the first time the political establishment has been used as a set for a commercial film. Carey and Helena were joined outside the building by hundreds of extras playing protesters, and there have also been scenes filmed in the central lobby and a committee room. MPs granted the production permission to use the historic building while they were away on Easter recess to subsidise the cost of maintaining Parliament. Suffragette’s director, Sarah Gavron told the BBC: ‘Our film is inspired by the true stories of the foot soldiers of the Suffragette movement, women who were willing to sacrifice everything in their fight for the right to vote. ‘We are honoured to be allowed to recreate a crucial moment in that long journey towards equality by filming where the Suffragettes actually brought their protest over 100 years ago.’ The theme for International Women's Day 2015 is 'Make it Happen'. According to the BFI (British Film Institute), in the seven years from 2007 to 2013, the average percentage of British films released each year that were directed by women was 12; and for films written by women the percentage was little better at 14.8. Gavron added: 'International Women's Day celebrates the achievements of women throughout the world and I am overjoyed that my film can be part of that celebration. 'The story of the ordinary British women who were willing to sacrifice everything in their fight for the right to vote is an inspiration to all of us in our ongoing fight for equality.'","The cast and crew of Suffragette posed together for the first time today .

"Graham Dwyer, 42, from Foxrock, south Dublin, was convicted by unanimous verdict of stabbing 36-year-old Elaine O'Hara to death in August 2012 . A married architect with a fetish for stabbing women during sex has been found guilty of murdering a mentally ill childcare worker and dumping her body in the Dublin mountains. Following a harrowing nine week trial, Graham Dwyer, 42, from Foxrock, south Dublin, was convicted by unanimous verdict of stabbing 36-year-old Elaine O'Hara to death in August 2012. The father-of-three, who was filmed knifing sexual partners and admitted having an affair with his vulnerable victim, faces a mandatory life sentence. Dwyer was remanded in custody at the Central Criminal Court. Judge Tony Hunt told the court he '110% agreed' with the jury's decision based on the evidence - which on three occasions was so gruesome the public had to leave the courtroom. Ms O'Hara's family members were in tears and embraced when the guilty verdict was read out. Dwyer closed his eyes and shook his head when he heard the verdict. The trial of the architect and family man was a graphic depiction of bloodlust and unnerving perversion. A huge swathe of evidence involved detail of BDSM sex, the 'Gorean' lifestyle of people living out a slave-master philosophy and a window into the life of a sexual deviant. Such was the shocking nature of some videos, photos and documents revealed in court that the media self-censored on occasions as well as the judge clearing the public galleries. In one, Ms O'Hara was bound, her feet in chains and her arms behind her back, while a gag muffled her screams as she was repeatedly stabbed her in the abdomen from behind. 'Now that wasn't bad, was it?,' Dwyer asked after he ejaculated on her. Thousands of disturbing text messages, backed-up on Ms O'Hara's laptop, revealed the unwavering control and power her 'Sir' (Dwyer) had over his Slave (O'Hara) and the mental torment she suffered throughout their sexual relationship. Dwyer had also written vile and sickening first person accounts about him kidnapping, raping, torturing and murdering series of women, including American woman Darci Day who testified against him. 'I had always fantasised about killing ever since I was a teenager and I got hard every time I had a knife in my hand, wielding the power knowing that I could decide who lived and died, Just like my hero. God,' he wrote. In one text to Ms O'Hara he wrote: 'I want to stick my knife in flesh while I am sexually aroused. Blood turns me on and I’d like to stab a girl to death some time.' Another said: 'My urge to rape, stab or kill is huge. You have to help me control or satisfy it.' Images and links from a phone Dwyer owned included women being stabbed, strangled or killed some of which came from a gore website. The body of Ms O'Hara, from Stepaside, Co Dublin, was discovered by a dog walker in the Dublin mountains . It was in the Killakee forest (pictured) in Dublin that the childcare's body was found - when her remains and personal belongings were recovered a small missing person's case was upgraded to a murder probe . Dwyer and his wife Gemma were both out celebrating their birthdays on Friday, September 13, 2013 when a dog walker found Ms O'Hara's skeletal remains in the Dublin mountains. The same week, an angler spotted something shiny in the shallow muddy waters in the Vartry Reservoir in Roundwood, Co Wicklow. Within days, Ms O'Hara's keys, keys, clothing, two mobile phones, and her rucksack carrying a variety of sex toys - including ropes, cuffs, a gimp mask and restraints - had been retrieved. Despite the water damage, experts managed to lay bare the extent of the controlling relationship by accessing more than 200 text messages between the 'Master' and 'Slave'. It was revealed in court the chilling final text sent to Ms O'Hara read: 'Go down to shore and wait'. Ms O'Hara was last seen at the Shanganagh cemetery, where her mother is buried, and was never seen again . It was revealed in court the chilling final text sent to Ms O'Hara read: 'Go down to shore and wait' Her car was parked at Shangahagh Cemetery, south Dublin, where her mother is buried, and she was never seen again. Some, including her family, feared she had died by suicide. When her remains and personal belongings were recovered a small missing person's case was upgraded to a murder probe. Dwyer was charged in October 2013 with her murder. He had denied murdering Ms O'Hara and claimed she was suicidal when she went missing on August 22, 2012, hours after being discharged from hospital for psychiatric treatment. She had been admitted to hospital for depression some 14 times, self harmed, and tried to take her own life three times. He was refused bail three times over the last 18 months. The trial had been pushed back for a day when the foreman of the jury had asked to clarify what exactly they were finding Dwyer guilty of. The prosecution has asked sentencing be adjourned to April 20 until the victim impact statements are prepared.

"Their normal mode of royal transport is a Bentley . But Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were game for a laugh today as they took a ride on a tuk tuk round the gardens of Clarence House. The couple were lending their support to a charity rickshaw race that will take place later this in memory of Camilla's late brother, Mark Shand. The Travels To My Elephant trek will see participants, including model Yasmin Le Bon and her daughter, Amber, drive 500 kilometres across India to highlight the plight of the endangered Asian Elephant. Scroll down for video . Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Charles, Prince of Wales ride a rickshaw at Clarence House where they hosted a reception to launch the 'Travels to My Elephant' Rickshaw Race . The royal couple viewed two in a fleet of motorised rickshaws that have been decorated by fashion designers and artists, including DVF and Nicky Haslam, which will also be auctioned off for the cause. Much to the surprise of the waiting photographers, the future king and his wife duly jumped in one of the creations for a spin round their garden. Unfortunately for the royal passengers their driver, Camilla's nephew Ben Elliott, managed to stall the vehicle several times, sending the couple lurching forward and Charles to jokingly wag his finger. Camilla holds on tight as the rickshaw pulls into Clarence House for the event, which celebrates a fleet of thirty rickshaws that will journey 500km across Madhya Pradesh, India, in November . The event is called 'Travels to my Elephant' and is inspired by Elephant Family's late founder, Mark Shand, Camilla's brother, who passed away in April 2014 . Here they come! The couple looked quite at home taking the quirky form of transport . The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall during a reception to launch the Travels to My Elephant Rickshaw race at Clarence House, London . Eventually, he managed to get it started and whizzed off with the couple, both weeping with laughter, in the back. 'They aren't easy to drive those things,' businessman Mr Elliot, 39, later laughed. 'Fortunately I have got broad shoulders and so have they.' Earlier Camilla had been in tears as speakers, including her own husband, lined up to pay tribute to her late brother. Mark tragically died in a freak accident at the age of just 62 last April, after tripping over on a pavement in New York and suffering a catastrophic head injury. The adventurer was in the US to raise funds for his charity, Elephant Family, a cause that had dominated his colourful life since he rescued an Asian elephant, Tara, as a young man.

It would be a crime not to carry it on. ‘I’m very into my cars but racing a rickshaw is going to be something else. ‘I am going to be the driver and Amber will be the navigator. We get on brilliantly but I think being cooped up in a rickshaw for eight days together it going to be explosive. ‘Luckily the engine is loud so I won’t be able to hear her – although I might be tempted to take some gaffer tape too. ‘I really want people to support us in any way they can.

"A 23-year-old has been charged with criminal damage and trespassing after a man was seen wandering on the roof of the Houses of Parliament last night. Braydon Liam Anderson  is accused of spending eight hours on top of the historic landmark on Saturday night with police, fire engines and specialist negotiators scrambled to the scene. It is not clear where he was part of a climate change protest staged earlier in the day which saw several others arrested. Scotland Yard confirmed on Sunday that Anderson, from Northampton, had been charged with criminal damage and trespassing. He will appear in Magistrates' Court on Monday. Scroll down for video . Braydon Liam  Anderson, 23, has been charged with criminal damage and trespassing after a man was seen wandering on the roof of the Houses of Parliament last night . Police and fire fighters descended on the Palace of Westminster at about 9.15pm on Saturday after the alarm was raised . Anderson was charged on Sunday after tourists reported seeing a man walking up and down the roof for hours. On Sunday afternoon it was still unclear how the man gained access. It came after around 5,000 protesters gathered for a climate change demonstration outside Parliament on Saturday afternoon. It is still not clear whether the man was staging a protest or not. Anderson will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court tomorrow. The man was seen calmly walking around on the roof of the building before being arrested by police. It remains unclear how he got there . Specialist negotiators were dispatched to the scene last night - but police said there was no suspicion of a suicide attempt . Eyewitnesses described seeing emergency services on the roof of the Palace of Westminster on Saturday night after police were called . Tourists  stopped to look up at the man as he wandered around the landmark's roof. On Sunday he remained in police custody . Specialist negotiators were called to the scene to communicate with the man who was later arrested unharmed. He is not believed to have given a reason for why he scaled the building or how he got there. Tourists stopped to observe the unfolding situation last night, with many pondering how he was able to gain access to the building. One witness told the Daily Telegraph: 'He's just walking up and down, looking a bit vacant.' 'Tourists are stopping to look. He doesn't have any flags or banners.' Two fire engines from Soho and one fire and rescue unit from Chelsea attended the incident, according to London Fire Service. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman confirmed Metropolitan Police officers and the London Fire Brigade were on the scene to deal with the incident . Security alert: The man appeared calm but described as 'vacant' by onlooking tourists who questioned how he got up onto the roof . Flashback: In 2009, more than 20 Greenpeace activists managed to climb on to the roof of the Palace of Westminster to stage a protest . On Saturday a spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The incident is currently being investigated by police. We will wait and see the outcome of that before we proceed.' The roof has been the scene of stunts by campaign groups in the past, including by protesters demonstrating against plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport in 2008. A year later more than 20 Greenpeace activists climbed on to the roof of the Palace of Westminster in a protest over climate change. It was reported at the time that protesters managed to slide ladders through the railings surrounding the building and then use them to climb on to one of the lower roofs. The demonstrators also scaled the ramparts and a turret on top of Westminster Hall, unfurling yellow banners which read: 'Change the politics, save the climate.' Fathers 4 Justice campaigner Guy Harrison, 38, spent five hours on top of Westminster Hall in 2005 with a banner which read: 'Does Blair care?' New Fathers 4 Justice said it did not know the name of the Westminster protester but confirmed that a protest was being planned for Westminster. Members of the campaign group visited the site last week and a spokesman said: 'With many MP's away pre election campaigning security around Parliament appeared noticeably much more relaxed than unusual last week.' Their plan involved a 'sympathetic insider who works as a researcher for a Lib Dem MP' but they refused to hand over any money.

"A 27-year-old man has died in outback NSW while attempting to recreate scenes from the iconic Mad Max film franchise with a group of fellow fans. The man, believed to be a US national, died instantly on Tuesday evening when his motorbike collided with a Mack truck causing him to be thrown from the vehicle.

Owner of the Silverton Hotel, Peter Price, said that the Mad Max community was devastated by the news. 'There has been an outpouring of grief from everybody that's been involved and we've had numerous phone calls this morning from avid fans that have been this way and it's been ... not nice,' Mr Price told The ABC. 'For the Mad Max family, it is a group of people worldwide and they'll be devastated by this, but I think the support that's there is so strong in the culture and I think there'll be plenty of support for everybody,' he said.

"The parents of three runaway schoolgirls feared to have joined the Islamic State in Syria have labelled British police 'hopeless' as they launch their own bid to bring their children home. School friends Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, left east London for Turkey last month before crossing into an ISIS-controlled area of Syria. Speaking from Turkey as they try to trace their children independently, the girls' parents claim they begged police to take their computers to check for any clues which may lead them to their whereabouts, but that officers only did so 'after many requests'. Scroll down for video . Schoolgirls Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and  Amira Abase, 15, (pictured at Gatwick airport) fled to Turkey before crossing the border into Syria where they are believed to have become ISIS jihadi brides . The parents of the three runaway schoolgirls have labelled British police 'hopeless' as they launch their own bid to bring their children home . The Bethnal Green Academy pupils are feared to have reached the conflict zone to become so-called 'jihadi brides' with ISIS. Parents and siblings of the teenage girls have now hit out at a series of alleged failures by the Metropolitan Police. Tasnime Akunjee, the families' lawyer, who has travelled with them to Istanbul, said that all contact with the British authorities and the academy had been 'an attempt to block them from finding out more about the circumstances surrounding the girls' disappearance'. Amira's mother Fetia Hussen, told The Times the people of Turkey have been very helpful. She said: 'We begged the police to take computers to check if there is anything on there useful to help find our daughters. 'The police only took these things after we asked them many times. We do not trust the police will do anything with this.' Scotland Yard said it would not comment on a live investigation. It comes days after a mother fled to Syria with her two young children to join the terrorist group. Rehana Begum Islam abandoned her husband of 14 years, vanishing overnight with her eight-year-old son and three-year-old daughter. The 33-year-old travelled from Heathrow to Istanbul on February 14 and then took an internal flight to Gaziantep, a city on Turkey's border with Syria. She is believed to have been helped by Syrian Mohammed al-Rashed, who was arrested last week on suspicion of getting the three east London schoolgirls across the border. On the journey to find the missing girls, their families went first to the Istanbul coach station where the teenagers waited 18 hours in the biting February chill for their bus to the Syrian border. There they spoke to a man who unknowingly let the girls in. He told ITV News they were 'smiling as they arrived' and 'smiling as they left'. Emotional: The families went to the Istanbul coach station where the teenagers boarded their bus to Syria . Questions: The families hope to find clues that may help them find or even contact their daughters . Anguish: The families of three missing London schoolgirls have travelled to Turkey to retrace their steps . Renu Begum, sister of Shamima, told ITV News: 'This is our next step basically to get the message out to them that we've followed them all the way out here. We want them to know that we love them.' Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza, said: 'I don't really recognise my sister, the video and the CCTV that we saw. Because this is just not her and we just want to understand her, you know, to find some answers and get some help.' Abase Hussein, father of Amira, said: 'I don't know how to explain. I can't describe my feelings. I feel like my girl is next to me when I find someone that's on their last journey who saw them. I feel like my daughter is next to me - that's the feelings I have.' The east London schoolgirls flew to Istanbul from Gatwick with Turkish Airlines and now believed to be in based in the Syrian town of Raqqa – the Islamic State's self-declared capital. Last week it emerged that Sharmeena Begum, 15, a close friend of the trio and a fellow pupil at Bethnal Green Academy, left Britain before them in December. There are suspicions the trio kept in touch with Sharmeena who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps. Those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by Islamists using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software. The families have criticised police and others for failing to stop them. But their plight has raised questions about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical Islam. Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has said the three schoolgirls would not face prosecution if they returned home.","Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, in Syria .

"The SNP will force Ed Miliband to abandon planned spending cuts from Labour's very first budget if the party holds the balance of power after the election, Alex Salmond said today. The former Scottish First Minister said the SNP would hold all 'the power' if a Labour government needed its votes to survive – and even claimed the party's surge in support showed it had been the real winner of last year's independence referendum. He said the party would demand an end to austerity – with billions of pounds more borrowing and debt – as the price of propping Mr Miliband up in power. Scroll down for video . The SNP will force Ed Miliband to abandon planned spending cuts from Labour's very first budget if the party holds the balance of power after the election, Alex Salmond said today . The comments, in a round of broadcast interviews this morning, were immediately seized on by the Tories, with defence minister Anna Soubry branding them 'terrifying'. Appearing alongside the former Scottish first minister on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Ms Soubry said: 'The thought that we are in a position where you can be actually controlling in the way that you have described this United Kingdom fills me with absolute horror. 'The audacity is atonishing. There was a wonderful debate in Scotland, you lost it. We are a United Kingdom, that is what the people of Scotland wanted.' But Mr Salmond, who is standing to re-enter parliament in the Gordon constituency, boasted that the party was set to dictate what was happening in Westminster. He said it would be 'very good for Scotland' if there was a decisive number of SNP MPs after May 7, adding: 'If you hold the balance, then you hold the power,' he said. Asked if that meant Ed Balls or another Labour chancellor would have to negotiate their Budget with the SNP, he replied: 'Yes, any minority government has to negotiate in order to win a majority for its proposal. That is patently obvious. To deny that is to deny reality. 'If the SNP are in these circumstances it will be very good for Scotland, certainly.' Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said Mr Salmond's remarks were 'terrifying'. She said: 'The thought that we are in a position where you can be actually controlling in the way that you have described this United Kingdom fills me with absolute horror' Mr Salmond mooted an example where he would propose an amendment to Budget legislation in order to create a high-speed rail line to Edinburgh. 'What would Ed Balls do?' he asked. Pressed on what kind of deal was possible with Labour, Mr Salmond said: . 'The Labour Party have ruled out a coalition but haven't ruled out a confidence and supply arrangement, where you have a set programme ... I think it is more likely to be a vote by vote arrangement.' The former SNP leader said: 'I think it's a very bad idea in politics to bend under pressure.' Mr Salmond went on: 'Hopefully that decisive bloc of SNP MPs will move the Labour Party in a different direction. Ed Miliband has vowed not to form a formal coalition with the SNP after the elction . 'I think there is lots of people - certainly lots of people in Scotland.. but I think people across these islands are pretty fed up with the duopoly at Westminster and might want to see politics a bit more interesting, where parties have to work for their votes and have to justify things on a vote by vote basis to the people of the country. 'I think lots of people will find that a much more exciting and productive system of politics.' Mr Salmond told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live that Mr Miliband had been 'very foolish' to rule out a formal coalition with the SNP. The mistake was 'not because it was likely to happen but because he did it under pressure from the Conservative Party'. 'I think it's a very bad idea in politics to bend under pressure,' he added. Mr Salmond said he believed Scottish independence was now 'near inevitable', and hinted that a commitment to a new referendum could be included in the SNP manifesto for the 2016 elections north of the border. 'The story is not finished. I think the direction is now as near inevitable as anything can be in politics,' he told the Marr Show. 'I think what has happened is that we have established the gold standard of how you have a process for Scotland becoming independent. 'What you have to have is a party or parties have to put it in their manifesto for the Scottish election, they have to win a majority in that proportional parliament to hold a referendum and then the decision of course lies with the Scottish people.' Mr Salmond also appeared to rule out taking over as leader of the SNP's Westminster group in the new parliament. 'No, Angus Robertson is leader of the group at Westminster,' he said. 'The SNP has a collective approach on these things but the person who calls the ultimate shots is Nicola Sturgeon.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the SNP would have 'no bargaining chips' to control a minority government headed by Ed Miliband as they had already ruled out working with the Tories . Pushed on whether renewing Trident was a 'red line' for the SNP that would prevent a deal with Labour, Mr Salmond said: 'You couldn't have a coalition or a confidence and supply, but a vote by vote is what comes up in the House of Commons.' Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the SNP would have 'no bargaining chips' to control a minority government headed by Ed Miliband as they had already ruled out working with the Tories. And he warned Scots that they could not vote SNP to get a Labour government 'by proxy'. Alex Salmond insisted his successor Nicola Sturgeon would lead the negotiations with Labour after the election . 'People are coming more to the understanding that the biggest party gets to form the government,' Mr Murphy told the BBC's Sunday Politics. 'It is either Labour or the Tories. You cannot vote for a Labour government by proxy ... it is one or the other.' Asked about polls suggesting Labour faces losing dozens of seats to the SNP in Scotland, Mr Murphy admitted his party had not been 'good enough' over recent years. But he argued that the public was 'starting to listen' to what they had to say. 'We have got a long way to go,' he said. 'If these polls are repeated on election day this will be a bloody, awful showing for the Scottish Labour Party. 'But much more important it will be a dreadful day for Scotland because by accident we would re-elect David Cameron ... 'David Cameron would cling on to power. He would be an accidental prime minister.' John Lamont MSP, Scottish Conservative chief whip said: 'Four weeks before postal ballots go out, Alex Salmond is taking the votes of people in Scotland for granted and planning back-room deals with Labour from a TV sofa in London. Even for him, this is stunning arrogance. 'Now he is talking up the prospect of a vote-by-vote deal with Labour - one Ed Miliband still refuses to rule out. 'That would mean the SNP holding a weak Labour Party to ransom on every vote, every day, all with the aim of trying to weaken the United Kingdom. 'A year after Scotland gave a clear and unequivocal No to the SNP's separation plans, Alex Salmond would be back at the heart of Westminster trying to sow chaos with our future.'","Former Scottish First Minister said the SNP would hold all 'the power'

"Pension firms will be forced to reveal to customers if they are offering rip-off retirement deals, the financial watchdog announced yesterday. Companies will have to advertise what rival firms are offering and how much more retirees could earn if they switched to a different provider. They will have to do this every time they send a customer a quote for an annuity – when a pension pot is turned into a fixed income for life. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that using a ‘simple quote comparison’ would expose bad-value contracts. Under new rules to be introduced in the UK next year, firms will have to advertise what deals rival firms are offering and how much more retirees could earn if they switched to a different provider (file picture, posed) In a victory for Money Mail, the radical shake-up will force firms to ‘make it clear to consumers how their quote compares relative to other providers’. The FCA said this would ‘prompt customers to consider the benefits of shopping around and switching’. From next month, pensioners will no longer have to buy an annuity with their pension pot and can withdraw all or part of it. However, many are expected to still opt for one because they want the security of a fixed income during retirement. FCA director Christopher Woolard said: ‘The retirement income market is set for the biggest change in a generation. We want to ensure it is fit for purpose.’ Experts said the new rules – to be introduced next year – will prevent swathes of pensioners blindly accepting a poor-value annuity offered by their pension provider. Andrew Tully, of retirement firm MGM Advantage, said: ‘Pensioners are locked into poor-value annuities because they are not encouraged to shop around. If providing details of what rivals are offering provokes someone to look at alternatives, that has got to be positive.’ The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that using a ‘simple quote comparison’ would expose bad-value contracts and the new regulations would ‘prompt customers to consider the benefits of shopping around' Other measures unveiled by the FCA includes cutting back on jargon-filled documents – in some cases as long as 22 pages – an issue Money Mail has highlighted. The watchdog said it would also consider whether savers should be sent a simple statement outlining how much money they have saved and what type of pension they have. Known as a pension passport, it would make it easier to switch to a better deal. Since Money Mail campaigned on the issue it has won the backing of pensions minister Steve Webb. The Treasury is now conducting trials at several pension companies before the regulator considers making it compulsory.","Pension firms will be forced to reveal offers by rival firms under new rules .

"It's the sort of job most of us dream of, where a day in the office would entail wolfing down hundreds of chocolates, all in the name of research. This is the reality for lucky Matt Trotter, who eats more than 200 eggs in the two months running up to Easter, chomping down on 50kg of chocolate to make sure they're up to scratch. But the Leeds resident is still in search of his perfect egg: one shaped like David Beckham. Matt Trotter from Leeds eats more than 200 Easter eggs for ASDA as part of his job as chocolate taster . Taking it seriously: Mr Trotter marks the egg for appearance (left) and check the egg filling (right) The professional Easter egg taster for Asda spends eight hours a day tucking into the sweet treats . The 26-year-old has always been passionate about the sweet things in life, initially training as a chef and then specialising in chocolate for six years before starting at Asda. He said: 'What's not to love? I get to channel my creativity into my favourite foods - chocolates and sweets. My friends and family are really envious of my job when they're stuck at their desks 9-5 every day.' Mr Trotter thinks he knows just what to look for when looking for the ideal chocolate egg. He said: 'When testing, I always look for a creamy flavour in milk chocolate and a bold intense cocoa flavour with dark chocolate, but both must have a good snap! 'To benchmark our products, I'll taste at least 50 Easter Eggs at a time to make sure we score the best.' And the chocolate tasting doesn't stop after Easter. 'I look after all the seasonal periods such as Christmas and Halloween, tasting chocolates, sweeties, jellies and mallows in all shapes, sizes and flavours for up to eight hours a day, taking inspiration from countries all over the world to bring exciting new products into our ranges,' he said. Altough Mr Trotter has tried more than 200 eggs, he is still waiting for someone to make an egg in the shape of his favourite footballer David Beckham (right) 'I can't wait for our customers to see what we have coming in-store - the biggest buzz I get is knowing our shoppers really enjoy the products. I must admit when I go home, I give the chocolates and sweets a miss and stick to the fruit.' And surely he must have a favourite now that he's tried almost all of them? He said: 'When it comes to Easter eggs, my dream would be a giant Easter egg in the shape of my favourite footballer - David Beckham. Who knows, maybe next year we'll get one on the shelves?'","Matt Trotter from Leeds eats 50kg of chocolate in the run up to Easter .

"Anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman, who could be set to be the first female to feature on a US banknote . An escaped slave who helped to free others from their captors could be set to become the first female face on a U.S. banknote. A campaign has been gathering pace to replace former president Andrew Jackson on $20 bills with that of a female for the first time in history. An online petition has now been set up with site visitors asked to vote for which female historical figure should feature on the bill. And it seems that illiterate black woman Harriet Tubman is leading the way to be nominated as the new face before the petition is formally handed over to President Barack Obama. The petition has been set up on the website womenon20s.org, which is calling for Jackson to be replaced due to his negative treatment of Native Americans. A 15-strong shortlist has been drawn up, which includes Tubman, who was born into slavery in 1822 in Maryland. In 1849 she escaped her owners, fleeing north and then subsequently made several missions to rescue friends and family, who remained enslaved, by using a network of safehouses known as the Underground Network. After the American Civil War she continued to be an advocate for education and joined early campaigns for women's equality and suffrage. Others on the list include Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her seat on a bus sparked the modern civil rights movement and Eleanor Roosevelt, a former first lady. The faces on American bank notes have remained the same since 1929, but President Obama has signalled he would be open to change. Civil rights activist Rosa Parks, left, and former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who are also on the shortlist to appear on the $20 bill . Currently, the $20 bill features the face of seventh US president Andrew Jackson, who became much maligned due to this treatment of Native Americans . The campaign, is hoping that if it is successful, a note featuring a woman would go into circulation by 2020. Petition organiser Barbara Ortiz Howard told CBS: 'There are no women on the money and I thought gee this is a crazy omission.' The petition mirrors a similar campaign in the UK to get Jane Austen as the face of a £10 note after a public outcry that every banknote featured a man. The Bank of England governor Mark Carney unveiled the new design as a tribute to ‘one of the greatest writers in English literature’ which will appear from 2017, replacing naturalist Charles Darwin. A similar campaign in the UK will see a £10 note, pictured, with the face of author Jane Austen on it go into circulation in 2017 . The announcement was hailed as a ‘brilliant day for women’ by journalist Cristina Criado-Perez, who had led a high-profile campaign on social media to ensure a female face would remain on banknotes after the Bank dropped social reformer Elizabeth Fry from the £5 note in favour of Winston Churchill. But days later she began receiving a stream of abuse from 86 Twitter accounts. Arts college graduate Isabella Sorley, 23, and unemployed recluse John Nimmo, 25 were jailed after threatening to kill and rape Miss Criado-Perez for her campaign.","New campaign is calling for the first woman to be put on a U.S. banknote .

"A million-dollar, five bedroom mansion has been successfully transplanted 14 miles from Fargo to Horace in North Dakota. Moving the 4,500-square-foot, 218-tonne home required four moving companies, a 23-axel truck, a slew of permits and help from dozens of people including police officers and electricians. New owner Scott Adelman bought the property at a knockdown price of just $70,000 because the land it was built on was being turned into a flood diversion. A million-dollar, five bedroom mansion has been successfully transplanted 14 miles from Fargo to Horace in North Dakota . Moving the 4,500-square-foot, 218-tonne home required four moving companies, a 23-axel truck, a slew of permits and help from dozens of people including police officers and electricians . 'It's quite the project to just get it moved,' new owner Scott Adelman told KVLY. He said the most challenging part of the process has been securing all the permits required, especially because he wanted to take the property across the interstate bridge. That required the Department of Transportation as well as the city of Fargo, Stanley Township, and Horace. He also had to coordinate with other contractors including sign companies, street light companies and power companies. It took two days to move the house as it crawled along the interstate at speeds of about 5 mph. Now that it has reached its destination, Adelman has a crew of 15 people ready to rebuild the property so he can have it back on the market in just five weeks. 'We will have to put the foundation underneath it and piece it back together,' said Adelman. 'It's a project, but the majority of the house obviously, stays intact.' He estimates that it will take a week for the concrete to set and then the house will be set on top. Then the plumbing and electric will next to set up before a new family can move in. Adelman, who owns a company that specializes in relocating and 'recycling' homes, intends to list the property at around $700,000.

"Scott Hall, who suffered from Rasmussen's Syndrome, died from a brain haemorrhage nine days after he was attacked by two teenagers . A teenager changed his Facebook status to ‘full-time killer’ after a disabled man he attacked later died of a brain haemorrhage. Scott Hall died 11 days after he was punched to the ground and repeatedly kicked by the 15-year-old and an accomplice of the same age in an unprovoked attack. But despite one of the attackers taking to Facebook to mock his victim – who was known to the youth’s family – and calling himself a killer, the pair walked free from court yesterday. They were given community orders and told to attend a rehabilitation programme. The sentence followed the Crown Prosecution Service’s insistence that it could not link the attack to 28-year-old Mr Hall’s death. His family criticised the decision not to charge the youths over the death and said ‘the punishment should fit the crime’. Instead, the teenagers were taken to court to face the lesser charge of assault causing actual bodily harm. Newton Aycliffe magistrates’ court was told that Mr Hall, who had both physical and learning difficulties, lived his final days in terror following the attack. He was confronted by the youths in Newton Hall, Durham, last July, beaten up and left unconscious. He was taken to hospital and later released. Nine days later his mother found him lying at the foot of the stairs at the family home in Framwellgate Moor, Durham. Despite being taken back to hospital and regaining consciousness, he died two days later. An inquest found that a ‘blunt force trauma’ led to Mr Hall’s death from a brain haemorrhage but said it could find no evidence the attack was directly linked. The youths, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, initially denied the assault but admitted the offence at the magistrates’ court on Wednesday. The victim’s sister Zoe Hall, 25, told the court: ‘[The defendants’] actions resulted in him being frightened for the last week of his life. He was constantly upset and couldn’t understand why someone would want to hurt him.’ Thugs: Scott Hall was kicked as he lay on the ground outside Newton Hall Library (pictured) in Durham . Chris Atkinson, prosecuting, said Mr Hall had been trying to walk away from a verbal altercation with his attackers when he was pounced on. He said: ‘He was punched in the face. That knocked him to the ground and witnesses describe both young men kicking him while he was on the ground.’ Witnesses ran to Mr Hall’s aid before he was taken to hospital and later released. ‘Mr Hall suffered from Rasmussen’s Syndrome, which affected his balance, speech and the way he walked,’ said Mr Atkinson. ‘His disability must have been apparent to his attackers.’ The youths, now 16, had no previous convictions and were said to be remorseful. Mr Hall’s family discovered they would not be charged with causing his death at an earlier hearing in January. At a hearing at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court (pictured), both teenagers pleaded guilty to assaulting Mr Hall and were given community orders . At the time his mother Carol Hall, 56, said: ‘I’m totally gutted. The punishment should fit the crime.’ A CPS spokesman said: ‘The coroner found no evidence to link the death of Mr Hall with an alleged assault some two weeks before.’ The mother of the teenager who boasted of being a killer said: ‘I don’t know why he attacked Scott, he has never been able to explain it. 'I knew some of Scott’s family quite well and it’s hard to describe how sorry I am. ‘It has devastated us as a family but of course nowhere near the suffering the Hall family has experienced. ‘They could never prove there was any link between the attack and Scott’s death but we all know the attack shouldn’t have happened.’","Scott Hall, 28, died from brain haemorrhage days after he was attacked .

"David Cameron, William Hague and Michael Gove were left humiliated last night after Commons Speaker John Bercow survived an attempted Tory coup. The Conservatives used the last day of Parliament to lead a so-called 'Payback Plot' on the controversial figure. But the move was defeated by 228 votes to 202 yesterday and an emotional Mr Bercow appeared close to tears as he announced the result. The Prime Minister and his senior colleagues immediately faced criticism over the 'grubby' plot – in which they wanted to change the rules to make it easier to remove a Speaker from Parliament. Scroll down for video . John Bercow was close to tears today as MPs dramatically defeated a Tory plot to oust him as Commons Speaker . Mr Bercow earlier insisted he is 'not going anywhere' after it emerged the Tories and Lib Dems have hatched a plot to oust him as Commons Speaker after the election . With help from Labour MPs, Mr Bercow still clings to his position – but he is thought to have been badly damaged by the attempted putsch. As the Speaker glared at the Government front bench following the ambush yesterday, Labour MPs ignored Commons protocol by leaping to their feet and cheering the result. One of Mr Bercow's few friends on the Conservative benches, Charles Walker, wept as he gave a speech in support of the Speaker. Senior Tories said the debacle meant Mr Gove was certain to be moved as Chief Whip after the election. He is being tipped as a potential party chairman. Mr Hague, the Leader of the Commons, was accused of damaging his reputation with what Labour called a 'grubby' and 'squalid' attempt to ambush the Speaker on his final day in Parliament. The Prime Minister, who raced back from an election campaign visit to take part in the vote, also faced criticism from opponents. Mr Cameron, who has a personal feud with Mr Bercow and referred to him as a 'dwarf' in a speech in 2010, was heard declaring as he strode into the Commons: 'I wouldn't miss this for the world!' However, some of the Speaker's friends conceded it was clear that Parliament is bitterly divided over his stewardship. They say he may now need to signal his intention to stand down within the next two years. Former Conservative vice chairman Michael Fabricant, a critic of the Speaker, said: 'The question now being asked by MPs is will Bercow survive the confidence vote on the first day after general election?' Unpopular with senior Tory and Lib Dem ministers because of his intemperate outbursts, critics wanted to replace Mr Bercow with Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle or the DUP's Nigel Dodds immediately after the election. Commons Leader William Hague today defended the move which Labour branded 'petty and spiteful' The coalition parties wanted to change the rules so that MPs who vote to remove a Speaker can do so in a secret ballot. That way critics could try to oust him without fear of reprisal if he survived, making his removal far more likely. The sway of a Speaker over an MP's career is such that few are ever prepared to make public criticisms. The rule change would also have brought the Parliamentary practice of secret ballots in line with elections for the chairmen of Commons committees and those for a new Speaker. Labour sources revealed last night how Mr Bercow gave them extra time to draft MPs back to Parliament in sufficient numbers to save him. With Labour having already let many of its MPs leave Parliament early to take part in election campaigning, it initially appeared the Government would pass the reform with ease. David Cameron was all smiles as he visited a factory with Boris Johnson this morning, but in the Commons his attempt to ambush Mr Bercow dramatically back fired . But Mr Bercow's decision to allow three separate urgent questions gave the Opposition crucial hours to haul MPs back to the Commons. Some 23 Tories also voted against the Government – saving Mr Bercow's skin – including 1922 committee chairman Graham Brady, former leadership contender David Davis and former frontbenchers Bernard Jenkin, Cheryl Gillan and Sir Edward Leigh. The intervention of Mr Walker, the Conservative chairman of the Commons procedure committee, appeared to help swing the vote. He was in tears as he told the Commons he had been 'played as a fool' by Mr Hague and Mr Gove, who had failed to tell him that they planned to spring the move. 'I have been played as a fool and when I go home tonight I will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me and I would much rather be an honourable fool in this and any other matter than a clever man,' the MP said. Mr Hague defended the proposed reform as 'fair, democratic and thus completely justified' and denied it was linked to any 'grudge' against the Speaker. 'I think a secret ballot frees members of this House completely from pressure from their parties or from the chair,' he said. Tory anger at Mr Bercow has been brewing for months, if not years. He has frequently clashed with Mr Cameron, who has often mocked his height. In April last year Mr Bercow tried to humiliate the PM in the Commons by cutting him off mid-sentence. During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs and interrupted by Mr Bercow. As the PM tried to protest that he had not finished, the Speaker hit back: 'He can take it from me that he is finished Mr Bercow also sought to humiliate Home Secretary Theresa May over government plans for a vote on EU powers, including the European Arrest Warrant. He frequently interrupts debates to berate MPs, including frontbenchers. He told Michael Gove to stop 'gyrating around' and teased David Cameron's parliamentary aide Gavin Williamson that his job is to 'fetch and carry notes and to nod and shake his head in the right places'. Tory MP Michael Fabricant has been branded a 'silly man' and Guy Opperman likened to a 'perspiring postman'. Senior Tory MPs got so fed up with John Bercow's rudeness last year that they formed what has been called 'the BBB Club', members of which complain they have been 'Bol****ed By Bercow'. They even created a lapel badge, featuring three bees, which they planned to wear in the Commons. The design of the badge was calculated to poke fun at the Speaker's extreme phobia of wasps and bees, which is said to date back to his childhood.","Prime Minister wanted to ensure secret ballot on Bercow's return .

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister had been in talks to join American TV station NBC as a 'special correspondent', but negotiations for the £400,000 role disintegrated after she was deemed not to have a 'breezy' enough manner. On Friday the 31-year-old stunned in ice-blue Hugo Boss gown at the Disability SnowSport UK Ball, her Mustique tan and dazzling smile hiding what must be serious heartbreak at her latest career effort stalling. And locals in the south-west London borough seemed to be enjoying soaking up the view, too .

The brunette chose a £475 tote bag by Milli Millu, flat suede pumps and a leopard print scarf for her day out . The Vanity Fair Contributing Editor and Ocado magazine columnist, who was catapulted to fame following her sister's wedding to Prince William in 2011, has long been keen to make a name for herself in the U.S. But a source close to NBC says Pippa’s screen trial, which can be watched online, was a flop. In the clip the writer looked uncomfortable as she danced with an aged local in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for no ascertainable reason. And came across as ‘a bit grand, awkward and bored, rather than enthusiastic’, according to one insider. ‘Cringe-worthy’ said another. Not that you would know it from her December 2014 column for the Spectator. Excitedly describing her visit to Wyoming, Pippa gushed about her experience of line-dancing and talked of the 'stunning' mountain scenery. 'Wyoming is real cowboy country,' she continued. 'Everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big, non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards.' Not one to claim the laurels undeserved, she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. 'It’s easy to get carried away with the whole free-riding atmosphere. My dance partner was about 80, and I did my best to keep up,' she continued. 'But it turns out I have two left feet, at least as far as moving to rhythm is concerned.' NBC apparently agreed. On Friday the 31-year-old stunned in ice-blue Hugo Boss gown at the Disability SnowSport UK Ball, her Mustique tan and dazzling smile hiding what must be serious heartbreak at her latest career effort stalling . Pippa even kept her glacial cool in that £750 Hugo Boss number when Heather Mills laid siege to her on the red carpet, jostling for the celebrity glow of a joint photo-opportunity . Ultimately NBC, it is said, was keen not to repeat the expensive mistake it made a couple of years back with Chelsea Clinton. They were concerned that by spending a lot of money on a famous-by-association personality with no apparent aptitude for TV presenting, they would look gullible when that person failed to produce ratings. Friends of Pippa say she didn’t want to move to the U.S. anyway as it would be too far away from Nico Jackson, the 37-year-old investment banker she’s been dating since 2012, who now lives in Geneva.

"A cattle farmer went above and beyond to save a freezing calf by spending an hour with it in a hot tub. Dean Gangwer, 46, from Cutler, Indiana, came up with unusual hypothermia remedy after spotting the animal barely breathing in the snow last week. He told ABC News that he hauled the cow, named Leroy, to his backyard and jumped with it into his heated bath full-dressed. Doting farmer: Dean Gangwer ,46, from Cutler, Indiana, went above and beyond to save a freezing calf by spending an hour with it in a hot tub . Indeed, photographs show Gangwer sat with the creature in the water with his T-shirt on and his spectacles slightly steamed up. In a bid to stop the young cow from drowning, Gangwer is seen supporting his head above the surface. After about 60 minutes the animal was apparently warmed up. Gangwer then carried it into his home and bundled it up in a pile of heated electric blankets. The third-generation farmer says that Leroy's mother wandered away from the herd and gave birth in a snowbank. On the road to recovery: He later carried the animal into his home and bundled it up in electric blankets . Sense of humor: Gangwer joked that Leroy is 'done hot-tubbing' but 'sunbathing is definitely in his future out in the grass' But in freezing weather, the decision to go off alone almost proved fatal for her young. Luckily Gangwer got to the scene just in the nick of time. Leroy is now fully-recovered from the chilly ordeal and has started to nurse. Gangwer joked that Leroy is 'done hot tubbing' but 'sunbathing is definitely in his future out in the grass.' He says luckily his wife loves animals as much as he does and she has cleaned the house after Leroy's impromptu visit. However, Gangwer added: 'She is leaving the hot tub for me to deal will. You never know what you might have to do when you live on the farm.' Many people have applauded the farmer's quick-thinking antics, with one commenter noting in jest: 'You could have just thrown some potatoes, onions and carrots in the hot tub and had dinner.'
