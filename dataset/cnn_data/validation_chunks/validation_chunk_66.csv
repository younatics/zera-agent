"President Barack Obama will make his first trip as president to Kenya, the country of his father's birth. The White House says Obama will visit Kenya in July for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, which brings together business leaders, international organizations and governments. Obama has visited Kenya three times in the past, including once as a U.S. senator, but never as president. Scroll down for video . Then a senator, Barack Obama is pictured here in Kenya in 2006 with Maasai 'mamas.' Basecamp Masai Mara in Mara National Reserve in Kenya is a Scandinavian initiative that aims to develop a partnership with the native Masai people. Obama will visit the country again in July, the White House announced today - his first visit to Kenya since becoming president in 2009 . Obama is pictured here during a 1988 trip at his family home in the Kenyan homestead of Alego. From L to R are Barack Obama, Grandmother Sarah,  Auma Obama (Barack's half sister) and Kezia Obama (Barack's stepmother) In this August 25, 2006  photo Senator Obama is greated by an enthusistic crowd in Nairobi. During the long-promised visit this July, Obama will attend a Global Entrepreneurship Summit in the east African nation . During a trip to other African countries last year, he said he was likely to visit Kenya before leaving the White House. The president's father came to the United States from Kenya for school, where he met Obama's mother Ann Dunham. The couple divorced when the younger Obama was two years old and Barack Obama, Sr. returned to his home country. The elder Barack Obama died more than 30 years ago, though the president has other family still living in Kenya. A controversy during his 2008 campaign for president, and again, albeit to a lesser extent, in his 2012 bid for re-election, was a rumor that Barack Obama the younger was not born in Hawaii as stated and was instead born in Kenya. The charge stems, in part, from a 'fact-checking error' a literary agent made in materials promoting Obama in 1991. The booklet, produced by agency Acton & Dystel stated that Obama was 'born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.' The editor of the text, Miriam Goderich, took credit for the mistake in 2012, telling Yahoo News, 'There was never any information given to us by Obama in any of his correspondence or other communications suggesting in any way that he was born in Kenya and not Hawaii.' The president's father, also named Barack Obama, is a Kenyan native. According to the younger Obama's memoir Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama Sr. met his mother Ann Dunham while attending college in Hawaii. The couple divorced after three years of marriage in 1964, and the president saw his father just one more time after that before his death in a car accident in 1982. The president's first known trip to Kenya, as detailed in his book, was in 1988, when he spent five weeks there. He returned to Kenya in 1992 with Michelle, then his fiance, and again  in 2006 during his first year in the U.S. Senate. The White House said today that Obama would visit Kenya in July for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit - his first trip to his father's homeland since he was elected to higher office in 2008. Some 'birthers' as they are known as continue to believe that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, however, and is therefore ineligible to be president based on constitutional requirements for the office. His first known trip to the country was in 1988, when he spent five weeks there, according to his memoir Dreams from My Father. He returned to Kenya in 1992 with Michelle, then his fiance, and his half sister Auma, and again  in 2006 during his first year in the U.S. Senate. It was not immediately clear whether the president would be accompanied on the July trip by his wife and daughters. The White House would not say on Monday whether Obama would visit with family while in town, either. It made no mention of Obama's personal ties with the country in its announcement but did point out that he has visited sub-Saharan Africa more than any other sitting president. 'Just as President Kennedy’s historic visit to Ireland in 1963 celebrated the connections between Irish-Americans and their forefathers, President Obama’s trip will honor the strong historical ties between the United States and Kenya – and all of Africa – from the millions of Americans who trace their ancestry to the African continent, to the more than 100,000 Americans that live in or visit Kenya each year,' it said in a blog post. Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, last year visited Washington at the invitation of Obama as part of the White House's first-ever Africa Leaders Summit. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu predicted Monday that Obama's trip to Kenya would likely gin up 'hard right' Republicans who still think he was born in the African country. He also suggested that with dwindling time to travel on the government's dime, Obama is more concerned about seeing the world than the United States' national security. 'He’s going to take advantage of the last two years and go to all the places he wants to go,' Sununu said, according to Politico. Making mention of the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran and the instability in Yemen, Sununu told Fox News, 'I hope the president is paying attention there and doing more focus on that than making travel plans.'","Obama will visit in July for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit .

"Smiling for the camera, this photograph depicts one of the happiest moments of Rachel Inglefield's life . The moment she arrived home with her new baby for the first time. But the elated new mother had no idea of the tragedy that would befall her just days later. Crippled by a devastating stroke, Mrs Inglefield was left paralysed, unable to cuddle her newborn son or help care for her young daughter. At the age of just 38 she woke up away from her children on a specialist stroke ward, where she was the youngest patient being treated. But it was the thought of looking after her new baby Jamie, and his big sister Serena, who was 16-months-old at the time, that gave her the motivation to get better. Scroll down for video . In this photograph, Rachel Inglefield had just brought her new baby son Jamie home from hospital, where he was enjoying time with sister Serena. An hour later, Mrs Inglefield suffered a stroke that left her paralysed . Mrs Inglefield spent ten days on a specialist stroke ward, and said the motivation to care for her children inspired her to recover. She is pictured with son Jamie, now three years old . Rachel and her daughter Serena learned to walk together - including reaching their milestone walk to the post box outside their home . She began the long road to recovery, eventually re-learning to walk at the same time as her daughter took her first few steps. Mrs Inglefield, now 41, said: 'It was comical in a way; we both took our first wobbly steps across the living room. 'We held onto each other, walking to the post box, at the end of the road. It was a huge milestone for us both.' To celebrate her recovery, Mrs Inglefield together with Serena and her husband, Ed, completed a half mile walk to raise money for stroke charities. Her stroke has proved the catalyst for reassessing their lifestyle, and they have now given up their high-flying jobs in London and relocated to the sleepy village of Ogbourne St George in Wiltshire. Mrs Inglefield, a PR executive, said: 'I expected my son's birth to be one of the most joyful occasions of my life. The last thing I expected was a life-threatening stroke. During pregnancy, the levels of female hormones rise, causing changes in the blood vessels and the make-up of the blood. During pregnancy the blood pressure can also rise. These changes can increase the risk of stroke. Pregnant women are 13 times more likely to have a stroke than non-pregnant women of the same age. However the risk of stroke in young women is small and strokes caused by pregnancy and childbirth are rare. It has been estimated that a stroke during pregnancy affects eight out of every 100,000 women. Research has shown that the risk of stroke is increased in the last three months of pregnancy and in the six weeks following birth. If you are pregnant and have existing high blood pressure or symptoms of blood vessel disease you should be closely monitored during your pregnancy. Strokes that happen during pregnancy should be treated in the same way as any other stroke. The risk of another stroke occurring in future pregnancies is unknown. It is thought to be a very low risk and it is likely to depend on the exact cause of your first stroke. Source: Stroke Association . 'My doctors tell me pregnancy-related strokes are extremely rare. They think I tore the arteries in my neck, pushing during contractions. 'It is so important to me that Jamie does not in any way feel responsible for what happened. 'He and Serena were my motivation for getting better again. I wanted to cuddle them and look after them, and be their mummy again.' Mrs Inglefield was fit and healthy and had enjoyed a normal pregnancy with her second child, right up to his birth in March 2012. After the labour, Mrs Inglefield developed a severe headache which doctors suggested was due either to constipation or an epidural leak. But 11 days after the birth, she collapsed and lost all feeling down one side. She said: 'I was rushed to hospital for a brain scan but the doctors said they couldn't inject the necessary dye, because I was breast feeding.' Her condition improved and she was sent home. The following night, as she caught up with her supermarket shopping online, she collapsed once more. She said: 'Like all new mums, I had fallen behind with the shopping so I was doing it online when I felt a loud click in my head. The pain was so bad I was violently sick.' Her speech was slurred, she had lost feeling down her left side, and her face and mouth were drooping. She had extreme dizziness which left her unable even to sit up straight. She had suffered a massive stroke. 'I found myself on a stroke unit - at 38, the youngest one there - and I was totally bewildered,' she said. 'I couldn't even let myself think about Jamie. It was too painful. All I wanted was to be with him. I felt guilty; I was letting him down. 'Of course the stroke unit was not suitable for new mothers. I was hormonal, still bleeding, and trying to express milk. All the other patients were elderly and it was horrendous. Mrs Inglefield's stroke caused her and her husband to reassess their lifestyles. They gave up high-flying jobs in London and moved to the sleepy village of Ogbourne St George in Wiltshire to raise their children . Two months on from her stroke, Rachel was strong enough to hold her son alone for the first time . During her pregnancy, Mrs Inglefield suffered headaches, but doctors chalked them up to constipation or an epidural leak . 'There was one advantage - I used my breast pads to cover my eyes when I wanted to sleep!' Ten days later, she was discharged from hospital, but was still unable to walk or use her left side. She was unable to look after herself and could not hold or feed her new baby. Mrs Inglefield said: 'I really worried that we wouldn't bond. My husband was wonderful, looking after the children. But it wasn't the same. I wanted to be there for my son.' She had physiotherapy and rehab classes and began a determined recovery. She said: 'The thought of holding Jamie kept me going. I wanted to be able to hold him myself.' Her daughter, Serena, was sixteen months old and ready to take her first steps - and so mother and daughter began learning to walk together. Mrs Inglefield said: 'She was very wobbly, just like me. We walked across the living room holding onto furniture. 'Our goal was to walk together to the post box outside our home, and when we did it, it was fantastic.' Two months on from her stroke, Mrs Inglefield was strong enough to hold her son alone for the first time. And she and Serena also completed a half-mile fundraising walk. So far the mother and daughter duo have raised more than £30,000 for stroke charities. Mrs Inglefield said her husband, Ed, was 'wonderful', but it pains her that her stroke meant she wasn't able to look after her son when he was a tiny baby. But she is now able to look after her children alone. 'I can't return to work yet, I can't play sport and I get tired easily. But I know I am lucky to be alive,' she said . She said: 'I am still on the road to recovery. I am now able to look after the children on my own, though we have an au-pair to help out and keep an eye on us all. 'I can't return to work yet, I can't play sport and I get tired very easily. But I know I am lucky to be alive. 'Serena is only four years old but she understands when I'm having a bad day, and she'll say: ""mummy head hurt."" 'I feel sad that I don't remember Jamie as a tiny baby at all really. I hope that he won't associate his birth with my stroke. I would hate for him to feel bad or guilty in any way. 'Despite my fears, he and I share a very special bond. 'After all, he was my inspiration for fighting this and getting myself better. I owe my recovery to my two lovely children.'

"A teacher in Ohio has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired 'because he opposed dairy farming, on his personal Facebook page, on his own time.' Keith Allison of Smithville was a second grade title one teacher at Green Elementary School working with small groups of kids who needed extra help with their math and English. According to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday at the U.S. District Court in Cleveland, school administrators told him he his contract wouldn't be renewed because of photos he had posted online showing baby calves in small crates. Keith Allison of Smithville, Ohio, has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired by Green Local School District 'because he opposed dairy farming, on his personal Facebook page, on his own time' Along with the photos, Allison - who is a vegan – had also posted a message voicing his support for animals rights. 'As someone who grew up feeling parental love and support, and now as a parent who gives love and support, I reject the claim that separating babies from loving mothers to raise them isolated in boxes can ever be considered humane,' he wrote on the post. Allison was told by his superintendent that the family that owns this farm had called and complained about it and said they were upset and frightened by the post. 'The fact that their family's farm was in the picture, I guess, is where their complaint was coming from and from what I was told, they were fearful, afraid that someone might come and break their calf crates or free their cows and their children were not safe to be out in their yards,' he told Fox 8. 'During the meeting with my superintendent, I was informed we live in a large agricultural area, which is true, and that a lot of our money for the schools comes through residents of the community and that I needed to be very careful of what i put on (Facebook) because I might offend the community and the economic interests of the community,' said Allison. According to a lawsuit, school administrators told him he his contract wouldn't be renewed because of photos he had posted online showing baby calves in small crates (stock photo) 'I was also told that I could have any personal beliefs I want to have, but if I want to be a strong Vegan advocate, I might want to look into doing something other than teaching.' The lawsuit says the Board of Education of Green Local School District has a policy that teachers cannot speak about issues if members of the community disagree with their views. Allison and the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on his behalf, say the policy is unconstitutional and are suing the district to remove it. They are also asking for back pay and damages and to reinstate him into his old position, even though he was hired at a middle school in the district in January.","Keith Allison of Smithville, Ohio, has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired by Green Local School District 'because he opposed dairy farming'

"Twitter is being sued by a former female engineer who claims she was overlooked for promotion in favour of her male colleagues. Tina Huang's proposed class action for sex discrimination comes as male-dominated Silicon Valley has been rocked by two other high profile lawsuits. In the complaint, filed in San Francisco on Thursday, Miss Huang has accused the microblogging site of discriminating against women in the way it promotes its employees. In the papers, she claims the firm has no formal procedure for posting job vacancies or granting promotions. Twitter is being sued by a former female engineer Tina Huang for gender discrimination . Instead, she says the company relies  on a secretive 'shoulder tap' process that allows few women to achieve the top engineering positions. In the legal papers Miss Huang allegedly argues that 79 per cent of Twitter's leadership team is male, according to Mashable. Miss Hiss Huang complained to Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, pictured . Miss Hunag is one of Twitter's oldest employees after joining the firm in October 2009. She was put on leave after she raised a grievance with CEO Dick Costolo about her lack of promotion and quit in June 2014. 'Despite being one of Twitter's oldest employees, Ms. Huang's career at Twitter was irreparably derailed for making a complaint, court documents says, according to Business Insider. 'After three months without explanation as to the status of the investigation, or mention of any possible time frame for her return to work, she felt she had no choice but to leave the company for the sake of her career.' She is now seeking other employees at the firm who feel they have been passed over for promotion to join her in the lawsuit. A spokesman for Twitter said Miss Huang had resigned and was not forced out. 'Twitter is deeply committed to a diverse and supportive workplace, and we believe the facts will show Ms Huang was treated fairly,' they said. Miss Huang started her legal action as the case was being heard of Ellen Pao, a former partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, who is suing for sexual discrimination. During the high-profile trial in San Francisco she has claimed she was passed over for promotion because she is a woman. She alleges that she was fired in 2012 after she complained. The firm deny her claims of sexual discrimination and harassment. At the weekend a judge denied a request by lawyers for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers to have Pao's demand for unspecified punitive damages thrown out. Judge Harold Kahn said: 'There is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that Kleiner Perkins engaged in intentional gender discrimination by failing to promote Ms. Pao and terminating her employment,' the judge said in the one-paragraph decision. Pao can seek punitive damages that could add millions of dollars to a possible verdict in her favour. She is seeking $16 million in lost wages and bonuses. Meanwhile, Facebook is also facing a lawsuit from former employee and program manager Chia Hong. According to the complaint she has filed with San Mateo Court, she was belittled by her boss for taking time off to volunteer at her children's school, forced to served drinks to male co-workers and told she should have just stayed home to take care of her child. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, pictured left, and Chia Hong, a former Facebook employee, pictured right,  have put the spot light on gender discrimination in Silicon Valley . A Facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and told Recode that the company has made progress in matters related to gender, diversity, and equality. 'In this case we have substantive disagreements on the facts,' the spokesperson said 'and we believe the record shows the employee was treated fairly.'","Female engineer Tina Huang is suing Twitter for gender discrimination .

"The father of murdered bride Anni Dewani has today marked what would have been his daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident. Engineer Vinod Hindocha, 65, was fixing a lift when it plunged to the ground, ripping his right arm off. He underwent a 13-hour operation to reattach his limb after being airlifted to hospital in Gothenberg, Sweden. Today, Mr Hindocha posted a picture on Facebook of himself with two nurses and wife his Nilam, a cake and treats to mark Anni's birthday. She was 27 when she was shot dead on her honeymoon in South Africa. 'Celebrations': Vinod Hindocha marked his murdered daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident. He posted this picture with two nurses and his wife Nilam (left) on Facebook . He wrote: ‘Happy Birthday little Angel. Miss U for ever. We R celebrating this Birthday In Gothinburg  hospital,love U for EVER’ Mr Hindocha was carrying out repairs on March 3 in Sweden when a chain slipped, sending the lift cage he was standing in hurtling to the ground floor. However, his arm was extended outside the cage at the time, meaning it was ripped off just below the shoulder. Mr Hindocha recalls seeing the limb suspended one storey above him after he fell. His brother Ashok, 54, told MailOnline that Mr Hindocha had recovered some movement in his fingers, but will not make a full recovery for at least 18 months, if ever. Vinod Hindocha, 65, was standing in a lift with his arm extending out of the cage when a chain slipped, dropping him to the ground floor . He added: 'He’s such a good person, he’s been through so much. Bad things happen to good people sometimes. 'Nilam and Vinod have had a very difficult few months. 'They are such a strong couple, they will get through this aswell. But it is a lot for anyone to go through. 'We are grateful that he was in Sweden and could get to hospital so quickly and into surgery to try and save the arm. Only time will tell whether the operation will be successful. 'Today is Anni's birthday and that fills the minds and hearts of all the family.' Mr Hindocha's wife Nilam, 64, who is in remission from stomach cancer, was with him in Sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt. The horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by Mr Hindocha in which details of his daughter's murder were recounted in detail. Anni was killed on November 13 2010 while riding in a cab with her new husband, Shrien Dewani, 35, through the impoverished township of Gugulethu, Cape Town. The cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw Shrien out before driving away. The vehicle was discovered the next day with Anni's body in the back seat. She had been shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards taxi driver Zola Tongo, 35, was arrested. He confessed to his part in the death, naming Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack. Mr Hindocha (centre) told family members he saw his severed limb one storey above him after falling. Surgeons reattached the limb, but it will be 18 months before they know whether he will get movement back . The tragedy came after Mr Hindocha saw Shrien Dewani, the husband of his murdered daughter Anni, acquitted of ordering her killing (pictured, Shrien and Anni together before they wed) However, he also said Shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride, claiming he wanted out of the marriage. After years of delays and legal wrangling during which Shrien claimed to be suffering from depression, he was finally extradited to South Africa to stand trial last year. During the short case, the judge heard that Shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies. The trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses, though one of the men serving time in jail for killing Anni, Xolile Mngeni, died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence. Eventually the judge threw the case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions. Anni's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal. The judge threw Shrien's case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions .","Anni Dewani's father Vinod Hindocha is in hospital after a freak accident .

"Holidaymakers seem as keen to work out as chill out when away on breaks, according to a survey, and it may be inspired by fitness-loving celebrities. As many as 47 per cent of Britons would be keen to head off on a fitness holiday, the poll by foreign exchange company Travelex showed. More than a third (34 per cent) booking health holidays are prepared to spend £500 or more on a trip, with more than half reckoning they will get better deals on fitness activities abroad than at home. Model Gisele Bundchen is a keen advocate of maintaining her exercise routine on holiday . TOWIE's Lucy Mecklenburgh has developed a strict fitness regime that centres on hard work and dedication . With a number of celebrities advocating exercise while on holiday, it seems the old adage of a break involving lounging around may be outdated. Model Gisele Bundchen has shared with her Instagram followers a series of photos of her exercising and performing yoga on the beach, and other stars such as Kelly Brook and TOWIE'S Lucy Mecklenburgh are similarly as strict with their fitness routines. Naked yoga, bootcamps and Nordic Walking are among the activities Britons have attempted, with 30 per cent of those keen on a health holiday seeing it as a chance to tone up and 23 per cent to lose weight. Also, 21 per cent wanted to learn a new skill while 17 per cent wanted to concentrate purely on their well-being. In contrast, boozy group trips only appealed to five per cent of the 2,000 people polled. Pop singer Beyonce (left) and model Miranda Kerr practise some yoga while on holiday . Gisele Bundchen (left) performs her take on yoga, with Lady Gaga (right) also doing the exercise . Among destinations for health holidays picked out by Travelex were Bali, Tanzania, Finland and Stockholm in Sweden as well as more traditional places such as the US and New Zealand. Elvin Eldic, from Travelex, said: 'Although the tourism industry has always offered healthy getaways, our research shows that fitness holidays are not only becoming more popular, they're also increasingly destinations where we wouldn't have considered to go on holiday such as Tanzania and Finland.' Travelex have also produced a fitness program that can be adopted on your holiday. This can be viewed here.","More than a third of people willing to spend more on an active holiday .

"The Supreme Court has given a former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duties while she was pregnant. On a 6-3 vote, the justices on Wednesday revived Peggy Young's discrimination claim against UPS and sent the case back to a lower court. The case concerned employers' responsibilities under the 37-year-old Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Atlanta-based UPS maintained that it obeyed the law because it provided light-work duty only in limited situations and did not single out pregnant women. Peggy Young (pictured in December last year), a Virginia woman who lost her UPS job because she became pregnant, speaks to reporters outside the Supreme Court in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court is giving the former UPS driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duty when she was pregnant . But the company changed its policy as of January and said it now tries to accommodate pregnant workers. The justices gave Young another chance to litigate whether UPS should have granted her request for temporary changes in work duties - she asked not to lift heavier packages - after she became pregnant in 2006. Writing on behalf of the majority, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the lower court is required to determine if the employer had 'legitimate, nondiscriminatory, nonpretextual justification' for treating employees differently. Breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of UPS policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities, injuries or otherwise might need accommodations, and asked, 'Why, when the employer accommodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant women as well?' Breyer said there is a 'genuine dispute as to whether UPS provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation cannot reasonably be distinguished from Young's'. The outcome reflects a 'middle ground' that Justice Elena Kagan suggested during arguments in early December. Courts must now re-examine Young's case with a more accepting view of the discrimination claim. A federal district court judge and an appeals court had ruled in favor of UPS, which was backed by business groups in the case. The two sides in the case disagreed over whether UPS agreed to accommodate non-pregnant workers requesting light-duty assignments. UPS and other employers facing similar suits still are able to argue their policies were legal because they were based on seniority or some other acceptable reason. The case concerned whether the package delivery company violated a federal law, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, by denying Young's request. Young, who worked at a Maryland facility, had acted on a midwife's advice that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds (9 kg). Young, now 43, said she dealt almost exclusively with overnight letters, but UPS said its drivers must be able to lift packages weighing up to 70 pounds. Young left the company in 2009. The Virginia woman lost two rounds in lower courts. UPS has since changed its policy, and now says it will try to accommodate pregnant workers. Nine states also have adopted laws directing employers to do so. In recent months, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in Young's situation. Yet the U.S. Postal Service said it has made no change in policy and maintains the practice that UPS has now abandoned. Supporters of Peggy Young, a Virginia woman who lost her UPS job because she became pregnant, attend a rally outside the Supreme Court in DC in December. The justices found in Young's favor on Wednesday .","On a 6-3 vote, the justices on Wednesday revived Peggy Young's discrimination claim against UPS and sent the case back to a lower court .

"An American woman who went on the run for six years rather than face jail over a fatal DUI has been linked to a second death - after allegedly treating a backpacker with an 'African potion' at a backstreet Thai clinic. Kelly Lynn Miller, 36 - a former Alabama stripper and prostitute - was handed a five-year sentence for mowing down truck driver Donald Goodwin, 56, in 2004. Miller was released on $50,000 appeal bond in 2009 but fled to Thailand, where she changed her name to Bea, switched from blonde to brunette and threw away her U.S. passport. Brazen: Kelly Lynn Miller, a 36-year-old fugitive, was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in Thailand . Victim: Brodie Smith went to Thailand with his girlfreind Kara Spark to attempt to kick drugs. He died after taking ibogaine at a 'clinic' run by Victor Cracknell and Mike Picone, his mother and girlfriend said. The fugitive, who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run, was finally captured this week and faces being deported to the U.S. to serve her original five-year jail term. However Daily Mail Online can reveal she is also linked to another fatality involving a man who died after undergoing an experimental drug treatment at an unregistered Thai clinic. Australian Brodie Smith, 33, checked into the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on Koh Phangan island to try to kick his methamphetamine addiction. Miller – a former nanny with no formal medical training - is said to have worked there as an assistant to two American expats. Victim: Miller killed Donald Goodwin, left, when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor-trailer in Alabama in 2004. Miller is pictured right in a mugshot from the time, when she was 26 . Former life: Pictured is the gentlemen's club in Birmingham, Alabama, where Miller allegedly worked before fleeing to Thailand . All three have been accused of administering Smith with ibogaine, a dangerous herbal hallucinogen derived from an African tree. The substance is used in tribal rituals in Gabon and neighboring states where many believe it can be successfully used to cure drug addiction. However, the World Health Assembly warns that its psychoactive properties are highly dangerous, and users say it sends them into a dream-like psychedelic state. Mr Smith's girlfriend Kara Spark, 26, says he stopped breathing shortly after taking his second dose along with another drug - thought to be Valium - during the $5,000 treatment last October. The clinic has denied giving Mr Smith ibogaine, saying the backpacker from Mandurah, Western Australia, injected himself with an overdose of ‘illegal narcotics’. Thailand's Ministry of Health took no action over the death - but Mr Smith's mother Diane Tucker has called on the Australian government to push for a proper inquiry. She has also identified Miller as Bea - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat's principal operators, Mike Picone and Victor Cracknell, both from Buffalo, New York. Mr Cracknell is believed to be the father of Miller’s baby boy, who was born two months ago on the island of Samui. He told Thai authorities he had no idea she was a fugitive, according to the Phuketwan newspaper. Miller was finally snared on the remote island of Koh Lanta, off the coast of Thailand’s Krabi province, following a tip from the U.S. Embassy. Drug clinic boss: Victor Cracknell was one of the two business partners running the Ibogaine 'clinic' where Brodie Smith died. Smith's mother says Kelly Lynn Miller was the woman at the clinic who called herself 'Bea' Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island . Difference: This home in Helena, Alabama, is where Miller lived when the fatal 2004 crash took place . Thai media reported that at around 9am Tuesday local time, an officer with the Tourist Police approached her in the parking lot of a Koh Lanta guesthouse and asked to see her passport. When she was unable to produce the document, the officer arrested her. The pretty fugitive was paraded in front of the press but appeared unconcerned by the media attention, casually reapplying lip-gloss as the cameras rolled. Thai authorities suspect Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to help her make ends meet. But Miller's mother Penney, 70, told Daily Mail Online she ‘laughed’ when she read about the accusations, adding: 'There's no money here to send her.' Unmoved: Miller looked nonchalant, and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in Phuket, Thailand . 'All my dreams now become impossible': Kara Spark, from Mandurah Western Australia, was with her boyfriend Brodie Smith when he tried to 'cure' his drug addiction with ibogaine in Thailand, she said. She went on: 'I only knew she was in Thailand because the U.S. Marshals told me. Other than that all I know is what I hear on the TV. 'She called me a few months back to say ""Mom, I’m pregnant,"" that was the first time I'd heard from her since she left. 'Had I had a chance to speak to her sooner, of course I would have told her to come back and turn herself in. 'At least I know she's finally coming home.’ Another island: Ko Phangan island was where the unregistered clinic operated by Cracknell and Picone, both from Buffalo, NY, was operating when Brodie Smith died. A third woman there, Bea, has been identified by the dead man's mother as Miller, who was on the run from Alabama . Miller struck and killed Donald Goodwin while driving drunk on Interstate 459 near her home in Hoover, just south of Birmingham, in September 2004. The Florida truck driver had pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking his tires when Miller hit his vehicle and careened into him. Miller was due to go on trial in January 2007 on a charge of vehicular homicide but pleaded guilty. Mission: Dianne Tucker, the dead man's mother, is campaigning for a murder probe into her son's death. She identified Miller as 'Bea', the woman at the 'clinic' when he died . She was set to report to prison but fled Alabama after making a $50,000 appeal bond and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. Probation papers describe her as a former nanny who left her $10-an-hour job to become a ‘self-employed entertainer’ making $4,000 a month. But Daily Mail Online can reveal that the busty divorcee led a seedy double-life as an exotic dancer and prostitute. A law enforcement source said: 'Kelly Miller is a very pretty girl from a good, upper-middle class family. ‘She's not stupid. She's entrepreneurial; she’s a survivor. She is a very good business person with an ability to manipulate men. ‘This business in Thailand fits exactly with the sort of person she is. She was never going to go over there to become a barrister or a newspaper reporter. ‘There’s no doubt she was working here as a prostitute. She probably carried on doing what she was good at in Thailand.’ Miller separated from her ex-husband Brett Street before her fatal DUI crash. Mr Street committed suicide in 2007 but his father Chris, 67, insisted his death had nothing to do with Miller and described her as a ‘pretty, sweet girl’. Former neighbors in the quiet Hoover street where she lived before vanishing overnight remember her less fondly. They told Daily Mail Online they suspected she used her three-bedroom, $350,000 home as a set for porn films. Business: Mike Picone, of Buffalo, NY, was the other business partner in the Ibogaine Thailand Clinic where Brodie Smith went for treatment before he died. Boast: What Cracknell posted on Facebook about what happened at the clinic . One said: 'This isn't the sort of neighborhood where you expect to see a Mercedes Benz or a limo but they would be parked outside her house all weekend. 'I don't know for sure if they were doing porn but people would turn up in all sorts of costumes. 'We would see all women coming and going in cheerleader outfits. The girls were all cute and there were a lot of blondes. 'The men would wear leather trousers and there was even one we saw wearing military fatigues - it was all very entertaining. According to her housemate she was obsessed with facial surgeries. 'She had certainly had her breasts done. They were very big - we called her Jugs.' Quasi-scientific: Victor Cracknell posted these pictures on Facebook of his 'clinic'. It did not have a permanent location but operated from hotel rooms. The mother of an Australasian who died after attending the clinic says Kelly Lynn Miller was involved with it and Cracknell was the father of her baby . Bill Veitch, the chief deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted Miller said she would likely have only served half of her five-year jail sentence for killing Mr Goodwin had she gone straight to prison. With good behaviour he predicts Miller will now serve the full five years - thought probably not any more. ‘If she had stayed here she would have likely been out in less than three years,' he told Daily Mail Online. ‘Now she's got a two-month-old child, honestly I think her capture is a blessing for that child that can now grow up here and a normal life. ‘It really hurt Donald Goodwin’s family when she ran. They are just profoundly grateful to the U.S. Marshals for tracking her down.’ Root: Ibogaine is made from this root, of a plant found on the banks of a river in Nigeria. It is illegal in the United States and Australia and regarded as a severe health risk for its hallucinogenic effects .","Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested on a remote island in Thailand this week after vanishing from Alabama, where she was supposed to be in jail .

"John Prescott was accused of being an 'apologist for terrorism' after saying Britain was to blame for the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers . Ed Miliband was tonight facing growing calls to condemn the Labour peer John Prescott of claims Britain is to blame for radicalising young Muslims into joining ISIS. The former deputy prime minister said the country should 'face up to the fact' that it had somehow pushed already devout youngsters into the throngs of extremism. He added if he was a young Muslim in Britain today, he too 'could be radicalised' because of 'injustice' in Gaza and US drone strikes in Syria. His comments were met with fury by MPs today. Home Affairs Select Committee member Michael Ellis said the Labour leadership needed to criticise the remarks immediately. Former minister Tim Loughton said Mr Prescott was playing into the hands of ISIS and ‘acting as an apologist for terror’. Fellow Conservative MP Conor Burns said Mr Prescott's view was 'half-baked, ill thought-out and sensationalist'. In his weekly column for the Sunday Mirror, Lord Prescott, who last week said Tony Blair's 'bloody crusades' in Iraq had contributed to terrorism, said: 'Isn't it time we faced up to the fact we've played a huge part in making them want to leave Britain and take up arms in a foreign land?' He was referring to a handful of youngsters to have fled the country to join ISIS extremists abroad. Last week three teenage boys were stopped trying to enter the country at the Turkish border. A High Court judge banned another group of youngsters from travelling overseas amid fears they were planning to wage jihad. Rather than blame 'Trojan horse schools', at which he claimed there was 'no proof' of radicalisation, Lord Prescott said of the impressionable teens: 'It wasn't just JIhadi John who radicalised them.' 'If I was a young Muslim watching the social injustice in Gaza where 2,000 people died in a matter of weeks from Israeli bombings, the displacement of millions of people in Syria and the U.S. using drone missiles.... I'm sure I could be radicalised too.' Mr Ellis, a long-standing member of the respected Home Affairs Select Committee, told MailOnline: . ‘We must stand up for our values and defeat extremism – not by apologising but by challenging ideologies which seek to destroy peace and co-operation. ‘John Prescott should focus on that an Ed Miliband should immediately condone these remarks and be clear that these views cannot be justified.’ Mr Loughton said the remarks as ‘extremely dangerous’, adding: ‘John Prescott now appears to be acting as an apologist for terror. ‘I hope Ed Miliband will distance himself from this comments at a time when we need to do everything possible to dissuade young Muslims listening to the poisoned voices of those who try to glamourise a case which characterises itself by murderous barbarism. ‘John Prescott only helps to play into the hands of those who wish to destroy our society and everything that we hold dear.’ Asim Qureshi of campaign group Cage said the masked executioner Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, was a 'beautiful' boy radicalised by the security services . Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, both 15, fled their north London homes in February and were seen on CCTV in Turkey shortly afterwards . Follow Conservative backbencher Mr Burns claimed it was 'one last attempt to make himself relevant'. ‘It is deeply irresponsible for anyone in public life to be suggesting that those who wish to go abroad to make common cause with people who are slaughtering Christians, murdering gay people and whose vowed intent is the elimination of western Liberal democracy. 'To put any of that at the door of the policy of Her Majesty’s government is despicable. Sir Peter Fahy said the parents of jihadi runaways should take more responsibility for their actions . ‘People like Prescott would probably want nothing more than for it to blow up between the Jews and the Palestinians. It’s very damaging.’ His comments were also slammed by members of the Muslim community. 'John Prescott an apologist for terrorism, you could have mistakened (sic) him for Asim Qureshi for I'm Cage,' wrote one user calling himself Shaykh Zahir Mahmood. Asim Qureshi faced a barrage of criticism after describing Mohammed Emwazi, the savage ISIS executioner known as Jihadi John, as a 'beautiful man.' Speaking on behalf of the terrorist when his identity was revealed last month, Qureshi tried to claim he had been unfairly targeted by police before leaving the UK sometime between 2012 and 2013. Yesterday one of the country's most senior counter-terrorism officers condemned the relatives of three London schoolgirls  after they appeared before MPs to chastise the police. Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, both 15, fled their north London homes in February. They are thought to have joined former classmate Sharmeena Begum in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. Relatives of the three girls said police should have directly informed them that Sharmeena had left the country. Speaking before a Home Affairs Select Committee, they said Scotland Yard should have done more to stop them from following suit. But Sir Peter Fahy of Greater Manchester Police said it was 'ill-advised' to blame the authorities for the radicalisation of youngsters, instead urging their parents to take more responsibility. He condemned families for 'embracing victimhood' when youngsters are reported as having travelled to the war-torn country.","Former deputy prime minister said Britain had to answer for runaways .

"An Illinois Army National Guard soldier vowed to bring 'the flames of war' to America if he was unable  to join ISIS in Syria, while his cousin bragged about gunning down 150 people at a military base disguised in his uniform, federal prosecutors said Thursday. Hasan R. Edmonds, the 22-year-old guardsman, was arrested Wednesday evening at Chicago Midway International Airport trying to board a plane on the first leg of a journey to Egypt. Jonas M. Edmonds, 29, was detained a few hours later his home in Aurora, the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago said. A federal complaint says the plan was for Jonas to carry out an attack at military installation in Illinois after Hasan  left for the Middle East. The pair allegedly visited the base on Tuesday with an undercover FBI agent they met on Facebook to discus their plans. They believed he was an accomplice. Scroll down for video . Jonas M. Edmonds (left) and Hasan R. Edmonds (right) stand in front of an FBI agent as they appear at a hearing at federal court in Chicago. Both have been accused of hatching a plot to attack a U.S. military facility . The alleged plan the pair devised was for Hasan (right) to flee the country and join ISIL while Jonas (left) would have snuck into a base where he trained, disguised in his uniform . According to federal documents, Hasan described the rooms inside and talked about which ones should be hit. They are suspected of plotting an armed attack against a U.S. military facility in northern Illinois where Hasan  had trained. The complaint did not name the facility. A spokesman for the Illinois National Guard, Lt. Col. Brad Leighton, said Hasan was member of Golf Company 634th Brigade Support Battalion, based in Joliet. In Facebook messages to an undercover FBI agent in January, Hasan  said that if he was unable to make it to the Middle East, he would help bring 'the flames of war to the heart' of America and 'cause as much damage and mayhem as possible,' the complaint says. In other social media messages, Hasan said his knowledge of the U.S. military and American psychology would prove helpful in terrorizing Americans, prosecutors contend. Hasan (left) allegedly told an undercover FBI agent on Facebook if he couldn't get to the Middle East he would help bring 'the flames of war to the heart' of America. Jonas (right) told the officials it may be difficult for him to get travel documents . 'If we can break their spirits, we will win,' he said, according to the complaint. He allegedly spoke admiringly of the terrorist attack in Paris on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. 'Honestly, we would love to do something like the brother in Paris did,' he allegedly wrote. Both men face a count of conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, the Islamic State. The conspiracy includes their alleged terrorist plots in the U.S. A conviction carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence. They made initial appearances in a courtroom in Chicago later Thursday. Jonas  kept swiveling in his chair, stroking his beard and, at one point, yawned loudly. Hasan  sat still. Hasan's sister, Manchinique Bates, told the Chicago Sun-Times, 'They aren't terrorists. ... Just because they choose to worship as Muslims does not make them terrorists.' Jonas  allegedly communicated to an undercover agent that it may be difficult for him to get travel documents. This may have been because he has a previous conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery in Georgia. Jonas (pictured left in a mugshot from 2005) served five years in a Georgia prison for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Hasan (right) was a member of the Illinois National Guard's Golf Company 634th Brigade Support Battalion, based in Joliet . Therefore, he said he would stage attacks in the U.S. using AK-47s to kill up to 150 people, prosecutors allege. If he couldn't secure guns, he said he would use anything he could get his hands on, the complaint says. 'I can unleash a lion,' he says. 'What I would need ... honestly nothing. I am prepared to go even if it's with a rock.' Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner said Thursday he was briefed about the investigation Wednesday. He provided no further details. Hasan wasn't on active duty, so any criminal allegation will be addressed by civilian federal authorities, said Leighton, the Illinois National Guard spokesman. Leighton said Hasan Edmonds reported to the Joliet base one weekend a month and that he did two weeks of active duty training — typically in the summer. Hasan Edmonds enlisted in 2011, but had never deployed. He worked as a supply specialist that was part of a logistics unit providing supplies and other services to the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Leighton said. Attorneys Paul Flynn and Jim Graham leave the Dirksen Federal Building in Chicago on Thursday after representing the pair .","Hasan Edmonds was arrested at Chicago Midway Airport on Wednesday .

"Archaeologists are to start digging for another of Britain’s ‘lost’ kings - this time under a school playing field. The team searching for medieval monarch King Stephen, who died in 1154, hope to follow in the footsteps of those who found Richard III. Thousands gathered to witness his burial at Leicester Cathedral yesterday after his discovery under a car park in the city. Archaeologist Dr Philp (left) is searching for medieval monarch King Stephen (right), who died in 1154 and is believed to be buried beneath Queen Elizabeth  school playing field in Kent . The fresh search is set to take place this week 160 miles away in Faversham, Kent. Stephen, grandson of William the Conqueror, was crowned in 1141 after the death of Henry I. His reign was dominated by civil war and he died from illness in 1154 and was buried in the grounds of Faversham Abbey along with his wife Queen Matilda and son Eustace. The abbey was demolished by Henry VIII in 1538 and when it was excavated by archaeologists in 1965 the bones of Stephen were not found. But local archaeologist Dr Brian Philp claims he has located the site of the former’ abbey’s royal vaults and believes an excavation will unearth Stephen’s tomb. Dr Philp, director of the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit, has identified the playing fields at Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School as his resting place. Dr. Philp claims he has located the site of the former’ abbey’s royal vaults and believes an excavation will unearth Stephen’s tomb . Director of the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit, Dr. Brian Philp has identified the playing fields at Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School as his resting place . He said: “I have now relocated the site of the royal vaults. We did not find any human bones in 1965 but the vaults were not fully excavated. “Once we have found the exact location, we may be able to find the bones.” He added: “As Richard III has been so celebrated recently, we want to have a big ceremony and a plaque to commemorate King Stephen. Richard III: Archaeologists are hoping to recreate the success that followed the discovery of the lost king. Thousands gathered to witness his burial at Leicester Cathedral after his discovery under a car park . “After all, Stephen was buried 330 years before Richard III and certainly not in a car park. “We hope the school and the Faversham Society will have a part in this project. This is a crucial historical site in Kent.” Dr Philp hopes to begin excavation of the playing fields this week. Stephen, grandson of William the Conqueror, was crowned in 1141 after the death of Henry I . His reign was dominated by civil war after Matilda I invaded to claim the throne . Nobles and allies quickly deserted King Stephen who had difficulty inspiring loyalty . He was captured at Lincoln in the first year of his reign but later released in a prisoner exchange . In 1149 and 1153 Matilda’s son Henry invaded England to challenge Stephen unsuccessfully . He had had his son Eustace crowned in his own lifetime to secure the throne . The long civil war finally came to an end in 1153 . He died from illness in 1154 and was buried in the grounds of Faversham Abbey along with his wife Queen Matilda and son Eustace .

"Shocking pictures of emaciated kangaroos starving to death show the devastating effects of drought in outback Australia. Cattle farmer Tracey Walker - who lives on a property near Ilfracombe in Central West Queensland, which has been in drought for three years - says the kangaroo population has been hit hard by the crisis in the past two months. 'The kangaroos are really struggling, there's just not one bit of green pick,' Mrs Walker told Daily Mail Australia. 'They're just literally starving to death - it's a mighty cruel death. Cattle farmer and photographer Tracey Walker has captured striking images of kangaroos starving to death . Mrs Walker says kangaroos have been hit hard by Queensland's drought crisis in the past two months . She lives on a property near Ilfracombe, Queensland, which has been in drought for three years. In photos taken this week, she has captured dead and dying kangaroos around her 30,000 acre property . 'You can see where they're digging the roots of the grass to try to find something but it's completely dead. It's just like matchsticks or cardboard, there's no nutrition.' The drought conditions are so bad Mrs Walker was forced to remove all 800 of her cattle off her land 30,000 acre property three months ago. 'This is my second year of not having a proper wet season, I don't expect to see anything substantial growing until January next year - and that's if we get a wet,' she said. She said many of the dams on her property have dried up, and kangaroos get bogged in them. 'The stronger ones have moved on, it's the weak that have been left here. They're the ones that are dying.' Mrs Walker added that the Landsborough Highway, which stretches for 27km from Longreach to Ilfracombe, is covered by kangaroos that have starved to death. Mrs Walker said many of the dams on her property have dried up, and kangaroos get bogged in them . The drought conditions are so bad Mrs Walker was forced to remove all 800 of her cattle off her land 30,000 acre property three months ago . 'They call it the Killing Fields because it's just dead kangaroos on the side of the road that have been hit by cars and trucks,' she said. 'Now they are dying just of starvation, they're not even being hit by cars.' Longreach Regional Council chief Mark Watt said local council workers are increasingly removing bodies of kangaroos that have starved to death from the sides of roads and the outskirts of townships. 'As the drought begins to take hold and as the grass and the herbage reduces the outcomes get quite intense, and more roos are tending to die,' Mr Watt told Daily Mail Australia. 'We can have roos coming into the main town area looking for water, feed or green grass in people's yards. Kangaroos can be seen seeking shelter out of the blistering sun . Longreach Regional Council chief Mark Watt said local council workers are increasingly removing bodies of kangaroos that have starved to death from the sides of roads and the outskirts of townships . Roads can be seen intersecting drought-affected farming areas located in south-eastern Australia . 'They're just poor, innocent animals that haven't got many options. 'It's not surprising that they're just dying from lack of feed and lack of water from the prevailing drought conditions but you just can't do anything about it.' Earlier this month, Longreach Mayor Joe Owens warned that Ilfracombe's water supply may run out within months. The drought has had a devastating effect on the town with farmers forced to destock, families forced to relocated and local businesses struggling to make money. Earlier this month, almost 80 percent of Queensland was officially declared to be in drought. The Bureau of Meteorology said areas of western Queensland are suffering serious to severe rainfall deficiencies – meaning they are recording the lowest 10 percent to 5 percent of records. Mrs Walker said she has been trying to regenerate grass on her property, but kangaroos jump into the paddocks and eat any new greenery . This picture was captured in 2013, before the drought hit. It is the same tree under which Mrs Walker captured dead kangaroos this week .","Queensland cattle farmer has taken striking pictures of starving kangaroos .

"A report  found staff at Homerton Hospital were slow to recognise patients deteriorating, and suffered breakdowns in communication . An investigation into a hospital where four women died in 12 months before or during childbirth has found a series of concerns, it has been revealed. Inspectors from the NHS's London clinical senate found that staff at Homerton Hospital, Hackney, were slow at recognising patients were deteriorating, and identified breakdowns in communication. Their report identified common themes in some but not all of the deaths, including a lack of involvement from consultants. The findings came after two unannounced inspections by the Care Quality Commission, following the death of a fifth woman in January this year, reports the Evening Standard. The first fatality occurred in 2013, when Pat Williams passed away following a Caesarean section procedure which she elected to have. A subsequent report found that she was over 40, obese, had previously miscarried and had a large fibroid in her uterus. Adeline Keh, 40, was the next to die in October the same year after she contracted a fatal infection following a Caesarean at Homerton. She was transferred from the east London medical centre to a specialist heart and lung unit in Cambridge, but died after she refused a blood transfusion because she was a Jehova's Witness. A report into her death found that her refusal 'may have compromised the final medical intervention' in order to save her life. It was listed as a cause of death alongside acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and an infection of the Caesarean wound. The third and fourth deaths occurred in March and June last year, at which point the CQC began investigating, and the London clinical senate was called in after a fifth death in January this year. Such deaths are extremely rare - therefore it was viewed as unusual for a single hospital to have so many deaths in a short period. Adeline Keh, 40, was one of five to die at the hospital, four of which perished in 12 months. She contracted an infection after a Caesarean, and refused a blood transfusion because she was a Jehova's Witness . In the whole of England and Wales in 2013 there were just 47 maternal deaths during pregnancy, childbirth and the six-week period following birth - out of almost 700,000 deliveries. In response to the report, which was made public this week, Tim Melville-Ross, the chairman of Homerton NHS Trust, said: 'This issue is clearly one of real concern to us. We have to devote all of our efforts to learning lessons.' Homerton chief executive Tracey Fletcher added that the report found no 'silver bullet' would have prevented the deaths. In response to the findings, staff at Homerton have been given extra training and consultant cover on wards has been increased to 98 hours a week.","Four deaths occurred from July 2013 to June 2014 at Homerton Hospital .

"A mountain lion that wandered near a southern California shopping center died after being tranquilized by a game warden, officials say. The three-year-old, about 125-pound mountain lion was seen outside of the Macy's at the Promenade Mall in Temecula at about 6am, NBC reports. The Riverside County Sheriff's Department contacted the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety, The Los Angeles Times reports. The lion died while it was being transported. Mountain Lion: A mountain lion (photographed) that wandered near a southern California shopping center died after being tranquilized by a game warden . Truck: A game warden shot the male mountain lion with a tranquilizer dart and moved it to the bed of a pickup truck to be transported to another location for public safety . Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, told the Times that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor. 'What I've learned is that when no one's around and the lion or deer is stuck, you dart them and everything goes fine,' Foy said. 'When you're in the middle of a parking lot and there are lots of people around, and there are police lights, the animal is very stressed, and that's when these sorts of things happen.' The state's fish and wildlife department is investigating if the mountain lion had pre-existing health issues, according to NBC. Stress: Lt. Patrick Foy, a fish and game spokesman, said that it is currently unknown the exact cause of the mountain lion's death, but a combination of stress and the drugs may have been a contributing factor . Rare: spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being darted, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine . A necropsy will be performed on the mountain lion. A spokesman with the department said that it is rare for an animal to die after being struck with a tranquilizer, and when one does, it is usually due to the dart damaging a sensitive area like the spine. 'They tried to do the right thing,' Foy told NBC. 'They have the training and equipment to do the right thing... and it doesn't always work out.' A witness told KTLA that the animal was underneath a trailer for about 45 minutes before authorities arrived. The mall wasn't open, and only a few store employees were around in the early hours. But the mountain lion was reportedly first spotted near a freeway. The animal was not aggressive, the LAT Times reports. Officials say the animal could have made his way to the mall area for a number of reasons including simply looking for a suitable habitat.

"A land, air and sea search was launched by police on Friday after a young surfer reported pulling up the body of a man while in the ocean. The 16-year-old was surfing at Palm Beach at the Gold Coast in Queensland with friends at about 6.30am when he was thrown off his board and found himself tugging up a person's body as he surfaced. 'A 16-year-old boy was surfing with friends, he caught a wave and as he's come up and he's touched something which felt like hair,' A spokesperson for Queensland police told Daily Mail Australia. The 16-year-old surfer told police he had fallen off his board and upon resurfacing, felt something in the water that felt like hair. Upon tugging up the object out of the water, he said he realised it was a man's body . 'He then grabbed at the item and when he pulled up the item he saw the face of someone at which point he panicked, let go of the body and returned to shore. 'He later returned to the water with a friend to try and find the body but they couldn't locate it and contacted police around 8.30 this morning.' Gold Coast Water Police Senior Sergeant Gavin Peachey told the Brisbane Times: 'That's what he [the surfer] believes - there's nothing to confirm that at the moment.' Police immediately launched a search of the area using boats, jet skis and a helicopter; however they have received no reports of a missing person in the area. Abandoned items of clothing were found on the beach, including a Maktec by Makita hat and a white Volcan t-shirt, however they have since been claimed by a member of the public and have been deemed unrelated to the incident. Police responded by launching an land, air and sea search at Palm Beach (pictured) at the Gold Coast in Queensland on Friday, where investigations are still continuing . While the land and air search is continuing into Friday night, the water search has now been suspended. 'Police will reassess tomorrow morning if they will continue the search, they'll probably wait to see if they get reports of anyone missing.

A copy of Irish America magazine features a cover of Clinton, who spoke at the ceremony about long-lasting peace agreements and how they need to happen at a personal level . She spoke about her experience meeting women in Northern Ireland and made the case that their involvement was crucial to cementing lasting peace in the region, along with the Good Friday agreement. She described sitting at a table in Belfast with women from both sides of the conflict and watching as they discovered how much they shared, over cups of tea. 'You cannot bring peace and security to people just by signing an agreement,' she said. 'In fact, most peace agreements don't last.' 'You cannot bring peace and security to people just by signing an agreement,' Clinton said at the ceremony, citing a time when she was having tea in Belfast with women from both sides of the conflict, who had more in common than they realized . She said that when 'the work of peace permeates down to the kitchen table, to the backyard, to the neighborhood, around cups of tea, there's a much greater chance the agreement will hold.' Clinton did not address the controversy surrounding her use of private email during her time as secretary of state at the event. Previous inductees of the hall of fame include former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and media personalities Bill O'Reilly and Chris Matthews.

"Champion skydiver Michael Vaughan has died in hospital following a skydiving accident on Friday. Mr Vaughan, aged in his 40s, had spent more than 24 hours hospitalised in a critical condition after the accident. His family and friends  spent the day by his side in a Gold Coast hospital, hoping and praying for him to pull through. He died after his family made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support. News of his death came after the identity of the woman who died when their parachutes tangled mid-air was confirmed as Briony 'Alana' Clarke. Scroll down for video . Family and friends of Michael Vaughan have taken to social media to wish him well in his recovery as he remains in a critical condition after a skydiving accident near Sydney on Friday afternoon . Mourners have flooded Mr Vaughan's Facebook page with messages since the news of his death broke. 'Fly Free. The world has lost an absolute gentleman,' one post read. 'You shall be remembered as a man with great talent, passion, patience and as someone who never stopped giving in this sport of ours. Thanks for sharing your skills with so many. Fly free and have fun up there and all around us...Massive love and hugs to your family and to Kate,' another read. Tragedy struck when the 29-year-old woman and Michael Vaughan attempted a mid-air manoeuvre on Friday afternoon. This left Mr Vaughan in a critical condition while NSW Police confirmed on Saturday that Ms Clarke died at the scene. Mr Vaughan was taken to hospital and has reportedly survived surgery overnight, according to the Australian Parachute Federation. Tragedy struck when Mr Vaughan and a woman, reportedly an experienced skydiver in her 30s, attempted a mid-air manoeuvre . The woman, which the Herald Sun reports to be Briony 'Alana' Clarke, was killed while Mr Vaughan was taken to hospital . Mr Vaughan's Facebook page was early filled with words of encouragement and photos shared by loved ones worldwide. One friend from the US wrote: 'Vaughny, we ALL need you! Please, fight!' 'Pull through this Vaughany. You are loved by so many my friend,' another friend posted on Facebook. The Australian Parachute Federation issued a statement earlier on Saturday, saying Mr Vaughan 'is in critical condition but has survived the night and is undergoing some more tests'. 'The families of both Kate [believed to be Mr Vaughan's partner] and Michael thank you for your support and messages and are grateful for your prayers,' the statement reads. Mr Vaughan, who is believed to be a champion of the sport, has made more than 10,000 jumps in his career, and is considered one of Australia's best 'canopy pilots'. A woman was killed and a man is in a critical condition following the accident . Emergency services arrived at the scene in Tyagarah, near Bryon Bay, about 3:30pm . Police believe the accident was caused when the parachutes of the skydivers became tangled during the jump . Mr Vaughan's Facebook page has been flooded with words of encouragement and photos shared by loved ones . It is believed the duo was training together when the accident occurred . According to an advertisement posted online, Mr Vaughan held a training course from March 20 to 27. An flier for the event posted by Mr Vaughan read: 'work on your landings or come fly with me.... Or BOTH!!!' Mr Vaughan also shared a group photo of members who were part of his landings course a day before the accident. Among those tagged in the photo was Alana Clarke, who wore a blue jumpsuit. Details emerged that Friday was slated to be a 'flying', course in which participants learnt manoeuvres such as in-flight stalls and high-performance landings. Varying reports have emerged of what happened in the air, but investigators from the Australian Parachute Foundation (APF) now believe the pair collided and became entangled during a dive that required them to fly close together. The trouble started below 3000 feet after the parachutes opened, according to investigators who visited the site on Saturday. Entangled, the pair spiralled towards the Tyagarah farmland, near Byron Bay, and hit the ground about 3.30pm. APF safety and training manager Richard McCooey says there is usually a procedure to use a reserve parachute in the event of a mid-air tangle. Investigations will focus on why that option wasn't used. The South Queensland Parachute Council released an update on Mr Vaughan's condition on Friday night on its Facebook page. 'At the hospital with Michael's family,' the post read. 'He is in surgery for the last two hours and will be there for a few more. His injuries are very severe and we do not know if they are survivable. Please keep praying for him. He has already survived more than they expected him to so that is something.' Another post said the 'entire skydiving nation (is holding) its collective breath'. The pair had been training together at Skydive Byron Bay, according to the AAP. They landed heavily at an airstrip off the Pacific Highway in Tyagarah, after the jump around 3:30pm on Friday afternoon. Michael Vaughan is a champion of the sport and had made more than 10,000 jumps in her career before Friday's tragic accident . 'A group of people jumped. Two of those people's parachutes opened normally but close to each other and they collided after their parachutes opened,' McCooey said, according tothe Daily Telegraph. 'Their parachutes collided, and then what tends to happen is their parachutes become tangled. 'That upsets the normal descent rate of the parachute and they descend faster than they are meant to ... they have impacted the ground very hard.' The pair was treated at the scene by paramedics, however the woman, who has not been formally identified, died. The man has been flown to Gold Coast hospital in a critical condition. Mr Vaughan is considered one of Australia's best 'canopy pilots' and trained other skydivers . 'It's not a common activity within skydiving,' CEO of Skydive the Beach Anthony Boucaut told AAP. 'The canopies dock on each other, they touch each other's parachutes. '(The moves are) part of an internationally recognised competition.' While police investigate the death and the man fights for his life, Mr Boucaut said the crash would reverberate throughout the skydiving community. 'It's a horrific incident, with two highly skilled people,' he told AAP. Mr Vaughan held a training course from March 20 to 27. A post advertising the event from Mr Vaughan read: 'work on your landings or come fly with me.... Or BOTH!!!' 'The gentleman involved in the incident is a world and Australian champion. 'He's regarded highly in the community.' Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the Australian Parachute Foundation would be responsible for investigating the tragedy, with a report to be handed to CASA for review. 'They take carriage of it but we certainly review it all and make any decisions about whether any ations are needed,' he said. Meanwhile, another parachuting accident has left a man in a serious condition in Victoria on Saturday morning. He hit his head and suffered pelvic and leg injuries after a 'rapid descent' and 'hard landing' at Barwon Heads on Saturday, Ambulance Victoria says. The man, who is yet to be identified, was airlifted to the Alfred Hospital in a serious but stable condition. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene, and the man has been flown to a Gold Coast hospital (stock picture) Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the Australian Parachute Foundation would be responsible for investigating the tragedy, with a report to be handed to CASA for review (stock picture)","Champion skydiver died in Gold Coast hospital after 24 hour fight .

"Senior Tories are secretly planning to shore up David Cameron’s leadership if he fails to win an overall majority in May. Loyalist MPs are being privately urged to form a ‘praetorian guard’ around the Prime Minister to protect him from Right-wingers plotting to move against him if he falls short. They are being asked to hit the airwaves in the hours following the election on May 7 to ‘save Dave’ by making it clear they want Mr Cameron to stay on. MPs loyal to David Cameron are secretly planning to shore up his leadership of he falls short at May election . No10 fears disgruntled MPs on the influential backbench 1922 Committee may use a meeting on the Monday after the election to push for a leadership contest. MPs thought to be loyal are being asked discreetly to promise they will help nip any mutiny in the bud. One MP told the Guardian: ‘There is an attempt to form a praetorian guard round David. We are being asked to speak up for continuity and to say that our best option is to keep our leader... to counter the malcontents. 'It would be extremely foolish to replace David. He out-polls our party. The Right just obsess about their issues and never look to the bigger picture.’ The leadership denies it is directly involved in the ‘save Dave’ initiative, but a number of senior ministers, including Chancellor George Osborne and Chief Whip Michael Gove, are understood to have had informal conversations with MPs. Tory high command is even preparing to declare a ‘moral victory’ if – as some polls suggest – Mr Cameron secures more votes than Labour but wins fewer seats. A number of senior ministers, including Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) are understood to have had informal conversations with MPs . Mr Cameron will come under intense pressure to step down if he loses to Mr Miliband, whom many Tories rate as the worst Labour leader since Michael Foot. One Tory MP said Mr Cameron ‘won’t last five minutes’ unless he manages to retain the keys to Downing Street in May. ‘He either wins, or he goes,’ the MP said. ‘He has said himself that if he can’t beat Miliband he doesn’t deserve to be in this game, and he’s right.’ But some senior ministers believe Mr Cameron should stay on if Mr Miliband is only able to cobble together a fragile coalition. In this scenario, they fear the party could be plunged into a destabilising leadership battle in the run-up to a second election that could take place in the autumn. The news came as George Osborne last night predicted he will be re-appointed as Chancellor if the Tories win a second term. He said he did not think this week’s Budget would be his last, suggesting he believes the Tories will win in May – and that David Cameron will let him keep his job. There has been speculation that he might move to the Foreign Office to lead the renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU. But he told LBC radio: ‘This decision belongs to the British people. But I have to tell you, when I was about to walk out the door of No11 and I thought “Is this the last time?” I honestly think it will not be.’ Action hero: Cruise in the movie series Mission Impossible, which Cameron compared himself to . David Cameron has compared himself to Tom Cruise – by saying he will win in his ‘Mission: Impossible’ tussle with Brussels. The Prime Minister says he will succeed in clawing back powers from the EU – just like the Hollywood hero always ‘prevails’ in the hit film series. Speaking yesterday at his final EU summit before the election, he said: ‘I’d make the point that if you watch any of his movies, you’ll find that Tom Cruise normally prevails in the end. He’s a little bit smaller than me but I hope to be just as effective.’ The PM, who is 6ft 1in compared with Cruise’s 5ft 7in, was responding to a comment from European Council president Donald Tusk that achieving renegotiating EU treaties was ‘close to mission impossible’. Mr Cameron also said that a win for Ed Miliband in May would cause arch-federalists on the continent to ‘breathe a sigh of relief’. A Labour victory would cause those who want ever closer union to ‘relax’, because they favour an ‘easy life’, warned the Tory leader. His comments suggest the Conservatives plan to put the issue of Britain’s relations with Europe at the heart of the election campaign. Mr Cameron added: ‘If Ed Miliband comes here in June, there will be no reform and no referendum.’","Loyalist MPs urged to form a 'praetorian guard' around Prime Minister .

"Posing with an AK47 assault rifle over each shoulder, this British student has been named as a 'senior Islamic State commander' responsible for recruiting hundreds of his countrymen. Nicknamed 'al-Britani Afro' because of his hairstyle, rapper Raphael Hostey, 22, has allegedly been instrumental in luring Britons to become fighters or jihadi brides in Syria. The news came as a shock to his neighbours, who remembered him as an innocent-looking 12-year-old boy obsessed with Manchester United. Menacing: A masked Raphael Hostey, 22, brandishes AK47s in a photo on Twitter while wearing a floppy hat . Fresh faced: Hostey was remembered by his neighbours in Moss Side, Manchester, as an innocent boy . Just a few years later he would shun his British upbringing and leave his wife and child to join IS. Posting raps about jihad on Twitter, he has urged young women considering joining IS to 'come as soon as possible'. Hostey's identity was revealed by an alleged Syrian double agent arrested in Turkey, who was involved in recruiting the three teenage girls from east London who flew to Syria last month. Hostey left behind a wife and child to travel to the country in 2013 with two friends, Mohammed Javeed and Khalil Raoufi, both 20. All three were students at Liverpool John Moores University. Javeed and Raoufi are thought to have died in fighting. Hostey, from Moss Side in Manchester, is known among jihadis for his afro hairdo. Under the name Abu Qaqa, he is thought to have used social media to lure many more British recruits to IS, including jihadi brides. In raps posted on Twitter, he has urged video game-loving followers to stop playing 'Call of Duty and Fifa' and come 'to the khalifa' (or head of a Muslim state). He also posed wearing a floppy fisherman's hat with his face covered and assault rifles on each shoulder. Commander: Under the name Abu Qaqa, he is thought to have used social media to lure  British recruits to IS . Football fan: Hostey was remembered as a 12-year-old boy who was obsessed by Manchester United . Since travelling to Syria, he is believed to have risen to the rank of senior commander. Hostey was injured in fighting but has not come home and still brags of his exploits on social media sites. On Tumblr he told 'a sister in London' to contact him privately when she asked for advice on life under IS. Born Raphel Saiho Hostey, he preferred to be known by the more anglicised name Raphael. Yesterday, neighbours said he 'loved playing football with other local lads'. They also revealed his family home was raided by police in September, with officers searching it for days. Siful Khan, 27, who lived opposite the red-brick semi for 15 years, said he was 'shocked' to hear about Hostey's alleged activities, adding: 'He used to wear a Manchester United shirt. He loved them.'","Rapper Raphael Hostey, 22, allegedly involved in luring Britons to Syria .

"North Carolina State University disbanded a fraternity chapter Wednesday following the discovery of a notebook filled with sexist and racially offensive entries in a restaurant off campus. The punishment comes amid recent cases of bad behavior at the University of Oklahoma, Penn State and other schools put fraternities in the national spotlight. University Chancellor Randy Woodson announced that the Tau Chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity was disbanded, effective immediately. The fraternity was ordered to immediately vacate its on-campus house. North Carolina State University disbanded Pi Kappa Phi after a book containing sickening jokes about rape and lynching was found by a female student at a restaurant near the school's campus in Raleigh . The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like: 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching' Besides the lynching line, the book contained the phrase: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' Woodson said 'I hope today's action makes it clear that there is no place for intolerance, sexism and racism at N.C. State. 'I know the poor behaviors we've seen recently by a few in no way represent the strong character and values of our larger student body. 'N.C. State will work hard to ensure these outlying actions never become accepted or tolerated at our university.' Woodson's announcement comes one week after the notebook containing sexist and racist remarks attributed to Pi Kappa Phi fraternity members was found at a restaurant near campus. The book and its contents were then featured by a local television station. A different N.C. State fraternity, Alpha Tau Omega, was suspended earlier this month after details of drug paraphernalia seized from its house surfaced in a search warrant related to a sexual assault allegation. N.C. State responded by temporarily suspending all social events involving alcohol for more than 20 fraternities on campus. Frat said: 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated' The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant . Woodson also called Wednesday for a 'thorough review' of the university's Greek system. The review will assess whether fraternities and sororities are meeting the core values and high behavioral standards of the university, and will focus on a range of issues including sexual misconduct, substance abuse, and diversity and inclusion. Pi Kappa Phi accepted Wednesday's punishment and may be allowed to return to campus with new membership in 2018. 'We appreciate the support and collaboration with the N.C. State administration,' said Mark E. Timmes, the chief executive of Pi Kappa Phi. 'Together, we acted quickly to address this situation and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued.' Pi Kappa Phi had earlier suspended its chapter at N.C. State until the investigation concerning the green book found at a restaurant near the school's Raleigh campus was completed. The contents of the Pi Kappa Phi notebook were first broadcast by television station WRAL. The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like 'If she's hot enough, she doesn't need a pulse.' and 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching.' It also contained the comments: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' and 'I like little girls.' The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant. She said: 'The contents were horrible. 'I wanted to make sure everybody knew this was going on so it could be corrected. 'Frats are looked up to, but this is what they are doing. Pi Kappa Phi accepted Wednesday's punishment and may be allowed to return to campus with new membership in 2018 . Alpha Tau Omega's NC State chapter was suspended earlier this month amid allegations of sexual assault . 'I hope other fraternities are disgusted. 'I hope that if they do have this sort of thing going on in theirs, that they'll realize, whether they want to or not, that they should change, that they shouldn't promote this kind of behavior.' Pi Kappa Phi chief executive officer Mark Timmes earlier called the quotes 'reprehensible and unacceptable'. He said: 'We have sent staff to Raleigh to investigate the circumstances of the situation. 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated. 'We are working closely with the university and have instructed our students to cooperate fully with all investigation efforts. 'We appreciate the university's collaboration in quickly addressing the situation.' N.C. State's alcohol ban doesn't apply to historically black Greek organizations or the Multicultural Greek Council. In announcing the alcohol crackdown, N.C. State said the school also plans training on diversity for chapters and other measures to increase accountability. In the Alpha Tau Omega investigation, a woman called police March 1 to say she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house. She also told officers drugs - including cocaine, ecstasy and prescription pills - were being sold out of the house. Campus police Sgt. J.P. Dye seized drug paraphernalia, a scale and white powder in a small bag during a search of the empty house. Wynn Smiley, Alpha Tau Omega's national chief executive officer, said the fraternity had kicked out a pledge who had white powder and other drug paraphernalia in his room. The student had been associated with the organization for less than a month, Smiley said. He said the national organization conducted its own investigation with a lawyer and other alumni advisers, and the organization believes the woman was exaggerating about drugs being sold and the level of drug activity. He also questioned her credibility on the sexual assault allegation. Smiley said: 'It just didn't line up with what we were finding out.' Kayle Graham, a junior psychology major at NC State, said racism and sexism among students is sad because the younger generation's attitude indicates where the country is heading. She said: 'It's unfortunate that at a college level, students aren't as mature and socially aware as one would like them to be.'","North Carolina State University has disbanded its Pi Kappa Phi chapter .

"Burglars have stolen a collection of 38 pythons after breaking into a flat. They escaped with their haul, including eight pregnant females and 11 young snakes, in two sacks. Merseyside Police are appealing for information after the  Royal Python snakes, which can grow to around 5ft in length, were stolen from an address in St Helens. Stolen: 38 exotic Royal Ball Pythons (pictured) were stolen from the Merseyside flat in two sacks . Thieves forced entry to the flat  last Monday evening and took the snakes. Two men were seen leaving the premises with two sacks before making off in a dark coloured vehicle. Police said the Royal Pythons are non-venomous and extremely unlikely to pose any threat to the public. Officers believe they will be offered for sale to people who are experienced in the handling of snakes locally or via the internet, and that the snakes are unlikely to come into contact with the general public. Detective Constable Neil Henry, from St Helens CID, said: 'This is a large collection of snakes that the victim had been gathering for a while. 'Clearly, there is a specialised market for such snakes and we would appeal to anyone involved in the buying and selling of snakes to look out for any Royal Pythons that they may be offered and consider whether they may have come from this address. The snakes in particular the pregnant and young snakes, need specialist care and can grow to around 5ft in length.

"Dentists are profiting from a huge rise in cosmetic treatment as more of us spend thousands of pounds to get a winning smile. The top-earning private dentists in the UK made a collective turnover of almost £1billion in 2014 – up 22 per cent on 2010 – with treatments including ‘smile analyses’ and sonic polishing, research shows. Analysis by finance provider LDF says the rise is because Britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private treatment. One of the increasingly popular procedures is so-called smile analysis, when a dentist assesses the width of the mouth, its symmetry and the extent to which teeth are even and white. Dentists are profiting from a huge rise in cosmetic treatment as more of us spend thousands of pounds to get a winning smile . The process typically costs £100. But any subsequent treatment such as braces, crowns being fitted on uneven teeth or whitening can be up to £10,000 depending on what a patient decided to have done. Other procedures include sonic clean and polishing – for about £130 a session – which uses air and tiny particles to blast teeth and remove stains caused by coffee, chocolate and wine. Some private dentists have renamed their surgeries ‘spas’, greeting patients with scented candles in the waiting room and offering facials, foot massages and aromatherapy. Separate figures from the British Association of Cosmetic Dentistry estimate the number of people seeking such treatments is growing by 40 per cent a year. Experts say adults are becoming more self-conscious and worry that their personal life and career may be hindered if they don’t have nice teeth. Britons are shelling out thousands of pounds for private dental treatment . Also, medical advances have replaced traditional train-track braces with clear, barely noticeable devices costing £6,000. Many are having these fitted in the run-up to major events where they will be extensively photographed such as family weddings or milestone birthdays. Peter Alderson, of LDF, said: ‘British people have taken to cosmetic dentistry in a big way, and that’s reflected in rising incomes for top dentists. ‘Increasing numbers of dental patients are starting to explore cosmetic treatments like laser whitening, and are willing to pay significant amounts of money for cutting-edge services, especially if they are delivered in a more exclusive, private clinic-style environment. ‘The biggest dental groups are able to invest very heavily in their practices’ equipment, furnishings and IT systems, and that has raised the stakes in the profession markedly. The younger generation of dental clients – those that are more comfortable with paying for cosmetic dentistry – expects enhanced services such as online booking and text message reminders as well as cutting-edge treatments. ‘If dentists want to make the most of the demand for cosmetic dentistry, they need the type of apparatus and environment that brings in clients, but that type of equipment routinely costs tens of thousands of pounds.’ One popular procedure is ‘cosmetic bonding’, in which grey fillings or chipped teeth are painted over to make them almost invisible, costing up to £1,000.

"Ditching green energy targets would save every household in Britain around £214 a year, a report reveals today. The Centre for Policy Studies paper concludes that the rush for renewable energy has been the ‘most expensive policy disaster in modern British history’. Shifting to wind and solar power have hugely increased costs to consumers, while creating an energy supply that is ‘intermittent’. As a result, huge additional investment has been required in backup capacity to cover for when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. Shifting to wind and solar power have hugely increased costs to consumers, while creating an energy supply that is ‘intermittent’ (file picture) And billions more have been spent to connect remote wind farms to the national grid. Author Rupert Darwall concludes that, astonishingly, no British government has conducted a rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits of the renewables target which was first negotiated by Tony Blair at the European Council in 2007. The Government is committed to providing 15 per cent of its energy from renewable power by 2020. Mr Darwall, the author of The Age of Global Warming, concludes that the annual costs of the renewables target is a staggering £9billion. Switching back to a free market in power would save households around £214 a year, assuming that gas replaces renewables, he says. The report says: ‘Energy policy represents the biggest expansion of state power since the nationalisations of the 1940s and 1950s. It is on course to be the most expensive domestic policy disaster in modern British history. ‘By committing the nation to high, cost, unreliable renewable energy, its consequences will be felt for decades.’ ‘In addition to their higher plant-level costs, renewables require massive amounts of extra generating capacity to provide cover for intermittent generation when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine.’ The report concludes that the costs of ‘intermittent renewables’ have been ‘massively understated’. As a result, ‘massively subsidiesed wind and solar capacity floods the market with near random amounts of zero marginal cost electricity.’ ‘To keep the lights on, everything ends up requiring subsidies, turning what was once a profitable sector into the energy equivalent of the Common Agricultural Policy.’ The cost of the national grid has nearly trebled as a result of connecting to remote wind farms, he says. More solar and wind means Britain is having to more than double its overall capacity, because additional sources are needed when wind isn’t working. Without renewable energy, the UK would need 22GW of new capacity to replace old coal and nuclear stations, but as a result of renewable energy, an additional 50GW is required, the report says. the annual costs of the renewables target is a staggering £9billion, according to the report . Abandoning renewables and going back to a market system would save around £6billion a year, or around £214 for every household, he says. But Professor Catherine Mitchell, Professor of Energy Policy at the University of Exeter said the report ‘downplays climate change as a problem’. She said: ‘What is needed is an electricity market that is constructed to best integrate renewable energy and energy efficiency for the benefit of customers, the environment and security.’ Last month, Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced £4billion in new energy deals for wind and solar schemes. It means a guarantee for some 27 new renewable energy projects that they can sell their power at a fixed price until 2040. The subsidised schemes include 15 onshore wind farms, five solar arrays, two offshore wind programmes and five waste conversion plants. It will be paid for by householders through their electricity bills with a subsidy added to the basic cost of electricity. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘We are dealing with a legacy of underinvestment to safeguard people’s electricity supplies now and in the years ahead. ‘The Government’s Electricity Market Reforms are designed to attract up to £100 billion of capital investment that we will need in the sector over the next decade. By creating the world’s first low carbon electricity market, we are going green at the lowest cost, and attracting tens of billions of pounds of infrastructure investment, creating huge numbers of green jobs.’","Shifting to wind and solar power has increased costs to consumers .

"India on Wednesday joined countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, China and Pakistan to support a proposal moved by Russia denying staff benefits to gay couples at the United Nations. The move was defeated as 80 votes were polled against it while 43 countries, including India, backed it. Speaking against the proposal, US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said: “We must speak plainly about what Russia tried to do today… diminish the authority of the UN secretary general and export to the UN its domestic hostility to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) rights.” The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. (File picture) India went with the Russian proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations. The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. But last year, secretary general Ban Ki-moon had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws. The Russian envoy at the UN had strongly advocated in favour of extending the domestic laws to respect cultural differences of the members of the world body. This is also perhaps the reason for India to back the Russian proposal. While Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were the other countries on India’s side, 37 members abstained and 34 did not vote at all. India’s own legal provision on the issue has been subject of much debate. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was struck down in 2009 only to be revived by the Supreme Court last year. There is one last chance for the gay community to get homosexual acts decriminalised by the Supreme Court. After their review petition against the judgment which made gay sex a crime punishable with life was dismissed on January 28, 2014, the activists filed a curative petition before the apex court on April 3, 2014 which it has decided to hear in an open court. The apex court said the government’s indecision and flip-flop on the issue was to be squarely blamed for the situation. The Bench, which ruled that making or changing of a law was the sole prerogative of Parliament, questioned why the government had not acted even 13 years after a Law Commission report sought deletion of the section and there were repeated demands. The court said this proved that the Centre wanted the section to remain in the statute.","India voted to support a proposal by Russia, to deny gay couples working for the UN staff benefits .

"'It'll be hell with a baby', said my friend, mother-of-two, a little bit too cheerfully as I stuffed another wad of nappies into the side of a duffel bag. 'Sand everywhere, mosquitoes, constant re-application of suncream, and jet lag. Why do you think I haven't been on holiday abroad for the last four years?' And with those encouraging words ringing in my ears, my husband, 18-month-old daughter and I were off for our first family holiday... to Costa Rica. We spend our days between the kids pool, which is of course necessary if you want to avoid a heart attack every few minutes, and the beautiful beach . Tal Gottesman braved a long-haul flight to Costa Rica with baby in tow for a family holiday at the Andaz Peninsula Papagayao Resort - but once she arrived, she didn't regret it for a moment . The journey was long, and not direct, and if I'm honest, a little bit painful at times but we miraculously managed to avoid full on meltdowns and a long weekend stopover in New York was lots of fun. Before we knew it, we were disembarking in Liberia, off to the Papagayo peninsula on the northern pacific coast of Costa Rica. Having travelled through the country on rickety buses with backpacks for several weeks on our honeymoon a few years before, this trip was to be all about comfort, ease and relaxation. Any relatively new, tired parents will know that once you've packed the seven thousand items you now seem to need at all times, and faced the joys of a long flight, you may not have the mental or physical capacity for much else. Even though children are well catered for and  welcome, the resort really prides itself on peace and tranquillity . The Andaz Peninsula resort seemed to know exactly what we needed. Good food (and lots of it), cocktails, beautiful spa facilities and incredible views were all on tap - and despite the fact children are brilliantly catered for and more than welcome, the resort really prides itself on peace and tranquillity. Costa Rica's 'Pura Vida' catchphrase resonates throughout the Andaz experience - a hybrid of 'take it easy' , 'hakuna matata', and 'don't worry, be happy', we are told that it is a term that means a lot to the people of this country who try to live by it. While we could have picked a holiday destination closer to home, there's something about being disconnected here, something really unique to this country that we felt on our previous visit and really wanted to feel again. Costa Rica's 'Pura Vida' catchphrase resonates throughout the Andaz experience - a hybrid of 'take it easy' , 'hakuna matata', and 'don't worry, be happy' Nothing is too much trouble at Andaz nothing is stressful, nothing is formal. The staff are miles ahead of other places we've visited in their genuine friendliness, desire to help and can-do attitudes. My toddler, not a fan of sitting still at a breakfast table for more than three or four seconds, was totally indulged as she went wobbling from buffet station to waiter to other guest tables. We actually managed to drink entire hot cups of coffee while watching her wander around - and as any parents of young children will know, that is a privilege not to be sniffed at. This may sound like terrible parenting, but she really was actively encouraged to play and genuinely seemed to disturb no one. It took all the stress out of 'eating out' that we routinely avoid at home by, well, just staying in. Having travelled through the country on rickety buses with backpacks for several weeks on our honeymoon a few years before, this trip was to be all about comfort, ease and relaxation . The resort boasts good food (and lots of it), cocktails, beautiful spa facilities and incredible views on tap . We spend our days between the kids pool which is of course necessary if you want to avoid a heart attack every few minutes, and the beautiful beach. There's much frivolity and splashing around while my husband assumes lifeguard duties and I lie on a sunbed and relax. I do reapply suncream too many times to count, but I truly barely notice. There is also an adults only pool, obviously a necessity for those travelling sprog-free because, let's face it - there are only so many times you can enjoy being hit in the face with an inflatable ball. In the evenings, we order from an extensive room service menu, or take advantage of babysitting facilities and visit one of the three resort restaurants. Standard Rooms at Andaz Peninsula Papagayo Resort start from 400$USD, on a room only basis, excluding taxes. We particularly enjoy the Chao Pescao, where small plates are served in a bar setting and the food is absolutely delicious. We end up eating so well throughout our stay that it is not only my daughter who is sporting a little pot belly upon our return. Nestled among the trees with a view over the spectacular blue bay you are literally living amongst the wildlife here, with monkeys swinging through the trees. The resort's local and celebrated architect, Ronald Zürcher, stayed true to the Costa Rican philosophy when realising his vision for the resort and the end result is that you feel like you are always in outdoors, even when you're not. The rooms are designed with the same values in mind - they sort of 'flow' from the outside in, with vast wall to wall and floor to ceiling windows, and beautiful balconies. We choose a suite, the huge benefit for families being that we get both a bedroom and a living room. In the evenings we are able to put the baby to bed in one room and enjoy the space and surroundings in the other without having to sit in the dark in silence. It is really worth the extra expense. Importantly for parents who haven't had a real rest in months, there is a kids club open every day at the resort with a great selection of toys and games, a playhouse, and plenty of safe outside space . And perhaps most importantly for some parents who haven't had a real rest for many, many months (or years), there is also a kids club open every day with a great selection of toys and games, a playhouse, and safe outside space. The staff are utterly charming and endlessly patient with the exhausting offspring and do a sterling job of occupying them while their parents drink jugs of sangria by the pool (this may or may not have been us). So, what about the suncream and sand, the mosquitoes and the jet lag? I returned home delighted to report to my friend that it was not hell at all. Not even close - I want to do it all again.","Tal Gottesman braved a long-haul flight to Costa Rica with baby in tow .

"Amelia Rose Jones was allegedly murdered by her grandfather Mark Jones - she was only 41 days old . A grandfather allegedly murdered his five-week-old granddaughter as he babysat her because he strongly disliked her father, a court has heard. Mark Jones, 45, is accused of attacking newborn Amelia Rose Jones three times, fracturing her skull and ribs, and causing swelling to her brain. The infant was taken to hospital in 2012 after her grandfather  Jones rang 999, saying she had simply stopped breathing in the lounge of his daughter's three-bed terrace house in Pontnewydd, south east Wales. Paul Lewis, prosecuting, told Newport Crown Court that Jones strongly disliked Amelia's father - Ian Skillern - who had finished his relationship with his daughter Sarah Jones, 25, before Amelia was born. He went on to say the jury would have to decide whether that had been the motivation for the violence against his granddaughter. The court heard the 41-day-old baby had been subjected to violence on at least three occasions - with the fatal blows coming from her grandfather while she was in his sole care. Recalling the incident, Mr Lewis explained that Jones had sole care of Amelia on November 17, 2012 while her mother Sarah went out to the cinema with friends. Before she returned, Jones made a 999 call saying he had gone to make a cup of coffee but came back to find the baby 'panicking for breath'. He said she had been feeding and appeared fine earlier that evening. Ambulance and police rushed to the house while the operator told Jones how to give CPR to his granddaughter. The ambulance crew found Jones in the lounge standing over the lifeless body of  Amelia lying on the floor. She was rushed to Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where medics managed to restore her pulse. But after failing to get her breathing she was quickly transferred for specialist treatment at University Hospital Wales in Cardiff. However doctors could not bring her back to consciousness and said she had suffered catastrophic brain injury. She died on the afternoon of November 19. Mr Lewis said: 'The injuries inflicted upon Amelia included a fracture to the back of her skull, swelling to her brain and multiple fractures to her ribs. Amelia was rushed to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport (pictured) and later taken to University Hospital Wales in Cardiff, where she later died . 'These injuries were all of different ages... and they demonstrate she had been subjected to violence on at least three occasions. But it was the most recent of these injuries to her had brought upon her cause of death. 'The prosecution case is that in the short tragic life of Amelia the injuries which she came by could not have been accidental. 'These injuries were all deliberately inflicted upon her by her grandfather.' Amelia's mother Sarah was initially arrested along with her father but the court heard it soon became apparent to police she had nothing to do with her daughter's injuries. After his arrest, the court was told how Jones changed his story four times during police interviews conducted between November 2012 and July 2014. At first, he claimed Amelia had simply stopped breathing when he left her on the sofa to make a cup of tea on the Saturday night. Mr Lewis said Jones then changed his story to claim he dropped her on the floor on the Friday night after tripping up on a toy penguin - because he learned from his daughter that doctors had discovered Amelia had suffered a fractured skull before her death. But when doctors said the injuries must have taken place on Saturday night he changed his story again, the court heard. He then claimed a teenage boy visiting the house had accidentally dropped Amelia while trying to use his phone. But when the boy told police it was a lie, Jones said he had 'blacked out or fainted' while holding Amelia and had fallen to the ground on Saturday night. Mr Lewis told the jury: 'He has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by telling the police the teenage boy had dropped Amelia. Mark Jones, 45, is being tried before a jury at Newport Crown Court (pictured) after pleading not guilty to the murder of his granddaughter Amelia Rose Jones, who died in November 2012 . 'We submit his detailed and calculated lies show the lengths he is prepared to go to conceal the truth about Amelia's fatal injuries. 'We say consider the repeated, frequent and detailed lies he had chosen to tell about his state of health . 'We say the catastrophic injuries Amelia suffered were deliberately inflicted and Mark Jones is guilty of her murder.' The court heard Jones, of Cwmbran in south east Wales, had been largely absent from his daughter Sarah's life - and only made proper contact with her when she was about 16. In the days leading up to Amelia's death, Sarah said her father had said something 'odd' to her, the court was told. He had said: 'Even though I don't like her dad (Ian), I do not hold grudges against a baby.' The jury was also told Jones had lied at great length to try to ingratiate himself with Sarah - even telling her he had cancer when he did not. 'He told her that he needed surgery and turned up at her home on crutches,' Mr Lewis said. 'He asked his daughter to help him in and out of the bath and supervise him while he appeared to inject himself with medication.' The jury heard that Sarah then began receiving phone calls via a withheld number from a 'Dr Hughes' - who, unbeknown to her, was actually her father putting on a different accent. Mr Lewis said: 'Dr Hughes told Sarah that her father indeed had cancer and was gravely ill and had a limited future. 'This was a cruel deception. There was not even an ounce of truth in what Mark Jones told his daughter. He added: 'The news Sarah was receiving [about his supposed cancer] must have been very distressing for her. 'She felt sorry for her father and allowed him to play an ever-increasing role in her life and the lives of her children which would prove to be a tragic mistake on her part.' Jones has pleaded not guilty to murder. High Court judge Wyn Williams said he expects the trial to go on until the end of April.

"Bill Badger was a hero even before he helped save people's lives during the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting in a grocery store parking lot that killed six people and injured 13, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. The Army veteran died Wednesday morning of pneumonia, according to his wife, Sallie Badger. He was 78 years old. Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived. Loughner is serving seven consecutive life terms in prison. Remembered: In this November 8, 2012 file photo, Bill Badger points his hand in the shape of a gun as he describes the events of the day Jared Loughner killed six people and wounded 13 others, following Loughner's sentencing to life in prison at U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona . Shooting: Bill Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived. A memorial plaque for the shootings is seen on January 8, 2014 . Giffords, who lives in Tucson, said she was sad to learn of Badger's death. She said in a statement 'I'm so sad to learn that Bill Badger has passed away. Bill was not only a great man and a proud Army veteran, he was a hero. On January 8, 2011, Bill was wounded in the head by a bullet from the gun of my would-be assassin. Not even pausing to realize he had been injured, Bill ran towards the shooter and towards danger so that he could help subdue him until the authorities arrived. I believe that Bill helped save lives that morning. And I will always be grateful to him for his selfless, brave actions. 'My heart, thoughts, and prayers are with Bill's loved ones as they mourn the loss of a great man.' Shooter: Jared Loughman is now serving seven consecutive life terms in prison . Rep. Ron Barber also released a statement, which said in part 'The label ""hero"" an be overused, but Bill was undoubtedly one of the true heroes when a gunman opened fire at the shopping center on January 8, 2011. Although he had been grazed by a bullet and was bleeding from his head, Bill disregarded his own well-being and joined two others to stop the gunman. 'Six people died that day and 13 others of us were wounded — but the toll would have been much higher had not Bill taken fast action when the gunman paused to reload. I will forever be grateful for his bravery and the lives he saved.' Sallie Badger said it came as no surprise that her husband had risked his life to help others. The retired Army colonel had spent his entire life doing just that, she said. 'Bill was a hero to many, many people long before he became a hero on Jan. 8. He was very influential in many, many young lives in many ways,' Sallie Badger said. She said Badger was highly involved in the life of their 25-year-old son, Christian Badger. Badger also guided young men into the military and other careers, she said. Bill Badger hailed from South Dakota. He joined the National Guard as a high school junior and went on to have a long, distinguished career as an Army pilot for 37 years. The couple moved to Arizona in 1985 when Bill Badger established the Western Army Aviation Training Site in Marana, just outside of Tucson. On January 9, 2011, Badger told KOLD 'The shooting stopped and I raised up and didn't realize it, but he was right beside me. Right in front of me. And I got to my feet and one of the individuals who was there to see her was on the other side of the walkway, you know, right where he was walking and that individual took a folding chair, folded it and hit him on the back of the head and he moved his head forward so much of the blunt of it came right on the shoulders of his back and when they did that his left arm came out and it was my opportunity. 'I grabbed his left arm and started to twist it back and grabbed him on the shoulder with my right hand another individual grabbed his right hand and together we pushed on him and he went right down on the sidewalk. 'I had a hold of his throat and the guy on the other side had his knee right on the back of his neck, and every time he would struggle, I would squeeze his throat and the guy would put pressure on the back of his neck.' Badger was not permanently injured from the bullet that grazed the back of his head, but he showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, his wife said. The couple embarked on a three-year journey across the country to push for stricter gun laws. 'We wanted desperately to have background checks on every gun that was sold,' Sallie Badger said. 'And Bill just made that his mission.' Assassination: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is seen in this January 5, 2011 file photo - three days before the shooting took place .

"A new Alzheimer’s drug that reverses the damage the disease causes in patients’ brains could ‘change the landscape’ of future treatment, according to researchers. It has already performed so well at early-stage trials involving people living with the disease in the United States that scientists are now in talks aimed at leapfrogging the usual second stage and fast-tracking it for larger trials. Pharmaceutical firm Biogen, which developed the drug, called aduncanumab, wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests by the end of the year. It is not yet known if this will include any from the UK. A new Alzheimer’s drug that reverses the damage the disease causes in patients’ brains could ‘change the landscape’ of future treatment (file picture) There are currently half a million people in the UK living with Alzheimer’s, and as yet there is no cure. ‘A lot of potential Alzheimer’s drugs never quite make it,’ says Biogen spokesman Kate Niazo-Sai. ‘But the results we have seen in a relatively small patient sample are very hopeful. If this was replicated in a further trial, then it could change the landscape for treatment of Alzheimer’s.’ Pharmaceutical firm Biogen, which developed the drug, called aduncanumab, wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests (picture posed by model) The trial shows that aduncanumab significantly reduces amyloid plaque – clumps of protein typically found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. This plaque can lead to the death of nerve cells and loss of brain tissue, causing devastating symptoms such as memory loss and personality changes. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, says the drug could prove an effective – and safe – treatment. He adds: ‘These are very promising early results. It will be important to see results from much larger trials before we can understand how effective this treatment may be.’ The year-long early-stage trial saw 166 patients with mild or early symptoms of Alzheimer’s given either aduncanumab in varying doses, or a placebo. Brain scans revealed that those patients on the strongest dose showed the most significant improvement in amyloid plaque by the end of the trial. Patients were also given a number of ability tests and it was found that those on the highest dose had a ‘significant slowing’ of mental decline, while those taking the placebo declined the most. The findings were unveiled at the 12th international conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases held in the French city of Nice last week.","New Alzheimer's drug reverses the damage disease has on patients' brains .

"Nicky Morgan said young people were facing 'unimaginable' pressure from threats such as revenge porn and cyberbullying . Teachers are to be issued new guidance this week to help children cope with the ‘unimaginable’ pressures of the modern digital age, including cyberbullying, sexting and ‘revenge porn’. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said last night that Personal, Social and Health (PSHE) lessons needed to be improved – and placed at the heart of the curriculum – to give young people the tools to cope with these growing demands. Children will also be taught about consensual sex to help vulnerable girls ‘spot, report and tackle abuse’. Mrs Morgan, addressing the Conservative think-tank, Bright Blue, said the new guidance will be published later this week, in conjunction with the PSHE Association. She added: ‘Let’s be clear, the internet and advance of the digital age are things to celebrate and to embrace. But let us not deny they bring new pressures that require new responses. ‘The pressures young people face today were unimaginable to my generation.’ Mrs Morgan highlighted research that showed two in three 11 to 16-year-olds reported having friends who had been bullied online. She said the bullying can take many forms but there were increasing incidents of abuse, sexting and so-called ‘revenge porn’. She added: ‘The evidence base is still small but in a survey conducted last year, just eight police forces reported 150 allegations relating to revenge porn over a two-year period.’ Explaining the focus on teaching about sexual consent, Mrs Morgan said: ‘In this modern world where many young women, and for that matter many young men, are exposed to so many pressures day in and day out, surely we have a duty to make sure they know they can say no and know how to do it. ‘It does mean telling young people the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship, about when something crosses the line, what they can do about it.’ Ms Morgan said lessons on how to deal with these new online threats, in addition to teching on safe realtionships, needed to be made 'central' to the curriculum (file image) ‘If the revelations of recent weeks have shown us anything it’s that the stakes are too high to let our young people leave school without this knowledge. ‘I don’t pretend for one minute that lessons on consent would have been enough to stop the horrific abuse in Rotherham or Oxford. 'But I will not rest until I know that we have done everything we can to arm young women and particularly the most vulnerable young women with the information they need to spot, report and tackle abuse.’ Mrs Morgan said she was concerned that children were growing up in a world that places ‘huge value on style and arguably not always as much value on substance’. She added: ‘The democratisation of communications opens the world up but brought its own pressures too. 'In research conducted at the start of this year, a third of 11 to 16-year-olds said they felt the pressure to update their social media profiles with pictures or postings that make them look good.’ It has already been revealed that schools are to teach pupils as young as 11 about rape and consensual sex.","Education Secretary Nicky Morgan plans classes on safe relationships .

"A federal judge has been shot outside his house in an apparent attempted robbery, police said. Judge Terrence G. Berg was approached by two men while taking the trash out from his Detroit, Michigan home around 9pm on Thursday. A struggle ensued and the 55-year-old was  shot in the leg. The suspects, thought to be aged between 18 and 20, escaped in a  dark-coloured Dodge Charger. Berg's condition is not known but police said the injury was not life-threatening. Judge Terrence G. Berg (above) was shot in the leg after a struggle near his house in Detroit, Michigan . Steve Dolunt, Assistant Police Chief, said it was not clear whether it was an attempted robbery or failed burglary. 'It happened in front of his house,' he told The Detroit News. Monica Moore, who lives opposite Berg, said she heard screaming and yelling. 'I looked out and I saw there were a fair amount of people there. I could hear the police cars coming and then there was a lot of commotion,' she told the Detroit Free Press. Chief U.S. District Judge Gerald Rosen said: 'While we are relieved to hear that all indications are that Judge Berg will be fine and make a quick recovery, the thoughts and prayers of our entire court family are with him and his family.'

"A schoolboy who missed lessons on doctor's orders has been refused a sixth form place because he did not go to school often enough. Daniel Keyworth, 16, had hoped to continue his studies with A-Levels at Wickersley School in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, after completing his summer's exams. However, the teenager, who has a number of medical conditions and underwent facial surgery twice last year, had his application refused because of his high absence record. 'Last year he had a bit of time off because of his operations and other medical conditions,' said Daniel's mother Tracy, 48. Daniel Keyworth, 16, has been told he cannot sit his A-Levels at Wickersley Academy in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, after missing too many lessons. But his mother, Tracy, pictured, said his low attendance was due to doctor's orders . 'When he's not well, I've always had him to the doctor. It's always been the doctor's advice. 'When they tell me to keep him off school, that's what I do. 'I'm a single parent with no transport, so when he's been at Sheffield Children's Hospital, it takes us three buses each way to get to appointments. 'I've done everything right and in Daniel's interests. That's what makes this so upsetting.' In February last year Daniel had a septoplasty - a corrective procedure to straighten the nasal septum. He needed the same procedure revised in July, when cartilage from his ear was put in his nose. Daniel missed two weeks' school while recovering each time. His other complaints include Raynaud's phenomenon, which affects the blood supply to the fingers and toes, asthma, eczema and a list of allergies. Daniel's mother said she didn't 'really know what to make of it' after her son's application to stay on at Wickersley School, pictured,  was rejected . Tracy, from Rotherham, said it felt like there had been a tug of war between ensuring Daniel went to school and taking care of his ailments. After he was rejected, she said: 'I don't really know what to make of it. 'I've written letters but don't know what else to do. Daniel enjoys school. 'He likes photography, graphics and science and he wants to do A-Levels after his exams. 'He's been getting there, slowly, and doing his best.' Tracy said Daniel's progress had also been hampered by the school losing coursework for graphics and photography. A Wickersley School spokeswoman said: 'We have no comment to make.' The septum is the structure that separates the right and left nostrils in the nose. It is made up of cartilage  at the front and bone further back. The septum is important in maintaining the shape of your nose. If the septum is bent or damaged it can cause a blockage or inflammation within the nose which can turn to mucus and a nasal drip. A septoplasty procedure involves operating inside the nose to straighten the septum. It involves a doctor exposing the bone or cartilage that is causing the blockage. The obstruction is then removed or straightened. Most patients who have the operation, which lasts between 30 minutes and an hour, are able to go home the same day.

"A six-year-old albino boy had his hand hacked off in a savage attack by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft. Baraka Cosmas was sleeping at his mother's house in Kipenda, Tanzania, on Saturday night when a group of men stormed in and grabbed him, police said. They beat up his mother before using machetes to cut off the boy's right hand. A six-year-old albino boy had his hand hacked off in Tanzania in a savage attack by a gang who use body parts for witchcraft . The latest assault comes days after Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a 'disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation'. He said: 'I believe that with close co-operation between the government and society, we will succeed in ending these killings of persons with albinism and rid our nation of this shame.' A police spokesman said: 'The gangsters got hold of the victim's mother, Prisca Shaaban, and beat her severely after she refused to hand over the boy. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete (above) blasted the wave of killings and attacks against albinos as a 'disgusting and big embarrassment for the nation' 'The assailants later used machetes to cut off the boy's right palm and walked out.' Albino body parts are thought to sell for around $600 (£397) with an entire corpse fetching nearly $75,000 (£49,685), a UN expert said. At least 75 albinos have died in the region since 2000. Earlier in the week four people were sentenced to death for the murder of 22-year-old albino woman Zawadi Mangidu. Tanzanian police on Monday banned a planned demonstration by the Tanzania Albinism Society in the country's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, citing security reasons. But Kikwete has said he had agreed to meet albino leaders next week to discuss possible solutions to the killings. The murders have been concentrated in the gold-rich regions and fishing communities surrounding the country's Lake Victoria, where superstitious beliefs are rampant. Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400 often as a result of inbreeding, experts said. In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. Albinos are seen as curses, or 'ghosts' who can be wiped off the face of the earth in many parts of Tanzania. Families are often told to kill the children at birth. Yet, conversely, their body parts are highly prized. Witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches, power and success, if used in potions, while a UN report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets, or would bury them where they are drilling for gold. Fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish. Children are particularly vulnerable - their innocence is highly valued and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them. Most of the time, limbs are taken but a recent report noted that there have been cases where victims were beheaded, or had their genitals, ears, and bits of skin removed. Tongues can also be cut out or the eyes and the heart gouged out. Other types of attacks reported include rape for healing purposes. Possibly, most shockingly, some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed, the more potent the charm.","Baraka Cosmas was sleeping at his family home in Tanzania .

"West Midlands Police received almost 150 calls reporting sightings of witches, ghosts and UFOs over the past five years. Spooked members of the public contacted the force in their droves amid fears of paranormal activity. While the majority required no further police action, one call, made in February 2010 over a reported witch, resulted in an arrest. Over a five year period more than 70 reports of witch sightings and witchcraft were made to police (file image) Spooked residents dialled 999 more than 40 times to report ghost sightings while around 30 calls were placed about UFOs. Almost 80 different reports of witches or witchcraft were filed. Of all the calls made only eight were classified as hoaxes. The rush in reports of paranormal activity was not to be mocked, said police who offered advice on dozens of the cases. 'While the figures can seem amusing, behind some of these 'supernatural' calls may be a deeply troubled individual or a person wasting valuable police time, which would be better spent preventing real crimes,' a spokesman said. 'West Midlands Police always take action against those found to be knowingly making false and malicious calls to the emergency services.' Nick Duffy of the West Midlands Ghost Club said the police had long received calls from panicked members of the public . Nick Duffy, leading light of West Midlands Ghost, believes the surge is down to the increasing popularity of supernatural-themed television programmes. 'When we started in 1989 we were the only one in the Midlands,' he said. 'Six years ago there were 70. I stopped counting after that. 'If you call a paranormal group, they will not come out of your house without something happening - and that is the real problem. 'These figure are also a by-product of Most Haunted and all the American rubbish. 'For people who experience things like poltergeist activity, the police have always been a go-to source.' Among the cases Mr Duffy has been involved with was a woman who thought she had a polar bear or werewolf living in her back garden. 'She hadn't seen it, but had heard growling and scratching around the bins. I asked if it could've been dogs?' Mr Duffy added the popularity of programmes such as Most Haunted (above) had sparked people's interest .","West Midlands Police received 152 calls reporting paranormal activity .

"Sydney has become one of the world's growing  hotspots for ultra-millionaires, outranking the likes of Moscow and Los Angeles, a new report has revealed. Sydney has claimed the 14th spot in a survey of 40 of the most important cities in the world for the wealthy by Knight Frank. Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs) must have a net worth of more than $30 million to qualify for membership of the exclusive rich-list. According to a list of Australia's wealthiest people by BRW, Gina Rinehart, James Packer, Frank Lowy, Harry Triguboff and Anthony Pratt are among some of the country's richest citizens. Sydney has been listed as one of the world's fastest-growing cities for ultra-millionaires with 764 UHNWIs . Billionaire Gina Rinehart  recently listed her extravagant property in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Mosman . Rinehart has an estimated wealth of $20bn, Pratt and family's wealth is estimated at $7bn as is Packer's and Lowy's. Triguboff is thought to have a fortune of over $5bn. Sydney is home to most of Australia's wealth with 764 UHNWIs, followed by Melbourne at 456, Perth at 267, Brisbane at 249 while Auckland  sits at 557. The Knight Frank Wealth Report's annual Attitudes Survey found London remains the single biggest centre for global UHNWIs, followed by Tokyo, Singapore and New York. Still, Knight Frank's head of research and consulting, Matt Whitby, said that over the past 10 years, Australia has grabbed fourth spot in terms of countries with the greatest foreign inflows of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs). 'Of these HNWIs, there were 1,734 UHNWIs living in Australia in 2014, that is, someone with a net worth of over US$30 million. Sydney currently accommodates almost half of these individuals, with the capital cities of Melbourne (26%), Perth (15%) and Brisbane (14%) taking up the balance. The report's Global Cities Survey expanded to 40 cities for the first time, collecting data from 108 major metropolitan centres to rank the UHNWI population numbers. Billionaires James Packer and Anthony Pratt are among the Australia's high-profile wealthiest residents . Harry Triguboff is the founder and managing director of closely-held Meriton Pty and Australia's biggest apartment developer . Sydney has the highest concentration of UHNWIs, and high-profile Australians have maintained their properties across the state. Billionaire Gina Rinehart, from Perth, recently listed her extravagant property in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Mosman. Rinehart's daughter Hope Welker and her husband Ryan previously lived in the stunning harbourside home before moving to New York in 2011.

The Wealth Report's annual Attitudes Survey studied cities where the wealthy congregate, work, invest, educated and spend their leisure time. 'One of the clear trends to emerge from the Global Capital Markets Survey results is the increasingly global nature of private investments,' the report said. 'UHNWIs still hold most of their property investments in their own country, but in the vast majority of the locations surveyed, wealthy private individuals have been increasing the amount invested overseas.' 1.

"Children of smokers may be up to four times more likely to develop heart disease later in life. And the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child's exposure to secondhand smoke, researchers warn. Therefore, the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all, they say. The findings confirm previous research that linked tobacco smoke and toxins with a lasting effect on children's cardiovascular health. The new research confirms tobacco smoke and toxins have a lasting effect on children's heart health . Finnish children were measured for their exposure to passive smoking and whether their carotid arteries - the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to the head, brain and face - had become narrowed or blocked due to plaque build-up in adulthood. Plaque buildup is made up of fatty deposits and other cells that can build up in the walls of the arteries over time, making them thicker (and therefore harder for blood to flow) As plaque continues to build, it can actually narrow or begin to clog arteries. This slow plaque buildup in arteries over time is a progressive disease called atherosclerosis. The study involved children whose blood samples were taken in in 1980 and 1983 as part in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. In 2001 and 2007, ultrasound readings of their carotid arteries were taken. Then in 2014, Finnish researchers measured the participant's childhood blood cotinine levels from samples collected and frozen in 1980. Cotinine is a biomarker of passive smoke exposure. The researchers found that 84 per cent of children from households where neither parent smoked had non-detectable cotinine levels in their samples. However, only 62 per cent of children from households where one parent smoked and 43 per cent of children from households where both parents smoked had blood samples with non-detectable cotinine levels. The dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child's exposure to secondhand smoke, the researchers warn. Therefore, the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all . The risk of developing carotid plaque in adulthood was almost two times (1.7) higher in children who had one or both parents who smoked, compared to children of non-smoking parents. And the risk was elevated even if parents tried to limit their children's exposure, warned the study, published in the  journal Circulation. Children whose parents smoked but didn't limit exposure had almost twice the risk - and those fiull exposed had four times the risk, the study found. Study author Dr Costan Magnussen, of the University of Turku, said: 'Although we cannot confirm that children with a detectable blood cotinine in our study was a result of passive smoke exposure directly from their parents, we know that a child's primary source of passive smoke exposure occurs at home. 'For parents who are trying to quit smoking, they may be able to reduce some of the potential long-term risk for their children by actively reducing their children's exposure to secondhand smoke, by not smoking inside the home, car, or smoke well away from their children. 'However not smoking at all is by far the safest option'. Repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse, a leading doctor has warned. Adam Goldstein, a professor in family medicine, says exposure is as abusive as leaving children unattended in hot car, or drink driving. He claims he was forced to speak out after caring for 'too many children hospitalised with asthma and pneumonia, caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke'. Dr Goldsteimn argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse . His controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. In it, he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse. 'But what if the substance is secondhand smoke?,' he asks. Dr Goldstein, who is director of the tobacco intervention programs in the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, says the damage from smoke is 'as abusive as many other commonly accepted physical and emotional traumas of children'. His comments come after years of caring for children who have suffered severe respiratory illness due to secondhand smoke exposure. In the opinion piece, he writes: 'Scientific research over the last decade has increasingly demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke is not simply a nuisance; it is deadly. 'Secondhand smoke exposure causes multiple diseases in children, including asthma and pneumonia, and results in thousands of avoidable hospitalisations. 'It is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome and may cause lung cancer and heart attacks with repeated exposure. He argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse . 'No safe level of exposure exists . '[Therefore], purposefully and recurrently exposing children to secondhand smoke - a known human carcinogen - despite repeated warnings, is child abuse.'","The dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child's exposure .

"A teenager has been diagnosed with depression after she was hit with a whopping £5,000 holiday phone bill. Lauren Searle, 17, visited Egypt with her family for eight days and mistakenly thought she had a £120 limit on her contract with O2. But when the shop worker, from Bridgwater, Somerset, returned home she was horrified when her mother Sharon - whose name was on the contract - received a £4,908.69 bill. Distraught Lauren - whose family can't afford the repayments - felt so guilty about the bill she went to the doctors and was prescribed anti-depressants. Lauren Searle, 17, pictured with her mother Sharon Searle, after she ran up a £5,000 phone bill in Egypt . Mother Mrs Searle, 51, said: 'My daughter has had to go on anti-depressants since she got the bill. It has really affected her. 'She's been really upset. She didn't realise that this was happening. The contract is in my name and she feels guilty. 'You don't expect your 17-year-old daughter to be on anti-depressants. 'Lauren is really worried that we won't be able to pay it back and the bailiffs will be round. 'They said we can pay £100 a month. That is too much. We can't afford it. We could maybe afford £50, but that would take years. I think they could do more. 'I don't know what to do. I've cried, I've been angry. What the hell will I do? The family flew to Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, for a Christmas holiday on December 22 and Lauren thought she was using the hotel Wifi to keep in touch with friends on Facebook. She was sent a text asking if she wanted to increase her bill limit to £120 - or 200mb of data - and she agreed. The family headed to Sharm El Sheik, Egypt for a Christmas holiday and Lauren chatted with her friends . Lauren, pictured with her mother and her mother's partner Leigh (right), thought her bill was capped at £120 . But when she got a second text later to say she had reached that limit, she agreed to remove the data restriction, mistakenly thinking she still couldn't go above £120. She thought the bill would be more than covered by the £200 she set aside before her holiday, so was astonished to return home to a £3,704.34 bill on January 2. However, not all data she used on her iPhone 6 to browse the web and Facebook was included in the first bill, and it was upped to £4,908.69 on February 27. Lauren is now taking anti-depressant citalopram every day and is nervous the bill will tear the family apart. Mrs Searle, an administrator, who was on holiday with her partner and his son, added: 'If I had known I would have told her to stop. Lauren thought she was still within the £120. She had no idea. 'I just got an email to say the bill was £3704.34. I was so shocked. 'They put it up in February. They said they hadn't included everything in the January bill. When I rang in January saying I needed help they said 'unlucky'. 'I was ringing them every day. How do you bill for something in January and then again in February?' She had set aside £200 for her bill while she was abroad, but the family now face years of paying it off . Since the huge bill was sent, O2 has slightly dropped the cost to £3,191.97 as a gesture of goodwill. A company spokesperson said: 'To help protect customers from higher costs charged by overseas networks we cap data usage at £40. 'Customers need to tell us if they want to increase this limit and confirm to us again if they want the cap removed completely. 'We received two separate notifications from Ms Searle's mobile asking us to do just that.

"Nick Gordon, the troubled fiancé of Bobby Kristina Brown, has defended himself against allegations that Whitney Houston’s daughter was the victim of foul play, Daily Mail Online can reveal. Speaking to Dr Phil McGraw Gordon, 25, said: ‘I lost the most legendary singer ever and I’m scared to lose Krissy. I want to let all you guys know I did everything possible in the world to protect them.’ Gordon’s impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by Dr Phil last week and due to air today. Weeping and wailing and at times incoherent, Gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by Dr Phil. Gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story. He has felt ‘vilified’ and ‘depicted as a monster’ since January 31 when Bobby Kristina, 22, was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub at the Roswell , Georgia home he and Bobby Kristina shared. Scroll down for video . Breakdown: With his mother, Michelle, by his side Nick Gordon struggles to stay coherent . Troubling preview: A trailer for the interview of Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon by Dr Phil McGraw was released Sunday night. Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil . But on learning of Gordon’s emotional, mental and physical state Dr Phil could not ‘in good conscience’ go on with the interview. According to Gordon’s mother, Michelle, who was by her son’s side during the highly emotional intervention, ‘Nicholas is at a breaking point. He cannot bear not being without Krissy, by her side. He’s dealing with it by drinking. I’ve begged him to stop.’ Dr Phil told Gordon, who admitted to having taken Xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting: ‘Nick, you’re out of control. You’ve threatened suicide. You deserved to get some help because if you don’t, you know you’re going to wind up dead.’ He added: ‘You’ve got to get yourself cleaned up. You got to man up and straighten up.’ Yesterday DailyMail.com revealed that, barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with Dr Phil, Gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk. The disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by Dr Phil as ‘exponential.’ In the show, due to broadcast Wednesday, a weeping and wailing Gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: ‘I’m so sorry for everything.’ Asked if he still intended to kill himself he said: ‘If anything happens to Krissi I will.’ He said: ‘My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.’ In recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills. Gordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.' Instead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab. Dr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.' Gordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive – at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed. She described her son as 'at breaking point.' She said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. 'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Leaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt…and to get clean and sober.' He added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.' Questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub. Just two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events. She posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' Leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show. Tough to watch: The young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . In her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece….We have strong evidence of foul play.' Marks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived. And speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].' Railing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fiancée's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.' According to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier. 'I hate Bobby Brown!' His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . 'Are you drinking?' The emotional man's anger only increases as Dr. Phil asks about Nick's sobriety . Refuses to go: The 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . Resigned: Ultimately, Gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . Then, on 11 February 2012, it was Gordon who tried to resuscitate Whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a Grammy awards party. Speaking to Dr Phil, Michelle said: 'Nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed Whitney. 'He administered CPR [to Whitney] and he called me when he was standing over her body. He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, ""Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs."" Gordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma. It is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina – Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Unlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. In an interview with The Sun  a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone. Sounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on. 'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs. 'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.' Their relationship was also very volatile. 'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her. 'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.' According to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.' Troubled relationship: A friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone .","Dr. Phil McGraw staged a highly-charged intervention with Nick Gordon that will be broadcast on his show today .

"Goldman Sachs has analyzed the spending habits of Millennials and are reaching out to spread the news using the hippest technology it can find, emoji. The multinational released macroeconomic insights into the way that people born in the 1980s and 1990s are buying houses, getting married and using phone apps . However, the firm, which had more than $34.5billion in revenue last year, took the time to condense its findings from Millenials: Coming of Age into a series of 22 cartoon characters on Twitter. Goldman Sachs, which had more than $34.5billion in revenue last year, condensed the life of many Millennials into a string of emojis . Goldman's insights put numbers to well-known trends about Millenials such as the fact that they are holding off on large purchases such as houses, are waiting to get married and buying more products online. The emoji version of a twenty- or thirty-something's life begins with a fresh-faced young boy cartoon added to a stack of books representing his education. When added together this leads to graduation, but a cancel sign next to a tie, presumably referencing graduates' increased difficulties in finding full-time employment in their fields after their studies. Instead, Millennials are met with curved arrow emoji that leads them back to their parents' houses. A series of six clocks the represent how the generation is taking longer than its forerunners to reach milestones such as getting a stable career, getting married, having kids and buying a home, the last six emoji. The tweet also used the hashtags #millennial and #economy. Other insights include the fact that younger consumers are using 'sharing economy' apps to access cars and music without buying them, according to the Goldman report. The investment banking firm released a report compiling information about the spending and lifestyle habits of those born in the 1980s and 90s . Goldman Sachs's report provided figures for the life choices of Millennials, such as waiting longer to get married and live on their own . Only 15 per cent of respondents to a survey said that they thought owning a car was 'extremely important'. Ninety-three per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds plan on owning a home someday, though the younger generation has also seen an increased number of renters. The firm found that the mean marriage age is now 30, rather than 23 for those getting married in the 1970s. A growing number of young people also define healthy living as not smoking or drinking too much, as opposed to just not falling sick. Eighty-three per cent of 12-graders in the study said they disapproved of adults smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, up 13 per cent from 1998. Some of the concepts  too difficult to show in tiny picture form on Twitter. While some may laugh at Goldman's use of emoji as a cute way to gain traction on Twitter, the tiny cartoons have gained an increased seriousness. In January Brooklyn teenager Osiris Aristy was arrested after he posted alleged terrorist threat messages that included a gun emoji pointed towards a police emoji. Aristy's charges were later dropped, though courts and others in official capacities still struggle with how to interpret or use the cartoons, according to Wired. Millenials are forgoing purchases of items such as cars and getting access to expensive goods through apps, according to the Goldman Sachs report . Goldman Sachs (headquarters pictured in Manhattan) found that Millennials are more health-conscious and more disapproving of smokers than previous generations .","Investment banking firm released report Millenials: Coming of Age .

"It is the moment mother Emily Caines feared she would never experience – the ‘lion’s roar’ of her baby’s vital first cry. After she had lost two babies because they were born prematurely, doctors went to extraordinary lengths to ensure baby Lennox would survive. One year earlier, she had delivered her tiny daughter Adelaide at 24 weeks, a baby who tragically lived for just one hour. Despite her overwhelming grief, Mrs Caines allowed a photograph showing Adelaide struggling for life to be published, because she felt so strongly that abortions should not be carried out on babies of a similar age. Other babies born so prematurely have survived, which she believed made ‘a mockery’ of the law allowing abortions until the start of the 24th week of pregnancy. Before 24 weeks, they are not legally considered ‘viable’ – despite recent advances in neonatal care. The tragedy: This was the image that broke our hearts... of baby girl Adelaide who died at 24 weeks . The triumph: This is baby boy Lennox, born to the same mother... who lived at 32 weeks . Doctors had told Mrs Caines that, due to physiological reasons, any child she conceived was unlikely to survive. Her cervix was so short that it would be a miracle if her womb could hold on to the baby long enough – meaning it would probably die after another extremely premature birth. But now Mrs Caines, 26, has realised her ‘impossible’ dream of becoming a mother, giving birth to Lennox at 32 weeks last December, with her husband Alastair beside her. Lennox’s birth came not only after the heartache of losing Adelaide, but also their first baby Isabelle, who was born at 23 weeks in 2011. But thanks to medics at Southmead Hospital in Bristol, the result this time has been triumph instead of tragedy. Describing the moment Lennox erupted into life, Mrs Caines said: ‘Isabelle never cried and Adelaide’s cry was very weak but Lennox’s was like a lion’s roar. ‘We just burst into tears because we finally believed he really was going to be OK. It was amazing.’ Thriving: Young Lennox with mother Emily Caines, who now feels 'totally blessed' She said: ‘There were so many times when I thought, “I’m never going to be a mum, ever. It’s not meant to be.” ‘After Isabelle and Adelaide, we asked ourselves, “Are we going to put ourselves through this again? Are we going to put ourselves through potentially another loss?” ‘But we just had to give it another go. I just couldn’t give up.’ Mrs Caines and Alastair, a 29-year-old security guard, subsequently started IVF in March and she was implanted with the embryo in April. Hero: Professor Tim Draycott holds tiny Lennox shortly after his birth . Crucially, her obstetrician Professor Tim Draycott used medical techniques designed to ‘trick’ her body into avoiding an early labour. At 12 weeks, he put in a cervical stitch to give her womb more support. And at 14 weeks, he started giving her extra doses of progesterone. Explaining why he administered extra progesterone, he said: ‘Progesterone is hugely higher in pregnancy than at other times. This helps to keep the uterus muscle quiet and probably helps reduce inflammation too, so there’s nothing driving it to contract before it should. ‘But we think some women don’t have enough progesterone in pregnancy, so the uterine muscle sparks off. We know that if we give this medication, it reduces the chance of early labour by about 50 per cent.’ Other precautions included prescribing aspirin to help maintain a healthy placenta, as doctors believe a breakdown triggered her miscarriage of Isabelle, and regular screening. And in a highly unusual move, Mrs Caines also spent over a month in hospital when she reached 23 weeks, so medical staff could do everything possible to stop the baby arriving early. Nurses scanned her every 48 hours to monitor the baby and – crucially – measure if her cervix was shortening. If it was, that drastically increased the risk of contractions starting. Thankfully, she did not go into labour – and a week after being discharged, she enjoyed a baby shower party with friends at home in Yeovil, Somerset. She said: ‘It was a huge milestone because I’d lost both my daughters before my baby showers.’ But soon afterwards, her waters began to leak, raising the risk that Lennox could contract a potentially fatal infection. As a result, Prof Draycott and colleagues decided it would be safer to get the baby out rather than continue to 36 weeks, which had been the target delivery date. Before the birth, Mrs Caines was injected with steroids to boost Lennox’s lungs to help him breathe independently after birth, which had been a major concern. It paid off too and he needed no help breathing from his first breathe. Mr and Mrs Caines married on September 8th 2012 in a villa in Portugal. This day was the anniversary of Mrs Caines' first daughter Isabella's birth and death . Five days after the birth, Lennox was transferred from Southmead’s specialist neonatal department to Yeovil Hospital, and he was discharged at three weeks. But his mother admitted: ‘Even now, I feel like Lennox is on loan because it feels too good to be true, that he is actually here. He is now 9lb 1oz, though, and doing great. He’s got some catching up to do, but he’s even started smiling.’ She added: ‘I tried to thank the professor but there weren’t really the words to convey what he has done for us.’ Prof Draycott said he was ‘no cleverer than anyone else’, but had the good fortune to work at Southmead, which has one of the safest maternity units in the country. Looking back on her two earlier births, Mrs Caines said she could not understand how Isabelle could have been legally aborted. ‘Isabelle was born at 23 weeks and called a miscarriage, and Adelaide was born one week later and called a neonatal death – but both my daughters looked exactly the same to me,’ she said. ‘We found the term miscarriage to be offensive. But what really hurt was knowing that this country permits babies like Adelaide and Isabelle to be terminated. I am not opposed to late abortions on medical grounds – if there is something seriously wrong with the baby, or if the mother’s life is at risk. ‘But personally I believe that if an abortion is for social reasons – just because you’ve been lazy with contraception – then I’m 100 per cent sure the 24-week limit is too high. We live in an age where the technology is available to keep a baby alive who is born at 23 or 24 weeks. ‘I know only too well we can’t keep all of them alive, but we can save some. So I think it’s wrong that babies can be aborted when they reach that stage. In my opinion, the limit should be lowered to 16 weeks, because four months is long enough to make up your mind if you want to keep the baby or not. ‘A baby is a baby from the moment you see a blue line on the pregnancy test. I saw Adelaide and Lennox when they were embryos, because they were both conceived through IVF, and to me they were already babies at that very early stage.’ Survival rates among babies born in England at 24 weeks have jumped in recent decades. While only 35 per cent of those admitted to neonatal care survived in 1995, 47 per cent did in 2006, according to a study published in the British Medical Journal in 2012. But only a quarter of those who survive birth before 24 weeks escape major health problems. Emily and Alastair Caines fell in love in the agonising weeks after she lost her first daughter Isabelle . More recent research has found higher survival rates among those born in highly specialist units like Southmead. And the BMJ figures are now almost a decade old – meaning there may have been further improvements in survival rates since then. At around the time that paper was published, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt caused consternation by saying he thought the abortion limit should be cut to 12 weeks. He let slip in an interview: ‘Everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is, and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it.’ His comments caused uproar among ‘pro-choice’ campaigners, who labelled him a ‘hard-line anti-abortionist’, but also from doctors. They said that there was no evidence for halving the time limit and that many abortions were carried out after 12 weeks for sound medical reasons. However, other senior Conservatives have also backed lowering the limit, with Home Secretary Theresa May suggesting 20 weeks, and former Culture Secretary Maria Miller saying it is ‘common sense’ because ‘the science has moved on’. Almost 16,000 abortions in England and Wales – nearly a tenth of the annual total – are performed after 12 weeks. Of those, 2,500 are carried out after 20 weeks but before 24 weeks. Mrs Caines said her newborn son bore such a strong resemblance to Adelaide at birth that she felt he had brought part of her with him. ‘My heart will always be broken for Adelaide and Isabelle, but Lenny has helped me to heal,’ she said. ‘We feel totally blessed now, because we know that there are so many people who will never be in our shoes. We know how lucky we are.’","Emily Caines, 26, lost two babies because they were born prematurely .

"The 21-year-old man who underwent the world's first successful penis transplant has been able to resume a sexual relationship with this girlfriend just five weeks after the transplant. Professor Frank Graewe, who took part in the nine-hour surgery on the South African man, said: 'He gets good quality erections, ejaculates and has frequent sex with his partner.' He said doctors are now also appealing for donors to enable more men to have the operation. Just five weeks after the transplant was carried out by surgeons from Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, the 21-year-old patient was able to have sex with his partner . The operation was carried out by surgeons from Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, using a donated penis. The man, who has not been named, lost all but a 1cm stump of his penis three years ago following a botched circumcision. He received the donated organ harvested from a man who was declared brain dead. Professor Graewe said the recipient had accepted the new organ as 'his own' – and added the skin tone of the donor penis is similar to that of the patient. As part of the procedure, doctors transplanted a new penis, donated by a deceased man. The pictures, left and right, show the veins and blood vessels they connected . 'It will never be 100 per cent similar, because even when the individuals have the same skin colour, complexions differ,' the doctor added. Ten years ago, a man in China received a transplant, but asked surgeons to remove the donated penis two weeks after the operation. Professor André van der Merwe, who led the operation on December 11 last year, had spent years experimenting on cadavers to see which nerves, blood vessels and other elements had to be joined to guarantee full functioning. The procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical South African hospital. The planning and preparation for the study started back in 2010. After extensive research Professor van der Merwe and his surgical team decided to use techniques developed for the first facial transplant. 'There are a number of men who would benefit from this operation but the issue is a lack of donors and also a lack of funding,' he told MailOnline last week. A follow-up operation enabled the young man to urinate normally, without the aid of a catheter, and the doctors said his overall confidence had risen considerably since the procedure. The man has made a full recovery - a result which the doctors did not expect to occur until about December 2016. After the nine hour operation, the man recovered rapidly. The procedure has allowed him to become sexually active again. The picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man's genital region . Professor van der Merwe said they were surprised by the patient's rapid recovery. He said: 'Our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery.' The recipient had sought medical help after being left with a non-functioning stump following a bungled procedure by an inept traditional 'surgeon'. As many as 250 men are estimated to lose their penises each year in a secret and brutal initiation ceremony conducted by the Xhosa tribe in South Africa. During the month of June, which marks the start of a new harvest, thousands of boys are sent naked into remote areas to survive with little more than a blanket and meagre rations. The ritual is known as ukwaluka and has been practiced for generations. The ultimate test of the rite of passage is the process of ukwaluka - the cutting of the penis foreskin that is done by an incibi - a traditional surgeon - which symbolises the beginning of manhood. However, infections and other complications are coming causing the death of scores of teenagers. Each year, there are repeated calls for the ritual to be stopped. Prof Van der Mewe said the success of the procedure meant it could eventually also be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer or as a last-resort treatment for severe erectile dysfunction due to the side effects from medication. Image shows the nerves in the donated penis, which were joined to the man's groin area. This was the first successful operation of its kind, as a previous attempt did not lead to long-term recovery . While full statistics are not available on the number of non medical circumcisions carried out in Eastern and Southern Africa, reports from the World Health Organization show it is as low as 2 per cent in parts of South Africa and up to 35% per cent in Kenya, CNN reports. Professor Van der Merwe said: 'The heroes in all of this for me are the donor, and his family. They saved the lives of many people because they donated the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, skin, corneas, and then the penis.' Professor Graewe said: 'It's a massive breakthrough. We've proved that it can be done – we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had.' 'It was a privilege to be part of this first successful penis transplant in the world.' Nine more patients will now receive penile transplants. The South African Government praised the surgeons who performed the operation. Dr Beth Engelbrecht, head of Western Cape Government Health, said: 'We are very proud to be part of this ground-breaking scientific achievement. 'It is good to know that a young man's life has been significantly changed with this very complex surgical feat. 'From experience we know that penile dysfunction and disfigurement has a major adverse psychological effect on people.'","Man underwent nine hour operation at Tygerberg Hospital, South Africa .

"Recent killings by an unidentified croc slayer in the Northern Territory, who's gone as far as skinning and beheading saltwater crocodiles, has sparked deep concerns among wildlife and conservation groups. One crocodile was recently found at Dundee Beach, southwest of Darwin, which is where a previous two  were brutally mutilated earlier in the month.

Mr Edlund says it is illegal to kill protected wildlife, which include crocodiles, with the maximum penalty being a $74,500 fine or five years behind bars . While it is unknown whether the suspected croc killer is working alone or with others, it is believed a fisherman could be responsible for the recent murders of saltwater crocodiles in the area. NT Parks and Wildlife spokesman Edwin Edlund says he is 'disturbed' by the recent killings.

'If it is the same person who is doing this multiple times, who knows when the next incident will be.' Mr Edlund says it is illegal to kill protected wildlife, which include crocodiles, with the maximum penalty being a $74,500 fine or five years behind bars. Mr Edlund says he receives about 10 reports of such incidents each year, most of which involve firearms. However he says there are no official reports issued by those who found the dead animals on the beach and urged them to come forward. 'We heavily rely on the public to come forward with evidence and report these incidents,' he said. 'So it's very hard for us to pursue any inquiries without reports.' Mr Edlund urged anyone with information to call NT Parks and Wildlife on 0419 822 859 or NT Police on 131 444 . The spokeswoman for NT Crocodile Conservation and Protection Society told Daily Mail Australia she was 'disgusted' by the latest killings and believes the culprit could be a fisherman. Broady, who only revealed her first name, says residents and passers-by have been sending her images of the 'brutal and inhumane' incidents. The most recent being Rachel Maddox who told Broady she discovered the croc on Friday. 'This has gone on forever in the Northern Territory and it's only just getting exposed,' Broady said. 'It happens all the time and it's increasing. It's so unregulated here, it's ridiculous. 'Crocodiles are a protected species but no one cares.

"Patricia Baines, 62, failed to inform authorities that her mother Dorothy passed away in August 1986 and stole almost £70,000 by collecting her pension . A daughter who stole almost £70,000 by collecting her dead mother's pension for  17 years has been spared jail. Patricia Baines failed to inform authorities that her mother Dorothy passed away in August 1986. Officers found £6,000 of the cash hidden in the 62-year-old's shed during a police search, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Baines, of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, was given a 26-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, on Friday after pleading guilty to theft earlier this year. An investigation is now under way to establish where the rest of the money is. Recorder David Chinery said he took account of her personal circumstances and decided not to send her to prison, even though her crime crossed the custody threshold. He said: 'I think you are a vulnerable lady and I am comforted to hear you now have support and are prepared to let people assist you.' Baines stole  £68,211.13 between August 1986 and April 2013, the court heard. Justin Wigoder, prosecuting, said the defendant's father  received the pension under the Nottinghamshire Local Pension Scheme. His wife then claimed a widow's pension until her death, when Baines should have alerted the authorities. Mr Wigoder said Baines abused a position of trust. He said: 'The pension should have ceased. This defendant did not notify Nottinghamshire local government of her mother's death and she carried on receiving over 17 years.' Digby Johnson, defending, said Baines was of good character. He added that she recently let the Salvation Army into her life to help. Recorder David Chinery told Nottingham Crown Court he took of account her personal circumstances and decided not to send her to prison, even though her crime crossed the custody threshold . He said: 'Before, she said she was okay. The reality is she was not. 'She will let The Salvation Army into her home and will accept the support that they can give. I'm confident there is genuine support there.'","Patricia Baines did not tell authorities her mother Dorothy had died in 1986 .

The three-member panel were also told how she even got rid of tea and coffee making facilities to 'undermine staff' and then tried to claim there would be 'retribution' for her suspension. Teacher Heidi Stonely, who taught at the school from September 2010 to August 2011, told the hearing how Miss Gretton had a negative attitude when it came to pupils with special needs. She said: 'In my class, I was teaching a pupil who had learning difficulties and was struggling with her reading and writing. 'The child's family came up in a leadership meeting and it was said her brother left the school without being able to write his name. 'It was said that the only way to talk to him was like a dog and treat him like a dog and Miss Gretton laughed about it. 'Another pupil called a second child 'pom-pom head' and I spoke to the child because it was of a racist nature. 'I reported it to the head and she responded by disciplining the child but then started calling the child ""pom-pom head"" herself. 'She would use words like horrible, nasty and unkind to describe pupils. I saw her slam the door so hard when yelling at a pupil it shook the walls. 'She also called a special educational needs child a freak show.' Another teacher at the school, Elizabeth Bashford, described how Miss Gretton mocked colleagues, claiming one left her job after feeling 'victimised and bullied'. She also claimed the head had been racist about an applicant for a job at the school. Miss Bashford said: 'A vacancy position came up and Miss Gretton said ""why would you send a photo with an application when you look like that?"", referring to an Asian/Indian male. 'Then she went on to mock him with an Asian/Indian accent and took the photo next door and continued the mockery in the office.' The panel also heard from current executive head teacher Philip Palmer. He said: 'In my experience going into the school, people were identified and then bullied. 'A lot of people told me that they wanted to keep their heads down and stay out of it. The hearing was also told how Mrs Gretton had CCTV camerasput in place at Burton Joyce Primary, pictured,  to intimidate staff . 'From the start it was clear that the staff were terrified of the head and they did not trust me to begin with. 'I have found the whole time I was there disturbing that someone could do so much damage. It has been the most difficult two years of my life. 'I did not know anything about the school until about 7.30am the morning before I started. When I got there the school was in a state of disarray. 'The site manager was absent, the grounds maintenance contract was cancelled and the school was a complete disaster zone to be honest. 'Things like the normal structures you would expect were not there like phone recording systems and the health and safety was disgraceful. 'The office manager was away due to the behaviour of Miss Gretton and she told me that herself. 'Things were in place to undermine the staff like there were no tea or coffee facilities and she only had meetings with team leaders and not the whole cohort.' The panel also asked Mr Palmer if he had seen the 'Robertson's golliwog' magnets on a filing cabinet. Burton Joyce Primary School caters fror 350 pupils aged four to 11 and its latest Ofsted inspection rated the school 'inadequate' Mr Palmer replied: 'I removed them immediately after noticing them.. They were completely inappropriate. 'There were allegations or recording devices and CCTV cameras put in place also. The staff were compromised and scared to say anything about what was happening. 'The cabinet was empty and the files were not in the school. 'One of the office staff had seen Miss Gretton on camera with her mother taking black bin bags full of something out of the school and into the boot of her car. 'I was told about messages being passed saying that she knew what was going on and that there would be retribution when she comes back. 'The teachers were scared and worried about these messages.' Allegations against the ex-head teacher related to discriminatory behaviour, inappropriate behaviour towards staff and failure to follow appropriate procedures. Miss Gretton denies all allegations, but was not present at the hearing. It will continue into next week, when further members of staff will give evidence and if the allegations are proved against her, she faces being struck off. Burton Joyce Primary School caters for 350 girls and boys aged four to 11, but in June 2013, the school received a rating of 'inadequate' from Ofsted, the worst possible rating. This led to Notts County Council stepping in, dissolving the governing body and replacing it with the executive board. A follow-up monitoring inspection in the autumn showed improvements had been made.","Margaret Gretton was sacked from Burton Joyce Primary in Nottingham .

"Britain basked in glorious sunshine yesterday – with the country enjoying the hottest day of the year so far. With temperatures soaring to above 17C – and winter seeming a distant memory – parts of the nation were warmer than Mediterranean hotspots Benidorm, Rome and even some of the Greek islands. The mercury topped 17.5C (63.5F) in Murlough, Co Down, Northern Ireland, while in Santon Downham in Suffolk it hit 17.3C. And with spring finally appearing to have sprung, thousands headed outdoors to enjoy the warmth. Full bloom: The flowers were out at historic Hampton Court Palace in East Molesey and visitors flocked to the attraction's famous gardens . Taking a punt: There was traffic on the River Cam where visitors to Cambridge made the most of the glorious sunshine and warm temperature .

Riders enjoyed a hack in the sunshine at Devils Dyke in Sussex yesterday, making the most of the warm temperatures. Forecasters warn it won't last . Sun-seekers flocked to Hampton Court Palace in South West London and the sandy beach at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk – and Britain’s wildlife also made the most of the balmy temperatures. In Central London, swarms of bees feasted on nectar and pollen in St James’s Park, where temperatures rose as high as 16.7C – well above average for this time of year. Elsewhere, visitors in Cambridge punted along the River Cam, while at beauty spot Devil’s Dyke, just outside Brighton in East Sussex, horseriders and walkers explored the countryside. And at Cornwall’s Crealy Great Adventure Park, near Wadebridge, one of the park’s meerkats ventured out to investigate a cravat-wearing toy of Russian meerkat Aleksandr Orlov from the TV adverts. In yet another sign that spring is here, an abandoned newborn lamb was found by a passerby on a roadside in Slough, Berkshire. Compare the meerkat: Jambo the meerkat came face-to-face with his television counterpart Aleksandr Orlova at Crealy Cornwall Great Adventure Park, near Wadebridge .

Locals play volleyball on Brighton beach (left) and a member of the Brighton and Hove Sea Swimming Club goes for a dip in the sea (right) Punting down the River Cam was a popular activity today as the country basked in temperatures about five degrees warmer than the average for this time of year . After being picked up by the un-named Good Samaritan, the baby lamb, nicknamed Larry naturally, was taken in by the Animal Sanctuary UK in Dorney. Diana Coad, head trustee of the sanctuary, said: ‘It was starving, exhausted and emaciated. There was no sign of its mother anywhere after searching for her. ‘He’s not fine but is a lot better than he was. He’s warm and fed and we just hope he will be OK.’ But forecasters warned the warm weather is likely to be short-lived, with more cloud and rain forecast for today and the rest of the week.

Blaise Castle, Bristol looked picturesque today as some of the warmest weather conditions of the year struck Britain . Craig Snell, at the Met Office, said last night: ‘It has been a very plea-sant day for many parts of the UK. ‘Most of the country has seen the warmest day of the year, with the exception of western Scotland, where it has been quite wet. As we go through tomorrow the rain will clear Scotland and make its way south towards England and Wales. ‘Temperatures will return to around average, with highs of 10C to 11C, cooling off a little bit but still not cold by any means, although tonight will be cold, with temperatures close to freezing in many spots if the sky is clear. This week will see quite changeable weather but nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year.’ Yellow ‘be aware’ and amber ‘be prepared’ warnings will be in place until this afternoon for heavy rain over western and central parts of Scotland, which may see up to 8in of rain over 36 hours. The worst hit so far is Glen Shiel in the Highlands, which had 4in in 24 hours up to midday yesterday. The Met Office also warned of high winds in the far north of Northern Ireland and the whole of Scotland from tomorrow morning, with gusts expected to reach 70mph. Bristol basked sunshine and there were in clear blue skies this afternoon, while temperatures in parts of the country inched past 17C .

Baffled by which bloom to buy your mother next Sunday? This map might help. It shows the flowers preferred by mums around the country. So if yours lives in Manchester, go for orange tulips – but purple pansies are top in Aberystwyth. The map was created for Mother’s Day on March 15 by Dobbies Garden Centres. The company quizzed women in 30 cities about their flower of choice. They then created a 10ft map of the UK with 2,000 individual flowers showing which varieties each part of the country preferred. Dobbies boss Andy King said: ‘We know mums love any gift on Mother’s Day, but this may help those who want to give things a little extra thought.’ In ten of the 30 cities surveyed – including Belfast and Leeds – mothers said they loved bright pink roses, while in London pink tulips were top choice. In York, pink lilies are favourites while Wrexham, Coventry and Swansea were the only ones to opt for white lilies. Roses and lilies were the most popular flowers nationwide, followed by tulips, pansies and orchids. The full Top Ten is: 1: Pink roses; 2: Yellow roses; 3: Pink lilies; 4: Yellow tulips; 5: Orange lilies; 6: Pink tulips; 7: Pink orchids; 8: White lilies; 9: Purple pansies; 10: Orange tulips.","Britain basked in sunshine yesterday with temperatures soaring to above 17C and winter seeming a distant memory .

"Pupils at a primary school were banned from watching today's once-in-a-generation eclipse because of 'religious and cultural reasons', it has emerged. Parents of children at North Primary School in Southall, London, said they were 'outraged' by the decision and claimed it showed a triumph of 'religious superstition' over scientific education. Phil Belman, whose seven-year-old daughter goes to the school, met with interim headteacher Ivor Johnstone who said he was unable to elaborate on the decision because of 'confidentiality'. 'It's just going back to the dark ages really. My child went in having spent an hour preparing and making up her pinhole camera,' said Mr Bellman. Parents of children at North Primary School  said they were 'outraged' by the decision to ban children from watching the eclipse, pictured is Mohammed Babar with his daughter Zahra, five, and neice Noreen, seven . 'This is an issue about scientific matters versus religious superstition. I am outraged — is it going to be Darwin next? We will be like mid America. 'I asked the headteacher to elaborate which religions and which cultures? But he said it had to be confidential. He referred us to the formal complaints procedure. 'What is the head's future after all of this? I consider this totally unacceptable. I think he should be considering his position.' Many parents voiced their concerns at the fact they had not been informed of the 'last-minute' decision by the school. Khairoe Islam, whose son goes to the school, said: 'I'm Muslim myself and in my religion it doesn't say we can't watch it. 'I don't know anything about it but if they say it's because of religion maybe they could have spoken to those people who had a problem and let the other kids enjoy it. 'It shouldn't be spoiled for the rest of the school.' Pupils at North Primary School in Southall, London, were banned from watching today's once-in-a-generation eclipse because of 'religious and cultural reasons' Phil Belman, whose seven-year-old daughter goes to the school, said the decision was like 'going back to the dark ages' North Primary School, situated in the Mount Pleasant ward of Southall in Ealing, was rated 'outstanding' in its last Ofsted report in March 2013. But this rating was largely attributed to the 'exceptional' then head teacher Rebecca Hastings, who left her post last Summer. The report said: 'The headteacher provides outstanding leadership based on a clear vision for the school. 'She has taken staff, at all levels, with her on the road to excellence and this is a tribute to her personal dedication and care for others. 'Because she has been able to communicate her vision for the school so well, staff are very well motivated and work exceptionally hard and successfully to make the vision a reality.' After she left, she was replaced by 'interim headteacher' Ivor Johnstone. Harpreet Kaur, whose siblings go to the primary school, said: 'The school didn't say anything to us. 'They told the children it was for religious and cultural reasons and they were told they couldn't see it outside. 'I don't think it was made very clear, even to the teachers. A friend of mine who is a teacher at the school said she didn't understand it. 'I think it was quite a last-minute decision. 'It's a shame because even though it was cloudy there is still the excitement of going outside and having a look. 'There's quite a large Muslim community in the school and someone said it has something to do with that. 'I did some reading up on it but couldn't find anything. Maybe it's some obscure reason.' Mr Johnstone admitted pupils had been prevented from watching the first solar eclipse of this century after 'religious and cultural concerns associated with observing one directly' were raised. It is not yet clear exactly what these concerns are, but Christian ministers have raised fears that this eclipse could signal the end of the world, or a judgement from God. Some Hindu scriptures say that an eclipse makes believers impure. And fundamentalists believe that they need to bathe immediately after an eclipse and chant the name of God to overcome the forces of darkness. Headteacher Ivor Johnstone said he was unable to elaborate on the decision because of 'confidentiality' The headteacher said: 'The school made this decision when we became aware of religious and cultural concerns associated with observing an eclipse directly. 'Although we are sorry for any disappointment, pupils were still able to watch the eclipse on screens in classrooms. However, the overcast conditions in West London today meant they would not have been able to see it live in any case.' Mohammed Babar, whose five-year-old daughter Zahra is a pupil at the school, said: 'There is no cultural reason that I am aware of. If that's what they said then it would surprise me.' Ealing Council confirmed the pupils were not allowed out of their classrooms but said they were able to see the eclipse on TV screens. A spokesman said the council was currently investigating the claims and asked the school for further clarification about why the children were prevented from watching the eclipse. Parents of children at North Primary School in Southall, London, said they were 'outraged' by the decision to prevent children from watching the eclipse . North Primary, which is not a faith school, describes itself online as 'multicultural with a welcoming ethos'. In the summer of July 2014, complaints made by a number of teachers led to an investigation by governors of the school. Sometimes known as Little India, Southall is a diverse community in west London with a large Hindi population. The school has 407 pupils on roll and around 97 per cent speak English as an additional language. A substantial minority of them are refugees and there are a few pupils from traveller families. The news from Southall comes after it emerged that school children across the country were forced to watch the eclipse on TV due to safety fears. The decision by head teachers angered parents, who wanted their children to experience the rare celestial event without sitting in front of a screen. Oldway primary school in Paignton, Devon, is one of the schools which came under  fire for keeping children inside. Head teacher Jane Smythe said she had 700 children to look after and she 'could not guarantee that they would not look at the sun'. Isabel Stevenson, a mother-of-four from Glasgow, added: 'So not happy about secondary school my kids go to doing NOTHING for solar eclipse tomorrow! Livid and furious. I'm on a mission today.' North Primary School, which is non-denominational, is rated as outstanding by Ofsted. Its cultural policy states: 'We are committed to an inclusive ethos based on the respect for and positive acknowledgement of ethnic, cultural and religious diversity. 'We strive to prepare all pupils for living in a multi-cultural, multi-faith and multi-ethnic society and are committed to promoting race equality in all dimensions of the school's life and community.'","Pupils at North Primary School in London banned from watching eclipse .

"A kidnapped journalist who survived  Jihadi John has told of the blood-chilling moment the British extremist ran the cold blade of a sword across his neck in a mock execution at an ISIS prison. Javier Espinosa, a Spaniard captured alongside colleagues while reporting the conflict between President Assad's regime and militant soldiers in 2013, was freed last year after a deal was brokered between his government and front-line extremists. He had spent months at the mercy of Mohammed Emwazi, the British hooded executioner now ominously referred to as Jihadi John, and other terrorists while in captivity. Scroll down for video . Freed: The moment journalist Javier Espinosa was reunited with his son on the tarmac of a Spanish airport after spending months in the captivity of ISIS terrorists . Now, a year after his emotional reunion with his children on the tarmac of a Spanish airport, the correspondent has revealed the depths of horror he and dozens of other hostages faced daily. In an harrowing account printed by the Sunday Times, he relives the moment Emwazi, now the world's most wanted man, ran the cold blade of a sword across his neck, threatening execution. 'He caressed my neck with the blade but kept talking: ""Feel it? Cold, isn't it? Can you imagine the pain you'll feel when it cuts? Unimaginable pain,""' Mr Espinosa wrote. It was, he continued, one of 'several episodes of psychological and physical torture, privations and humiliations' prisoners endured. Emwazi, who 'wanted maximum drama', was among 'psychotic' extremists who pillaged the Spaniard's belongings to put towards a haul of stolen cash apparently so large there were rooms filled with millions of dollars. It was, he continued, one of 'several episodes of psychological and physical torture, privations and humiliations' prisoners endured. Mr Espinosa was snatched with his colleague photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova when the pair were working near the Turkish border in 2013. Mr Espinosa and his colleague Ricardo Garcia Vilanova were kept alongside other hostages for months . Emwazi (right before joining extremists in Syria and left in his trademark hood) was among Mr Espinosa's captors . Alongside American journalists and aid workers including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines, they were locked in ISIS prisons - as Mr Espinosa describes them 'elegant mansions' and the former government headquarters in Raqqa - across the war-ravaged country for months. While their comrades have all but been murdered - John Cantlie is seemingly still alive but in the group's clutches - the two Spaniards were freed, spared to tell the world of the group's atrocities. Among the most horrifying anecdotes was a threat to exhume the body of murdered Russian engineer Sergei Gorbunov and make remaining hostages sleep next to his bullet-riddled head. 'They liked scaring their captives, forcing us to look at photos of Sergei Gorbanov...""You might end up with him,' recalled Mr Espinosa. '""We'll make you dig him up and put you in another tomb where you can sleep with him.""' Being woken by the screams of other hostages as they were tortured in their cells was commonplace. On one occasion, the Spaniard notes, a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive Sharia law. The European and American hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved, Mr Espinosa claims to have been told. Instead they were being picked off one by own, their deaths showcased to the world in barbaric propaganda videos. While the journalist doesn't describe in depth any hopes he had of escaping, he revealed that asking his captors how to pray was among his first actions once taken. In March last year Mr Espinosa, a veteran journalist for the Spanish national newspaper El Mundo, and Mr Vilanova were taken into the care of Turkish authorities after six months of captivity. Once across the border he contacted his newspaper and his wife who later tweeted: 'Pure happiness'. To secure his release the Spanish government is understood to have paid a sum to the terror group. France, Italy, and Germany are other countries to have complied with extremists demands to ensure the release of kidnapped citizens. Britain and the U.S. are the only two to have stayed true to a UN agreement not to give in to such requests. As a result, jihadis claim, a handful of journalists and aid workers from both countries have been slaughtered. His first victim: American journalist James Foley was the first Western citizen to have been killed on film by Jihadi John in a sickening propaganda video . Slaughtered: Britons Alan Henning (left) and David Haines (right) are among the hostages who were savagely murdered by the group . Mohammed Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John . The son of a Kuwaiti minicab driver, young Emwazi arrived in Britain speaking only a few words of English, and appeared more interested in football than in Islam. He went to mosque with his family, who spoke Arabic to each other, but wore Western clothing and became popular with his British classmates at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London. After finishing primary school in 1999, young Mohammed moved to Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John’s Wood, where he is believed to have studied alongside former X Factor judge and pop star Tulisa Contostavlos. Once there, he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional Islamic dress, and his sisters began to wear the hijab. The university has since been linked with several proponents of radical Islam, and Emwazi appeared to have fallen under their sway. He began attending different mosques and was known to associate with Bilal el-Berjawi, who was killed by a drone strike in Somalia three years ago. In August 2009, after his graduation, Emwazi flew to Tanzania in East Africa with friends and told authorities they were going on a wildlife safari. But the group was refused entry and put on a plane to the Netherlands, where Emwazi later claimed he was questioned by an MI5 agent called Nick. The British officer accused him of planning to travel to Somalia to join the militant group Al Shabaab, he said, and said MI5 had been watching him. Emwazi denied the accusation – bragging that he would not take a designer Rocawear sweater in his luggage if he was planning to join Somalian rebels. In emails to the campaign group Cage, Emwazi said: ‘He [Nick] knew everything about me; where I lived, what I did, the people I hanged around with.’ ‘Nick’ then tried to recruit the 21-year-old, Emwazi claimed, and threatened him when he refused to cooperate. Emwazi said the officer told him: ‘You’re going to have a lot of trouble…You’re going to be known…You’re going to be followed…Life will be harder for you.’ On his return to Britain, Emwazi said his family told him they had been ‘visited’, and he claimed a woman he had been planning to marry broke off their engagement because her family had also been contacted and were scared. According to Emwazi, his family then began planning for him to travel to Kuwait to get him away from the ‘harassment’ he had suffered in Britain and he went to work for a computer programming company in the emirate. In 2013 after changing his name by deed poll he made another attempt to enter Kuwait but was rejected. Disappearing from home he was not seen again until appearing in ISIS propaganda films, his face masked as he slit the throats of innocents. His identity was revealed last month. He has not appeared in online footage since.","Javier Espinosa spent months at the mercy of ISIS extremists in Syria .

"One in five Instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. To capitalise on this, the Californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called Layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations. Photos can be selected from the phone's camera roll, or taken with the Photo Booth tool, and Layouts can then be 'remixed' and edited with mirror effects and flips. Instagram has launched a photo collage app called Layout. Users begin by selecting as many images, up to the maximum of nine, to feature in the collage (pictured left). As they add more images the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired (right) It is branded in the same way as Instagram's other standalone timelapse app, Hyperlapse. The Layout app has four main features called Faces, Mirroring, Photo Booth and Previews. Users begin by selecting as many images, up to the maximum of nine, to feature in the collage. Photos can be selected or deselected at any point. As they add more images, the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired. Pictures can be chosen from a phone's camera roll, or users can use the Photo Booth feature to set a timer and capture photos. There are a number of different tools which allow users to 'remix' their layout including mirror effects, flip, pinch to zoom, and rotate. The Faces tab scans all the photos in a user's camera roll and only shows those containing people. Once the Layout is complete it can be shared to Instagram or Facebook, or saved to their camera roll to be shared elsewhere. These photos can then be zoomed, flipped to form a mirror image, or turned upside down. Instagram said that of the collages already uploaded to the app, 90 per cent of these contain faces. The app has therefore added a Faces tab that scans all the photos in the user's camera roll to show those in which it detects a face. Importantly though, this is facial detection and not facial recognition and the app can't identify people in the photos. Meanwhile, the Photo Booth feature acts in the same way as a standard photo booth. Once the shutter is pressed the app takes four photos, a few seconds apart, using the front-facing camera. All collages can be previewed and saved, or they can be uploaded to Instagram or Facebook. The Layout app has four main features called Faces, Mirroring, Photo Booth and Previews.

"Ministers have been accused of putting profit over human rights after organising a secretive arms fair to sell tear gas and rubber bullets to a host of authoritarian regimes. The three-day 'Security & Policing Event', which is closed to the public and press, has been organised by the Home Office to showcase British anti-riot kit to dozens of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Vladimir Putin's Russia . Sniper rifles, phone-hacking equipment and specialist 'sound guns' will be available to help foreign police control uprisings. Ministers have organised an arms fair to sell anti-riot equipment to foreign governments including rubber bullets, like those used by police against protesters in Sao Paulo, Brazil last year 2014 . The Government has publicised the event as a unique opportunity for arms manufacturers to market equipment 'which would be too sensitive to show in a more-open environment'. Since the Coalition came to power in 2010, £15.9million worth of export licences for crowd-control have been approved by Vince Cable's Business Department. This includes £10million of tear gas or 'anti-riot irritants', £640,000 of 'crowd-control ammunition' and £3.1million of riot shields. Much of the kit is sold to democracies like France and the US. But crowd-control supplies have also been cleared for countries on the Government's own human-rights blacklist. Nine of the countries to receive export approvals - Afghanistan, Bahrain, Colombia, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia - feature or have featured on the Foreign Office's human rights blacklist of 'Countries of Concern' over the last five years. The figures - compiled from Government data by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade - show that goods worth £6.7m were cleared for shipping to the nine countries between 2010 and last September. Since the Coalition came to power it has signed off export licenses for anti-riot equipment to foreign regimes, including Libya under Muammar Gaddafi (left) and Valdimir Putin's Russia . Some £2.95m of tear gas was sold to Saudi Arabia and £228,000 of 'crowd-control ammunition' to Libya while Muammar Gaddafi remained in power, the Independent reported. Andrew Smith, from CAAT, told the newspaper: 'This is a sign of a system that puts arms-company profits ahead of human rights. Weapons like tear gas have an indiscriminate effect and are synonymous with internal repression. 'The Government may have revoked the licence for tear gas to Libya, but it should never have been signed in the first place. Gaddafi was a brutal tyrant from day one, and this is a reminder that acts of oppression by his regime were carried out with British support.' The government insists licences will not be granted when there is a 'clear risk' that the exports 'might be used to facilitate internal repression'. In a statement, the Business Department said: 'We rigorously examine every licence application on a case-by-case basis against internationally recognised criteria. 'Risks around human rights abuses are a key part of our assessment and we do not grant licences where there is a clear risk that it might be used for internal repression.'","Three-day 'Security & Policing Event'  closed to the public and press .

"Far from the prestigious homes that normally fetch well over the reserve price, three small homes in Sydney have blown realtors and buyers away, exceeding all reserve expectations. Collectively the houses pulled $1,720,000 over their reserve prices. Rob Mellor, property analyst and managing director of BIS Shrapnel, says the ‘market is getting a bit sticky’ and warns investors that their future profits may be much lower than expected if you spend more than the property is worth. ‘I feel the market has more growth in it but if growth like this happens overnight there’s a real danger for investors.’ ‘No-one pays that amount of money unless they have more money than sense,’ Mr Mellor told Daily Mail Australia.

Labelled a ‘diamond in the rough’ this quaint one bedroom cottage in Surry Hills covers a tiny 63 square metres however it managed to sell for a whopping $840,000. No bells and whistles: This tiny one bedroom cottage leaves a lot to be desired . With only one bedroom and a combined living/dining area the Surry Hills home leaves investors with a lot of renovating ahead . That’s $90,000 over the reserve and a considerable investment compared to the 500 pounds the original owner paid in the 1960’s. The eastern suburbs apartment has no ocean views but pulled an astonishing $1.4 million . Labelled a 'blank canvas' the unit on Moore Street, Coogee, will require substantial investment to renovate . Another auction for a two bedroom unit in Coogee attracted 55 registered bidders and had 150 contracts out on the property. The ground floor art deco apartment is rundown and not renovated but still managed to fetch $1.4 million. That’s an extravagant $530,000 more than the reserve price for an apartment that doesn’t even have water views. Advertised as an apartment that 'presents a restoration/renovation opportunity seldom found now in this locale' The biggest shocker of the weekend was in Sydney’s north-west suburb Gladesville where a 4 bedroom, single level brick home went under the hammer for an astounding $2.85 million. ‘It was just one of those auctions where people get caught up in the moment and it just kept going, and going, and going' With their reserve set at $1.75 million the home owners are set to pocket a massive $1.1 million over their asking price. Agent Paul Tassone from Professionals Real Estate told Daily Mail Australia the auction was full of locals who were blown away at how much the home sold for. The 4 bedroom Gladesville property was previously renting for $800 a week . ‘This was well above anything else that’s sold in the area,’ he said. ‘It was just one of those auctions where people get caught up in the moment and it just kept going, and going, and going.' ‘This was well above anything else that’s sold in the area,’ said Mr Tassone . Mr Mellor warns buyers to tread carefully in a market like this because it won’t stay this hot for long. ‘I’d be starting to exercise some caution as an investor entering the market, especially if you are paying 15 to 20 per cent above the reserve.’ He says many buyers won’t see a return on their investment unless they get out of the market within 18 months, which is when he predicts it will cool.","Properties across Sydney going under the hammer have sold for well above their reserves .

"Lawyers for a Missouri man who shot dead a sheriff's deputy years after doctors removed part of his brain are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt his execution, which is scheduled for tomorrow. Cecil Clayton, from Purdy, is set to be put to death at the state prison in Bonne Terre at 6pm on Tuesday for the November 1996 shooting of Barry County Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Castetter. But his attorneys are arguing that mental illness and an intellectual disability, which is the result of a traumatic brain injury, make the 74-year-old ineligible for execution, NBC reported. Their last-ditch effort to save his life comes after the Missouri Supreme Court refused to halt the execution over the same claims. On Saturday, the court issued the 4-3 ruling that he should die. Facing death: Cecil Clayton is scheduled to die in Missouri on Tuesday evening but his lawyers are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to stop it. Years before he murdered a cop, he had part of his brain removed, they say . Missing: A brain scan shared by his lawyers show a significant section of his brain is missing . His lawyers have explained that in 1972, 24 years before he killed the officer, Clayton was using a sawmill when a board splintered and a shard went into his head above his right eye. Doctors were forced to remove 20 per cent of his frontal lobe, the area of the brain that controls decision making and emotions, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. A scan shared by his attorney Elizabeth Unger Carlyle shows a large section missing from his brain. Following the accident and before the arrest, Clayton frequently went to mental health facilities, spending up to 15 months at a time under psychiatric care. Then the evening before Thanksgiving in 1996, Deputy Castetter responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle parked outside Clayton's girlfriend's mother's home. Earlier that night, Clayton and his girlfriend had been arguing, and prosecutors said he then took a loaded gun to her mother's house. Clayton walked up to the deputy's patrol car window and shot him in the head at point-blank range. Castetter, a 29-year-old married father-of-three, died in the hospital later that day. He was convicted of the murder in October 1997 and sentenced to death later that year. His attorneys have argued that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial but despite their appeals, state and federal appeals courts have upheld the conviction and the death penalty. His lawyers are seeking a competency hearing to determine whether he understands his death penalty. Killed: Barry County Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Castetter, pictured left, was shot dead by Clayton, pictured right in an old mug shot, as he responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in 1996 . At the weekend, when the Missouri Supreme Court issued its decision, three of the seven judges agreed that he is entitled to a competency hearing. Mental health professionals who have examined him agree that he is mentally impaired and has mental health issues, including dementia. His most recent IQ test found he had an IQ of just 71 - 29 points below the average. 'He is not simply incompetent legally; he would be unable to care for himself or manage basic self-care, were he not in a structured environment that takes care of him,' according to a doctor who examined him, the Kansas City Star reported. 'He can shower, groom, eat, walk; it is his comprehension, judgment, memory, limited intelligence and social deficits that plague him.' But there is no agreement on how much he understands his death penalty or his other options. 'If you can prove mental retardation, you can get exempted, but mental illness alone is not an exemption to the death penalty,' Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the New York Times. In Missouri, the director of the Department of Corrections is the only one with the authority to order a competency hearing, and last year, he called on a doctor to examine Clayton. Dr. James Reynolds of the Missouri Department of Mental Health concluded that Clayton is mentally ill, but could not be certain that he doesn't understand his death sentence. Execution: He is scheduled to be put to death at the state prison in Bonne Terre, pictured, next Tuesday . Death: His family and lawyers are arguing that he is child-like and does not understand the significance of his death penalty. They are calling for his execution at Bonne Terre (pictured) to be stopped . But Clayton's lawyers say, while he may have conversations in which he understands he is about to be executed, he will later forget that conversation ever happened. His family have also called for a fair hearing on the issue. 'He is brain-damaged, and talking with him is like talking to a child,' Clayton's daughter, Jena Clayton, said during his clemency petition, the Kansas City Star reported. 'I do not believe we are the kind of country that executes the disabled.' Clayton, who is the state's oldest death row inmate, will be put to death between 6pm on March 17 and 5.59pm on March 18. He will become the second person put to death in the state in 2015, after a record 10 executions in Missouri in 2014. Last month, Walter Storey was put to death for slitting his neighbor's throat 25 years ago.","Cecil Clayton is due to die in Missouri at 6pm Tuesday but his lawyers are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the execution .

"The singer-songwriter behind the rock anthem Spirit in the Sky is in critical condition in a California hospital after a car accident that left a motorcyclist dead. Norman Greenbaum, 72, was the passenger of a Subaru Outback driving near the city of Santa Rosa on Saturday around 3.30pm. A motorcycle crashed into the Outback at an intersection after the driver, Bonita Perea, 63, failed to yield to the motorcycle when turning. Scroll down for video . Greenbaum, 72, was in a Subaru Outback on Saturday during a deadly accident in Santa Rosa, California . The woman driving the Outback failed to yield at an intersection and a motorcycle slammed into the vehicle . Ihab Usama Halaweh, 20, crashed into the sedan after he was unable to stop his 2004 Suzuki GSX-R600,and died at the scene, the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat reported. California Highway Patrol Officer Matt Pinheiro said: 'There's no stop [at the intersection], but the Subaru driver was supposed to yield to oncoming traffic and they didn't.' His passenger, Nhmia Mekonnen Kahsay, 20, was seriously injured. Kahsay and Greenbaum were both brought to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital and were listed in critical condition on Sunday afternoon. The hospital is not releasing any further updates about the musician's condition and said his family has requested privacy. Greeenbaum's hit song sold two million singles for Warner Brother in 1969 and 1970. The tune, which has an iconic opening guitar riff, has been featured in almost 50 films like Apollo 13 and in ads for Gatorade, Nike and American Express. It was also included in Rock Band 2. Greenbaum, who was born in Malden, Massachusetts, said he based the song's spiritual lyrics on Western films. Global one hit wonder: Rocker Norman Greenbaum, who is best known for his hit song Spirit in the Sky, is listed in critical condition . He said: 'These mean and nasty varmints get shot and they wanted to die with their boots on. 'So to me that was spiritual, they wanted to die with their boots on.' Hospital spokeswoman Vanessa DeGier said Kahsay was being treated in the intensive care unit and that his vital signs were unstable. She said: 'Critical condition means the patient may also be unconscious. 'Indicators are unfavorable at the moment.' Perea was not injured during the accident, but she was upset after the crash. Santa Rosa Fire Battalion Chief Jack Piccinini said: 'She's very shaken by the whole incident.' Investigators do not believe that alcohol or drugs were factors in the accident. The investigation into the crash could take weeks. It is unclear how fast the motorcycle was going at the time of the accident.","Greenbaum, 72, was the passenger of a Subaru Outback on Saturday .

"The first artifacts from the Confederate Civil War ship CSS Georgia have been recovered. The ship, which was built in 1862 but never fired a shot in the Civil War, has begun yielding items that haven't seen the surface for 150 years before being excavated near Savannah, Georgia . Among the 400 recently recovered bits of history include leg irons worn by prisoners on the ship and cannon firing equipment. Scroll down for video . Divers have recovered 400 artifacts from the CSS Georgia, which is being excavated after sitting in the Savannah River for the last 150 years. Above, leg irons for prisoners were smoothmetal  before corrosion . Civil War items recovered from the sunken ship including cannon equipment including a iron gun carriage trunnion cap (above), which allowed gunners to aim their weapons . Though the CSS Georgia never fired a shot during the Civil War, leg irons were likely used to keep deserts locked aboard . The CSS Georgia has sat at the bottom of the water along its namesake state's coast since it was deliberately sunk by its crew in 1864 to prevent it from being taken by the approaching United States army of Major General William Sherman. The iron clad ship, estimated to be up to 250 feet long, was too heavy to move under its own weight and was kept stationary at the mouth of the Savannah River with a large supply of cannons. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but an agreement was made to explore its contents before deepening its resting place, according to the Army Corps of Engineers Savannah District. Artifacts from the lost ship will be studied by researchers from Texas A&M University's Conservation Research Laboratory, with hopes that many will eventually be displayed in museums. There is only one photo thought to show the CSS Georgia during its time being used by Confederate troops . Big items such as the ship's cannons will be taken out of the water in the summer, though equipment for the guns is already being recovered by divers . Because of bad visibility near the sediment of the river, divers are forced to use their sense of touch to find artifacts such as a cannon trunnion cap (left) and a serving dish (right) Iron eyes for tackle (above) assisted the CSS Georgia's crew in moving their guns into firing positions aimed along the Savannah River . A group of divers led by principal investigator Stephen James are scouring 40 feet below the water's surface . However, sediment conditions at the bottom of the Savannah make visibility in the water next to nothing, meaning that divers contracted to find the historic items are searching with their hands rather than their eyes. 'You are doing archaeology by braille,' Conservation Research Laboratory project manager Jim Jobling told Daily Mail Online. The divers use a 3D positioning system created by previous sonar studies of the ship wreckage, though the skilled archaeologists may only be able to complete a couple of 10ft by 10ft grids because they can only work during high and low tide. They hope their rewards will help enhance knowledge of the mysterious ship, for which historians have found no building plans. The excavation process began in January, but larger items will be recovered in the summer when Navy salvage teams arrive. Thousands are artifacts from the 1860s are expected to be found, including artillery shells, four cannons, two engines and a propeller, according to CNN. Mr Jobling said that all ordnances, including possible ammunition in the cannons, will need to be neutralized by the Marines before being studied. While iron items have survived long years and are in various states of corrosion, wooden bits of the ship have largely deteriorated. Due to limited resources during the Civil War, the builders of the CSS Georgia used railroad irons to armor the ship's sides . Researchers hope that personal items such as this ironstone pottery will help illuminate what life aboard the ship was like for soldiers . Due to limited resources, the ship used railroad iron to armor its slanted sides, called casemates, which were about 12 feet high. Sections of the casemates will be recovered after the current small item phase and the large weapons in the summer. Many items such as the cannons will have excess material removed after they are transported to Texas by placing them in 1,300 gallon electrolytic tanks with sodium hydroxide solution. Conservators are hoping the remaining bits of ship and personal items will help tell about what life aboard the ship was like for crew. Mr Jobling has already been contacted by historians and researchers from around the country. He says that beyond written descriptions of the Civil War, the actual artifacts 'really brings it home' and help students of the period piece together day-to-day life. A  man recently snapped a copy of the only known photo of the ship at a Georgia garage sale, though he did not have the money to take the important artifact home. Conservators are appealing to the public to help find the photo or others like it to add to their knowledge of the vessel. CSS is the abbreviation used for Confederate States Ship, as opposed to USS for United States Ship. It was made after a group called the Ladies Gunboat Association of Savannah raised $115,000 during the war for its construction. The process of removing the CSS Georgia's to deepen the Savannah harbor costs about $15million. The CSS Georgia is technically owned by the US Navy, which classifies it as a 'captured enemy vessel,' according to the Army. Though many iron items remain, pieces of wood (pictured) are either entirely or mostly deteriorated from years underwater . The US Army Corps of Engineers has used previous dives to map where they will recover larger items such as cannons and a propeller . As opposed to modern battleships or earlier galleons, gunboats during the Civil War sometimes used a slanted body composed of casemates .","Confederacy's CSS Georgia was scuttled off the Savannah coast in 1864 .

"A Filipino heroin smuggler’s final legal appeal is thought to be all that now stands between Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran’s execution date being set. Indonesia's attorney general has insisted the executions of the two Bali Nine smugglers and other drug offenders are going ahead, even though he's decided to respect the pending legal processes of Filipino woman Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso. She is the only one of the 10 convicts slated for the firing squad who is not yet on Nusakambangan prison island where the deaths  will take place. The Supreme Court is considering her application for a second judicial review, and Co-ordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security Tedjo Edhie Purdjiant on Monday said the decision would be sped up. Scroll down for video . Philippine national Mary Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, center, is escorted by a court official and a police officer upon arrival for a judicial review hearing at Sleman District Court in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, Tuesday, March 3 . Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso is expected to be executed with Bali Nine members Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran of Australia and other drug smugglers from Brazil, France and Nigeria . 'We'll wait. Maybe this week we will get a decision,' he told reporters, as quoted by Indonesian website okezone. The Australians were moved from Bali to Nusakambangan - the island where the executions are set to take place - last week under heavy security. Authorities wish to keep prisoners on the Central Java island for as little time as possible before their execution. They are required to give the condemned prisoners a minimum 72 hours notice of their pending deaths. With the Bali Nine pair in place on the island, Jakarta unexpectedly shifted gear on Friday and said it would respect prisoners' ongoing legal processes. On Monday, the duo received grim news when a Nigerian inmate on death row had his legal challenge rejected, offering poor prospects for their own appeal. Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso (R) in court in Sleman in central Java island during a hearing of judicial review on March 3, 2015 after her plea for clemency was rejected by Indonesian President Joko Widodo . Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukmaran's fellow inmate - a Nigerian man - had his appeal rejected on Monday . Nigerian Jamiu Owolabi Abashin believes the prosecution case against him has been entirely based on his fake identity. He was arrested under his alias in 1998, smuggling 5.3 kilograms of heroin . Jamiu Owolabi Abashin had his appeal against clemency rejected on the grounds that the Administrative Court did not have jurisdiction over Joko Widodo's presidential decision. Abashin and his lawyer, Utomo Karim, will appeal the latest decision and seek a judicial review on Wednesday on the basis that he committed his crime under the alias Raheem Agbaje Salami 17 years ago. He was arrested under his alias in 1998, smuggling 5.3 kilograms of heroin but his fake identity was still used right through his arrest, conviction and clemency plea. Attorney General HM Prasetyo told reporters in Jogjakarta on Monday it wasn't accurate to say the executions were delayed. 'I assure you there's no delay. I never said the date of execution,' he said, as quoted by Indonesian website kompas.com. Myuran Sukumaran was transported to the Indonesian 'death island' by armed officers on Wednesday . Andrew Chan - now an ordained minister - took a bible with him to his place of execution . It's emerged Chan (left) proposed to his girlfriend of three years Febyanti Herewila (right) when he discovered his clemency bid had been rejected by Indonesian authorities . But he corroborated his spokesman's comment from Friday that legal appeals were behind the delay in announcing an execution date. 'Right now, we have to fulfil their legal rights even though they have already requested clemency,' he said of the prisoners. Mr Prasetyo said Indonesia still intended to execute the prisoners simultaneously, noting that a 'psychological burden' may be created if the prisoners went to the firing squad separately. Chan and Sukumaran have an appeal in court on Thursday, and a French prisoner has one on Wednesday. Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, were on Monday buoyed by their first visit from their families since moving into Nusakambangan. The Sydney families will return on Wednesday during visiting hours. The men can receive consular and lawyers' visits on other days. Nigerian Silvester Obiekwe is also facing the firing squad along with nine others . Frenchman Serge Areski is also facing the firing squad as well as Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia . Just after Indonesian president Joko Widodo had touched on the possible abolishment of the death penalty in an interview with Al Jazeera on Saturday, former Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri reportedly told Widodo not to grant clemency. In a speech she made on International Women's Day, she blamed drugs for the spread of HIV in Indonesia and said that drug use in the country had entered a critical state . Abashin is one of three Nigerians awaiting execution - the others being gospel singer Okwudili Ayontanze and Silvester Obiekwe who was caught running a drug racket from inside jail. Prisoners facing the firing squad that are having their cases judicially reviewed are Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, Serge Areski Atlaoui and Zainal Abidin.

"Two ice fisherman were in for a big surprise when the reeled in a live bird from freezing waters  in northwestern Pennsylvania earlier this week. In a video titled, 'Shocking ice fishing video from Pennsylvania!', Nicholas Colangelo filmed his friend Fred Christensen pulling a live red-breasted merganser out of a hole in a large sheet of ice in  Monday. Red-breasted mergansers dive into the water while foraging for food and can usually stay under for a little under a minute - so the fisherman pulled up the line at the perfect moment. Catch of the day: Three men were ice fishing in northwest Pennsylvania when the caught a red-breasted merganser on their line as it was diving for food . Christensen, who was fishing for muskies with Colangelo and friend Luke Wholey, told Daily Mail Online that he realized immediately that he wasn't pulling up a fish, but he wasn't expecting a bird. 'I wasn't exactly certain what flashed passed the hole, there were colors that just didn't set well with me so I was hesitant of grabbing something I hadn't yet identified,' he wrote in an e-mail interview. '[It] Wasn't until I saw feathers that I realized what was going on.' 'My jaw hit the ice,' Colangelo told the Washington Post. 'I was absolutely shocked.' Colangelo said that though he and his friends go fishing regularly and have seen mergansers dive under water for long stretches of time, he wasn't expecting to catch the bird on his fishing line. 'I've never heard of anything like this happening,' he told the Washington Post. 'It was so unusual.' In the video, Christensen can be seen pulling up the fishing line out of a small hole in the water until he eventually reaches his hand in and pulls out a squirming live bird. Unexpected: Fred Christensen, pictured on Monday, said he wasn't sure what he was pulling up on the line, but he was certain it wasn't a fish . Unusual: Christensen was hesitant to reach into the water at first, but he grabbed the merganser and likely saved it from drowning on the end of the fishing line . After Christensen posed for a picture, the men untangled the bird and set it free into it's natural habitat. 'It didn't take long to realize it wasn't happy, I just grabbed the mean end as soon as I saw the chance,' Christensen wrote in an e-mail. 'I figured controlling its head and body would make unhooking and tangling much faster, I treated it the same as I would a fish. Thankfully Nick was there to help, it would have been a difficult task to accomplish alone,' he added. Colangelo told the Washington Post that the bird was only minimally tangled and easily made its way back to its flock. Christensen said that he had never heard of people catching a merganser through the ice, but said that it occasionally happens 'in open water in ares where large amounts of water birds like to congregate'. The three fishermen don't kill anything that they catch while fishing and release it all back into the wild. 'I would just sincerely like to say that the environment , the fish the birds - that's what's high priority,' Colangelo told the Washington Post. Catch-and-release: Red-breasted mergansers dive into the water looking for food. The men untangled the bird from their fishing line and set it free to return to its flock . Christensen said that there's 'no sense in killing' the fish they catch, and that you never know a fish's full potential if it's killed. 'I've seen and have caught fish I've released even years prior that have had identifying scars or characteristics that couldn't be mistaken,' he said. 'When you experience catching a fish that you've caught before it is a good feeling to see that the fish is still alive and well. It gives you that much more incentive to let them all go,' he added. The three men often fish for musky, a rare and large species that is known to be difficult to catch. The freshwater fish is often spotted around the Great Lakes region and through Canada. Colangelo and Wholey hit headlines last month after catching a 53-pound musky while ice fishing n northwest Pennsylvania, according to CBS. The men estimated that the fish was about 30 years old. They were one pound away from matching a 1949 state record for biggest musky catch. Christensen that that three days prior to catching the merganser, he had another unusual bird encounter. 'I watched a bald eagle wipe out a Canadian goose and carried it as far as it could until it realized it was extremely heavy,' he wrote. 'It just so happened it dropped less than ten yards from where I was quietly sitting waiting for a flag to pop.' 'Most would find this crazy uncommon, but for me it's just a typical day on water,' the fisherman said. Under the ice: Christensen, and his friends Nicholas Colangelo and Luke Wholey fish for muskies in northwest Pennsylvania .

"Former Labor leader Mark Latham was dumped from a radio interview for an on-air rant that included calling Triple M host Gus Worland a 'loveable f***wit' and movie star Hugh Jackman a 'North Shore w***er.' Now Worland wants to punch Latham's head in - for charity. Mr Latham, who was opposition leader for 13 months from December 2003 and led Labor to lose the 2004 election, had been invited on to the station's Grill Team morning program to talk about his latest book. Scroll down for audio . The Grill Team on radio station Triple M says 'it's on!' A fight for charity between the 'Marathon Man' Gus Worland (left) and former Labor heavyweight, Mark Latham (right) The program is co-hosted by Worland, who is also known for reality TV progams including An Aussie Goes Barmy. An audio recording had earlier emerged of Mr Latham talking to another Triple M presenter, Merrick Watts, about Worland's latest TV show, Gus Worland: Marathon Man, which document's the presenter's efforts to get fit and run the New York Marathon. 'I actually watched Gus' Marathon Man show, flicking through Foxtel one night, and hooked into it on the basis it's got to be the worst TV ever. It lived up to expectations, it was f***ing horrendous,' Latham said in the audio, which was not put to air. 'It was shocking but I couldn't work out he wasn't losing any weight, how's this fat tub going to run a marathon, they ended up shoving tubes up his a***.' 'No doubt I'll drop him like a bad habit,' Latham fired back at Worland. 'I'll knock him into tomorrow and he can whack his mate Hugh Jackman in for seconds.' His criticisms led to The Grill Team - Worland, Mark Geyer and Matthew Johns - urging Mr Latham to come on their show and talk about his book, Latham at large. Mr Latham did not back down from his criticism talking directly to Worland and his colleagues. 'The best s*** TV in the history of the entertainment industry,' was how Mr Latham described Worland's show. He went on to take a swipe at Worland's previous TV efforts focusing on cricket, but left his harshest criticism for last. 'Gus, I’ve been talking to Davey Gyngell down there at Channel 9 and we’re gonna put a proposition to you, you’ve got a lot of talent ... so Gyngell and I want to make you an offer to put on a new variety show, prime time, channel ...' But Mr Latham was taken off air before he could finish his sentence. Co-host Johns explained why. 'He said he wanted to call the show, Gus Worland Loveable F***wit,' Johns said.

After the awkward on-air episode, Triple M said Worland wanted to take the stoush further. Worland 'has challenged Mark Latham to a boxing match after the ex-Labor leader called him a ""f***wit"" live on-air,' Triple M said in a statement. It explained the whole incident like this: . 'Latham was in to talk about his book, which Gus called ""rubbish""… after the ex-Labor leader slagged of his TV show, calling it the ""worst television show in the history of the media"". 'This really p***** Gus off. He called him a ""failed opposition leader, a failed pollie"" that ""even Labor don't even care"" about. Gus Worland pictured with his best mate, none other than Hugh Jackman. Mark Latham says he'll knock them both out . Mark Latham said of Gus Worland and his best mate Hugh Jackman (pictured starring in the movie series Wolverine) 'all those north shore w*****rs', seriously, I'll knock them out of the ring'. 'He then challenged the former pollie to a boxing match for charity. Looks like someone is gonna get hurt.' 'I want to put on a boxing match,' Worland said. 'Three rounds. I’ll take him on for charity after what he said.' 'No doubt I'll drop him like a bad habit,' Latham fired back. 'I'll knock him into tomorrow and he can whack his mate Hugh Jackman in for seconds. All those North Shore wankers, seriously, I'll knock them out of the ring.' Mr Latham ended by daring Worland to name the time and place. Mr Latham grew up in Sydney's blue-collar south-western suburbs, and represented the area in Parliament for the seat of Werriwa. Known for a brash, sometimes abrasive personality, Mr Latham allegedly broke a taxi driver's arm in 2001 during a fare dispute and is also remembered for a quite aggressive, in-your-face, handshake with John Howard during the 2004 election campaign.","Controversial ex-politician Mark Latham calls radio host 'f***wit'

"A huge step towards recreating the woolly mammoth has been taken by scientists who inserted more than a dozen of its genes into the live DNA of an elephant. Researchers studied the structure of DNA from mammoths preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal’s genes. These were then integrated by experts at Harvard University in Massachusetts into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal DNA. Scroll down for video . Recreation: Researchers studied the structure of DNA from woolly mammoths (file illustration) preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal’s genes . A new method known as 'Crispr' - helping scientists make accurate changes to DNA - was used by genetics professor George Church, who replaced parts of elephant DNA with the mammoth genes. He said: ‘We prioritised genes associated with cold resistance including hairiness, ear size, subcutaneous fat and, especially, haemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen around the body).’ ‘De-extinction’ enthusiast Mr Church, who was speaking to The Sunday Times science editor Jonathan Leake, added: ‘We now have functioning elephant cells with mammoth DNA in them.’ Mammoths co-existed with early humans who hunted them for food. Comparison: The mammoth was roughly the size as a modern African elephant, standing up to 11ft tall . They are the best studied of all prehistoric animals thanks to the discovery of frozen carcasses, as well as dung and skeletons. The mammoth was roughly the size as a modern African elephant, standing up to 11ft tall and weighing about seven tonnes, and its fur and long hair protected it from severe winters. There are at least three teams trying to rebuild the whole mammoth genome - which could one day become a template to recreate actual mammoths, reported The Sunday Times. But ancient DNA expert Professor Alex Greenwood said: ‘Money would be better spent focusing on conserving what we do have - than spending it on an animal that has been extinct for thousands of years.’ Last week, MailOnline reported how scientists had begun extracting DNA from the remains of a mammoth found in Siberia, taking bone marrow samples from its front left leg. The samples will be examined at a laboratory in Yakutsk, Russia, and by scientists in South Korea - with the hope of one day being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals.","Scientists study structure of DNA from mammoths preserved in Arctic .

"Bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher A-level subjects, a study shows. Researchers found those from disadvantaged families were far less likely to study and score highly in English, maths, science, humanities and languages. Pupils who do not take these so-called ‘facilitating’ subjects have less chance of obtaining a place at the prestigious Russell Group universities, which often favour them. Bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher A-level subjects, a study shows (file picture) Researchers commissioned by the Department of Education at Oxford University also found poor children are much less likely to get three A-levels in any courses. The wide-ranging study also showed that going to a decent nursery, reading for pleasure and attending an outstanding school can boost a disadvantaged pupil's chances of getting good results. Taking part in school trips and getting into a daily homework routine can also help them. The research is based on data drawn from more than 3,000 young people who have been tracked from the age of three for the Effective Pre-School, Primary and Secondary Education (EPPSE) project. Researchers found that just a third of bright but disadvantaged students took one of more A-levels facilitating subjects, compared to 58 per cent of their wealthier peers with the same academic ability. Less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a B in these subjects, compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates. The findings also show that just over 35 per cent of the sixth-formers identified as clever based on their test results at age 11 got three A-levels in any subjects, compared to 60 per cent of their high-achieving, richer peers. An analysis of the data found that sixth-formers who did two to three hours of homework each night were nine times more likely to gain three A-levels than those who did none. Less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a B in these subjects, compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates (file picture) The study said: ‘Spending time on homework is likely to reflect both student motivation and engagement, study skills and independence, school policies and the priority teachers attach to encouraging students to study at home (or provide opportunities after school), as well as parental attitudes and support.’ The study concludes that encouraging reading for pleasure, educational trips, the chance to go to a good nursery and school, feedback on school work and a supportive home life can help disadvantaged youngsters to get good results. It suggests that bright, poor students should get ‘enrichment’ vouchers, funded through the Pupil Premium - public funding for disadvantaged children - to help with educational trips, reading for pleasure and studies outside of the classroom. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust which commissioned the report, said: ‘The fact that bright disadvantaged students fall so far behind when they reach their A-levels shows that government and schools urgently need to do more to support able students from less advantaged homes. ‘We must ensure that access to the best schools and opportunities for academic enrichment outside school are available to all students. It is also vital that schools advise their students on the right subject choices at GCSE and A-level so as to maximise their potential.’ Professor Pam Sammons, co-author of the report, said: ‘There is no silver bullet that alone can make a difference but a combination of good schools and pre-schools, the right home learning environment and supportive teachers ready to monitor progress and provide good feedback can all ensure that bright but disadvantaged students get the chance of a good university education. There are important lessons here for teachers and policymakers seeking to reduce the equity gap in attainment.’","Disadvantaged pupils less likely to score well in science and humanities .

"A  prosecutor who sent an innocent man to death row for 30 years  has apologized to him and admitted he was more interested in winning the case than achieving justice. Attorney A.M. 'Marty' Stroud III, from Shreveport, Louisiana, admitted that he was to blame for putting father-of-four Glenn Ford behind bars in 1984 for the fatal shooting of a jeweler. 'In 1984, I was 33 years old,' he wrote in a letter to The Shreveport Times. 'I was arrogant, judgmental, narcissistic and very full of myself. I was not as interested in justice as I was in winning.' Ford, now 65, was released from the prison in Angola in March 2014 but last month, he learned he has stage four lung cancer and just four to eight months left to live. Scroll down for video . Apologies: Attorney A.M. 'Marty' Stroud III, pictured, has written a lengthy letter apologizing to an innocent man he sent to death row as he slammed the state for refusing to pay the man compensation . Earlier this month, the state argued that Ford is not entitled to receive compensation for his time behind bars because he is unable to prove he is 'factually innocent'. In his letter, Stroud, 63, slammed the decision. 'Glenn Ford should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life,' Stroud said. 'The audacity of the state's effort to deny Mr. Ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of Louisiana justice is appalling.' Ford was accused of shooting Isadore Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Mr Ford had done occasional yard work, in 1983 and was convicted the following year. He was sent to prison, where he lived with little light or heat, while Stroud, who had been with the Caddo District Attorney's office for two years, went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team. 'That's sick,' he said in his letter. 'I had been entrusted with the duty to seek the death of a fellow human being, a very solemn task that certainly did not warrant any ""celebration"".' From behind bars, Ford continued to protest his innocence. Glenn Ford, now 65, was convicted of an 1983 murder but was released a year ago after evidence showed he was not at the scene. He has since been diagnosed with cancer and has four to eight months to live . Then in 2013, State District Judge Ramona Emanuel voided the conviction and sentence based on the new information that corroborated his claim he was not present or involved in Rozeman's death. 'My fault was that I was too passive,' Stroud said in his letter. 'Had I been more inquisitive, perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago... Wrongly accused: Ford, a father-of-four (pictured in a booking photo), was sent to death row in 1984 . 'I did not hide evidence, I simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion. And that omission is on me.' Stroud said he still does not know the extent of the new information that led to Ford's release. But he added that the odds were stacked against Ford, whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law. He also faced an all-white jury. In light of the new evidence, Stroud said he realized how wrong he had been. 'I speak only for me and no one else,' he said. 'I apologize to Glenn Ford for all the misery I have caused him and his family. I apologize to the family of Mr. Rozeman for giving them the false hope of some closure.' In a separate interview with The Shreveport Times, Stroud again called for Ford to be compensated and for the 'barbaric' death penalty to be abolished. Ford walked free from Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola on March 11, 2014, wearing a jean jacket, sweater and beanie hat and carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes. As he walked out of the prison gates, he said he was sad he had not been around to raise his now-adult sons, but added: 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.' Freed: Ford is pictured in March 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars. He was given just $20 but was taken in by a non-profit group who found a free place for him to stay . Prison officials gave the then-64-year-old a debit card worth just $20. That, along with the money that he had in his bank account, left Mr Ford with a paltry $20.04 to his name. His lawyers set up an Amazon wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so Ford could start to re-build his life. With the help of a non-profit group, Resurrection After Exoneration, he had a place to live free of charge and has since moved to his own apartment. He relies on Social Security disability and food stamps, and has also visited California to see his four sons. He has also filed separate federal lawsuits claiming he was wrongfully imprisoned and was denied medical care following his cancer diagnosis. He names numerous prison guards and prison doctors for ignoring his condition and says his poor living conditions, including contact with sewage and asbestos, contributed to his illness. After he left prison, he learned he had Stage 3 lung cancer, which has now progressed to Stage 4. Making the days count: Ford, pictured last month, relies on Social Security disability and food stamps. He is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer, which is now terminal . 'I'm trying to make every day count,' he told The Shreveport Times from his home in New Orleans after learning he had just months to live. He said if he does get awarded any money, he plans to leave it to his grandchildren. He said he has between 17 and 21 - but could not be sure how many. Of his situation, he said: 'I don't have no anger. I have anger that I have cancer. I have resentment Angola allowed this to happen. I guess everything is for a reason. I really don't know.' Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections spokeswoman Pam Laborde told The Times-Picayune that she could not comment due to pending litigation and privacy issues. No one has been charged with Rozeman's death. Three men had also initially been arrested in the crime but were ultimately released because of insufficient evidence. Two of the men have since been indicted in other murders.","Marty Stroud has admitted he was to blame for wrongly putting Glenn Ford behind bars in 1983 for the shooting death of his former employer .

"A former Sydney preacher who is now a senior figure of notorious terror group Jabhat al-Nusra has spoken out for the first time about why he joined the jihadi cause. Abu Sulayman Muhajir fled to Syria at least two years ago and has found himself added to the most wanted list of Western intelligence agencies. He started his association with extremist organisations when he became a mediator between two warring groups, Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State (IS). Scroll down for video . Former Sydney preacher Abu Sulayman Muhajir is a senior figure of al-Qaeda off-shoot Jabhat al-Nusra . But eventually he joined Jabhat al-Nusra. Speaking from Syria's frontlines, Abu Sulayman warned Western forces to leave the Middle East. 'The choice is simple… leave our lands, stop interfering in our affairs or face perpetual war,' the Egyptian-Australian told SBS's Dateline from a secret location. 'They [the West] rob our resources, they back tyrants, they force regime change, and they economically enslave our nations.' Abu Sulayman is best known for spreading his hate speeches throughout Sydney's west, most notably at the Al Risalah centre in Bankstown (above) Abu Sulayman has spoken out for the first time about why he joined the jihadi cause after the death of Islamic State fighter Suhan Rahman, from Melbourne . Abu Sulayman - who is also known as Mostafa ­Mahamed - is best known for his hate speeches spouted across Sydney's west. In one speech at Bankstown's Al-Risalah centre, the former preacher urged young men to spill their 'blood' in Syria, news.com.au reported. He has also been threatened by fellow Australian Khaled Sharrouf who fights with Islamic State. During the SBS interview, the senior leader said IS worked at 'delegitimising the rest of the Muslim community' by naming themselves as the 'exclusive bearers of Islam'. On the other hand, he said Jabhat al-Nusra wanted to 'restore the right of the Muslim people to choose their leaders independently'. They are one of the major forces battling the regime headed up by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Abu Sulayaman said they also wanted to established a governing system based on Islam known as 'shura'. Shura is the Arabic word for consultation, which according to the Koran is a beneficial practice. After Rahman's death, his wife - known as Umm Jihad on social media - tweeted a photo of his dead body . Rahman was also friends with Mohamed Elomar - a Sydney boxer who fled to Syria to fight with Islamic State . Last year, Elomar was pictured on social media holding up severed heads and smiling at the camera . 'Every society needs a penal code... we have a penal code in which punishments are appropriate to the crimes committed and act as a deterrent to others,' the extremist group leader said. 'Islam to us is whole and complete and that does include corporal and capital punishment.' It comes as it is revealed the latest Australian to die in the conflict, Suhan Rahman, was a convicted criminal before her fled to the Middle East to fight for IS. New details have emerged that Suhan Rahman was sentenced to 80 hours of community service for attempting to pervert the course of justice and witness intimidation in 2013, according to The Australian. The 23-year-old, who was previously pictured with Sydney boxer-turned-terrorist Mohamed Elomar, also faced a number of charges including assault and unlicensed driving, where he was hit with a $1000 fine. After his death, Rahman's wife - known as Umm Jihad on Twitter - tweeted a picture of his dead body.","Abu Sulayman Muhajir is a senior figure of terror group Jabhat al-Nusra .

"Police investigating the historic murders of a Playboy bunny and a London schoolgirl have launched a fresh appeal for information on the 40th anniversary of their deaths. Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old glamour model who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her Leyton home on the evening of March 18, 1975. Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was brutally attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow at 11pm on September 3, as she returned from a night out with friends. Eve Stratford, 22, a Playboy bunny, was stabbed between eight and 12 times when she was murdered on the evening of March 18, 1975 . Lynne Weedon (left) was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she walked home on September 3, 1975 and her murder was linked to Miss Stratford's in 2007 when matching DNA was found on them - a former Met Police detective believes Lynda Farrow (right) - knifed to death in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer . She was found abandoned and barely alive at an electricity sub-station the next morning and died a week later. Both murders were linked in 2007 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims, who did not know each other. Former Met Police detective Colin Sutton believes a third woman, Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. Miss Stratford, worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966. She was 22 when she was raped and killed in her home. Her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times. Detectives believe she may have known her killer and invited him into the flat she shared with her boyfriend Tony Priest, the lead singer with the pop band Onyx, who found her body. She was found with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back. She was last seen walking alone near her home in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton, shortly before 4pm on a snowy day in March. This map shows the three unsolved murders all took place in close proximity - it is believed they are all linked . Miss Stratford, a Playboy bunny, was last seen walking alone near her home on a snowy day in March, 1975 . The Playboy bunny (pictured left) was found dead in the bedroom of her flat in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton (right) She was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm. An hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking, apparently calmly, in her flat. There was no sign of forced entry. A blood-splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body. Later that year, on September 3, Lynne Weedon was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a short-cut to her home in Hounslow. She was then thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity sub-station before being raped and left for dead. A school caretaker looking after the grounds found her still alive and she was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where she died a week later. The post-mortem examination found her skull was smashed with a heavy blunt instrument, but the weapon was never recovered. Police believe Lynne was followed on foot from Great Western Road into The Short Hedges (pictured right), before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead . Lynne's mother Margaret Weedon has now made an impassioned plea for information as the anniversary of her daughter's death approaches. She said: 'It has been 40 years since our beautiful young daughter Lynne was violently taken from us. '1975 seems so long ago and it is. Forty years without her. We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her. 'We are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like - a true life sentence.' Mrs Weedon added: 'We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford. That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence.' Investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said the suspect for both murders is likely to be in his 60s or 70s. He added: 'The man who carried out these murders is now of a different, older generation. I would imagine he must have reflected upon his actions every day over the past 40 years. 'It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years. It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.' Police believe the killer would have known of the Hounslow area - the alleyway and sub-station where Lynne was found were away from busy areas and meant her screams would have not been heard. Mrs Weedon said: 'I will make a mother's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford's lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.' Lynne was beaten and raped 30 yards from her home in Lampton Avenue, Hounslow (left) - she attended Lampton School (right) next to her house . Last week, former detective Colin Sutton pinned a third unsolved murder on the man who murdered Miss Stratford and Lynne. Mr Sutton, who solved the Levi Bellfield and Night Stalker cases, believes Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. He told the Sun: 'I have no doubt the same man committed all three.' 'I was quickly struck by the similarities with that of Eve Stratford. 'A woman killed in her own home by having her throat slit? That is rare enough today — in the 1970s it was almost unheard of. 'For this to have happened twice, with identical wounds, within a few miles of each other was just too much of a coincidence.' He added: 'My gut feeling tells me he (the killer) is still out there some where and still nervous about a knock on his door.' Ms Farrow, a mother-of-two, was pregnant when she was stabbed to death at her home in Woodford, Essex, on January 19, 1979. When her daughters Sam, 11, and Justine, eight, returned from school at 3.30pm they found the door locked and looked through the letterbox where they saw their mother's body face down in the hall. The blood-stained murder weapon, a serrated carving knife, was found in the kitchen. Witnesses described seeing a man lingering in the area, wearing a check lumber jacket and cowboy hat. But he was never traced.

"Disgraced news anchor Brian Williams has admitted to feeling haunted by the ‘ghost’ of his famed predecessor Tom Brokaw, whose presence he still felt looming over the Nightly News even after more than ten years in the hot seat. Williams, 55, is currently serving a six month suspension without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina, among others. The anchor is banned from speaking publicly during his ban, but several NBC News staffers have revealed that the legacy of legendary anchor Brokaw leaned heavy on Williams. Scroll down for video . Disgraced news anchor Brian Williams has admitted to feeling haunted by the ‘ghost’ of his famed predecessor Tom Brokaw, even after more than ten years in the hot seat. Williams’ admission to his own insecurities were revealed during a conversation with colleague Chuck Todd last Summer, reports New York magazine. The pair were talking after it was announced that Todd would replace David Gregory as moderator on Meet The Press. Todd had been tasked with reviving the Sunday morning show which had suffered a ratings slump after Tim Russert’s death in 2008. ‘At least your ghost is dead. Mine is still walking the building,’ Williams told Todd. Brokaw, who still works at NBC News, was apparently ‘furious’ when news of Williams’ exaggerated claims embarrassed the network last month. 'Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter,' said an NBC source. The New York article also reveals that Williams approached both NBC and CBS bosses in a bid to make the move to become a late-night host but his advances were spurred by both. A few years ago Williams had told NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke that he wanted to take over the Tonight Show from Jay Leno. News legend Brokaw, left, who still works at NBC News, was apparently ‘furious’ when news of Williams’ exaggerated claims embarrassed the network last month . Williams had told Chuck Todd that he was 'lucky' because his ghost was already dead . Burke turned down Williams's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called Rock Center, which Williams hoped could evolve into a variety show. Instead, the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and was canceled after two seasons, . Williams pushed on, however, and went to CBS CEO Les Moonves to suggest succeeding David Letterman. Moonves wasn't interested. In a bid to keep Williams’ happy NBC News president Deborah Turness presented him with a gift of veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old desk at a dinner in December. Williams was so moved by the gesture that he announced on the spot that he had decided to stay at NBC for another five years. He had sent Turness a note over the Christmas holidays that read, '2015 is going to be our year together', according to New York magazine. Less than two months later, Williams was publicly shamed and executives were left struggling how to deal with the situation. There continues to be speculation that Katie Couric might be is in talks with NBC's incoming chairman Andrew Lack to make a return and replace Williams on the Nightly News. 'It makes sense (that she could come back) because she is so closely associated with the brand,' a source told the New York Daily News. Lack 'has not made up his mind' as to whether or not Williams will return when his six-month suspension is up, according to sources. A 'close friend' of Williams has said that the anchor 'can't wait until he can speak', which he can't do publicly until his suspension ends in the summer.","The disgraced news anchor has admitted to feeling haunted by the 'ghost' of famed predecessor Tom Brokaw .

"Diabetes could become a global epidemic affecting one in 12 adults around the world (file picture) Diabetes has become a global epidemic, affecting one in 12 adults, scientists say. And the number of sufferers is set to soar by 55 per cent in the next two decades unless the human population drastically changes the way it eats and exercises. The study by researchers at the University of East Anglia estimates that 382million people had diabetes in 2013. At current rates, that figure is expected to reach 592million by 2035. Around 10 per cent of sufferers have type 1 diabetes – an auto-immune disorder that is usually present from childhood. But the other 90 per cent have type 2 diabetes – an illness driven by a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. The chronic illness is a particular problem in fast-developing countries. In China and India, almost 10 per cent of adults have diabetes, compared with the global average of 8.3 per cent, reveals the study published in the journal Pharmaco Economics. In Britain, around 3.2million people have diabetes. Lead researcher Till Seuring said: ‘Diabetes has become an epidemic. ‘The rising prevalence of diabetes in these countries has been fuelled by rapid urbanization, changing eating habits, and increasingly sedentary lifestyles. ‘Diabetes affects 382 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to grow to 592 million by 2035. ‘It is a chronic disease that has spread widely in recent decades - not only in high-income countries, but also in many populous low and middle-income countries such as India and China.’ He added: ‘We would hope that the findings further increase the policy attention being paid to diabetes prevention and management in rich countries and it should in particular make health and economic policymakers in developing countries aware of the economic damage that diabetes can do.’ The study, published in the journal Pharmaco Economics, cited data from the International Diabetes Federation estimating that 8.3 per cent of adults aged 20 to 79 now suffer from diabetes. In China and India the number is closer to 10 per cent, with 165million diabetics living in those two nations alone. Mr Seuring and his colleagues analysed the impact on increasing number of diabetics on the economies of 20 countries. They found that increased healthcare costs and reduced workforce productivity could severely dent economic growth. A woman adjust a device which delivers insulin to her body. In Britain 3.2 million people suffer from diabetes . And Mr Seuring warned of a hidden cost of carers, many of whom leave their jobs to care for loved ones. In Britain, where 3.2million people suffer with diabetes, Mr Seuring estimated the cost to be significant. He said: ‘People in the UK with diabetes experience an income loss of £887 per year. But it is carers in the UK who are the worst hit financially, with a reduction in income of £1327 annually.’ That pales in comparison, however, with the US where the annual diabetes healthcare cost is $6,800 (£4,600) – and the total economic burden per person reaches $283,000 (£191,200) over a lifetime.","Researchers estimate 382million people suffered from diabetes in 2013 .

Yesterday, a distraught Philip Bramley visited the monument erected near where the Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed. His son was one of three Britons who lost their lives. Fighting back tears in Digne, close to where his son perished on Tuesday, Mr Bramley said: ‘What is relevant is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever. I don’t want it to be forgotten, ever.’ He added: ‘I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. We put our lives and our children’s lives in their hands. 'I want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person.’ Many people took to Facebook to offer Ms Tiirik condolences in response to the photo she posted, with one friend saying ‘he was the best guy you could ever meet’. Emotional appeal: Philip Bramley, whose 28-year-old son Paul (seen in the photograph) was one of three Britons on board the ill-fated Airbus A320, said the 150 who lost their lives should 'not be forgotten' Grief: Speaking at a memorial near the crash site in the French Alps, Mr Bramley (centre) fought back his tears as he talked about his son, who was returning from a short holiday in Barcelona on the doomed flight . Tribute: Paul Bramley told Sky News that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was 'ill' and his motivation for deliberately downing the plane was 'irrelevant'. Above, Mr Bramley holds a photo of his son at the victims' memorial . Ms Tiirik, who is from Estonia, replied: ‘Thank you! He was. It is a big loss for everyone. How it can [sic] be that the most lively and positive person there ever was can be taken from us in this way... I just don’t understand.’ Mr Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with Ms Tiirik. He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days’ holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family.","British student Paul Bramley, 28, was one of the 150 victims of the crash .

"Prize-winning Irish Setter Jagger was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of Belgium . A prize-winning Irish Setter allegedly 'murdered' at Crufts was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of Belgium, according to The Kennel Club. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Tongeren, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world's biggest dog show. His devastated owner Aleksandra Lauwers, 34, was convinced the pedigree dog must have been given the beef laced with poison at the event - as it was the only time the dog was alone. But The Kennel Club, which runs Crufts, said toxicology reports revealed the fast-acting poison was consumed 28 hours after the dog show. Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, said two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for Jagger's death. She said: 'There has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at Crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to Crufts that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons, thought to be on a piece of beef, were eaten in Belgium, shortly before Jagger's death. 'We have had confirmation, including from independent toxicologists, that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting. 'Severe clinical symptoms would usually occur within half an hour to three hours. 'Considering we are told that Jagger showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in Belgium, late on Friday March 6 night, leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention, we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at Crufts on Thursday March 5, some 28 to 36 hours earlier.' She said the poison was believed to have been given on a piece of beef that was largely undigested when the autopsy was performed on Saturday March 7 - the day Jagger died. The Club Secretary then pointed out that food is usually absorbed in dogs within six hours. Three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died at his owner's home in Tongeren, Belgium, 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at world's biggest dog show, pictured with Aleksandra Lauwers's son Jeremy . Her comments were made amid fears that at least six dogs were deliberately poisoned at the world famous show. But she said there was no evidence that any of the dogs taken ill at Crufts were actually given poison while at the show. 'We must stress that despite reports to the contrary which have caused a lot of concern to dog lovers, absolutely no dog has been shown to have been sick at or after Crufts due to poison ingested at the show, there are no veterinary reports or evidence to support this notion, and no official reports of poisoning have been made to the police,' she said. 'We have a lot of security measures in place to protect the dogs at our show and we continually review our procedures because the welfare and safety of the dogs is our first and main priority. 'Regardless of the fact that the poison was not ingested at Crufts a dog has very sadly died and we must now respect the owners' privacy and give them time to grieve.' Jagger suffered a fit and fell into a coma before dying in Aleksandra's arms back at the family home in the city of Tongeren, in Belgium. Two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran- were to blame for Jagger's death . She revealed a post mortem by a vet found cubes of meat laced with a toxin in his stomach and thought he may have been targeted at the show at Birmingham's NEC. The family's vet Dr Patrick Jans said Jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died. Speaking for the first time about the tragedy, he told the Mail: ‘I doubt that it happened at Crufts. I think it’s unlikely because of the long time delay. ‘I am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case.’ Nick Sutton, health information officer at the Kennel Club, added: 'Regardless of the specifics surrounding this particular tragic incident, where Jagger's owners suspect malicious intent, this tragedy has shone the spotlight very firmly on the issue of poisoning. 'It is important that dog owners know that the majority of poison related deaths and illnesses in dogs in the UK are accidental. 'Some accidents could potentially be avoided if dog owners were to be aware of the common household and garden items that can be harmful to dogs, including chocolate, raisins, onions, some pesticides and garden plants, detergents and many human medicines.' The three-year-old Irish setter was 'best friend' to the couple's son, Jeremy. The family have vowed to find the person responsible for his 'slow and painful' death . Aleksandra Lauwers (pictured with Jeremy and the litter Jagger was born part of) said she and her son are struggling to cope with the dog's death . Aldicarb and carbofuran are carbamate insecticides which are used in agriculture - but are not approved for use in the EU. Nick Edwards, senior information scientist for Veterinary Poisons Information Service, said: 'We understand that the toxicology report says carbofuran and aldicarb, toxic carbamate pesticides - which are no longer approved for use in the EU - were found. 'We would expect the clinical effects, if ingested by a dog, to be rapid in onset; normally between half an hour and three hours. 'After this time a combination of clinical effects, if the toxins were taken in sufficient quantities, would likely be present, including weakness, collapse, diarrhoea, slow heart rate, difficulty in breathing and excessive salivation.'","Irish Setter Jagger died 24 hours after winning silver medal at Crufts .

"Despite the ever growing popularity of online dating, virtual platforms are no match for interactions in the real world when it comes to finding true love, a new Australian study has found. Almost half of all Aussies surveyed by ticketing company Eventbrite said they met their partner at a live event. One in three people said they'd exchanged phone numbers at an event with someone they fancied and one in ten said they'd fallen in love. The survey found the most common hooked-up hotspots were live sporting and music events, followed by business and networking events. Scroll down for video . The most common places to meet a potential life partner in Australia are sports and music events, followed by business and networking events, according to the EventBrite survey of 1000 Australians . Passions in common: Kari Vallury met her husband Trillock at a world music event. The couple married last year at Adelaide's WOMAD music festival surrounded by 170 family and friends. From a survey of 1,000 Australians commissioned by EventBrite: . 35% of people (1 in 3) exchanged numbers . 32% of people (1 in 3) kissed someone . 30% (1 in 3) Approached someone they fancied at an event . 24% of people (1 in 4) held hands with someone new at an event . 16% of people (1 in 6) slept with someone they met at an  event . 10% of people  (1 in 10) have fallen in love with someone they met at an event . 41% of people said 'None of these' Food and wine, educational and fundraising events also featured in the study as likely places to find that special someone. The odds might be encouraging for hopeful singles jaded by too many uninspiring online connections. Of the 100 survey respondents, 32 per cent, or one in three people, said they had exchanged a kiss with someone new at a live event. One in six people had slept with someone they met at an event and one in ten said they'd fallen in love. When it came to preferences between virtual dating and real-world romance, the real world won out by a long mile. 97 per cent of people surveyed said they'd prefer to initiate a conversation with someone they fancied than to 'like' a photo of them on social media (just 3 percent) and 93 per cent of people said they'd rather lock eyes with someone across a room for the first time than receive a friend request on Facebook. As things develop, 95 per cent of people said they'd rather introduce their new mate to their friends in person than post a 'selfie' with their date to social media. The vast majority of people (92 per cent) would rather introduce their new lover to their parents than change their relationship status on Facebook. 'No replacement for real life connections': 93 per cent of survey respondents said they'd rather lock eyes with someone across a room than receive a friend request from a love interest on Facebook . 'While more and more first time interactions are being formed via apps and social media, the study findings are resounding proof there is no replacement for real life connections in taking a possible love match to the next level,' said Laura Huddle, Head of Marketing at Eventbrite Australia. 'Live experiences of all shapes and sizes bring people together to celebrate their common interests and passions,' she says. 'Being in a place with like-minded people and similar interests encourages people to be open and live in the moment.' It was certainly true for South Australian couple Kari and Triloks Vallury, who met at a world music event at an Adelaide bar and, after 18 months together, decided to get hitched at the city's famous WOMAD music festival last year. 'We hoola hooped in the gardens:' Kari and Trillock Vallury met through their shared love of music and were married 18 months later at WOMAD . 'We both love WOMAD. The food and ambience is everything we would want at our wedding. Trilok suggested it as a joking idea at first, but I contacted them and within a few months we got married there!' says Kari. She says 170 family and friends celebrated their union with them at the festival and the best part was not having to organise entertainment. 'We did the ceremony as soon as the gates opened, before the music started. We then went to see several bands with a big following of guests, ate great food from the Womad vendors and hula hooped in the gardens.' With the Australian festival season in full swing, now could be the perfect time to get out there and find your perfect match.","New study says you could be looking in the wrong place if you're only looking for love online .

"'U sound hot I wish I nva done that to u (but) to late' (sic). That's the text message a remorseful New Zealand criminal sent to a University of Otago student after he broke into her car. And it was just the beginning of remarkable banter which culminated in the apologetic thief returning a swag of stolen goods - including handbags and identity cards - to Kate McDonald, 20, and her four friends. Dunedin residents Ms McDonald, Julia Kerr, Kate Randhawa, Briar Middleton and Olivia Van Diepen visited Christchurch for a mutual friend's 21st birthday on March 14. Pictured (L to R): Julia Kerr, Kate McDonald, Olivia van Diepen, Briar Middleton, Kate Randhawa, all age 20, were attending a mutual friend's 21st birthday in Christchurch when Ms McDonald's car was robbed . The beginning: Kate McDonald decided to open up her conversation by taking a different tack - 'Hope the tampons and condoms come in handy'. As the conversation continued, the crook began to reconsider. 'U sound hot i wish i neva dne tht to u nw bt to late' 'Next tym take ya bags with ya': The criminal warned the girls not to leave their handbags unattended in a vehicle on future occasions . The next day the 'very hungover' students went sightseeing in town, leaving their handbags in plain sight inside Ms McDonald's car. When they returned they discovered the car's locks had been picked and their possessions taken. They were preparing to make a police report when they realised Ms Kerr's Nokia N100 was among the stolen goods. 'So I'm like, ""oh, why don't we try texting them?"" Nothing will probably happen,' Ms McDonald said. Ms McDonald drafted a series of text messages aimed at the criminal. She did not rail over her stolen possessions, instead taking a different tack - telling the crook she hoped he enjoyed his new condoms and tampons. To her surprise, the robber replied. '(He was) so funny. We had a good convo,' Ms McDonald told Daily Mail Australia. 'We became friends and (he) became quite remorseful of the fact (he'd) taken all our stuff. 'il add u on fb one day lol': After returning (most) of the girls' items, the crook pledged to add Ms McDonald on Facebook. She told Daily Mail Australia she hopes he comes forward . The students used text messages to sweet talk the thief and get back their stolen mobile phone and cards . Following a phone conversation, the sorry criminal informed the women he would leave their items at a look out near Spencer Beach Holiday Park in Christchurch. They were overjoyed to find everything there hours late, with the exception of some of their money and Julia's stolen phone. 'I guess once you put a face on the person you've stolen off it's hard to imagine that they're not hurt from what you've done,' Ms McDonald said. 'Most people wouldn't be able to contact the people who took their stuff. 'We just didn't imagine he would actually reply'. The thief has not made contact since, despite promising to add them on Facebook in the future. 'I hope the guy sees all this and comes forward so we can thank him,' Ms McDonald said. 'And get him to pay for my munted car lock - ha!'.","A group of university students reclaim their possessions after text message banter with thief .

"Archaeologists have discovered the long lost remains of Miguel de Cervantes - the author of Don Quixote . Archaeologists have discovered the long lost remains of Miguel de Cervantes - the author of  Don Quixote- in a Madrid chapel. Forensic scientists said they  found the bones of the famous Spanish writer and his family in Madrid's Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians. The author of The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,' considered the most influential work of Spanish literature, was buried in 1616 and the church was later rebuilt. But his remains were moved into the new building in the late 17th Century, and disappeared. His bones were lost for centuries until earlier this year when archaeologists used 3D scanners, infrared cameras and ground-penetrating radar to discover  a forgotten crypt under the building. Inside the niche, they found the lid of a coffin with the initials MC - for Miguel de Cervantes - and bones of at least ten people were also found inside the niche. Researchers said separating and identifying his badly damaged remains will be difficult but work is underway to recover his bones. Although there is no genetic proof at this stage, the team of anthropologists and archaeologists said they were confident of the claim on the basis of the documentary research they carried out. 'The remains are in a bad state of conservation and do not allow us to do an individual identification of Miguel de Cervantes,' forensic scientist Almudena Garcia Rubio told the BBC. Scroll down for video . 'But we are sure what the historical sources say is the burial of Miguel de Cervantes and the other people buried with him is what we have found.' Discovery: Experts analyse bones to find the remains of the 17th Century author Miguel de Cervantes at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid . On one of the wooden fragments the initials 'MC' can be clearly seen; investigators also discovered bones which they have determined belong to the late author Miguel de Cervantes . Cervantes was 69 when he died in 1616 and in accordance with his wishes, he was buried in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. 1547: Born near Madrid . 1571: Shot and wounded at Battle of Lepanto . 1575: Captured and enslaved for five years in Algiers . 1605: Publishes first part of The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha. 1615: Cervantes published the second part of his celebrated work . 1616: Cervantes dies aged 68, from suspected diabetes and with just six teeth remaining. He is buried at Convent of Barefoot Trinitarians . 1673: His remains are lost went when the convent is rebuilt . 2015: His tomb is rediscovered . His remains were then lost for centuries after his bones mysteriously went missing in 1673 when building works was done at the convent. Investigators were able to use clues from the author's own stories to help them identify the remains. Shortly before his death Cervantes wrote that he only has six teeth, but the most obvious marks were his battle wounds. In 1571, the writer was injured in the Battle of Lepanto, which pitted Ottoman Turkish forces against the Holy League, led by Spain. Aboard the ship La Marquesa, Cervantes was hit with three musket shots, two in the chest and one in his hand. Investigator Luis Avial told a news conference on Tuesday that Cervantes would be reburied 'with full honours' in the same convent after a new tomb had been built, according to his wishes. 'Cervantes asked to be buried there and there he should stay,' said Luis Avial, georadar expert on the search team. Excavation: A team of archaeologists and anthropologists take notes after starting the excavation work after identifying three unrecorded and unidentified graves in the chapel's crypt last January . Experts searching for the lost remains of the author of Don Quixote found wooden fragments of a casket bearing his initials with bones in and around them in a crypt in Madrid . The convent's religious order helped pay for his ransom after he was captured by pirates and held prisoner for five years in Algiers. He spent several months in a hospital in Sicily, but managed to recover. Cervantes is a towering figure in Spanish culture. His novel 'The Adventures of the Ingenious Nobleman Don Quixote of La Mancha' changed Spanish literature. The crypt will be opened to the public next year for the first time in centuries to coincide with the 400th anniversary of Cervantes' death. Experts pick through the broken coffins and dirt looking for bone fragments and other evidence . A plaque commemorating Cervantes on the Convent of Trinitarians in Madrid where he was buried . Don Quixote was the magnum opus of Miguel de Cervantes and was published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615. It is considered the most influential work of Spanish literature and one of the greatest works of fiction ever published. The book is also believed be one of the most widely read and translated books in the world. Cervantes influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often referred to as 'the language of Cervantes'. The author died in 1616 at the age of 69. In accordance with his wishes, Cervantes was buried in in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. His bones went missing in 1673 when work was undertaken at the convent. They were thought to have initially been taken to another convent before being returned.","Miguel de Cervantes was buried in 1616 in the Literary Quarter in Madrid .

"An Indonesian woman accused of ordering the murder of her wealthy Australian husband is claiming to be of another religion so she won't lose her inheritance, a lawyer says. Noor Ellis, 45, is facing charges carrying the death penalty after allegedly paying her maid's boyfriend to kill Robert Ellis, 60. The successful businessman's body was found in a Bali rice field in October 2014. Ellis told police her husband had neglected her and was denying her money she was entitled to - a claim that shocked family and friends who knew the couple. British man Robert Kelvin Ellis (left), here with wife Noor Ellis (right) was found in a rice paddock with his throat cut in October 2014 . 60-year-old Robert Ellis's (left) body was found wrapped in plastic with his wrists and feet bound and was dumped in a ditch in a rice field near Sedang Village. Sons Peter (centre) and John (right) now face the loss of their mother too if she gets the death penalty for their father's murder . The lawyer for their two sons, Any Aryani, says even as she faces the death penalty, Ellis is making moves to protect her inheritance. Ms Any says Ellis is now stating her religion is Hindu, even though official documents say she's Muslim. Under family law, which closely follows religious custom in Indonesia, if a Muslim woman is convicted of her husband's murder, she loses her rights to benefit from it. 'If Noor thinks ""I killed, I've been punished, but my inheritance rights remain"", well that's not possible,' Ms Any told AAP. 'We have prepared for that. 'As soon as the court states Noor is guilty of killing her husband, we will take legal measures that will ensure Noor will not get even the smallest bit of Bob's fortune.' Already in custody for his murder is his Indonesian wife of 25 years, Noor Ellis, the couple's two maids and the boyfriend of one of the maids . If the suspects are found guilty of murder, they could face the death penalty . Ms Any says she's confident Mr Ellis's Perth-based sons Peter and John will be well provided for. The young men say they will support the court's decision if it sentences their mother to death for the crime, because they just want justice done. Peter Ellis learned about his father's death via the internet, and hopes to be better informed about the trial process as it continues. Police allege Noor Ellis paid a man known as Aril, the boyfriend of her maid, $A14,000 to kill Mr Ellis. They allege Aril and four others slashed Mr Ellis' throat in the kitchen of his villa while his wife was in another room. The trial last week heard from a friend of Noor Ellis who lent her the money to pay the killer. Police move Noor Ellis from her detention centre cell to an investigation room in the Crime Detectives Division of Bali Provincial Police on October 27 . Ellis has her handcuffs temporarily removed at Denpasar District Court in Bali on February 4 . Ni Luh Yoskana Darmada thought the Rp 50 million was to buy ceramics for Ellis' hotel development. 'I was terrified,' she told the court. 'A week after she borrowed the money the police came.' Police officer Wayan Sujana told the court that when he informed Ellis that her husband's body had been found, her expression was 'like that of a sick person'. Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife . Noor and Robert's son John Ellis (in grey shirt) arrive at Bali police station in October to visit his mother . Robert and Noor's sons, Peter (left) and John (right) text messaged their mother (centre) the night he disappeared to ask where their father was . 'The defendant said she knew nothing of the incident,' he said. Police then examined the maid's text messages and found one from Aril that said: 'Danger, I just want to go back home'. He was caught trying to flee to his native island of Sumba. Ellis' trial resumes in Bali on Wednesday.","Noor Ellis admits planning execution-style killing of husband Robert Ellis .

"An American prog-rock star who has sold millions of records is at the centre of an online storm after a London ambulance did not have enough fuel to take him to hospital. Mike Portnoy, 47, a drummer with the iconic prog-rock outfit Dream Theater, said that he was barely able to stand or lift his arms shortly before he was due to go on stage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London on Saturday night. Paramedics attended the scene and said that the star needed to be taken to hospital so that his mystery illness could be treated. However, they admitted that they didn't have enough petrol to get him there. Scroll down for video . Downbeat: American rock star Mike Portnoy, 47, was struck down by a mystery illness before a gig in London, but was left stranded after the ambulance taking him to hospital ran out of petrol. He was eventually given a lift by a fan, but when he arrived at A&E, doctors forced him to wait because his condition was not life-threatening . Portnoy claims that ambulance staff said that he should find alternative transport, although the London Ambulance Service denies this. The drummer asked fans waiting for him to perform with rock band Neal Morse if they would drive him to the nearby Whittington Hospital. Once a volunteer was found, Portnoy was driven to Accident and Emergency. A London Ambulance spokesman said: 'An ambulance crew arrived at an address on Upper Street in Islington to take a patient to the Urgent Care Centre at the Whittington hospital,. 'The vehicle was low on fuel and requested another ambulance to take the patient to hospital. The patient decided to make their own way to hospital so the second ambulance was not sent.' When asked if the paramedics would have been allowed to fill up at the petrol station located next door to the venue, a spokesman said that he 'wasn't sure', but confirmed that the crew 'had been on the road since 6.30am and it was their last job'. Angry: Mike Portnoy, 47, an American rock star, spoke out against the Whittington hospital in London in an extended Facebook rant . But the litany of bad luck did not end there. According to fellow band member Neal Morse, after whom the group is named, 'it took us 30 minutes because of traffic that the ambulance probably could've avoided'. To make matters worse, when Portnoy arrived at Whittington hospital, staff told him that he would have to wait to allow them to deal with more urgent, life-threatening cases. At this point, Portnoy appeared to lose his temper. 'A very special NO THANKS to the staff at the Whittington Hospital for NOT seeing me regardless of telling them that there is an audience waiting for our show to begin,' he wrote on Facebook. 'I finally left WITHOUT seeing a doctor in order to make tonight's show. I have no idea how the hell I'm going to make it through this show. I can't even stand up or lift my arms.' His online rant generated thousands of responses, as fans and members of the public accused him of being a 'diva' and trying to exploit his fame to go to the front of the queue. One fan wrote: 'Not to be rude, but if someone was dying, I'd hope they didn't move you to the front of the line just to get you to a show. Very narcissistic thinking here.' Another fan, who said he was a doctor at the Whittington, wrote: 'As much as I'd jump at the opportunity to help you if I actually was on call tonight, please try to understand. 'Us healthcare professionals don't want anyone to wait or suffer at all. 'However, we encounter life-threatening conditions every hour, sometimes every minute, that stop us from seeing others that may be slightly less unwell, as quickly as we'd like. 'Waiting sucks, I know, but dying patients suck even more.' The intensity of the row provoked Portnoy's wife, Marlene Portnoy, 51, to leap to his defence. 'Some of you people are just so horrible,' she said. 'He didn't ask for special treatment because he was famous, his concern was the fans that paid good money to see a concert that was about to get cancelled.' Portnoy later apologised to staff at the Whittington. End of the road: An ambulance is parked outside the Whittington hospital, London. An American rock star, Mike Portnoy, 47, has complained that when he fell ill in London, a paramedic team was unable to transfer him to hospital because their ambulance had run out of petrol . 'It was not a personal attack or rage against England's health care system in general, of which I know nothing about,' he said. 'I did not expect any special treatment or wanted to be put ahead of anybody else in need. We only wanted some answers as the clock was ticking until showtime.' On Facebook, Portnoy said that the episode was 'one of the worst days of my life'. Whittington Hospital declined to comment.","Mike Portnoy, 47, a drummer with the prog-rock outfit Dream Theater, came down with a mystery illness shortly before going onstage in London .

"The first treatment specifically designed to treat migraines has been developed - a breakthrough experts say is of 'ground-breaking' importance. The new injection gives hope to the hundreds of thousands of people who suffer chronic migraines - the most debilitating type of headaches. The jab is made from monoclonal blood protein compounds. These are are antibodies - proteins produced by the body to fight injection - specifically engineered to fight the chemical that causes migraines. The protein compounds are able to 'mop up' another protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which triggers the pain, nausea and vomiting associated with a migraine. A new injection to prevent migraines has been developed for the first time, in a breakthrough experts are calling 'ground-breaking' In trials of 172 sufferers, scientists found the jab brought 'significant reduction' in the numbers of hours and days chronic migraine patients suffered headaches. The International Headache Society defines chronic migraine as more than 15 headache days per month over a three-month period - more than eight migrainous – if it has been ruled out that the headaches are caused by an overuse of medication. A migraine is severe recurring headache, usually affecting only one side of the head, characterised by sharp pain and often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), up to four per cent of the world's adult population have headaches on 15 or more days every month. It has identified chronic migraine as more disabling than blindness, paraplegia angina or rheumatoid arthritis. It has also categorised migraine at the same level of disability as dementia, quadriplegia and acute psychosis. And people with migraines or severe headaches are three times as likely to become depressed than healthy individuals, the WHO warns. This can lead to sufferers often becoming depressed and unable to cope, says the charity The Migraine Trust. While internal or outside influences can bring on a migraine, the mechanism by which one is triggered is understood. A combination of reactions occur that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) being produced and released. CGRP causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve, which is located on both sides of the head. This leads to a painful headache, sometimes with aura – meaning the person experiences visual disturbances, dizziness and vertigo – as well as nausea and vomiting. Researchers found monoclonal blood proteins – antibodies specifically engineered to bind to CGRP – were able to 'mop up' the chemical, meaning it did not trigger a migraine. Peter Goadsby, director of the NIHR-Wellcome Trust King's clinical research facility, London, and a trustee of The Migraine Trust, told MailOnline this was a 'landmark' breakthrough. He said: 'This announcement is of ground-breaking importance, as it represents the first potential, specific treatment for chronic migraine ever developed. The injection, which is made from proteins called monoclonal blood proteins, is able to 'mop up' another chemical which triggers migraines when it is released in the brain . 'All interested physicians will watch this development with excitement, as it offers a chance to do more for our most disabled migraine patients, as we invest in further research for an eventual cure. 'The message for people with the condition is that there are real developments which will make substantial improvements to their treatment.' He said past medications used to treat migraines – beta-blockers, anti-depressants, and epilepsy medicines – are 'borrowed' from other specialities, whereas this injection works specifically for migraines. While internal or outside influences can bring on a migraine, the mechanism by which one is triggered is understood. A combination of chemical reactions occurs that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) being produced and released. CGRP causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve, which is located on both sides of the head.

Researchers found monoclonal blood proteins – antibodies specifically engineered to bind to CGRP – were able to 'mop up' the chemical, meaning a migraine was not triggered. These treatments all have side effects, whereas none have been identified for the new injection. It also prevents the onset of migraines, rather than treating them when a headache has come on. He said: 'If you have 15 days or more and you're just chasing the headaches it's not a good strategy. No side effects have been identified. As the injection will be expensive, he expects the injections to be offered as a last resort, after the first line treatments such as antidepressants have been tried. Wendy Thomas, chief executive of The Migraine Trust, said: 'Many chronic migraine patients find existing treatments are ineffective, or cause unpleasant side effects. This breakthrough has the potential to give them back a more normal life.' Due to the way and how long sufferers are affected, people with chronic migraine take considerably more time off work, school, leisure, housework and social activities than episodic migraine patients. Efficiency is also hit, with work or school productivity more than halved - described as a migraine 'hangover' by numerous sufferers. Incapacity for over half a month sometimes means people cannot work at all, with some claiming disability living allowance. If the treatment given in the trials passes further tests, the injections could become available within a few years. The next step will be a phase III trial on a larger population of people, in which the injection will be tested against a placebo.","Migraines are triggered by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) protein .

"Trainspotting isn't usually regarded as a dangerous hobby. But a young Chinese train enthusiast was lucky not be killed when he was frazzled by high-voltage wires as he stood on top of a locomotive while posing for pictures. Lin Ho, 21, and a group of friends had gone to the station in the city of Fuzhou in south-eastern China's Fujian province to take photos of trains, according to The People's Daily Online. Horrific: Lin Ho, 21, and a group of friends had gone to the station in Fuxhou to take photos of trains . Accident: But when Ho climbed up on top of the train, he touched the wires - turning him into a fireball . But after clambering up onto one engine Ho, from Putian, was seen to reach up and touch the overhead wires,  sending 35,000 volts ripping through his body. Horrified pal Shi Tao, 22, said: 'One minute he was laughing and excited and the next he erupted into a ball of fire and was thrown right off the top of the roof. 'We ran over but he was burning and we couldn't get close so we began screaming for help.' Another witness told Fujian Southeast Network he watched three men climb up onto the roof. Xiao Yibo told the network: 'I see one of the men suddenly raised his arm but he did not actually touched the wires above his head.' He said the next moment there was a loud bang, and the man caught fire and fell down. Mr Xiao yelled at the two friends, who appeared to be in shock, to get off the train as soon as possible. 'Someone fetched a fire extinguisher and put out the fire on the man,' said Mr Xiao. Ho was then rushed to hospital, where he was treated in a special burns unit. A hospital spokesman said: 'More than 80 percent of his body is severely burnt and although he is still alive he is by no means out of danger yet. 'Even if he recovers, electricity has done horrific damage to his body. 'He is being closely monitored.' Not out of danger: Ho was rushed to hospital, but suffered 80 per cent burns to his body . A spokesman for the railway station said the cargo trains which passed through were popular with locals, who visit to take pictures. It is reported even newly married couples visit the station for photos, and many climb on the trains' roofs to get better shots. However, the spokesman was clear they try to discourage people from wandering onto the area where the trains are kept. 'But there are some, including children, who sneak into the area to play despite the fact we make it quite clear it isn't allowed,' he added.","Friends say Lin Ho, 21, was turned into a fire ball after he touched wires .

"A Hong Kong pianist who murdered his parents before chopping up their bodies and cooking them in a microwave has been jailed for life. Henry Chau Hoi-Iueng, 31, was found guilty of killing his devoted mother Siu Yuet-yee, 63, and father Chau Wing-ki, 65, before salting, cooking and packing their body parts into lunchboxes 'like barbecued pork.' It is thought that he wanted them dead after they became reluctant to fund his lavish lifestyle. Henry Chau Hoi-lueng, pictured, who has been jailed for life after being found guilty of the brutal murder of his parents in Hong Kong . Chau's parents, Chau Wing-ki, 65, right,  and Siu Yuet-yee, 62, left,  who were chopped up and cooked with rice . At Hong Kong's High Court, Chau, who wore a loose-fitting grey suit while sitting in the defendant's dock, looked impassive as the life sentence was passed down. Judge Michael Stuart Moore also handed down an additional nine years and four months in jail for two separate charges of preventing the lawful burials of his parents, which he admitted earlier. He described Chau as 'narcissistic' and 'preoccupied with fantasies for success' before branding him a 'dangerous individual. The judge added: 'People may wonder why you did his. The fact is there is no obvious answer is what makes you so dangerous. 'You always blame your faults on others not yourself. Your parents became the victims of your blame.' The court had previously heard how Chau's parents went with him on the morning of their murder to his friend Tse Chun Kei's home in Tai Kok Tsui in the west of Hong Kong. Several days after they disappeared, their eldest son Chau Hoi-ying, wanted to raise the alarm but Chau said the pair were visiting mainland China. However, he then sent a WhatsApp message to friends admitting that he had killed his parents. Chau Hoi-Leung outside Hong Kong High Court at an earlier appearance. The judge described him  as 'narcissistic' and 'preoccupied with fantasies for success' Tse Chun-kei (pictured), was cleared of the murder charge but admitted preventing a lawful burial . They reported this to police and when officers arrived at a flat belonging to his friend Tse, they found his Chau's parents' heads stored in two large refrigerators. Several plastic lunch boxes containing chopped flesh and organs were also found, along with a further three boxes containing salted body parts. The missing body parts are believed to have been cooked and eaten. A pathologist reassembled the skeletons, which had same parts missing. He testified that the couple were stabbed in either their chest or neck before being dismembered. Henry Chau told investigators that he wanted to kill himself six months before the attack. Police found the heads of Chau's parents inside these refrigerators removed from Tse's apartment . Police show the weapons used by Chau to kill his parents after he invited them round for dinner . Prosecutors also believe he was angry at his father for refusing to turn the volume down on the TV while he studied and was also annoyed with his mother for forcing him to study the piano. Police believe that the couple were murdered and dismembered in Tse's, although he denied taking any part in the killing and was acquitted. However, Tse was handed a one-year jail term for the unlawful burial charges but was released from custody due to the length of time he has already spent on remand. Prosecutors claimed that Chau and Tse discussed a range of methods of disposing of the bodies - including mixing the remains with cement and throwing them away as bricks. Other plans included cooking the remains and throwing them into the sea. Tse said the only reason he helped Chau is because he was afraid that his friend would kill his mother. Chau first claimed that he did not kill his parents but only helped his friend dismember the remains. He later tried to plead guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.","Henry Chau Hoi-Iueng has been jailed for life for murdering his parents .

"A Cairo schoolboy died on Sunday after being severely beaten by his teacher who has now been suspended, Egypt's education ministry said as an inquiry was launched. Corporal punishment is common in Egyptian schools, where official negligence has been blamed for the deaths in late 2014 of two children in accidents because of badly maintained equipment. The 12-year-old pupil died on Sunday 'after being beaten by a teacher the previous day', a ministry statement said.

The child had head injuries and suffered a brain haemorrhage, forensics department chief Hisham Abdel Hamid told AFP. The number of child abuse cases in Egypt has reached alarming proportions. Between January 2014 and the end of October, attacks on children increased by 55 per cent compared with the average over the previous three years, the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood said in December. It said 50 per cent of the cases of violence against children were registered in schools. In September, the director of a Cairo orphanage was sentenced to three years in jail for assaulting minors.

"A French court has ruled that that it has jurisdiction to judge a case against Facebook, after the U.S.-based social network blocked a man's account for posting a painting of a woman's genitals. The Frenchman, a teacher and a father-of-three, posted an explicit 19th-century oil painting depicting the lower half of a naked woman in 2011, and was subsequently blocked. The man sued Facebook that year, but lawyers representing the social network has argued that it does not fall under French jurisdiction. Blocked account: The Frenchman, a teacher and father-of-three, was blocked after posting an image of Gustave Coubet's painting The Origin Of The World on his Facebook account . The unnamed man had posted an image of  Gustave Coubet's painting The Origin Of The World on the social networking site four years ago. He claims he missed messages and 'social contact' from his 800 Facebook friends when the page was taken down on the eve of his birthday on February 27, 2011. At the time, the unnamed man's lawyer Stephane Cottineau said repeated emails to the California based company demanding the page be reinstated had also gone unanswered. He added: 'This blind censorship and refusal to reply to emails suggests he is not worthy of their attention and is someone who has acted immorally or illegally. 'Deleting his account is a breach of his human rights, which guarantees my client's freedom of expression. French rules: The Paris court has ruled that that it does have jurisdiction to judge a case against Facebook, despite the U.S.-based social network arguing it has to be done in California . 'It is also in breach of his rights as a consumer under French law.' Earlier this year, Facebook's lawyer Caroline Lyannaz argued that the site did not fall under French jurisdiction as users have to sign a clause agreeing that only a California court can rule in disputes relating to the firm. Facebook's rules state users 'will not post content that is hateful, threatening, or pornographic, or that incites violence, or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.' However, a Paris court ruled yesterday that Facebook's clause forcing all users to agree that any litigation must be based in the U.S. state, where the site is based, was 'abusive'. Mr Cottineau hailed the court ruling as a 'first victory won by David against Goliath'. 'This decision will create jurisprudence for other social media and other Internet giants who use their being headquartered abroad, mainly in the United States, to attempt to evade French law.' The lawyer said this was an 'abusive clause' as none of the 22 million Facebook users in France 'can ever take recourse to French legal jurisdiction in the event of a dispute.' Facebook said it noted the judgement and was considering its response. The court will hear the case on May 21.","Man posted 19th-century painting of woman's genitals on Facebook .

"Parisian women have always been known for their ability to look chic under any circumstances. As well as their sophisticated diet and their relaxed attitude to life, the women of the French capital have a few key rules to dressing that mean they nail it every time. Natalie Portman, who is married to the French dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied, revealed one of the key style points in an interview this weekend that has previously been unknown by many - that Parisian women don't wear shorts. Scroll down for video . Natalie Portman, 33, who married a Frenchman, says that Parisians would never wear shorts in the city . She told the Wisconsin Gazette: 'The city is so rich in terms of the architecture, the bookshops you find at every corner, the way everyone dresses so well. 'No Parisian ever walks around in shorts and even the children look very chic.' Parisians haven't just abolished shorts, they also steer clear of high heels, matching accessories and would never, ever been seen in a pair of tracksuit bottoms. Read on to discover the top tips Parisian women have for looking chic... Actress Vanessa Paradis attends a film premiere in head-to-toe black, a regular choice for Parisian women . Embrace black . Black is the overwhelming shade in every Parisian woman's wardrobe. It is key to make sure that you appear effortless and to guarantee that your clothes won't clash. Lay off the accessories . While British women are all about quantity, the French are the opposite - jewellery is understated. Avoid piling it on too - as Coco Chanel once said: 'Before leaving the house, a lady should look in the mirror and remove one accessory.' Coco Chanel advised never to overload on accessories . Invest in some scarves . When it comes to scarves, the accessory rule does not apply. Parisian women love scarves and sometimes even wear two at a time by twisting them together. Don't try too hard . Parisian women are polished but never let it show. Their messy hair, often un-tucked shirts and barely-there make-up are all part of a conscious effort to look as though they have given little thought to their appearance. Lou Doillon always looks effortlessly chic, with a slightly crumpled appearance . Invest in wardrobe staples . There are some basic items of clothing that feature in every Parisian woman's wardrobe. They include a white shirt, a black leather jacket, a little back dress, a fitted blazer, a black pencil skirt and a pair of cigarette pants. These are then worn for years and adapted to changing figures using a seamstress, unlike British women, who would head out and buy the item in a different size. The items can be made to look different and more modern by pairing them with on-trend accessories. Don't be too matchy matchy . Unless we're talking about black. French women don't match their accessories - shoes can be a different texture and even a different colour to a belt or a handbag. Mario Cotillard plays by the Parisian rule of unmatched accessories . Learn to love flats . French women love flat shoes. They will wear heels in the evening, but during the day they wear ballet pumps , moccasins or biker boots. A woman who is hobbling in her heels will look unglamourous no matter how hard she has tried. Try out masculine tailoring . Women like Lou Doillon always look effortlessly chic in their masculine tailoring. The emphasis is on clean lines and a clean silhouette.","Natalie Portman has revealed that Parisians don't wear shorts .

"Activists: Members of the National Union of Students (file picture) have asked for jazz hands rather than clapping in case it caused anxiety . Young student union activists have asked other conference delegates to wave with 'jazz hands' instead of clapping or cheering speakers in case it 'triggers anxiety' among nervous members. Hundreds were asked to wave in silence because other people found 'whooping' to be 'super inaccessible'. The request was made at the National Union of Students' annual Women's Conference in Solihull, West Midlands, which started yesterday. NUS Women's Campaign tweeted: 'Whooping is fun for some, but can be super inaccessible for others, so please try not to whoop! Jazz hands work just as well.' They then followed that with: 'Some delegates are requesting that we move to jazz hands rather than clapping, as it's triggering anxiety. Please be mindful! #nuswomen15'. Critics have said the messages had 'damaged feminism'. Tara Hewitt tweeted: 'This damages real equality nothing from conference will make a difference today but ""jazz hands"" nonsense damaged feminism'. Others lampooned the instructions online. @JLat55 tweeted: 'Open palms can be triggering. Well, so can closed ones... you should just ban any outward expression of approval.' The suggestions got more ridiculous and ironic with @BookGeek-T tweeting: '@nuswomcam @Little-G2 hi, jazz hands can be triggering because of the quick movement of the hands. I vote blinking rapidly instead. Thanks'. Despite the jokes the NUS has said that it is important that they are inclusive. Nona Buckley-Irvine, General secretary at the London School of Economics Students' Union, said: 'Jazz hands are used throughout NUS in place of clapping as a way to show appreciation of someone's point without interrupting or causing disturbance, as it can create anxiety. 'I'm relatively new to this and it did feel odd at first, but once you've used jazz hands a couple of times it becomes a genuinely nice way to show solidarity with a point and it does add to creating a more inclusive atmosphere.' Practical example: This woman shows how jazz hands should be done - but NUS delegates were urged not to make any noise doing it . LSE SU women's officer Gee Linford-Grayson added: 'As someone who is new to the NUS conference culture it surprised me at first, but actually within a few rounds of jazz hands applause it began to make a lot of sense, as loud clapping and whooping can be intimidating and distracting when you're speaking on stage. 'Plus who doesn't like jazz hands?!' The annual event decides the female issues for the NUS to campaign on, and elects the campaign's representatives. An NUS spokesperson said: 'The request was made by some delegates attending the conference. 'We strive to make NUS events accessible and enjoyable for all, so each request is considered.'","NUS asks for waving in silence because cheering is 'super inaccessible'

"A businessman who once owned the world's most expensive home but was then exposed as a fraudster has failed in his claim to claw back £66million from the taxpayer after his mansion was seized by the State. Baljit Singh Bhandal bought and developed Updown Court, a 100-room mansion in Surrey, using the proceeds from money laundering and evading tax on alcohol sales. HM Revenue and Customs took control of the home as part of an investigation into his business - but his prosecution on fraud charges subsequently collapsed. However, today a High Court judge told him he was not entitled to compensation because it was 'beyond any reasonable doubt' that he was in fact guilty of the crimes he was accused of. Court case: Baljit Singh Bhandal, who built Updown Court, pictured, has lost his claim for compensation over the seizure of the property . Luxurious: The home was once the world's most expensive property when it went on sale for £70million . Bhandal bought Updown Court in the 1990s, after it had been practically gutted by the Great Storm of 1987, and rebuilt the interiors in a lavish style. The home was raided by HMRC in 2001, after Bhandal was accused of smuggling duty-free alcohol out of the bonded warehouse where it was stored and selling it on the black market. He was taken to court, but the case collapsed when it emerged that the manager of the warehouse was a police informant. Bhandal jumped bail and left the country using a false passport during the failed trial, but on his return to the UK in 2005 he was jailed for eight years for attempted kidnap. In his latest legal struggle, he argued that HMRC owed him millions in compensation because he would have been able to develop and sell Updown Court if he had not been arrested and prosecuted on the fraud charges. Lavish: Updown Court, which sold for £35million in 2011, is decorated throughout with marble interiors . Fraud: Bhandal lost his claim that the house, which boasts a bowling alley, was wrongly seized . Government lawyers insisted that he was guilty all along despite the collapse of the trial, saying: 'There was no acquittal on the merits and it was clear that massive fraud had been committed.' They claimed the seizure of the mansion was legitimate because it had been bought using the proceeds of crime. Mr Justice Collins today dismissed Bhandal's case, saying: 'I regarded him as a thoroughly unsatisfactory witness. 'I am satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the criminal conduct alleged against him and that Updown Court was acquired from the proceeds of crime.' The house in Windlesham, Surrey was said to be the most expensive home on the market anywhere in the world when it went up for sale for £70million. View: This image shows the rooftop pool on top of the house in Windlesham, Surrey . It was owned by property tycoon Leslie Allen-Vercoe, who claimed to have spent £30million on renovating it - but it passed into the hands of the Irish government when he was unable to pay the mortgage he had taken out with a State-owned bank. The property was finally sold to an unidentified buyer, said to be a foreign businessman, for £35million in October 2011. Updown Court is situated in a 58-acre estate, with 24 bedrooms, a 50-seat cinema, six swimming pools and a heated marble driveway. It boasts decadent luxury features such as mosaics made out of real gold, and more practical amenities including a panic room and escape tunnels. The house featured in the 2010 film Green Zone, starring Matt Damon, where it portrayed a palace in Baghdad.","Baljit Singh Bhandal built a huge fortune from fraudulent alcohol business .

"Agonising wait: Catherine Urhegyi, 32, who is 26 weeks pregnant, won't know if the abortion drug has affected her baby until she is born . It was the heart-stopping moment that every mother- to-be dreads. A routine scan to determine Catherine Urhegyi’s due date revealed her longed-for second child was dead in her womb. Numb and bewildered, she was told she could miscarry naturally or have an abortion. She and husband Andrew were distraught. ‘I’d gone along expecting to see a baby on the scan,’ she recalls. ‘I hadn’t been expecting bad news. So I was stunned to be told there was no heartbeat. I just burst into tears.’ Reluctantly, the couple agreed to an induced abortion and Catherine took medication to start the process. Two days later, after a bout of heavy bleeding, Catherine returned to Salford Royal Hospital to complete the abortion. There – much to her astonishment and delight – a further scan, carried out before a second drug was administered, detected a heartbeat. The girl they had hoped would complete their family had not died as the hospital had said. And against all the odds, she had survived the ill-advised abortion. Though thrilled, the couple now face an agonising wait until their daughter is born, fearing she will have long-term health problems as a result of the medication that was intended to induce the abortion. To make matters worse, doctors have told them that the heavy bleeding Catherine suffered could have been a miscarriage of a possible twin – killed by the procedure. As Catherine and Andrew struggle to understand how it could have happened, and what it could mean for them, the NHS hospital has launched an urgent investigation. Doctors have warned them they cannot be sure their little girl will not suffer birth defects because the abortion pill was administered during the critical 12-week development period for the foetus. The couple have decided to speak of their experience in the hope that hospitals will ensure they perform a second scan with a different sonographer if it is suspected a baby has died in the womb. ‘To say this has ruined my pregnancy would be an understatement,’ says laboratory manager Catherine, 32, who is now 26 weeks pregnant and already has a son Thomas, two. ‘Our little girl is a much-wanted baby and we are extremely worried she won’t now be born healthy. We are incredibly angry and upset. We can’t understand how doctors could have made such a big error. ‘In hindsight we believe a scan should have been carried out before I took the pill to double-check the diagnosis that the baby had died.’ Yesterday, holding hands with her plasterer husband Andrew, also 32, at their home in Walkden, Manchester, Catherine told how they had desperately wanted a second child. ‘We wanted a little brother or sister for Thomas and as I’d had a completely normal pregnancy with him, we had no reason to believe this one would be any different,’ she says. As her periods had been irregular and Catherine was unsure how many weeks pregnant she was, her midwife suggested she had a routine ‘dating’ ultrasound scan and referred her to Salford Royal. However, within minutes of doing the scan the sonographer told Catherine there was a problem. During a routine scan, medics told Catherine her child had died in the womb and that she should start an induced abortion, but the baby survived the process. Pictured: A scan of her unborn daughter . ‘She couldn’t detect any heartbeat and in fact said she believed the pregnancy had already started to disintegrate,’ recalls Catherine. ‘I was told I had three options. I could let a miscarriage occur naturally, which could take weeks, I could have a dilatation and curettage – an operation under a general anaesthetic to empty my uterus – or I could take a pill to induce labour. ‘I chose the pill because it meant that I could stay at home and wouldn’t have to leave Thomas.’ Doctors explained she would take the first pill, containing the drug mifepristone, by mouth. It works by blocking the hormone progesterone. Without this, the lining of the uterus breaks down. Then two days later she would return to the hospital for the final stage, which would involve a second drug, misoprostol, to bring on contractions and expel what remained of the pregnancy. The evening after taking the mifepristone, she began to experience heavy bleeding, but thought it was part of the process. To check the mifepristone had worked, Catherine underwent another scan, before taking the misoprostol. She recalls: ‘As she did the scan the woman looked concerned. She left and returned with a colleague. After pointing out something on the screen, the colleague nodded and left. ‘The woman then turned to me and said she’d found a heartbeat and estimated I was around seven weeks pregnant. I was amazed and overjoyed. But seconds later I was overcome with shock because I began to worry about how the drug might have harmed my baby.’ Shaking, Catherine rang Andrew who hurried to the hospital. ‘By the time he arrived I was in a terrible state,’ she says. ‘A consultant came in and said it was our decision, but due to the possible harm our baby may have suffered from the pill, it was still an option to continue with the abortion. However, there was no way, having seen my baby’s heart beating on a scan, I could carry on.’ Doctors explained that, as the drug acts by shearing off the embryo from the uterus, they could not guarantee a miscarriage wouldn’t happen in the coming days or weeks. ‘Because I had such a large bleed, I’ve since found out it might be I was pregnant with twins and did in fact miscarry one,’ Catherine reveals. ‘That was very upsetting. Nobody knows for sure but it is heartbreaking to think I might have lost a baby over this. And I have been terrified since that I will lose my baby I am carrying now.’ A spokesman for Salford Royal (pictured) apologised for the error and launched a probe into the incident . Since then, Catherine has imagined every little twinge is a miscarriage. ‘It is a miracle I am still pregnant, but I just haven’t been able to relax,’ she says. ‘I just wish I had asked for another scan to check, especially as I’d had no other sign anything was amiss with the pregnancy, but then I trusted the doctors. They’ve given me leaflets which explain the drug can be linked to birth defects. Some of these might not be immediately noticeable and will only show as our daughter grows. But there’s been hardly any research. I’ve been reassured she is growing as expected and I feel happier now I can feel her kicking. But doctors can’t check for everything. ‘I am trying to put what happened to the back of my mind and be positive but then I have moments of despair at night when I fear the worst. It is very hard. ‘We have found ourselves in a nightmare situation which could have been avoided. We only hope getting this out into the open will ensure no one suffers as we have.’ Jack Sharp, executive director at Salford Royal, said: ‘We again apologise unreservedly to Mrs Urhegyi for the error and the distress this has undoubtedly caused. ‘We immediately launched an investigation to understand how the incident happened and how we could prevent it occurring again. This has now concluded and a member of our senior nursing team has arranged to meet with Mrs Urhegyi in person to share those findings.’","Catherine Urhegyi was told after routine scan that baby had died in womb .

"NFL rookie and San Francisco 49ers linebacker, Chris Borland, has revealed a concussion at football training camp led to the remarkable decision to quit his multi-million dollar contract at the age of only 24. Revealing that the injury forced a total rethink of his career just one year into his $3million contract, Borland said that he was happy to turn his back on fame and fortune and cause a sensation within his sport. Fearful of permanent brain damage due to frequent head trauma, Borland said, 'There was a moment in camp where I sustained a mild concussion and it wasn't something that was detrimental to my health immediately but it changed the way I viewed the risks of my chosen profession. Scroll Down for Video . Confession: Chris Borland told CBS' Face The Nation that a concussion he suffered during training camp led to a rethink of his NFL playing career . 'I didn't want to go down a route that could for years be ultimately detrimental to my health.' Speaking on Face The Nation, Borland revealed he told his parents his decision by writing a letter to them. '(I told them) My career may be brief. I did a lot of research during the season and afterwards and came to the conclusion it was best for me,' said Borland. Having made his mind up, Borland became the first high-profile player to walk away from his NFL career citing brain damage worries. 'The decision was simple after I had done a lot of research and it was personal,' Borland said to Face The Nation. 'I was concerned about neurological diseases down the road if I continued to play football, so I did a lot of research and gathered a lot of information and to me the decision made sense.' Sensation: San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is retiring from the NFL over health concerns related to repeated head trauma . Last week, the NFL moved quickly to head off the damage done by Borland as the league battles with the rising concern over the number of concussions that players are suffering during their playing days. The NFL's senior vice president of health and safety said that, by any measure, football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes, safer tackling techniques at all levels of football, and better equipment, protocols and medical care for players.' 'We are seeing a growing culture of safety. Everyone involved in the game knows that there is more work to do and player safety will continue to be our top priority,' he said. However, Borland refuted that and said, 'football is inherently dangerous and that will never change.' While most people would consider walking away from a multi-million dollar contract to be madness, Borland said that at the very least he would want young players to stop playing if they were suffering a concussion. Backing: Tim Kawakami from the San Jose Mercury News Tweeted that he found the culture of football - and the lifestyle that comes with it - to be changing . 'I love the visceral feeling of the violence of the game; I think everyone that plays at a high level is passionate about that,' he said to Face The Nation. 'However I don't think you shouldn't be informed and you should have every opportunity to know all you can about the dangers of that feeling that you love and the sport that you're passionate about.' Hitting back at those who said he played for one year just to take home a lucrative payday ahead of another player who wanted it more, Borland said that was not true. I'm paying back three fourths of my signing bonus. I'm only taking the money I've earned,' he said. 'This to me this is just about health and nothing else. I never played the game for money and attention. I love football and I've had a blast. I don't regret the last 10 years of my life at all. I'd do it over the exact same way.' The announcement comes as an unexpected blow to the 49ers, who have already had a difficult off-season and also saw standout linebacker Patrick Willis retire last week. Culture change: His Tweet suggests that Borland's decision could mean putting him at the forefront of changing the perspectives of football . Legal concerns: NFL.com's Michael Silver suggested that people should take a step back from what Borland's retirement means for the 49ers and look at what it means for football as a whole . Knock-on effects: Monday Morning Quarterback's Andrew Brandt said that Borland's retirement could allow for other players to have more open discussions about concussions . Many sports reporters and commentators went to Twitter to express their thoughts about Borland's retirement. San Jose Mercury News's Tim Kawakami and NFL.com's Michael Silver highlighted what Borland's retirement meant for the larger sport of football. 'I used to think that 99% of players wouldn't be able to pull themselves away from this-- the game, the fame, the lifestyle. But...' Kawakami wrote. 'But the perspective is changing. Chris Borland just put himself at the forefront of that, and he obviously did it with a lot of thought.' 'I understand the compulsion of 49ers fans to see this through team-centric eyes, but Borland's decision is bigger than that, obviously,' Silver wrote. Monday Morning Quarterback's Andrew Brandt mentioned that this announcement might allow other players to be more open about concussions. 'Borland news may not lead to more players retiring early but may lead to less players inclined to hide and play through the head trauma,' Brandt wrote. Shadow: Sports Illustrated writer Doug Farrar suggested that Junior Seau's suicide may have played a role in Borland's Decision . Sports Illustrated writer Doug Farrar suggested that Junior Seau's suicide may have played a role in Borland's Decision. 'Looking at the number of early retirees in the NFL this month, You'd better believe the Junior Seau story has a lot of people thinking,' Farrar wrote. A class-action lawsuit involving thousands of former players, filed in 2012, contended that the league hid the dangers of brain injury among players while profiting from the sport's violent physical contact. There have been suicides in recent years by former NFL players, including Jovan Belcher, Junior Seau, Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson. In February, a U.S. judge refused to accept a proposed settlement between the NFL and the players, saying payment should be expanded for some players and families among other concerns.","San Francisco 49ers lineback, Chris Borland caused sensation by quitting .

"Elsie Watson, who passed away last year, was sent a council tax bill – for a penny . A woman who died last year aged 92 has been sent a council tax bill – for a penny. Elsie Watson left the paltry debt after moving from Woodley near Stockport into a care home whose staff forwarded the unopened bill to her son Barry Holland. The Stockport Council demand, which would have cost 60 times more to post than the penny debt, even offered Mrs Watson the chance to pay instalments. Barry Holland, 72, of Cheadle Heath, whose wife has paid the bill, has branded the letter 'ludicrous.' Stockport Council has since admitted their error and apologised. Mr Holland said: 'It is ludicrous, I really do think it is horrendous that the council can send out letters for a penny to someone who is 92, even if they didn't know she was dead. 'My mum was fiery, I imagine she would have gone down there, thrown a pound at them and said keep the change. 'These people have no knowledge or feelings. 'Whoever sent this has cost 60 times more than a penny with a stamp. 'The bill even said it could be paid in instalments on the back – how is that possible?' Mr Holland said his wife Sandra paid the bill just to put an end to the matter. The Stockport Council demand said Mrs Watson could pay it in instalments. The council have since admitted their error and apologised . Mrs Watson's son Barry Holland, pictured with wife Sandra, said the letter was 'ludicrous' even if his mother was not deceased . Mrs Watson, who had two sons and a daughter as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren, died in August after battling ill health. She had worked as a cleaner before retiring. A Stockport Council spokesman said: 'This was an error. Our internal systems let Mrs Watson's family down on this occasion and we apologise to her family for any distress this has caused.'

"Those who claim Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor humiliate their contestants will be foaming at the mouth when they hear about ITV's latest prime-time Saturday night extravaganza. When international illusionist Keith Barry introduces an extraordinary new Generation Game-type TV show tonight, viewers will see what happens when the contestants who are competing to win pots of money are given bizarre instructions under hypnosis. They end up doing the most mind-bogglingly embarrassing things – to the extent that while your toes do curl for them, you have to remind yourself that they have willingly volunteered to make fools of themselves. Hypnotist Keith Barry with five contestants on ITV's new show You're Back In The Room . Hosted by Phillip Schofield, ITV's You're Back In The Room pits five hypnotised strangers against each other as they take on apparently simple game-show challenges straight out of Bruce Forsyth's 70s heyday, such as making balloon animals and doing impersonations of pop stars. The twist that brings it into the 21st century Hunger Games-style arena is when Keith – who's already hypnotised them – then sabotages their chances of winning by telling them to do the weirdest things. So for example, when a clutch of five contestants is asked to make sculptures out of clay, one is made to believe that the clay is a miracle face cream, while another is certain it smells of dog dirt. A third is convinced she really is a mad French sculptor, a fourth that everyone else's sculptures are obscene and the final one, when triggered by hearing that famous Unchained Melody song, believes he's Patrick Swayze in the amorous pottery scene from the film Ghost. Of course the question of how safe it is to play with the volunteering contestants' minds like this, and just how humiliating the results are once all inhibitions are removed, is going to make this one of the most controversial shows ever. Keith, an Irish hypnotist and magician who has appeared on stage and TV all over the world and also uses his technique to help people overcome phobias and shyness, admits even he wasn't quite sure what would happen. Kate Cook, with host Phillip Schofield, believes her sculpting clay is face cream after being hypnotised . 'They were like greyhounds coming out onto the track, ready to accept any suggestion I gave them,' he says. 'But I was a bit worried they might run amok because while Phillip is on stage at all times, I'm not. So even though the contestants couldn't see me I still felt I had a duty of responsibility to keep control over their behaviour. 'Hypnosis is about shutting down the conscious mind and re-igniting the unconscious and the imagination, so while I give instructions to them under hypnosis the contestants might interpret those instructions in all kinds of ways. For example, 60-year-old contestant Carolyn was a polite and gentle soul off-camera, but after hypnosis I could get her to do anything. When she was told to be a frustrated French sculptor, she got very, very angry. Phillip was shocked! 'Another contestant was asked to throw a pizza off stage. Her imagination went wild and she threw it over a member of the audience who happened to be beautifully dressed for her birthday celebrations. That proves just how spontaneous the show is.' Every week members of the studio audience who've come to see the show being filmed are invited to take part in a few tests before the show begins to see which of them are more susceptible to hypnosis – and so who is likely to make a fool of themselves and get the biggest laughs. Then five are picked to compete in the challenges onstage. 'Anyone can be put into a trance but everyone has different levels of susceptibility,' explains Keith. 'One studio audience test I did where I got people to imagine their hands are glued together was classic. Many of them, even the cynical ones, found they couldn't pull their hands apart. 'Once we've picked our five candidates I take them backstage and put them into a deep trance, which takes about 20 minutes. First I make sure they shut down their physical bodies by getting them to sit comfortably, focus on their breathing and relax. Then I get them to imagine they're at the top of the stairs and to count down, imagining their own choice of colour for the stairs and how many there are as they're walking down, so that by the time they reach the bottom they've drifted into a calm hypnotic state. From there I'm able to implant suggestions into their minds.' Keith then brings the contestants round before they emerge onto the stage. But they're still in a waking trance, and although they're speaking and acting normally in this state, Keith only has to say the word 'sleep' and they instantly nod off. At this point he can implant instructions into their minds which will get them to behave totally out of character – and hinder their progress during each round of games. 'Once you've hypnotised someone once, you can pretty much put them under instantly any time you meet them afterwards,' says Keith. TV chef Paul Rankin is served dinnerby a hypnotised contestant on the show . The instructions he gives them can have astonishing effects. One episode involves the contestants serving a champagne dinner to four popular TV chefs – Ed Baines, Aldo Zilli, Paul Rankin and Lesley Waters – in a supposedly 'posh' restaurant. But once Keith suggests ideas into their minds, it quickly turns into more of a dog's dinner. One woman is told she's lost her expensive ring in the mashed potato, while another participant is convinced the guests are toddlers who need encouragement to eat their food and the girl serving the gravy thinks she's aboard a ship in rough seas. Because detailed portrayal of the way Keith manages to put the contestants into a state of deep trance is banned under stage hypnosis laws, it naturally begs the question of whether the participants are acting, or at least playing to the gallery. Keith insists it's all bona fide. 'Phillip was sceptical at the outset but he soon realised how real hypnosis is and how it allows people to do things they wouldn't normally do. After each show he tells the studio audience that he would never have become involved unless he was 100 per cent convinced that everything I do is real. But putting someone into a deep trance can't be shown on TV for legal reasons in case someone does it at home and they don't have me there to wake them up afterwards.' David Behan, a Harley Street hypnotherapist who treats a range of issues from weight loss to giving up smoking, says, 'People have been using hypnosis to cure themselves and others since ancient Egyptian times. Paul McKenna brought the positive aspects of hypnosis to the forefront with his TV shows in the 1990s. He showed people how they could utilise hypnosis to help themselves become more confident and conquer anxiety, bed-wetting, losing weight and giving up smoking. But the onus is on the therapist to use this technique in accordance with a moral code. Does this show do that? That's not for me to say, it will be up to the viewer to decide. Lots of people have never seen hypnosis being carried out and may want to investigate more. I know of Keith Barry but have never met him, but he's morally bound to make sure no harm comes to anyone taking part. 'Hypnosis should be used to help people and not used to encourage others to laugh at them. No one can be forced in their behaviour, under hypnosis they are simply following a suggestion. It's a heightened state of awareness. Perception at its most open.' Whether the show will put off people who might have considered hypnotherapy to help themselves we can never know. Keith says at the end of each show his final task is to 'de-fry', as he calls it, the five contestants and bring them back to normal consciousness. 'I remove all the game show suggestions I've implanted in their minds and replace them with confident thoughts so they can look to their futures in a positive way,' he insists. Then he shows them the footage of what they got up to – and if you want proof of the authenticity of what goes on, married mother Kate Cook offers it. 'I'm a bubbly person but there's no way I would normally have been able to do what I did under hypnosis,' says Kate, 30. 'I was told to fall in love with Phillip Schofield. I believed I was utterly in love with him and I believed he loved me too. I was waiting for him to propose to me any moment. It was surreal. Meanwhile my husband Chris was in the audience and a man next to him, said, 'Good grief, can you imagine what her boyfriend will say?' Chris said, 'That's my wife!' We know we live in an age when people crave to be famous – or even infamous. Kate, like all the other contestants I spoke to afterwards, said how much she enjoyed the whole experience. Ross Calder, a 33-year-old musician who'd been told he was naked on stage, told me, 'I truly believed I was naked even though I could see I was actually wearing clothes. But after the show I felt energised – as if I could accomplish anything.' Those who believe in self-control will watch with their hands over their eyes but Phillip Schofield, who is no doubt hoping it will get similar sort of ratings to BGT, is convinced it will be a hit. 'It's absolutely hysterical. I had no idea what to expect, but the contestants completely lose their inhibitions under hypnosis. I think one of the highlights was Kate professing her love for me – you really have to see it to believe it.'

"Buzz Aldrin, one of the first two men to walk on the moon, used one of the world's oldest monuments to send a message about the future of space exploration. The 85-year-old former NASA astronaut, who touched down on the moon in 1969 with Neil Armstrong, posted a picture on Twitter of himself in front of England's Stonehenge, wearing a T-shirt reading, 'Get your a** to Mars'. 'While at @EH_Stonehenge yesterday I decided to send a message to the cosmos,' he wrote on Tuesday, accompanying the photo. Buzz Aldrin posed in front of Stonehenge in a T-shirt reading, 'Get your a** to Mars' on Monday, claiming he was sending 'a message to the cosmos' Stonehenge, a prehistoric ring of standing stones, dates back to between 3,000 and 2,000 BC. Aldrin's picture is the last move in his campaign for the U.S. to focus on having human settlement on Mars. The veteran astronaut has written a series of columns stressing that space exploration should continue. Aldrin has stressed numerous times over the years that space exploration needs to continue and the U.S. needs to have a goal of settling on Mars . He wrote in CNN last year: 'The moment to begin could be on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11's touchdown on the moon. 'We can make a courageous, Kennedyesque commitment to America's future in deep space. 'The U.S. President could utter these momentous words: ""I believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing an America-led, permanent presence on the planet Mars.""' In November of last year, he wrote a column for TIME, stressing that more people need to touch down in space. He wrote: 'I firmly believe we will establish permanence on that planet.

"It was first hollowed out by in the 1990s the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which had been buying up local properties for decades, only for many more residents to flee after the organization was proven to have contaminated groundwater with hexavalent chromium. Now the town of Hinkley, California - a Mojave Desert community famous for being 'saved' by Erin Brockovich and then immortalized in Steven Soderberg's Oscar-winning film  - has been all-but deserted. After the movie was released in 2000, PG&E - who paid out $333 million in an out-of-court settlement - never halted its crusade to obtain land rights for most of the town, and last year stopped delivering bottled water to the few locals that remained, after tests in the area showed the chromium levels were below the maximum. As a result, Hinkley has sadly started to grind to a halt. Closed for business: Hinkley, the The Mojave Desert community whose toxic chromium contamination was portrayed in the movie 'Erin Brockovich', has already lost its post office and will now lose its only gas station and convenience store . Shutting down: Hinkley's business has been dwindling as the community struggled with concerns over the cancer-causing chromium-6 in well water. Here, Ali Abu Hantash, owner of Hinkley Market & Gas, sits and waits for customers to enter his general store in Hinkley, Calif. The store will close in the coming weeks . Deserted: Hinkley, an unincorporated community in the Mojave Desert, in San Bernardino County, California, 14 miles northwest of Barstow, suffered greatly from its only school shutting down . According to Vice, PG&E  continued their buy out to reduce the risk of any more lawsuits. In March this year, the Hinkley post office closed. Postal officials say they will be looking for a new location for the Hinkley Post Office, which had been at the same location since 1958. The number of street deliveries in Hinkley has dropped by nearly 38 percent — from 504 in 2012 to 321 in 2015, U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman Eva M. Jackson told the San Bernardino Sun newspaper. Huge hit: Erin Brockovich, starring Julia Roberts, was released on March 17, 2000, and grossed $28.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $126.6 million in North America and $130.7 million worldwide . Rented boxes dropped 76 percent, from 321 to 75, during the same period, she said. During the 1950s and 1960s, PG&E used chromium-6 to kill algae and protect the metal at its Hinkley natural gas pumping station. Decades later, residents blamed their illnesses on a plume of contaminated groundwater that is 8 miles long and 2 miles wide. The utility reached a $333 million settlement with residents in a case portrayed in the hit 2000 film 'Erin Brockovich,' starring Julia Roberts. Iconic: Albert Finney and Julia Roberts walk down the main street of Hinkley in a scene from Erin Brockovich . Business at the convenience store — the Hinkley Market — collapsed after the nearby Hinkley Elementary School closed in June 2013, the newspaper said. The school shut down because of dwindling enrollment. The market and gas station - the only store and place to get gas - will close at the end of April. The store was bought out by PG&E. 'It's another blow to the community,' Lester White, a longtime community advocate, said of the loss of the town's only storefront. No Hollywood ending: Hinkley has been decimated by the toxic water that has infected the area the decades . Empty: PG&E have been buying up homes in Hinkley for years just to knock them down and leave the land . Ruins: Some of the homes have been left sitting, rotting away. Locals say the town is nothing like what it used to be, but a few farms still remain . The land parcel containing the gas station, market and post office is owned by Barstow resident Tawfig A. Musitef, who could not be reached for comment. According to Brenda McIlvain, owner of Riley's Place, a roadside dive bar, the town was once 'full of such nice people'. 'But I don't think Hinkley will ever be like it used to be,' she told Vice. PG&E spokesman Jeff Smith told the Sun that the company is in negotiations to buy the parcel. PG&E has been buying residential properties in Hinkley for decades as people seek to relocate.","The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) continued buying up homes in Hinkley for years after their $333 million lawsuit payout .

"The first of our human ancestors emerged in Africa around 2.8 million years ago - 400,000 years earlier than previously thought, a newly discovered fossilised jawbone has revealed. The partially complete lower jaw, which was uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. This would make it the common ancestor for modern humans - Homo sapiens - and their extinct relatives including Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Neanderthals. The fossilised lower jawbone, shown above with teeth still in the bone, was found in Ledi-Geraru in Ethiopia . Scientists say the fossil, which is known as LD 350-1, is recognisably human but also has more primative features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the Homo family. Researchers who have digitally reconstructed the jaws of other ancient human ancestors say the fossil also matches what they would expect from this common ancestor. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.8 million years ago - LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . The discovery, which was found in the Ledi-Geraru area of Afar, has put a new date on the emergence of the first 'man' from our more ape-like ancestors. Dr Brian Villmoare, from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, helped lead the fossil hunters, said: 'In spite of a lot of searching, fossils on the Homo lineage older than two million years ago are very rare. 'To have a glimpse of the very earliest phase of our lineage’s evolution is particularly exciting. 'LD 350-1 reveals that many of the anatomical patterns we see in 2 million-year old Homo were established much earlier in the evolution of the genus. 'At 2.8 million years ago we see relatively evolved Homo traits in combination with other much more primitive anatomical features.' The researchers, whose work on the fossil is published in the journal Science, say the fossil could be a key missing link between the Homo lineage and a more primitive and ape-like rival branch of the hominin evolutionary tree called Australopithecus. Details of the Australopithecus are best known from a fossil named ‘Lucy’, dating back 3.2 million years, which was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. But exactly how Homo habilis had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record. The new discovery has helped to fill that gap. Scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the Homo family from those belonging to Australopithecus. Until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first Homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils. Scientists have been searching for decades for earlier examples in an attempt to understand how our ancestors split from other ape-like hominins. Dr William Kimbel, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University who was also involved in the research, said: 'The Ledi jaw helps narrow the evolutionary gap between Australopithecus and early Homo. 'It’s an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution.' The images above show the jawbone from different angles and how many of the teeth still remain in place . Anthropologists digging tin the Ledi-Geraru, pictured above, discovered the new jawbone in January 2013 . The jawbone was found in the Ledi-Geraru area, marked with a star on the map above, of Ethiopia . The fossilised jawbone was first discovered by student Chalachew Seyoum from the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage in Ethiopia in January 2013. It is thought to be the left side of an adult's lower jawbone that has canine, premolars and three molars still preserved in the jaw. Mr Seyoum said he was ‘stunned’ when he saw the fossil. ‘The moment I found it, I realised that it was important, as this is the time period represented by few fossils in Eastern Africa,’ he told BBC News last night. Dating of the fossil and the surrounding sediment suggest it is between 2.8 million and 2.75 million years old. Other fossils of antelope, prehistoric elephants and hippos discovered alongside the jawbone suggest that this early Homo species lived in open grassland and shrub habitats. This matches the picture that scientists believe was occurring around this time of climate change creating increasingly arid conditions in Africa. These are thought to be one of the main driving forces that led to the evolution of the Homo lineage and eventually our own species. Australopithecus, by contrast, was thought to inhabit far wetter environments and this may have contributed to their eventual demise. The researchers said that the changes in the new jawbone compared to Australopithecus suggest that evolution of different jaw shapes may have been a key step in the divergence of the two lineages. Professor Kaye Reed, also from Arizona State University, said: 'We can see the 2.8 million year aridity signal in the Ledi-Geraru faunal community, but it’s still too soon to say that this means climate change is responsible for the origin of Homo.' The new fossil has helped fill a huge gap in the evolutionary history (above) of how the Homo family appeared . Another study published in the journal Nature has also provided convincing evidence that LD 350-1 was a common human ancestor to the Homo family. They used 3D imaging techniques to scan partial skull of Homo habilis - a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname 'handy man'. It reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure, indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like. Their findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago - Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Homo rudolfensis. Scientists used 3D imaging techniques to reconstruct the skull of Homo hablis (left) which has provided clues about how this now extinct member of our evolutionary branch would have looked. The image on the right shows an early reconstruction of Homo hablis at the Westfälisches Museum for Archaology in Herne . They found that the ancestor of Homo habilis would have had features similar to those found in the fossilised jawbone LD 350-1. Professor Fred Spoor, a researcher of evolutionary anatomy at University College London and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, said: 'By digitally exploring what Homo habilis really looked like we could infer the nature of its ancestor, but no such fossils were known. 'Now the Ledi-Geraru jaw has turned up as if ‘on request’, suggesting a plausible evolutionary link between Australopithecus afarensis and Homo habilis.' This reconstruction of the jaw of Homo habilis by the UCL team shows that it was more primitive than the jaws of Homo erectus or Homo sapiens and was more similar to the jaw of  Australopithecus afarensis . Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the discovery of LD 350-1 could help scientists unravel the complex beginnings of our own species. He said: 'It gives us a better understanding of what was happening at the earlier end of the genus Homo. 'Finds like Kenyanthropus (a 3.5 million year old ape-like species) have made it harder to understand the relationship between the Australopithecines and us - in short it’s the replacement of the old fashioned unilinear model of a evolutionary branch with a multiple species based evolutionary bush. 'What’s becoming clear is that we have only a small part of the jigsaw puzzle. This new fossil may well be a member of our genus, an australopithecine or an hitherto unknown genus.'","Jawbone - known as LD 350-1 - was discovered in Afar region of Ethiopia .

"Veteran journalist: Jeremy Bowen said claims he is anti-Semetic are 'untrue and offensive' BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen has come under fire after accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of 'playing the Holocaust card'. The  Middle East editor posted his comments on Twitter during the politician's speech at the U.S. Congress. His tweet sparked outrage, with critics labelling the veteran journalist a 'slime bag' and calling his statement 'deplorable'. But the senior journalist has responded to his attackers and said claims he is anti-Semetic are 'untrue and offensive'. It comes just weeks after Mr Bowen's BBC colleague Tim Wilcox was accused of anti-Semitism over his coverage of the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo killings in Paris. Mr Bowen made his claim after highlighting how Prime Minister Netanyahu had referenced U.S. professor Elie Wisel, a survivor the Auschwitz, Buna and Buchenwald Nazi concentration camps. He wrote: '#NetanyahuSpeech He acknowledged Elie Wiesel in audience. Once again Netanyahu plays the holocaust card. don't repeat mistakes of the past'. The Israeli Prime Minister was invited to speak by the Republicans and he took the opportunity to slam an emerging nuclear deal with Iran. Mr Bowen was live tweeting the speech using the hashtag #NetanyahuSpeech. In response to the senior BBC journalist's tweet, Aboud Dandachi, who describes himself as a 'displaced Syrian from Homs' living in Istanbul', wrote: 'A deplorable statement by Bowen.' Twitter user @AndyLondon7 added: 'It's b/c of ppl like Bowen that Elie Wiesel has to remind people of the 1930s'. Shimon Chaim tweeted: '@BowenBBC 'plays Holocaust card'? Avoiding a repeat of genocide some cynical game to you is it?' @thehugheslady added: 'Bowen is a slime bag. Shame on him and BBC for using him'. Controversial: This  tweet sparked outrage, with critics labelling the veteran journalist a 'slime bag' and calling his statement 'deplorable' Response: Mr Bowen has responded to his attackers and said claims he is anti-Semetic are 'untrue and offensive' The UK-based campaign group, North West Friends of Israel, also expressed anger. It tweeted: 'err-'Holocaust card'? The holocaust wasn't a game, Jeremy. Maybe take a trip to Europe again to see how world treated Jews.' Mr Bowen has been the BBC's Middle East editor since 2005, having previously been based in  Jerusalem as a correspondent. When MailOnline asked him for a comment, he said: 'Nothing to add to the tweet I posted saying it was untrue and offensive to suggest I'm anti-Semitic.' Accusation: BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen (left) said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) was 'playing the Holocaust card' In January, the BBC's Tim Wilcox faced calls to resign after he told a French woman, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, that 'Palestinians suffer hugely at Jewish hands as well'. His comments came as he covered a rally in Paris following the deadly attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine and a Kosher supermarket. The woman had told him that she feared a return to the persecution of Jews seen in the 1930s.","BBC's Jeremy Bowen accused Israeli PM  of 'playing the Holocaust card'

"An unusual nexus of mining interests, relief work in Haiti, and a former U.S. first family is raising new ethics questions that could affect Hillary Clinton's presidential ambitions. Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, was a board member of a North Carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to Haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president Bill Clinton through the Clinton Foundation. Another board member of the firm, VCS Mining, was former Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, who co-chaired the charitable Interim Haiti Recovery Commission with Mr. Clinton. The revelation, smacking of cronyism and back-room government dealing, is part of a forthcoming book by Government Accountability Institute founder Peter Schweizer, whose work exposing the investment 'insider trading' habits of members of Congress caused national outrage in 2011 even though the practice was legal. Scroll down for video . ONE-STOP SHOP: Clinton presided over the grand opening of a Haitian industrial park in October 2012, two months before VCS Mining got a lucrative gold mining permit . 'Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,' his latest book, will go on sale May 5. At the time VCS Mining's 'gold exploitation permit' was awarded, according to a press release from the company, it was one of only two firms to get one. The Haitian government hadn't issued such a permit in more than 50 years. Tony Rodham, brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, sat on the board of a company that landed a gold mining deal in Haiti after Bill and Hillary Clinton directed millions into post-earthquake relief . Breitbart News first reported on the investigative nonfiction book's coming release. The January 2010 Haiti earthquake killed more than 100,000 people and affected more than 3 million. That disaster was followed nine months later by a cholera epidemic of historic proportions. The Clinton Foundation raised at least $36 million to help, according to its website. The Obama administration pledged $3.6 billion. 'Much of the U.S. assistance is provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development,' a department of the State Department that Mrs. Clinton led at the time, according to the department's website. Rodham's company got its gold mining rights in December 2012, according to the VCS press release. Schweizer's publisher, HarperCollins, said in a press release Thursday that it 'reveals how the Clintons went from ""dead broke"" on leaving the White House to being millionaires, describing in detail the way in which the Clintons habitually blur the lines between politics, philanthropy, and business.' The Clintons' family philanthropy came under fire in February for admitting it had accepted money directly from foreign governments including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman. Some of those donations came while Mrs. Clinton was the U.S. secretary of state. Breitbart reported that the terms of Rodham's gold windfall upset members of Haiti's senate: The government's royalties under the deal were pegged at just 2.5 per cent, half the customary rate. And VCS mining has an option to renew the terms for 25 years. HarperCollins executive editor Adam Bellow, son of the famed novelist Saul Bellow, said in a statement that in Schweizer's book, he 'coins a new term to describe the unique way in which Bill and Hillary tend to mingle their political, personal and philanthropic interests.' He calls it 'the Clinton Blur.' 'Schweizer’s exhaustively researched book raises serious questions about the sources of the Clintons' sudden wealth, their ethical judgment, and Hillary's fitness for high public office,' Bellow added. Mrs. Clinton was America's first lady and a U.S. shuhenator before losing the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama in 2008 and joining his administration the following year. In addition to howls from the political right about her foundation's role in attracting donors from among countries with whom she negotiated – $500,000 of the Clinton Foundation's Haiti donations came from the Algerian government, for example – she is under fire for using a private email address run on her own server, during her years at the State Department. She never had a 'state.gov' address. Instead she ran her professional and personal emails through her own Internet domain, 'clintonemails.com,' creating ethical and possibly legal issues because of the possibility that the State Department has not archived all her messages. CLOSE: Clinton greeted Haitian President Michel Martelly warmly when she arrived for the indutrial ribbon cutting in 2012 . Clinton got an additional black eye this week with the revelation that Scott Gration, who served as America's ambassador to Kenya for 13 months of her tenure, was ousted after he did somethign similar. When Gration took over the Nairobi embassy, according to a 2012 inspector general report, he insisted on the installation of a private, commercial Internet connection in the bathroom attached to his office so he could communicate with the outside world beyond the reach of the State Department. The Federal Records Act requires employees of executive branch agencies to keep their emails and make them available for permanent retention. The law originally did not explicitly apply to electronic communications; Congress updated it after Mrs. Clinton left her job as America's top diplomat. Stories about government higher-ups using private email addresses for government work are nothing new. One Obama administration official, former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson, used an email address with fictitious name attached – 'Richard Windsor.' But Clinton is widely expected to announce a run for the White House next month, putting her conduct under an unforgiving microscope. Members of Congress typically have private email addresses, something that's not prohibited under federal law for officials in the government's legislative branch. Federal law does, however, prohibit them from using their taxpayer-funded 'mail.house.gov' or 'senate.gov' addresses for fundraising and other political activity.","Book due out in May describes alleged sweetheart deal that netted VCS Mining a gold concession that hadn't been issued to anyone in 50 years .

"Forty years after his death, a legal battle yesterday began to play out in a Jerusalem court over documents belonging to Oskar Schindler including personal copies of the lists of Jews he saved from the Holocaust. The case has been brought by Erika Rosenberg, an Argentinian woman, who is suing Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust museum over a suitcase containing thousands of Schindler's documents. The case sheds unusual light on Schindler's personal life after he saved some 1,200 Jews from the Nazis during World War II, and the battles over his estate. Visitors at the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem walk past a portrait of Oskar Schindler, who saved some 1,200 Jews from the Nazis during World War II. Argentinian Erika Rosenberg is suing the museum over a suitcase containing thousands of Schindler's documents . An Ultra-Orthodox Jewish man looks at facsimiles of Oskar Schindler's lists displayed for the public at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, where the original documents are being stored in the museum's archives. The Yad Vashem Holocaust museum insists the documents it received in 1999 never belonged to Emilie Schindler, seen here during a 1993 ceremony for her late husband in Buenos Aires . Schindler's story captured public attention with Spielberg's 1993 Oscar-winning movie . Rosenberg claims ownership of the documents by virtue of being the heir of the German industrialist's late wife, Emilie. The suitcase and the documents have been held since 1999 by Yad Vashem, which insists they never belonged to Emilie Schindler but were passed on by Oskar Schindler to a third party before his death. During World War II, Schindler, an ethnic German from then-Czechoslovakia and a member of the Nazi party, persuaded German officers - through bribes and other means - to let him employ Jews at his factory, saving them from the death camps. His story captured public attention decades later with Steven Spielberg's 1993 Oscar-winning movie Schindler's List, with Liam Neeson playing the lead role. After the war, Schindler emigrated with his wife to Argentina, but in 1958 returned to Germany alone and died there in 1974. She remained his legal heir. The suitcase containing Schindler's personal documents and pictures - as well as a number of copies of the original lists of Jews he saved - eventually turned up in the home of a friend, the late Annemarie Staehr. In her lawsuit, Rosenberg describes Staehr as Schindler's 'lover' and claims she took it from his home after he died. But Yad Vashem's legal team says their relationship was platonic and that Schindler had given her the suitcase and its contents as a gift. According to the plaintiff, the suitcase was found at Staehr's house after she died and her children handed it over to a German newspaper and the German national archives in 1997. When news of the discovery became public, Emilie Schindler took legal action in Germany to retrieve the suitcase and its contents. But when a judge turned up to search the premises of the newspaper in 1999, he was told that they had already been sent to Yad Vashem, court documents show. In 2001, Emilie Schindler returned to Germany where she died, childless. In the last decade of her life, Emilie Schindler became close to Rosenberg, her biographer, and designated her as heir to her estate. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler in Spielberg's Oscar-winning movie . Holocaust survivor Solomon Susskind - who was saved by Oskar Schindler's list - places a flower at the Hall of Remembrance during a 2008 visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem . A woman looks at copies of facsimiles of Oskar Schindler's lists displayed at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum in Jerusalem . Yad Vashem claims that Rosenberg is a 'serial suer' who is seeking to exploit Schindler's memory for her personal gain. Documents related to Schindler have financial as well as historic value. In 2013, the blueprints for an expansion of his wartime factory in Poland were sold for $63,426 and the same buyer paid $59,135 for a 1944 letter of introduction signed by Schindler. None of the original lists of Jews comprising the 'Schindler lists' remain, but historians believe seven copies were made of them shortly after World War II. Only one such copy is currently in private hands. Every so often unsuccessful efforts are made to sell that document, most recently in 2013 with a starting price of $3 million. Naor Yair Maman, who represents Rosenberg, told AFP in March his client had tried to retrieve the documents informally for years, before finally resorting to legal action against Yad Vashem. 'I've no doubt that the issue of the ownership is very clear,' he told AFP. 'Even if you believe that from the historical-academic perspective, it would be preferable that the documents remain in Yad Vashem, you have no right, whatsoever, to claim title to someone else's property,' he said. Rosenberg doesn't say in the suit what she wants to do with the documents. Yad Vashem is a national institution which is tasked with gathering, examining and researching materials pertaining to The Holocaust. It is venerated within Israel and a mandatory stop on the itinerary of visiting dignitaries. The museum says the disputed documents 'belong in the public domain'. Yad Vashem insists it is legally entitled to the documents and has not acted in an underhand manner, denying claims by Rosenberg's legal team that it had 'grabbed' the suitcase. 'Yad Vashem holds the documents lawfully and has acted the whole time openly and publicly,' it said in a statement to AFP, in which it expressed opposition to 'trading in Holocaust-era documents'. 'We will hold our debate with Rosenberg in court to ensure these documents do not reach private hands, of those who are not their legal owners and whose interests are unclear,' it said.","The case has been brought by Erika Rosenberg, an Argentinian woman .

"In a new twist in the continuing saga of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a towelette that was washed up on a Western Australia beach is now being examined to try and find out if it could have come from the disappeared plane. The small pre-moistened paper towel that was in a Malaysia Airlines sealed packet has been sent to Canberra for testing and verification after being found  by a couple walking along a beach in Cervantes in July last year, Nine News reported. The news comes just days after the one year anniversary of the plane's disappearance, with 239 people on board. Kingsley and Vicki Miller discovered the unopened packet at Cervantes, 200 kilometres north of Perth, and said it was ‘unopened, which was very unusual’. Scroll down for video . A reenactment of the discovery of the towelette that washed up on a Western Australia beach which may have been from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . The package was washed up on a Cervantes beach hundreds of kilometres away from where the plane is said to have disappeared . The small package has been sent to sent to Canberra for further testing . 'If it had of been opened and found lying there it would have been completely different,' Mr Miller said. The Daily Telegraph reported that experts believe it's possible for a small package such as the towelette to travel long distances without sustaining damage. However, experts believe that the package may not provide any helpful information as to the disappearance of the plane. 'A 6cm x 8cm moist towelette in wrapping branded with the Malaysia Airlines logo was found at Thirsty Point on 2 July 2014. It was handed in to the WA police,' said a spokesperson for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. 'It is unlikely, however, that such a common item with no unique identifier could be conclusively linked with MH370,' reported The Sydney Morning Herald. The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Kingsley and Vicki Miller discovered the unopened packet at Cervantes, 200 kilometres north of Perth . The MH370 flight disappeared on the May 8 with 239 people on board . The anniversary of the plane's disappearance was matched by a report which revealed that the battery of an underwater locator beacon on the flight had expired more than a year before the incident. The update on the progress of the probe surrounding the Malaysia Airlines plane indicates those looking for the aircraft would have had less chance of finding it. Apart from the anomaly of the beacon, the report devoted many of its 584 pages to describe the complete normality of the flight - shedding little light on one of aviation's biggest mysteries. The significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent, except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane, even if they were in its vicinity. The report said: ‘The sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents, and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability.’ The big question: Artist Sudarsan Pattnaik creates a sand sculpture of MH370 on Puri beach in Odisha, India . Standing together: Relatives of MH370 passengers attend an event today marking the one-year anniversary of its disappearance in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Whilst the battery had expired on the beacon of the Flight Data Recorder, the report said that the battery on the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working. However, in a statement on Monday, Malaysia Airlines said that a similar beacon was also installed with the solid state cockpit voice recorder and its battery life was still good. Relatives of passengers and crew marked the anniversary of the day the plane went missing, under a heavy police presence. Chinese relatives had planned to commemorate the disappearance of the Boeing 777 at a number of sites in Beijing, including the Malaysian embassy, the airport and the Lama Temple, a popular Tibetan Buddhist place of worship and tourist site. Sadness: A relative of MH370 passengers holds a sign reading 'Dad I miss U!' outside the Lama Temple today . Relatives of MH370 victims: (Clockwise from top left)  Li Jiuying holds a picture of her brother Li Guohai;  Jacquita Gonzales holds a portrait of her husband,  in-flight supervisor Patrick Gomes; Liu Kun displays a photo of his brother Liu Qiang; and Chinese woman Dai Shuqin, who lost five members of her family . Remembered: Jie Yie, four, holds a picture of her grandmother Lee Sew Chu and her aunt Ng May Li who were aboard MH370, in Kuala Lumpur today . Flight Captain: Zaharie Ahmad Shah . The physical and mental well-being of Flight Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was examined by the report, which said he had no known history of apathy, anxiety or irritability. ‘There were no significant changes in his lifestyle, interpersonal conflict or family stresses,’ it said. It also said there were ‘no behavioural signs of social isolation, change in habits or interest, self-neglect, drug or alcohol abuse’ by the captain, his first officer and the cabin crew. Financial checks also showed nothing abnormal about their gross monthly income and spending pattern. It said the captain held several bank accounts and two national trust funds. He had two houses and three vehicles, but there was no record of him having a life insurance policy. Co-pilot: First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid . The co-pilot, First Officer Fariq Abdul Hamid, had two saving accounts and a national trust fund account. He owned two cars and ‘spent money on the upkeep’ of these vehicles. ‘He does not have much savings in his bank account. He has a life insurance policy,’ it said. Dozens of uniformed security sealed the street around the diplomatic mission, while relatives said they had opted to avoid the airport as police were out in force. About 30 visited the Lama Temple, with around 10 entering the site in groups of two or three to pay their personal respects, as if attempting to keep a low profile. The remainder waited outside the temple in a group, wearing T-shirts saying ‘Pray for MH370’, and waving placards to photographers reading ‘Keep searching for MH370’. Meanwhile, Voice 370 - a support group for the relatives - hosted a ‘Day of Remembrance’ at a shopping centre in Kuala Lumpur with songs, poems and prayers. Grace Subathirai Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the plane, said: ‘It is important to highlight to the public that we still don't have any answers and that we must pursue the search.’ The Malaysian prime minister said he still is hopeful the plane will be found. Najib Razak said: ‘The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear. ‘Together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. Malaysia remains committed to the search, and hopeful that MH370 will be found.’ While the country's government has already formally declared the disappearance of the plane as an accident, and said all those on board are presumed dead, relatives of those on the flight have said they are frustrated by the lack of answers. Ministers from Australia, China and Malaysia are expected to meet next month to decide on the next course of action for the wide-ranging search. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said his government would provide ‘all needed service to every next of kin’ and help uphold their ‘legitimate and lawful rights and interests’. Most of the plane's passengers were Chinese. ‘A year has passed, the plane has not been located, but the search effort will continue,’ Mr Wang told a news conference in Beijing. ‘Today must be a difficult day for the next of kin. Our hearts are with you.’ As his country said prayers on Sunday for those who were on board the missing flight, Malaysia's Prime Minister said no words could describe their pain. 'The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear,' said Mr Najib Razak. 'No words can describe the pain the families of those on board are going through.' Search and rescue missions were conducted for the flight off the coast of Perth . The Department of Defence launched an underwater vehicle to locate the plane off the Australian coast . China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said in Beijing that the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight which vanished one year ago today will not stop. 'The search for MH370 will continue,' said Mr Wang, echoing the previously-spoken commitment of the countries involved in the hunt for the aircraft - Australia, Malaysia and China - in the southern Indian Ocean. In Kuala Lumpur, Mr Najib spoke of the joint effort, adding in his official statement that 'together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists. 'Malaysia remains committed to the search and hopeful that MH370 will be found.' Although Mr Abbott said he was confident the aircraft would be found as 40 per cent of 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australian had been scrutinised and another 60,000sq km to be covered if necessary, he added that the search had to end at some stage. 'It is one of the great mysteries of the 21st century and I know that there will be a nagging doubt in the minds of billions of people until such time as we can find that plane,' he told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. 'It can't go on forever but, as long as there are reasonable leads, the search will go on.' It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .","The package washed up on a Cervantes beach in Western Australia .

"A petition demanding an outright ban on slaughtering animals without stunning them first has attracted more than 100,000 backers - but the Government insisted it still had 'no intention' of outlawing religious slaughter. Vets chief John Blackwell vowed to continue the fight, warning ministers they 'simply cannot ignore the strength of public feeling' over animal welfare and a failure to let consumers know how their meat was killed. Campaigners will now press for a fresh Commons debate on the issue after quickly exceeding the six-figure threshold required on the parliamentary petition site to trigger a possible time slot. A petition demanding an outright ban on slaughtering animals without stunning them first has attracted more than 100,000 backers - but was still rejected by Parliament . The controversy surrounds legal exemptions for religious purposes such as Muslim halal and Jewish shechita - which Prime Minister David Cameron vowed to uphold in a speech last year to the Israeli parliament. Opponents say they respect the various faith traditions but insist animal welfare must take priority - with scientific evidence clear that those that are killed without stunning feel pain. The petition - which backs calls by the RSPCA, the British Veterinary Association (BVA), the Farm Animal Welfare Committee, the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe and the Humane Slaughter Association - points out that more than 80% of halal meat in the UK is pre-stunned. 'We must differentiate between religious and non-stun slaughter. Our concern does not relate to religious belief but to the animal welfare compromise,' it states. 'Non-stun slaughter affects millions of animals. We support a good life and a humane death for all animals.' There are also concerns about large quantities of meat being sold without any indication of how the animal was slaughtered and the petition says that until a ban is imposed, consumers must be told what they are buying. In a speech last year, Prime Minister David Cameron vowed to uphold legal exemptions to animal slaughter rules for religious purposes such as Muslim halal and Jewish shechita . BVA president Mr Blackwell said: 'This is a truly fantastic result for animal welfare. 'BVA has long argued that all animals should be stunned before slaughter to render them insensible to pain and we are delighted that the British public has got so firmly behind our campaign. 'Consumers value the high welfare of British produce and care deeply about the provenance of their food. 'But under the current legislation meat from non-stun slaughter can end up in the food chain unlabelled as such, which is completely unacceptable. 'Scientific evidence tells us that non-stun slaughter allows the animal to perceive pain and compromises animal welfare. This is an issue that affects the welfare of millions of individual animals every year. 'The Government simply cannot ignore the strength of public feeling and we look forward to petitioning the Backbench Business Committee for a full debate in the new parliament.' The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) remained unswayed by the petition hitting the 100,000 milestone - achieved by only 35 demands on the e-petition site since 2011, around 0.1% of those accepted. A spokeswoman said: 'There are strict rules that govern the slaughter of animals in England which include additional conditions for religious slaughter and these remain unchanged. 'The Government has no intention of banning religious slaughter. 'The Government would prefer animals to be stunned before slaughter, but we respect the rights of Jewish and Muslim communities to eat meat in accordance with their beliefs. 'Existing rules require that where stunning is used it must be sufficient to make the animal unconscious and insensible to pain without causing unnecessary pain, suffering or distress.'","Vets chief John Blackwell vowed to continue the fight following rejection .

"An eight-year-old girl has taken on Clarks over its 'sexist' shoes range saying she would rather wear dinosaur trainers than a pair covered in flowers and butterflies. Sophia Trow took to social media to vent her frustration after being told the Stomp Claw range of dinosaur trainers was for boys only. She tweeted the multi-national company saying: 'Dear Clarks, I don't like how girls have flowery shoes - I like dinosaurs and fossils, so I think that other girls might as well.' The eight-year-old from Middlesbrough said she was upset when she was told the specific range, which leaves behind 'awesome' reptilian footprints, was not suitable for female bone structure. Sophia Trow, eight, has taken on Clarks over its 'sexist' shoes range saying she would rather wear dinosaur trainers than a pair covered in flowers and butterflies . The eight-year-old schoolgirl said she would rather wear dinosaur trainers than a pair covered in flowers and butterflies (pictured shoe from Clarks range) 'I really want dinosaur shoes because they leave footprints in the sand and mud,' she said. 'Clarks should learn what girls really want and do something about it.' She said she felt like killing anyone who told her she couldn't have or do things 'just because I'm a girl'. 'I don't like how girls just have to like pink and purple - I like blue and science and fossils,' she said. Sophia's sentiments are backed by her six-year-old sister Helena and their mother, 34-year-old Jane Trow. Ms Trow tweeted Clarks on her daughter's behalf, saying: 'My daughter has written you a letter about your sexist shoes. Not all girls want to be pretty princesses.' She said young children should be given more choice rather than being prescribed gender-specific toys and clothes. 'Dinosaur shoes are fun, exciting and something to stomp around and make noise in which is apparently just a boy thing,' she said. She tweeted the multi-national company and sent a letter asking: 'Why can't girls have dinosaur shoes?' The eight-year-old  was upset when she was told the specific range, which leaves behind 'awesome' reptilian footprints, was not suitable for female bone structure during a shopping trip . 'Girls' shoes are dainty and flowery while boys' are sturdy and fun - where's the choice?' She added: 'I want my children to have options - if they want to go down the pretty girl, traditional route and grow up to have a family then I'll be proud. 'If they'd prefer a career, no children or to play with toys that aren't supposed to be for girls then I'm equally as proud. 'I don't want them hampered by expectations that tell them how they should behave as girls - I want them to be able to do whatever they want to do and become strong women.' A spokeswoman for Clarks said the company offered a wide range of children's shoes to meet 'varied tastes and needs'. She added: 'We are sorry to hear that our product range didn't suit Sophia's personal tastes.'","Sophia Trow, eight, has taken on Clarks over its 'sexist' shoes range .

"A new injectable drug designed to eliminate double chins without surgery was unanimously recommended for approval by a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee this week. The drug, currently known as ATX-101, now only needs to receive final FDA approval before it becomes available to the public. Unlike current double chin surgeries, which require doctors to 'cut it out or suck it out,' ATX-101 will be a 'noninvasive, in-the-office procedure,' according to Dr. Susan Weinkle. Scroll down for video . A dermatologist prepares the injection site for ATX-101, a new injectable drug  designed to eliminate double chins without surgery that was unanimously recommended for approval by an FDA advisory committee . ATX-101 works by eliminating the membrane of fat cells underneath the double chin. This causes the fat cell to burst, destroying it permanently. Side-effects include short-term swelling, bruising and numbness . Weinkle, a dermatologist who has been working with ATX-101 since 2007, said many people have fat underneath the chin, even if 'they're not fat in the rest of their body', she told ABC News. To insert the drug, Weinkle marks the area where she sees the 'max amount of fat' with a grid of tiny dots, which act as the injection sites for the ATX-101. Weinkle says the procedure only takes about five minutes and patients heal in two to three days - and don't even need to wear a bandage. The drug is a  formulation of deoxycholic acid, a 'naturally occurring molecule' that helps our bodies break down the fat we receive from food, according to manufacturer KYTHERA Biopharmaceuticals. Dr. Derek Jones, who presented ATX-101 to the FDA, said the drug destroys the membrane of the fat cells underneath the double chin. The ATX-101 treatment only takes five minutes to administer and two to three days to heal . This causes the fat cell to burst. Its remains are naturally absorbed back into the body, while the cell is destroyed permanently. As with any drug, there are side effects. They include short-lasting swelling, bruising and numbness that was found to be 'mild to moderate', according to dermatologist Adam M. Rotunda. Fleeting pain at the site of the injections was also reported. Rotunda noted in the trials that the intensity of the side effects decreased with each additional treatment session, he told Dermatology Times. Although the drug reaches its maximum desired effect if the patient undergoes six treatments spaced a month apart, Rotunda said he does not believe 'most patients' will require that many. Rotunda said ATX-101 could be a game-changer in terms of what dermatologists can do when patients are worried about their neck. 'We've been accustomed to addressing patient aesthetic concerns primarily from the chin up,' he told Dermatology Times. 'However, the neck...is critical in framing the lower half of the face and creating our profile. Changes in the neck as we age or gain weight can have profound effect on our self-esteem.' The drug is a formulation of deoxycholic acid, a 'naturally occurring molecule' that helps our bodies break down the fat we receive from food, according to manufacturer KYTHERA Biopharmaceuticals . Dr. Michael Edwards, president of the Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, said not everyone is a good candidate for the drug. He told NBC News he worries that, after ATX-101 is approved, people will use the drug to try and fix larger areas of fat. But according to Weinkle, the drug is 'not a weight loss treatment' and needs to be administered properly so that patients get a 'very even reduction of fat.' She warns that physicians must 'understand the anatomy' of the area underneath the chin, which houses delicate nerves that should not be touched. Edward recommends patients only receive the procedure from trained 'board certified experts'. ATX-101 has been tested in 19 clinical studies with 2,600 patients. It will not be covered by insurance and the approximate cost is not yet known.","ATX-101 is a noninvasive, in-office procedure that takes five minutes .

"She was crowned Mrs Australia when she was 37 weeks pregnant and now Piper O'Neill is gearing up for Mrs International - just eight weeks after giving birth to her second child. The former model turned full-time mother has completely embraced her post-baby body but shares how she struggled to accept her changing figure when she first became a mother. The 31-year-old told Daily Mail Australia getting back into shape for the pageant has been more challenging compared to previous years, particularly because she has to juggle her time with her two young kids. But Mrs Australia says she wouldn't have it any other way as her family always comes first and further hopes she can encourage other mothers to love their post-baby bodies too. Piper O'Neill was crowned Mrs Australia when she was 37 weeks pregnant and is now gearing up for Mrs International - just eight weeks after giving birth to her second child . The former model turned full-time mother has completely embraced her post-baby body but recalls struggling to accept her changing figure. She is pictured (left) before becoming a mother and then three weeks after giving birth to her son Taylor (right) Family comes first for the mother-of-two, aged 31, with daughter Elsie, who is now 19-months-old . It was only eight weeks ago that Mrs O'Neill, who has been in the modelling industry since the age of three, gave birth to her baby boy Taylor. She and her husband Jordan Green also have a 19-month-old daughter Elsie. But Mrs O'Neill is determined more than ever to represent Australia and will be flying to Florida in the US to compete against more than 60 other women around the world. 'It's an honour to be representing the country and I'm really looking forward to it all,' she said. Mrs O'Neill, who was recently crowned Mrs Australia 2015 and is also an ambassador for charity program Look Good Feel Better, says she became involved in the competition as it wasn't solely based on looks. 'This pageant is really refreshing for me because it's open to all married women from all backgrounds, shapes and sizes,' she said. 'About 50 per cent of it is about raising awareness about your charity while the rest is about your evening gown and your health and fitness.' Mrs Australia Piper O'Neill gave birth to her second child, a son called Taylor Ethan Green in January . Since giving birth to her second child, Mrs O'Neill's attitude has changed. 'It took me some time to finally accept my body during my pregnancy and afterwards too,' she said. 'I've been a model most of my life so not being in control of my body was really hard for me. My belly was growing and it felt like I was gaining five kilos just by looking at a piece of lettuce. 'Looking at myself in the mirror after my first child, with a fuller figure, was really difficult. 'But when I was pregnant with Taylor, I went in with brighter eyes and knew what to expect from my body. Mrs O'Neill back in her modelling days (left) and then with her second child (right) 'I especially knew I had to have better and more positive views about my changing body in order to become a good role model for my daughter.' And it is with that attitude she has decided to go into the Mrs International competition. In between tending to her two children, Mrs O'Neill takes advantage of whatever free time she gets. 'I try to go the gym every night when my husband is home to look after the kids and do about 30 minutes of cardio,' she said. 'Of course, I actually don't end up doing this every day because as a mother something last minute always comes up. 'But I'm going to sign up to do a heavy training session with my personal trainer so I'll be committed to do that once a week. 'During nap-time for the kids, I try and squeeze in any other training.' Piper and husband Jordan Green with their first-born, daughter Elsie last year . Mrs O'Neill is also very conscious of her diet, particularly because she is currently breastfeeding. 'I have to make sure I eat healthy for my baby so I can't just eat salads all the time for the sake of the competition,' she said. 'Plus this pageant doesn't have a swimwear section and instead focuses on health and fitness which is also why I wanted to get involved.' Mrs O'Neill says her main goal isn't about getting her pre-baby body back. 'There's too much pressure on mums these days to go back to the way they were and I don't think that's a realistic goal,' she said. 'I've had two children and there is no hiding that. My focus now is being fit and healthy rather than skinny. 'So I'd really like to reach out to other mothers, encouraging them to go easy on themselves because it's an amazing thing that we can have children and bring them into this world.' Mrs O'Neill says she's feeling pretty confident about the competition. 'It feels good to be part of something I'm familiar with again and hopefully I can bring home another crown for my daughter,' she said.","Piper O'Neill was crowned Mrs Australia when she was 37 weeks pregnant .

"Accessible only by a six-day boat journey from South Africa or as part of epic month-long cruises through the South Atlantic Ocean, Tristan da Cunha is about as far from a quick holiday destination as it gets. The world's most remote inhabited archipelago stands 1,243 miles from Saint Helena, its closest neighbour with residents, 1,491 miles from South Africa and 2,088 miles from South America. It's just seven miles long and 37.8 square miles in area, and has but one settlement officially known as Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, referred to by locals - less than 300 of them - as The Settlement, located at the foot of the 6,765-foot Queen Mary's Peak. But despite its unimposing size and formidable remoteness, Tristan da Cunha has a rich history and a plethora of native wildlife that is truly unique. Scroll down for video . Tristan da Cunha's only settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, is built on the flat below the 6,765-foot volcano Queen Mary's Peak . The vast distances that must be travelled to get to Tristan da Cunha, which  lays claim to being the most remote inhabited island in the world . It is 1,243 miles from Saint Helena, its closest neighbour with residents, 1,491 miles from South Africa and 2,088 miles from South America . Tristan da Dunha's main island, which also gives its name to the archipelago is just seven miles long and 37.8 square miles in area . Edinburgh was named after the visit of the first Duke of Edinburgh in the 1800s, but is referred to as The Settlement by its less than 300 locals . A sign shows the remarkable lengths one must go to get to Tristan, including 5,337 miles to London . Oceanwide Expeditions have four cruises that take in three-day stops at Tristan da Cunha, the name given to both the main island and the surrounding archipelago, including the uninhabited Nightingale Islands, and Inaccessible Island and the Gough Islands, which are nature reserves. Cruises, such as those which leave from Ushuaia in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego, are the most convenient way to see the island. One of 12 spaces can be filled on the fishing vessel MV Edinburgh and the cargo ship MV Baltic Trader. However, non-local tourists are at the bottom of an eight-tier priority pecking order that may include those responding to medical emergencies, official visitors and locals. The other cruise sails annually to Gough Island, run since 2012 by the South African Antarctic Research and Supply Vessel Agulhas II, and carries more than 40 passengers to and from Tristan. The local rockhopper penguins are hugely popular with visitors and live on all four of Tristan's islands . Oceanwide Expeditions' Atlantic Odyssey tours, the shortest and cheapest being the 27-night tour from £3,929 (Euro 5,450), calls in on The Settlement, and aims to land on Nightingale and Inaccessible, which millions of seabirds call home. The landings aren't guaranteed though, with 30 per cent of attempts via zodiac boat since 1998 having been unsuccessful due to bad weather. Thankfully, tours often factor in a spare day. On Nightingale Island, the wandering, yellow-nosed and sooty albatrosses all breed, and the Rockhopper penguins that live on all four of the Tristan Islands are also hugely popular with those who manage to make it there. Even with such attractions, tourism is a minor industry for Tristan, with the majority of earnings coming from their commercial crawfish or Tristan rock lobster (Jasus) operations and the sale of their unique postage stamps and coins to collectors. Cruise operator Oceanwide Expeditions have four cruises that take in three-day stops at the Tristan da Cunha archipelago . A yellow-nosed albatross is one of several large seabird species that uses Tristan's Inaccessible Island as a breeding ground . Two juvenile yellow-nosed albatross frolic on the island that is rich in wildlife but an effort to reach . However, a range of accommodation is available in the form of home stays with locals - descendants of one of seven families originating from Scotland, England, The Netherlands, the United States and Italy - who also serve as guides and sell craft and souvenirs. All residents are farmers too, and the entire area is communally owned. Historically, the island has proven an important stop for sailing ships needing a stopover in the Atlantic, and was annexed by the UK in 1816 to ensure the French couldn't use it as a base to attempt a rescue of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was imprisoned at Saint Helena. Some typical housing in Edinburgh, where all 297 locals of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago live . Hiking paths and rough roads are plentiful around the small and remote volcanic island . The Settlement was named in honour of the 1867 visit of Queen Victoria's son Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, when the islands served as a Royal Navy outpost called HMS Atlantic Isle, also said to have been used to monitor shipping movements in the ocean and the radio communications of Nazi U-boats. Prince Phillip, the second Duke of Edinburgh, also visited there on board the royal yacht Britannia in 1957. Just four years later, the entire population was forced to evacuate to England via Cape Town when Queen Mary's Peak erupted. Fortunately, the damage to The Settlement was found to be minimal and most residents returned in 1963. All of the local families are farmers of some kind, with cattle among the livestock, though fishing is also a massive part of their economy . Local social haunts include the cafe and the Albatross Bar, which by virtue of being on Tristan is one of the world’s most isolated pubs . Stamp collectors pay significant amounts for the rare Tristan da Cunha stamps, another major source of revenue for the town . Local residents all have a plot on the Patches Plain where they primarily grow potatoes, a staple of the Tristan diet . Supplies have to be brought into Tristan's small harbour, while tourists from cruise ships must be brought to shore by zodiac . The local penguin population was threatened in March 2011 when the MS Oliva freighter ran aground and created a potentially devastating oil slick around Nightingale Island, which has no fresh water. Rockhoppers had to be taken to Tristan to be cleaned. The islands then got even more worldwide attention later the same year when Volvo Ocean Race competitor Puma's Mar Mostro broke a mast during its journey from Alicante to Cape Town and was forced to stop there. The town turned it on for the 11 person crew, who visited the local St Mary's School, took a tour of the fish processing factory and picked up emergency supplies at the local shop.","From Tristan da Cunha it's 1,243 miles to Saint Helena, 1,491 miles to South Africa and 2,088 miles to South America .

"Dawn Love was found guilty of possessing extreme pornography after shocked staff at O2 found the clips of people having sex with horses on her faulty Blackberry and reported her to police . A  housewife who  regularly went dogging has been caught with clips of women having sex with animals after taking her phone to get repaired, a court heard. Dawn Love was found guilty of possessing extreme pornography after shocked staff at an O2 store found images of people having sex with horses on her faulty Blackberry and reported her to police. During a search of her home and a camper van, officers also found a DVD showing women having sex with dogs. A jury took just half an hour to find the 55-year-old, was born a man, guilty but cleared her of the second count relating to the DVD. Love, who told the court she has regularly been going dogging for 30 years, stared straight ahead and showed no emotion as the verdicts were delivered. During the one-day trial, the court heard she would regularly swap pornographic DVDs with various people including lorry drivers in car parks while dogging, however, she claimed she rarely watched them and often did not know what was on them. She told the jury at Guildford Crown Court: 'I went dogging all over the place. I had casual sex in public places.' Prosecuting, Kate Mallison said: 'The counts relate to a time on July 26 2013, when the defendent had possesion of items which are illegal. 'She took her Blackberry mobile phone into an O2 store in Camberley to get it fixed. Something was seen on the phone which caused concern to staff and led to the phone being looked at with greater care.' Love, who was dressed in a tee-shirt, trousers and a zip-up jumper, listened to proceedings at Guildford Crown Court through a hearing loop. Ms Mallison told the jury of six men and six women: 'What was found on the phone were two videos of images of someone having sexual intercourse or oral sex with an animal, namely a horse, which is banned by law. 'As a result of her arrest, her property and car were searched and in her car a DVD was found containing a number of images showing someone having sexual intercourse or oral sex with a dog. 'The issue is whether in fact Dawn Love was in possession of these articles,' said the prosecutor. The jury at Guildford Crown Court heard that Love worked in a West End club for gay and transsexual people, which often hosted television stars and police officers, two days a week and would often leave her phone on the reception counter or behind the bar. Love said she had been dogging since she was around 25 and never usually saw the same person twice. She told the court she kept her phone in a holder on the dashboard of her Nissan camper van, where she invited people in for sex. The jury at Guildford Crown Court (pictured) heard that Love worked in a West End club would often leave her phone on the reception counter or behind the bar . Love, who denied two counts of possessing extreme pornographic images, said she had not had her phone stolen or tampered with as far as she was aware. When asked if she would leave the phone unattended, she replied: 'All the time, when I was strapped up in the back, on the bed.' The disabled post-op transexual, who went dogging around three to four times a week at the time the images were found in 2013, said she swapped DVDs with people 'all the time'. She said: 'I would swap them with doggers and lorry drivers in car parks. They were straight sex DVDs mostly.' When asked about whether she would always watch the DVDs, she replied: 'No. One could stay in the machine for months' The court heard Love took her phone into the 02 store in Camberley, Surrey on July 26, 2013 after her emails stopped working. Horrified staff found two video clips called 'Sally Horse' and 'Hannah' showing video clips of women having sex with horses.Both clips featured a logo reading 'zoosection.com'. Love, who denied two counts of possessing extreme pornographic images, said she had not had her phone stolen or tampered with as far as she was aware . Prosecuting, Kate Mallison said: 'You say you helped at the club on Thursdays and Sundays. I ask that because these clips you had on your phone were accessed on a Tuesday.

When asked why she had not tried to find out who had given her the DVDs, she replied: 'I do not know the people who get into my van and tie me up and have sex with me. I wouldn't know where to start. 'Nine times out of ten I am off my head on drugs.' Miss Mallison said: 'Is it just coincidence that the two pictures are of the same nature as the DVD?' Jobless Love replied: 'I have all sorts of DVDs, several of black men who are well endowed. I never ask people's names, I just get tied up, have a good time and never see them again.' Judge Christopher Critchlow told the jury of six men and six women: 'The only issue for you to decide is whether or not you are sure the defendant had the images on her phone and the DVD in her possession.' Love, from Sunbury, Surrey, was found guilty of possessing extreme pornographic images on her phone but the jury did not find her guilty of possessing the footage on the DVD.

"Facebook faced a backlash last year for forcing users to download a separate Messenger app for mobile, and it looks like the web version is heading in the same direction. The social network has launched Messenger.com - a standalone site that lets users chat to Facebook friends privately on a browser in the same way they can on the Messenger app. For the time being users can still send, receive and view messages on Facebook, and the site has not announced any current plans to remove this feature yet. Facebook has launched Messenger.com (pictured) - a standalone site that lets people chat to their Facebook contacts, start group conversations and send photos in the same way they can on the app. Users can still send and receive messages on Facebook and it is not known yet whether this will be removed in due course. Facebook didn't reveal its future plans for the service, but told MailOnline: 'We're launching Messenger for web browsers - a standalone web chat product accessible via Messenger.com. 'Once logged in, people can dive directly into a dedicated desktop messaging experience, keeping their conversations going and picking up where they left off.' To use Messenger.com, users log in with Facebook credentials and the site will automatically import their contacts and current chats. These conversations are shown full screen, as opposed to the pop-up on Facebook or the half screen view on the main Facebook Messages page. None of the other Facebook buttons, including links to the News Feed, are visible, but settings can be managed by clicking the gear icon in the top left-hand corner. This menu lets users manage sounds, see desktop notifications and block users. WhatsApp first hinted it would let users make free calls to each other early last year. Now Android users can make voice calls and the feature will come to iOS soon. The latest version of the popular messaging app also has a cleaner layout with three tabs for contacts, chats and calls. Users simply have to click on the ‘Calls’ tab and choose a contact to phone a friend at no cost. However this only works between WhatsApp users and it relies on an internet connection. Jack Kent, principal mobile analyst at IHS Technology told MailOnline that by splitting Facebook services, it reduces the  different ways in which the site has to handle messages in its standard app and site. ‘With a portfolio of apps, there’s more room to manoeuvre; you don’t have to use Facebook anymore,' he added. The standalone site is the latest addition to the much-maligned service. At its F8 conference in San Francisco last month, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg announced it was turning Messenger into a platform for 'e-commerce, video and more'. During the event Facebook executives introduced more than 25 tools tailored to help developers 'build, grow, and monetise' mobile applications. Messenger was also upgraded to let users share photos, audio and videos, and make calls more easily. 'They are trying to make Messenger a full-featured and rich media platform,' Gartner analyst Brian Blau said at the conference. 'I think that they are interested in letting people know that Facebook is not a single app company, it is an app constellation.' Users log in with their Facebook credentials and the site  automatically imports their contacts and current chats. These conversations are shown full screen.

Messenger.com is the latest addition to the much-maligned service. At its F8 conference in San Francisco last month, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) announced it was turning Messenger application into a platform for 'e-commerce, video and more' in a bid to shake up online communication . 'Voice calling has been ramping up, and by separating [Messenger], Facebook can make this feature available. It would be too cumbersome to add to the standard site,' continued Mr Kent. 'This also makes voicecalling easier to deploy in other countries.' Facebook-owned WhatsApp started rolling out its own internet calls to Android users this week, and the feature is coming to iOS 'soon.' One of the Messenger upgrades was designed to connect customers with companies, called Messenger Business. 'We're making Messenger a place where you can easily communicate with the businesses you care about in addition to the people you care about,' Mr Zuckerberg said. During the event, Facebook executives introduced more than 25 products and tools to help developers 'build, grow, and monetise' applications. Messenger was also upgraded to let users share photos, audio and videos and make calls (left). And Messenger can now be used for making payments to friends (right) And early last month Facebook announced Messenger can be used for making payments to friends, and that it was testing a 'buy' button to allow users to make purchases directly from Facebook pages. Elsewhere, the Messenger team is working with partners including ESPN and the Bad Robot film production company owned by Hollywood director J.J. Abrams to release applications that work on the Messenger platform. Additionally, Facebook introduced a tool designed to make it easy to take public video posted on the social network and embed it on other sites. Facebook launched Messenger back in 2011 but split the app from Facebook at the start of last year and forced people to download both apps if they wanted to use the two services. One of these Messenger upgrades was designed to connect customers with companies (example pictured), called Messenger Business. 'We're making Messenger a place where you can easily communicate with the businesses you care about in addition to the people you care about,' Mr Zuckerberg said . At the time, members said they were outraged by the changes and flocked to the respective app stores to complain. They were also concerned about the app’s permissions that gave Facebook access to send texts and make calls on the user’s device. Facebook was then forced to respond with a blog post explaining why it needed certain permissions. It said: ‘Almost all apps need certain permissions to run on Android, and we use these permissions to run features in the app. ‘Keep in mind that Android controls the way the permissions are named, and the way they’re named doesn’t necessarily reflect the way the Messenger app and other apps use them.’","Messenger.com is a standalone site that lets you chat to Facebook friends .

"A new ITV programme that appears to show members of the public being hypnotised has been branded a fraud by experts. Contestants in You’re Back In the Room compete for cash prizes after being put in a trance by a hypnotist who claims to have ‘hacked’ into their minds. Keith Barry is said to have implanted ideas into volunteers’ brains – convincing them, for example, that their pants will feel tight whenever they hear a bell, or that they should push their face into a cake every time they hear certain words. Scroll down for video . Back In the Room: Phillip Schofield hosting the new show  which some experts are calling a fraud . But clinical hypnotherapists who treat conditions like anxiety claim the TV brainwashing is a nonsense – and could be exploiting ‘vulnerable’ people. ‘It is not true to say anyone can have their brain hacked,’ said qualified therapist Mark Powlett. ‘You absolutely can’t make people do things they don’t want to do. ‘People who are under hypnosis are put in a very relaxed state which makes them open to positive suggestion. But the last thing a show like this wants is people who are relaxed – as they wouldn’t be able to perform as required.’ Mr Powlett said contestants on the show, hosted by Phillip Schofield, were not under Barry’s ‘control’, but playing along willingly. ‘The people on stage want to entertain, they what to be in front of people and they want to win money,’ he said. In a trance: Experts have questioned whether contestants on new show You're Back In The Room, pictured above, are really hypnotised . Liz McElligott, chief executive of the National Hypnotherapy Society said: ‘The programme sounds sensationalist to me. It’s completely wrong to say you can make people do something they don’t want to do. ‘It would worry me if vulnerable people are playing along because they want to be on television.’ ITV selected contestants via auditions, and one who failed to get a place tweeted: ‘My conclusion is that they are looking for people who purposely carry on for the camera because it will make great TV.’ Barry, who is certified by the National Guild of Hypnotists, said: ‘There is obviously a huge difference between using hypnosis as a therapy and as entertainment. ‘All contestants were genuinely hypnotised. On many occasions they were throwing away their prize money – something they would never ordinarily do, unless of course they were hypnotised.’ ITV, which will air the four-part series from next Saturday, said; ‘Duty of care to the contestants was always of paramount importance.’ Producers also abided by the 1952 Hypnotism Act and Ofcom rules on showing the full hypnotism routine that may cause ‘adverse reactions’.","New show where public are hypnotised branded a fraud by experts .

"Coroner Mary Hassell, who claims she has been left in fear of violence after being falsely accused of anti-Semitism . A senior coroner has accused Orthodox Jews of bullying and intimidating her in an extraordinary row over the handling of dead bodies. Mary Hassell claims she and her staff have been left in fear of violence after being bombarded by hundreds of complaints about how they deal with deaths in devoutly religious communities. In a letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, she says she has been falsely accused of anti-Semitism and warns the situation risks becoming ‘volatile’. She says that on one occasion the police had to be called when 60 Orthodox Jews refused to let undertakers take the body of a man whose body they wanted to pray over. Mrs Hassell believes other families in the North London area she covers are ‘suffering’ because she has to spend so much of her time dealing with the large number of Orthodox Jews, whose faith requires them to bury their dead quickly and prevents them undergoing autopsies. But the Orthodox Jews say they are being ‘traumatised’ by the coroner’s disregard for their beliefs, forcing them to take unprecedented legal action against her. Both sides will soon face each other in the High Court in a case that could lead to all families being given the right to demand a high-tech scan to determine cause of death rather than the traditional surgical post- mortem examination. In a letter to her bosses at Camden Council, Mrs Hassell writes: ‘I look forward to hearing how you intend to support those who work within the service for which you have statutory responsibility, and protect them from bullying, intimidation and the threat of violence.’ But Rabbi Asher Gratt told this newspaper: ‘The Jewish community is increasingly traumatised by Mrs Hassell’s conduct. It’s getting to the point where elderly people are scared to die in England – literally. A pair of Orthodox Jews wait for a bus in London. In their faith, they believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin . ‘I’m actually aware of at least one elderly couple who have happily lived in the UK since the Second World War but who have now emigrated permanently due to their fear of being subjected to unnecessary delays of their funerals when they pass away – or, worse still, a post-mortem autopsy.’ The row has arisen because Jews believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin. They also believe that traditional post-mortem examinations amount to desecration of the body. But when a doctor is unable to state a cause of death and sign the medical certificate needed before a body can be released for burial, a coroner must decide if a post-mortem examination is required. This process can take several days. Following years of campaigning by Muslims and Jews – who share many beliefs on burial customs – the Ministry of Justice has agreed that all coroners in London will operate an out-of-hours service from next month. Others in England and Wales already do so.","Coroner Mary Hassell claims she and her staff are in fear of violence .

"Government employees in Florida have been banned from using the terms 'climate change' or 'global warming', an investigation has revealed. Former staff members from the state's Department for Environmental Protection (DEP) confirmed they were not allowed to use the phrases in reports, emails or official communications because it is 'not a true fact'. The bizarre practice is said to have been enforced since Governor Rick Scott took office in 2011 - a politician who insists climate change is not caused by humans. The practice enforced in the Department for Environmental Protection is said to have been enforced since Governor Rick Scott took office in 2011 - a politician who insists climate change is not caused by humans . The unofficial guidelines have been criticized as a number of scientists have warned The Sunshine State is more vulnerable than anywhere in the United States to rising sea levels. A report published in 2012 suggested southern parts of Florida could be under water within 100 years. Despite  concerns, four former DEP employees across the state say the order not to use the phrases was well known and distributed verbally statewide. Kirstina Trotta, a former DEP employee based in Miami, told the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting (FCIR) they could not use the terms because they were not 'allowed to discuss anything that was not a true fact'. Christopher Byrd, an attorney with the DEP’s Office of General Counsel in Tallahassee from 2008 to 2013, added: 'We were told not to use the terms ""climate change,"" ""global warming"" or ""sustainability,"" 'That message was communicated to me and my colleagues by our superiors in the Office of General Counsel. The unofficial guidelines have been criticized as a number of scientists have warned The Sunshine State is more vulnerable than anywhere in the United States to rising sea levels (pictured flooding in Miami Beach' 'It’s an indication that the political leadership in the state of Florida is not willing to address these issues and face the music when it comes to the challenges that climate change presents.' Another staff member, who wanted to remain anonymous, said they were warned use of the words would bring unwanted attention to their projects. They told the FCIR: 'We were dealing with the effects and economic impact of climate change, and yet we can’t reference it.' Spokesman for the DEP, Tiffany Cowie, told the FCIR: 'DEP does not have a policy on this'.

"The Saudi Arabian blogger sentenced to 1,000 lashes could now face the death penalty, his wife has revealed. Raif Badawi hit headlines earlier this year when he was handed the sentence for supposedly insulting Islam. The draconian punishment meant that he would be flogged 50 times every Friday for 20 weeks. Scroll down for video . Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for 'insulting Islam', could now face the death penalty . Leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone showed the first flogging session, as a shackled and standing Mr Badawi was hit on his legs and back by a policeman . But after the first beating in Jeddah on January 9 this year, the process was paused when doctors ruled that a week later his scars had not healed sufficiently for him to face another round. The punishment has since been postponed each week on medical grounds but the government has so far failed to come up with a long term solution. Yesterday Ensaf Haidar, wife of the father-of-three, said her country’s criminal courts want him to undergo a retrial for apostasy. She said the ‘dangerous information’ had come from ‘official sources’ inside the conservative kingdom. If found guilty he could face the death penalty. It comes nearly two years after a judge threw out the charge of apostasy against the 31-year-old blogger in 2013 after he assured the court that he was a Muslim. Ensaf Haidar (pictured), Mr Badawi's wife, said the Saudi Arabian courts wanted to re-try him for apostasy - which is punishable by the death penalty . Philip Luther, Director of Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa Programme said: ‘We are looking into reports that Raif might be facing the death penalty again and can’t verify that at this stage. Raif and his family must be thinking ""what new hell is this?"" ‘The torment of facing each week the possibility of another brutal public flogging is an unimaginable torture. These latest rumours that the death penalty is a possibility again add to the nightmare. ‘Over a million people have called for Raif’s freedom. That should be the only development we’re hearing about.’ Last night Mr Badawi’s family explained that the penal court where he faces a retrial now has juristiction over major cases punishable by the death penalty. In a statement the family said: ‘Due to a new regulation issued by the Supreme Judicial Council on 19.09.2014, the penal court has now jurisdiction over major cases, which are punishable by the death penalty, amputation and stoning. Distressing: The father-of-three was earlier this month seen being flogged in public by a police officer . ‘We have reasons to believe without any doubts that the same judge has again asked the Head of the Court of Appeal to charge Raif with ‘Apostasy’. ‘We call on the world citizens and governments not to leave Raif dragged by such bigots to death. And we renew our calls to his Majesty King Salman to pardon Raif Badawi and allow him to leave for Canada to be united with his family there.’ Secret footage from a mobile phone showed a shackled Mr Badawi being flogged by a policeman outside a mosque in January. The distresssing pictures were seen all over the world and provoked universal outcry. Mr Badawi’s wife fled to Canada with their children but has continued to campaign for his freedom. She says he started a forum that was simply meant to encourage discussion of the Muslim faith. After seeing the video, she said: ‘Every lash killed me.’","Saudi  Raif Badawi was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for 'insulting Islam'

"Information obtained using torture was used to help foil  an al-Qaeda plot to bring down two planes, it has been claimed. British authorities intercepted a bomb at East Midlands Airport after being 'tipped off' by Saudi Arabian security forces, reportedly following the interrogation by torture of an al-Qaeda operative. The claim comes as former MI5 head Sir John Sawers said torture does produce 'useful information' and can be 'effective in the short term.' Intelligence obtained via torture was reportedly used in a 'Jack Bauer real-time operation' to foil an al-Qaeda plot to bring down two planes and intercept a bomb at East Midlands Airport (pictured) A major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from Yemen to the US in October 2010. Pictured is the package found at East Midlands Airport . A major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from Yemen to the US in October 2010. It is believed the bombs were designed to go off mid-air and bring the huge planes down over the US. After what was described as a 'tip-off' from Saudi Arabian security forces, the planes were stopped at East Midlands Airport in Leicestershire and the United Arab Emirates and the bombs uncovered. A group called Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) later took responsibility for the plot. Now it has been claimed the discovery at East Midlands Airport was only possible because British officials in Saudi Arabia were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of terror group al-Qaeda. 'The people in London went back on the phone two or three times to where the interrogation was taking place in Riyadh to find out specifically where the bomb was hidden. There were two Britons there, in immediate communication with where the interrogation was taking place, and as soon as it happened, they were in touch with the UK. It was all done in real time,' an intelligence source told Jamie Merrill, James Hanning, Mark Leftly and Nick Clark at The Independent On Sunday. A major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from Yemen to the US in October 2010. Pictured is a packaged being launched onto a police helicopter at East Midlands Airport . It is claimed the discovery at East Midlands Airport was only possible because British officials in Saudi Arabia were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of al-Qaeda . A source close to the operation said there was 'no way' that the information which led to the plot being exposed 'wasn’t procured under duress', but that the British officials would have ensured they were not present. He added: 'Of course we use intelligence from torture. We take it from wherever we can get it, but we are never, ever going to say ""we don’t want that"". Or ask too many questions about where it has come from. It is the difference between intelligence and evidence.' Last month, following the death of King Abdullah, Prime Minister David Cameron defended Britain's ties with Saudi Arabia - despite the country’s record on human rights. He also said that a piece of counter-terrorism intelligence supplied by the Arab state had 'saved potentially hundreds of lives' in the UK, which aides have confirmed was a reference to the bomb plot. He added: 'Now, you can be Prime Minister and say exactly what you think about every regime in the world and make great headlines, and give great speeches. Former MI5 head Sir John Sawers said yesterday that torture does produce 'useful information' and can be 'effective in the short term' 'But I think my first job is to try and keep this country safe from terrorism and if that means you have to build strong relationships sometimes with regimes you don't always agree with, that I think is part of the job and that is the way I do it. And that is the best way I can explain it.' Former spy chief Sir John, who was head of MI6 from 2009 to 2014, yesterday hit back at claims that security services played a role in the radicalisation of British jihadist Mohammed Emwazi. Asim Qureshi, research director of Cage, claims Emwazi, who was nicknamed Jihadi John, was interrogated by MI5 and subjected to security agency harassment before becoming a militant. But Sir John  said arguments that harassment drove Emwazi to join IS were 'very specious'. 'The idea that somehow being spoken to by a member of MI5 is a radicalising act, I think this is very false and very transparent,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Sir John also told presenter Mishal Husain: 'Torture had been used for “thousands of years in order to extract useful information. 'If you decide in 2015 that it doesn't work at all then that would be to misunderstand the problem.' He added: 'The whole problem about torture and maltreatment is sadly is that it does produce intelligence. And that’s why in a civilised society like ours we have to set aside certain methods, even though they might be effective in the short term. In the longer term they are very counterproductive; they are undermining the values of our society.'","British authorities intercepted bomb at East Midlands airport after 'tip off'

Peyton was saved when she was able to crawl out and get help from a passing bicyclist. In a video, obtained by WISN, the girls both say they told Peyton they wanted to go bird watching, this after planning their attack on the school bus. 'People who trust you become very gullible,' Morgan told police. 'And it was sort of sad.' Anissa is more emotional during her interview, wiping away tears at one point.

In the interrogation video, Morgan can also been seen with blood on her shirt, which she has photographed at one point. She also begins singing to herself at one point during the six-hour interview, and told police of her plan; 'You have no idea how difficult it was not to tell anyone. I knew we'd get in trouble.' When she described the actually stabbing, she said; 'It just sort of happened. It didn't feel like anything. It was like air.' Anissa said at one point Slender Man would kill their families if they did not kill Peyton . Morgan and Anissa said they stabbed their friend to appease the Slender Man . As for Slender Man, Morgan described him as a man with 'tendrils that are very sharp.' 'I see him in my dreams,' she told police, . Anissa said in her interview that she did not have the same visions as Morgan, but knew she had to kill her friend for the Slender Man. 'I decided to go along, tag along, to prove the skeptics wrong,' she said. Then, when asked if she saw the Slender Man, she told police; 'Uh huh, after Morgan stabbed [Peyton].' She also revealed that Morgan said to her; 'I kinda sorta made a deal with Slender saying that if I didn't, if we didn't kill Peyton that he would, would either or could kill our families and everything we love.'","Anissa Weier and her friend Morgan Geyser will stand trial as adults for stabbing a fellow classmate and are facing 65 years in prison .

"Former deputy leader of Rotherham Council Emma Hoddinott (pictured) admitted there are illegal, underage brides in the town's Roma community . Roma gipsy immigrants are illegally marrying underage girls as young as 12 before bringing them to the UK to live. Girls as young as 12 and 13 are regularly being married off in exchange for thousands of pounds in countries including Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary before being brought to Britain. The former deputy leader of Rotherham Council, where more than 1,400 schoolgirls were sexually exploited by Asian gangs, made the revelation at a meeting this week. It has prompted calls for an urgent investigation into how many child brides are living in Britain's estimated 250,000-strong Roma community. The arranged marriages of girls under 16 is common in Roma communities, where families follow the Gypsy code Pachiv which encourages girls to marry soon after reaching puberty. The code dictates that the head of the large family group is always obeyed and in some cases large sums of money can be involved when matchmakers seek out a suitable young girl for marriage. During a meeting of the full council in Rotherham this week, Independent councillor Martyn Parker repeatedly questioned former deputy leader Emma Hoddinott over the claims. Cllr Hoddinott finally admitted there are illegal brides in the town's large Eastern European immigrant community, adding it was 'unacceptable'. Cllr Parker said : 'On the Roma community you're not answering my questions. I've asked five times now and you're still avoiding it. 'I asked are there any people in the Roma community in Rotherham married to underage children - that's under 16-years-old. 'We need a bit of honesty for the people of Rotherham or we will go nowhere.' Cllr Hoddinott replied: 'It's a simple answer - yes, children are being married underage and that is unacceptable. 'We have to work with police to tackle that and we have to work with the commissioners to make sure there are actions in place to tackle these issues. Rotherham Council (pictured) heard there are underage illegal child brides in the town's Roma community . 'Underage marriage is an issue in Rotherham and we have to tackle that. Part of that is understanding how we tackle it. 'We need to get it right - we can't write off those girls because they are in that community.' But she said she was unable to say how many children in the town might be married to men already. But Cllr Parker said: 'You say you can't get the information, but a passport has marital status on it. If you're concerned about a child then you can get that information from the police - saying you can't answer is unacceptable. 'If they're here legally then they're here on a passport and the police can find out.' Speaking after the meeting he said: 'Officially in Rotherham there are 6,500 Roma gypsies but unofficially it is more like 7,500. Cllr Martyn Parker (pictured) said young Roma girls are being married off and brought to Rotherham . 'I believe there are young Roma girls who come over here already married. They couldn't possibly legally marry here. 'But when I have asked for information I have been told that it is not possible to find out but I believe council officials should be looking into this. 'We have already got the child sexual exploitation scandal in Rotherham and I don't want us in five or ten years time to have the same situation with this. 'Just because a child is allowed to marry at the age of 12 or 13 in another country doesn't mean we have to change our laws to accommodate that. We have one law which should be fairly implemented for everyone who lives here wherever they have come from. Two damning reports into child sex abuse in Rotherham revealed that more than 1,400 young girls were groomed, trafficked and abused by gangs of mostly Pakistani men over a 16-year period. Police and the town's Labour Council were accused of covering up the abuse. The Government has since appointed commissioners to take over running of the scandal-hit council. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'South Yorkshire Police is committed to tackling issues of underage and forced marriage. 'Part of our strategy for tackling issues of forced marriage is that we consider the benefits of working in partnership locally and nationally. 'Because forced marriage is often a hidden and under-reported crime, we recognise within South Yorkshire that there is a need to develop creative and flexible ways to break down any barriers and to encourage full and active engagement with local agencies, communities and groups. 'Information regarding forced marriage issues can be received from various sources and involve sensitive and complex issues. Therefore within South Yorkshire Police we have specially trained officers who deal with such matters, such as domestic violence officers, and child protection officers. 'We would encourage any victim of forced marriage to come forward and report it to police, in the confidence that they will be listened to, that they will be taken seriously and that a thorough investigation will take place.' Anyone with information about underage or forced marriage is asked to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Roma immigrants are marrying off underage girls for thousands of pounds .

"A police officer was charged Tuesday with criminal homicide after investigators concluded she shot an unarmed motorist in the back as he lay facedown after a traffic stop over an expired inspection sticker. Authorities accused Hummelstown police Officer Lisa J. Mearkle of shooting David Kassick, 59, twice February 2 without legal justification. She was jailed without bail. They said Mearkle had attempted to pull over Kassick for expired inspection and emissions stickers before he sped away. She caught up to Kassick near his sister's home, where he got out and ran. She had incapacitated him with a stun gun and he was on the ground when she shot him twice in the back, police said. Scroll down for video . An officer in handcuffs: Hummelstown police Officer Lisa J Mearkle was charged Tuesday with criminal homicide in the February 2 shooting death of David Kassick, 59. Mearkle pictured above (center) before her court hearing on Tuesday . Necessary? Prosecutors say Mearkle shot dead Kassick when he was lying facedown on the ground and didn't present any danger. She has contested that she saw him reach into his jacket - possibly for a weapon. However, he was unarmed. Pictured above leaving court on Tuesday in handcuffs . Mearkle was later released on $250,000 bond and will have to wear an ankle monitoring device . Victim: Last month, one of Kassick's (pictured) brothers said he had struggled with drug addition but was not the type to get into a fight - especially with a police officer. He was working as a construction worker at the time of his death last month . Before the shooting: Mearkle above pictured in her Hummelstown, Pennsylvania police uniform . Mearkle, 36, told investigators she shot because he would not show her his hands and she thought he was reaching into his jacket for a gun. The stun gun recorded portions of the encounter, and District Attorney Ed Marsico called it the strongest evidence in the case. He said it appeared Kassick had been trying to remove stun-gun probes from his back. 'At the time Officer Mearkle fires both rounds from her pistol, the video clearly depicts Kassick lying on the snow covered lawn with his face toward the ground,' according to the arrest affidavit. 'Furthermore, at the time the rounds are fired nothing can be seen in either of Kassick's hands, nor does he point or direct anything toward Officer Mearkle.' Marsico said Mearkle performed CPR after the shooting. He called the shooting 'a tragedy for all involved.' In the wake of Tuesday's announcement, Kassick's younger brother Dale Kassick spoke out, saying: 'Nothing is going to bring my brother back. He should have never lost his life over a traffic stop.' However, Dale said he and the rest of his family were thankful for the community's support in the past month and the prompt filing of charges. 'It's not being swept under the rug, it's not being forgotten about,' Dale said. Last month, Kassick's older brother Dan said his brother had struggled with drug addition in his life. However, he said the construction worker was not the type to get into a fight - especially with a police officer. Scene: Above, a picture of the area where Kassick was shot on February 2, with police investigating . Serious allegations: Mearkle pictured above entered court on Tuesday, before the arraignment . The DA said a syringe was found near Kassick's body, and he had alcohol and unspecified drugs in his system when he died. Mearkle's lawyer did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment, nor did Hummelstown Chief Charles M. Dowell. The police department issued a news release that said it had cooperated fully, calling the matter 'an extremely difficult case for all involved.' 'We are servants of justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented,' the news release stated. The offense of criminal homicide encompasses a range of charges, from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to felony first-degree murder. Prosecutors often narrow the charge later in the process, about the time when defendants are formally arraigned. Mearkle was released this afternoon on $250,000 bond and will have to wear an ankle monitoring device at home.

"A teenager, who was groomed by her married former teacher, is now pregnant with his baby. Jeffery Thomas, 40, was banned from the teaching profession for starting a 'sexually-motivated' relationship with his sixth-form student, Lily-Mai Guard, who is now 18. The couple are now expecting a child together and have recently moved to a home in Windsor to start a new life together. Married design-technology teacher, Mr Thomas, was working at Haberdashers' Aske's Knights Academy, in Bromley, Kent, when he embarked on a relationship with the Year 12 student in 2013. Jeffery Thomas, 40, was banned by a disciplinary hearing for starting a 'sexually-motivated' relationship with Year 12 pupil Lily-Mai Guard (together above) at Haberdashers' Aske's Knights Academy, in Bromley, Kent . A disciplinary hearing report published this week revealed Miss Guard stayed at his flat one night after school on his birthday, and witnesses say they were seen kissing at least once. It is not known when the affair first began, but witnesses say they saw them together around 10 times outside school. And Mr Thomas and Miss Guard saw each other increasingly over the summer holidays - while he was still married - making 89 calls and texting 29 times in just one-month. The National College for Teaching and Leadership's misconduct panel banned him from teaching indefinitely and found his 'conduct represents a fundamental abuse of his position of trust'. The relationship between the pair continued despite Miss Guard's brother - a fellow teacher - and the school's vice principal warning him off several times. Mr Thomas, who resigned in September 2013, accepted his conduct had breached professional boundaries but denied his behaviour was sexually motivated. However, the report says that during a heated row, Mr Thomas told his wife – who has now moved to the US – that he had kissed the girl. And while the panel found no evidence of a sexual relationship while the pupil was at school, they heard the pair were now living together and the teenager is expecting their first child. The report concluded: 'The fact that Mr Thomas continued to maintain and develop the relationship with student A whilst she was a student, in the face of very clear advice and warnings as to his behaviour, is an aggravating factor in this case. 'Mr Thomas's behaviour undermines public confidence in the profession and damages its collective reputation. In a statement Mr Thomas - known as Jeff - claimed that Miss Guard only stayed at his house once because 'she knew I was low and alone on my birthday.' 'She arrived at my flat late and unannounced,' he said. 'We went to the cinema and she ended up sleeping on the bed (me on the sofa) because she missed her last train home.' Mr Thomas (pictured) was working at the school as a design and technology teacher when he embarked on a relationship with the student. She is now said to be expecting his baby and the pair now live together . He added that 'with hindsight' he realised it was his fault and he 'should have sent her home when she arrived.' Miss Guard, a fan of dogs and reality shows such as Made in Chelsea, lived with her parents and six siblings before she moved to Windsor in Berkshire, with her former teacher. The 18-year-old, who often posts light-hearted short videos of herself and friends on social media - openly states she is in a relationship with Mr Thomas on Facebook. It is understood the couple moved to Windsor because he has family living there. One former student wrote anonymously on social media: 'To everyone saying this is fine because he's not her teacher anymore, I think this is disgusting. 'Mr Thomas taught me and during her lessons he would always be with her and just put on a film or something for us, he was a lovely teacher, friendly, etc and I feel sick knowing he taught me.' Another added: 'Mr Thomas WAS an excellent teacher who abused his position. To those who know him and the girl in question it is sickening. 'I feel for the students that he taught for letting them down so badly in their exam year. It is my understanding that quite a few pupils were aware of some sort of inappropriate friendship from year 11. 'The whole story is sad.' Mr Thomas was working at the school when he embarked on a relationship with the Year 12 student, from Downham, Bromley, in 2013. The report from the disciplinary hearing reveals the pair exchanged phone numbers, making 89 calls and texting 29 times over a one-month period during the summer holidays . And a former pupil, who also did not want to be named, said: 'I always saw them together whilst Mr Thomas was helping her with coursework or if she had a 'free lesson'.' 'After a while I noticed they were hanging around a lot more than a normal teacher would with a student but I didn't really take notice. 'As a teacher I thought Mr Thomas was a good teacher as he was willing to help you get the grades you wanted and the ones he expected from you. 'He was a generally funny person and someone you could trust.' A spokesman for Knights Academy said: 'We are in full agreement with the Teacher Misconduct Panel that Mr Jeff Thomas' behaviour was completely unacceptable and we fully support the banning order. 'The school took swift action as soon as it became aware that Mr Thomas had ignored all advice about his professional conduct. This resulted in his suspension and the referral of his case to the appropriate authorities, who have now taken the decision to ban him from teaching.' 'The panel that investigated the case found that despite the school giving him 'very clear warnings', he continued to maintain and develop the relationship with Student A.'","Jeffery Thomas, 40, started a 'sexually-motivated' relationship with Year 12 pupil Lily-Mai Guard at Haberdashers' Aske's Knights Academy, in Bromley .

"George Osborne is facing questions . over his relationship with Andy Coulson after claims he was paying back a . favour by helping the former News of the World editor get a job with . the Tories. A lawyer representing phone hacking . victims says the now-defunct tabloid underplayed their coverage of sex . and drugs allegations against him in October 2005. Six years ago the paper ran on its front page hotly . disputed claims from former prostitute and ex-drug user Natalie Rowe . that the Chancellor took cocaine in his early 20s, before he became an . MP. Mark Lewis said Mr Coulson, editor of . the paper the time the story broke in October 2005, deliberately played . down the scandal in the leader column, effectively saving Mr Osborne’s . political career. Mr Lewis told Australian TV: 'The . editor at the time was Andy Coulson, and I think that's worth . remembering because of the future relationship that we have between the . Conservative Party, the Prime Minister and Andy Coulson.' He added: 'Andy Coulson had done . George Osborner a favour; perhaps it was time for George Osborne to . reciprocate and do a favour back.' But Tory MPs rounded on Mr Lewis, calling it a 'spurious' attempt to embarrass the Chancellor with 'the wprst sort of smear'. In the leader column the paper said Mr . Osborne was 'a young man when he found himself in a murky world', and . said it was up to the voters to judge at election time. A lawyer representing Natalie Rowe claims Andy Coulson (left) was helped into his Number 10 role by George Osborne (right) because he was owed a 'favour' Mr Lewis said: ‘The decision on which . spin to give to the story by the editor of the News of the World . particularly was something that determined his future in politics. ‘If it would have been written the other way it would have finished his career I’m sure.’ In July, as the phone-hacking scandal . broke, Rebekah Brooks, Mr Coulson's successor at the NotW, told MPs that . the chancellor had played a key role in his appointment as David . Cameron's media adviser. Mark Lewis, a solicitor who represents . many of the celebrities said to have had their voicemail messages . intercepted by the News of the World, was speaking after Miss Rowe . repeated the cocaine allegations on Australian television. She told ABC’s PM programme she sold . her lurid story to the Sunday Mirror in 2005 and was surprised to see it . appear simultaneously in the News of the World, then edited by Andy . Coulson. She and her lawyer claim the paper obtained the story by hacking her phone. Allegations: Former escort girl Natalie Rowe claims that George Osborne used to take cocaine with her . Tory MPs condemned Mr Lewis's latest claims as a spurious attempt to smear the Chancellor. Patrick Mercer said: ‘This is the . worst sort of smear, where an account that has previously been put to . bed is raised again on the back of other allegations. ‘It is a vacuous attempt to breathe . life into an issue that has already died, by a lawyer who is clearly . looking for financial advantage.’ Mark Field, another Tory MP, said: ‘It . appears to be a rather spurious attempt to embarrass a senior minister . and link the government to the phone hacking scandal using the most . lurid of claims.’ Miss Rowe is believed to have spoken . out abroad because of the legal difficulties in having such an interview . broadcast in this country. She explained that in 2005, a picture . surfaced which showed Mr Osborne sitting alongside her when she was . working as a dominatrix known as ‘Mistress Pain’. The photograph was taken in a London . flat in about 1993 or 1994, when Mr Osborne was in his early 20s. It has . been claimed previously that a line of a cocaine can be seen on the . table in front of them. In her TV interview, Miss . Rowe, now in her mid-40s, claimed she was ‘more than just a friend’ of . Mr Osborne and insisted he had been a regular user of the Class A drug. A source close to Mr Osborne said it was ridiculous to claim that the Chancellor had helped Mr Coulson come to work for the Tories because he owed him a favour. The source pointed out that it was all of two years later that the journalist joined the Conservatives: ‘There’s nothing in it. If there had been someone would have said something about it at the time.’ Although the picture was taken before Mr Osborne entered politics, it was published when he had taken centre stage in the Conservative party as shadow chancellor. Only a few months earlier he had managed David Cameron’s successful campaign to become Tory party leader.","Former prostitute's lawyer questions Andy Coulson's appointment as Cameron's communication chief .

"A veterinary student was killed in a murder-suicide just two months before graduation and days before she was expected to attend job interviews. Whitney Engler, 27, was found shot to death in a home she shared with Joseph Hein, 24, in Davis California, on Friday. The body of the University of California student was discovered after police staged a seven-hour stand-off outside the duplex, believing there was an armed gunman inside. Scroll down for video . Veterinary student Whitney Engler, 27, was found shot to death in a home she shared with Joseph Hein, 24, in Davis California, on Friday following a murder-suicide . Police received a mysterious 911 call from a man saying two people had been shot to death inside. According to the Sacramento Bee they initially thought it was a hoax, so only entered the building at 1:30am when they threw tear gas through the window. Authorities have not publicly revealed who pulled the trigger, but Whitney's parents told the California paper officials said her daughter was the victim. She and Hein were said to be in a platonic relationship and in a short-term rental agreement - creating mystery around what prompted the tragic events to unfold. After father, Dennis Engler, told the Bee she moved in with Hein in December because the house she had lived in was too crowded. He said the deal was that she would cook in exchange for five months free rent. Whitney's family have said she and Hein (left) had a platonic relationship. He uploaded a picture to Facebook of a card (left) which read: 'Here lies Joseph Hein, 1991-2015, devoted friend, lover of __________' last year .

He posted a number of pictures of a semi-automatic rifle on his Facebook last year as well as an image of a card which read: 'Here lies Joseph Hein, 1991-2015, devoted friend, lover of __________.' It had a Cards Against Humanity branding at the bottom, referring to the popular card game. The space is supposed to be filled by a word. Mr Engler said: It’s mystifying. Nothing I’ve learned leads to even a hint of an explanation, which might never be forthcoming. Whitney was a lover of animals and had been looking after a service dog called Rosie at the time. It has since been found after her friends set up a search in the area. Friend and fellow veterinary student Anjolie Anjali Daryani, who led the search for Whitney's pets, said on Facebook on Saturday: 'Last night I lost a good friend, and the world loss an amazing person. Friend Anjolie Anjali Daryani said Whitney was only two months away from graduating and had a number of job interviews planned this weekend . 'Whitney Engler I hope that you rest in peace and know that we are all doing everything we can to find Rosie. 'I will never forget all of our time spent together.. whether it was horseriding, training our dogs, going out to dinners, going shopping, or just hanging out I will miss those moments dearly.' She told Fox 40: 'She had job interviews set up this weekend, she’s less than 2 months away from graduation.' On Saturday night, a vigil was held by Whitney's friends on campus. More than 200 people gathered on the patio of Gladys Valley Hall. Police received a mysterious 911 call on Friday from a man saying two people had been shot to death inside.

"Couple: Becky Tait, 20, stepped in front of a train on the same stretch of tracks where her boyfriend Phil James, 19, did the same two months earlier . A heartbroken girlfriend killed herself at the same spot where her boyfriend committed suicide weeks earlier after struggling to come to terms with his death, an inquest heard today. Becky Tait, 20, stepped in front of a speeding train on the same tracks where her boyfriend Phil James, 19, had stood two months earlier. The care assistant from Stoke-on-Trent had been distraught after his death and was struggling to cope with her loss, Cannock Coroner’s Court in Staffordshire was told. Miss Tait went to the tracks where she died last November - where her ‘soul mate’ Mr James had died in September. Witnesses said she looked on ‘purposefully’ at the passenger train, which braked but struck her - causing multiple injuries. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Miss Tait had already tried to kill herself a month after Mr James’s death by taking an overdose, the inquest was told. She was kept in hospital for five days where she told mental health nurses she was unable to cope with the death of her boyfriend. Miss Tait was discharged in October and put into the care of her grandparents, but she killed herself one month later. Margaret Jones, deputy assistant coroner for Staffordshire South, recorded a verdict of suicide. She said: ‘Becky Tait was a very young lady who was clearly traumatised by the death of her boyfriend. She was a very unhappy lady. ‘She clearly had been since the death of her boyfriend some weeks ago in similar circumstances. She had made some progress since being discharged from hospital.' 'Very unhappy': Miss Tait (above) had been distraught after her boyfriend's death and was struggling to cope . She said that on the 9th of November she was went to the railway tracks and was seen by witnesses. She added: 'This was a tragic event and her death deeply affected a lot of her family and friends.’ A young witness, who cannot be named, said in a statement read out to the court: ‘This girl was hanging over the barriers and I just thought she was in a rush or something. ‘I could see that she squeezed through the barriers and onto the train lines. I thought she was in a rush and she was just going to walk through the train lines. ‘The train came closer and closer, but she stood in the middle of the tracks. She waited for the train to get too close and then it hit her.’ Police Constable Melanie Dodd, of British Transport Police, told the inquest that Miss Tait had a suitcase at the time, which contained clothes and personal items. She added: ‘She moved on the tracks in front of the train, indicating a deliberate act. I am aware that her boyfriend did something similar weeks before.’ Family: Miss Tait's sister (left, with red hair) and mother (blonde, wearing scarf) were among the attendees at her inquest. They are pictured outside Cannock Coroner's Court today . Flowers left at the scene of the double-tragedy in Staffordshire . Miss Tait, who was born in Darlington, County Durham, had been going out with Mr James for a number of months and had planned a holiday to Portugal. Mr James was described as a huge fan of Robbie Williams and had a tattoo of the pop star’s name across his chest. The Stoke-born singer even took to his personal blog to pay tribute to Mr James, saying: ‘Save me a pint in heaven youth. Gone too soon. We'll all miss you. Much love, Rob.’ Consultant clinical psychologist Jurai Daromgkamas said Miss Tait was treated by the crisis team at South Staffordshire and Shropshire NHS Trust. She added: ‘The plan was to keep her safe and well until she was no longer feeling the suicide feelings. She was given some suggestions for coping strategies and was also told she was going to be monitored in the community.

Tribute from Williams: The Stoke-born singer even took to his personal blog to pay tribute to Mr James, saying: ‘Save me a pint in heaven youth. Gone too soon. We'll all miss you. Much love, Rob' ‘She said she no longer had suicide thoughts and hence she was discharged from the ward.’ Later, Miss Tait’s grandmother Val James said she was in Spain at the time of the death - and had received a text from the care worker just before she took her own life. She said: ‘The text said she can't cope anymore and that it would be okay and that she loved me. She was such a beautiful and fantastic girl. She was our world. We have done so much to remember her the way she was.’ Her friend Jade Johnson, 21, added: ‘She was usually the life of the party. She was the sort of person who would make sure people were enjoying themselves. Another friend, Debra Blythe, 50, said: ‘She was such a lovely person and she had so many friends. She would do anything to cheer people up, including a funny dance. That's just who she was.’ For confidential support call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here for details .","Becky Tait, of Stoke, killed herself at same spot in Staffordshire .

He is accused of using a scanner and a computer to help forge Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. The court heard the forged documents were created by Tritschler to show the complaint department that he had given clear management advice to his junior. They also heard the pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were both working on-board HMS Illustrious in July 2007, when it was based in New York. Captain Tritschler thought Lt Cdr Bovill's performance was 'substandard' while on board the Invincible-class aircraft carrier, Portsmouth Military Court Centre in Hampshire heard. Meanwhile, Lt Cdr Bovill believed Captain Tritschler to be 'abrupt', 'blunt' and accused him of being a 'bully'. Their feud resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill - who left his Major rank in the Army in 2006 to transfer to the Navy - pursuing the complaint service in the Royal Navy. Lt Cdr Bovill joined the Navy as senior air engineering officer and was working under Captain Tritschler, who was then a Commander. Captain Tritschler denies three counts of forgery. David Richards, prosecuting, said: 'The accused, Captain Tritschler, is a man of previous impeccable character. 'In 2007 and 2008 he was the head of air engineering on HMS Illustrious. In July 2007 the complainant, Lieutenant Commander Bovill, was transferred to HMS Illustrious, which was the first ship he had served on. 'It was clear the two men had a very difficult relationship. 'Captain Tritschler thought Bovill's performance was substandard. Bovill found Tritschler to be officious, abrupt and bullying. 'The disagreement between the two men resulted in Lt Cdr Bovill pursuing the complaint service. The pair had a 'difficult' relationship while they were working on HMS Illustrious (pictured) in 2007 . 'In February 2008 Lt Cdr Bovill submitted a complaint and a decision was reached but Lt Cdr Bovill was not happy and asked for it to be taken to the next level.' The court then heard Captain Tritschler allegedly forged Lt Cdr Bovill's signature on three separate documents. Mr Richards added: 'What the documents appear to show is regular manager advice from Captain Tritschler to Bovill and the documents bear signatures of both men. 'However, the signatures of Bovill were not put there by Bovill. Rather they are copied and forged, possibly using a scanner. 'There is no dispute that these signatures are forged. The dispute is whether Captain Tritschler is responsible for them. 'The prosecution's case is that Captain Tritschler only ever had the documents and the idea that someone else infiltrated them is fanciful. 'It was deliberate and deceitful and was quite out of character for a man who has the rank Captain Tritschler does. The court heard how when Bovill joined the navy he 'struggled' to cope and noticed Captain Tritschler had an 'abrupt management style'. Mr Richards said: 'Lt Cdr Bovill made mistakes, however he felt these were dealt with in an unacceptable way by his superior, the accused, who he accused of humiliating and undermining him.' 'On February 21, 2008, Lt Cdr Bovill submitted his first complaint of bullying (regarding Tritschler's behaviour).' When he realised the signatures on the documents were forged, Lt Cdr Bovill reported it and Captain Tritschler was subsequently interviewed. In interview, Cpt Tritschler denied forging the signatures and said he remembered Lt Cdr Bovill signing them in his presence. Mr Richards said: 'He insisted the documents were signed in front of him. 'The prosecution's case is that it was Captain Tritschler who generated these false documents in an attempt to bring an end what seemed like a never-ending complaint process.' Lt Cdr Bovill today told the board: 'Our relationship significantly deteriorated. I know that I made mistakes in how I went about my professional business. 'But I wanted to submit a complaint about the behaviour I was receiving. I thought he had a very abrupt and blunt manner with me.' Captain Tritschler denies three charges of forgery and the trial continues.

"The British economy could overtake Germany to become the biggest in Europe within 20 years, Nick Clegg claims today. The Lib Dem leader claims that under his plans the UK can become the 'powerhouse of Europe'. He will call for the science budget to be protected from cuts and the the amount of public money spent on innovation to be doubled. Official figures suggest Britain overtook France last year to become the second largest economy in Europe . Official figures suggest Britain overtook France last year to become the second largest economy in Europe. According to Eurostat, the UK economy in 2014 hit €2.22trillion, ahead of France's €2.14trillian but well behind Germany's €2.9trillion. The Centre for Economic and Business Research has predicted that within the next two decades, Germany, held back by a declining population and the weakness of the euro, could be overtaken by the UK for the first time since 1954. At an event at London's docklands, Mr Clegg will set out an ambition to sustain economic growth of an average of more than 1 per cent higher per year than Germany until 2035. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claims that under his plans the UK can become the 'powerhouse of Europe' The plan will involve ring-fencing the £4.6 billion science budget, with a commitment to increasing it in real terms once the deficit is eliminated. The party's manifesto will also commit to doubling innovation spending across the economy, increasing the Government contribution in real terms by 2020-21 from £454 million in 2014-15 to more than £1 billion. Mr Clegg will say: 'The Liberal Democrats have rescued the economy and led the recovery. Now is the time to be ambitious about our future. 'We believe that by building a strong, modern, open economy we can become the powerhouse of Europe. We can grow faster than both France and Germany, overtaking them as the largest economy in Europe in 20 years' time. 'That is hugely ambitious but absolutely possible. To do it we need two things: to secure the recovery; and to put in place an ambitious long-term plan that harnesses and encourages the skills and dynamism of British workers and British businesses.' Experts say Germany is being held back by a declining population and the impact of the eurozone crisis which continues to dog the single currency. Business Secretary Vince Cable will use today's event to highlight his commitment to the European Union and encouraging international students to come to the UK - both issues the Lib Dems have clashed with the Conservatives over in government. Mr Cable will say: 'In Government, the Liberal Democrats have enacted important reforms to move Britain away from a culture of short-termism to one where business and government thinks long-term beyond the political cycle. 'Our industrial strategy has laid the foundations to give business the confidence to invest over a number of years by planning for the provision of skills, finance and innovation. 'The Liberal Democrats are on the side of business in creating an economy that is open to international students and the global skills pool our country needs to grow. Britain has thrived by being part of the European Union and that is why the Liberal Democrats remain committed to ensuring we continue to play our part in the world's largest single market. 'We have started to reap the rewards, but we want to do more to move our economy from recovery to renewal across the whole of the UK over the coming decade.'","Britain overtook France last year to become second largest EU economy .

"More than 300 young people in Oxfordshire were groomed, raped and sometimes forced into 'sex slavery' by gangs over the last 15 years, a damning report will reveal tomorrow. In a scandal startlingly similar to the one in Rotherham, police and social services will be criticised for failing to protect vulnerable children from sexual abuse. One gang of Asian men was responsible for abusing and enslaving 50 girls, mainly from Oxford, but the men were also able to sexually torture girls as young as 11 for eight years after a series of missed opportunities to stop them. Scroll down for video . Abuse: More than 300 young people, mainly from Oxford, pictured, were groomed, raped and sometimes forced into 'sex slavery' by gangs over the last 15 years, a damning report will reveal tomorrow . Tomorrow the county's safeguarding children's board will publish a review into 15 years of child exploitation, which will be 'brutal' in its condemnation of the authorities. The victims, who were mainly girls under the age of 16 in the care system, were targeted by men from mainly Asian gangs who raped, tortured and trafficked them for sex between 1999 and 2014. Some were abused for up to eight years despite asking for help from the authorities, who instead refused to believe them or blamed them. Their abusers fed them drink and drugs before taking them to graveyards, a B&B and flats rented just for the rape and torture of children. According to the Guardian, one 12-year-old girl was taken to a Reading house for a backstreet abortion during a six-year period where she was passed between groups of men who raped her in what she called 'torture sex'. The plight of the victims was laid bare in 2013 when seven members of a sadistic gang were jailed for a total of 95 years for their 'depraved' and 'evil' abuse of vulnerable girls. Five gang members were given life sentences and two others were jailed for seven years for 'crimes of the utmost gravity'. The paedophile network groomed more . than 50 vulnerable girls in Oxford between 2004 and 2012 with gifts, . alcohol and drugs before subjecting them to extreme physical and sexual . violence. They used knives, meat cleavers and baseball bats to inflict severe pain on the girls for their twisted pleasure. But a catalogue of opportunities to stop the abuse was missed as early as May 2005. Jailed: Brothers Akhtar Dogar (left) and Anjum Dogar (right) were each given a life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the Old Bailey in 2013 for their role in the Oxford abuse . Abusers: Mohammed Karrar (left), 38, was given life with a minimum of 20 years for the 'dreadful offences' he committed against the girls. His brother Bassam Karrar (right), 34, was also handed a life sentence with a minimum of 15 years . Attackers: Kamar Jamil (left), 27, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years while Assad Hussain (right) , 32, was sentenced to seven years in prison . On numerous occasions girls told . police officers, social workers and care staff in children's homes how . they were raped or seriously sexually abused – but no charges were . brought against the gang. Three of the girls who gave evidence . at the trial were reported missing from residential care on 254 . occasions. Paedophile: Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child . And the judge in the case, Judge Peter Rook, said 'police and social services missed tell-tale signs' about the abuse that was taking place. One social worker had earlier told the trial that 'nine out of ten' people who were meant to be caring for the girls 'knew what was going on'. Life sentences were handed to Akhtar Dogar, 32, and his brother Anjum, 31, who were both jailed for a minimum of 17 years, Mohammed Karrar, 38, who will serve a minimum of 20 years, his brother Bassam, 33, jailed for a minimum of 15 years and Kamar Jamil, 27, jailed for a minimum of 12 years. Assad Hussain, 32, and Zeeshan Ahmed, 27, were jailed for seven years. The latest serious case review came weeks after true scale of abuse in Rotherham was revealed, where at least 1,400 girls fell into the clutches of paedophiles, mainly from Pakistani backgrounds. Whistleblowers who tried to raise concerns lost their jobs, and  police officers often did not seem to believe the girls, their families or those who reported problems, and did not treat them as victims. One former police officer said: 'They were running scared of the race issue… there is no doubt that in Rotherham, this has been a problem with Pakistani men for years and years. People were scared of being called racist.' Similar paedophile rings were uncovered in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and Derby.","Oxfordshire safeguarding children's board to release  report on Tuesday .

"Parents are in danger of being reported to police by their children's head teachers if they allow them to play video games for over 18s. A letter sent by a group of schools in Cheshire raised concerns about the 'levels of violence and sexual content' young people are being exposed to by playing games such as Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, which are renowned for their violent characters and have an 18 classification. It warns that if teachers are made aware their pupils have been playing these video games they will contact police and social services. Scroll down for video . Nantwich Education Partnership sent a letter to parents warning them it will report them to police or social services if they become aware children are playing violent 18+ video games, such as Call of Duty . The letter, sent by Nantwich Education Partnership, said allowing children to play these type of  games on Xboxes and Playstations is deemed 'neglectful'. It comes amid fears children could be left more vulnerable to grooming and abuse by being exposed to early sexualised behaviour as well as extreme brutality, often seen in video games in the upper age classifications. The letter says: 'Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Dogs of War and other similar games, are all inappropriate for children and they should not have access to them. 'Nor should they have Facebook accounts or interact on sites or media or messaging sites like WhatsApp that are not designed for their age.' Nantwich Education Partnership covers 16 primary and secondary schools in Cheshire. The letter also warns: 'If your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game or associated product that is designated 18+ we are advised to contact the Police and Children’s Social Care as it is neglectful.' The teachers claim the games can expose children to sex and violence, making them vulnerable to abuse . There is now more pressure on teachers and social workers to report concerns about children after David Cameron announced they could face up to five years in prison if they do not speak out about suspicions children are being neglected or abused. Department for Education guidance on safeguarding also urges school staff that they have a responsibility to identify children who are likely to suffer significant harm. Headteacher Mary Hennessy Jones, who helped draft the letter, told the Sunday Times: 'We are trying to help parents to keep their children as safe as possible in this digital era.' The letter was sent by a group of primary and secondary schools, warning people over the dangers . Video games with an 18 classification are known for their violence. Call of Duty allows players to take on the role of a blood thirsty soldier in a number of violent scenarios - arming themselves with an arsenal of weapons including rifles, pistols and grenades. The game has been mired in controversy, with Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claiming he had trained himself to kill his 77 victims through playing the game. Games such as Grand Theft Auto are renowned for their violent scenes and brutality towards women . Grand Theft Auto is well known for its violence which includes carjacking, gambling, killing and simulated sex with prostitutes. Last year Grand Theft Auto V was removed from the shelves of Australian stores Target and Kmart amid fears that the game glamorises violence against women. However the message from Nantwich Education Partnership has been criticised by parents as going too far, and threatening parents rather than helping them. Margaret Morrissey, of Parents Outloud, told the newspaper: 'Accepting the huge concerns about these violent games and their effect on children, I think the schools are stepping outside the realm of what is probably acceptable.' But she acknowledged that there is no a 'huge pressure' on teachers to report safeguarding concerns, placing them in an impossible situation. Call of Duty allows players to inhabit the role of a blood-thirsty soldier in a variety of grusome scenarios. Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed. Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 victims by playing Call of Duty. French terrorist Mohammed Merah also played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March 2012. The violence in Call of Duty has been criticised by the London Jewish Forum, the British Muslim Forum and Church of England ministers. Call of Duty 3 shows soldiers running through London while bombs explode and buildings crash to the ground. In one controversial scene a soldier causes a Tube train to derail and explode. Other graphic scenes show aerial attacks on New York and grenades exploding in Paris and Berlin. When news of the Certificate 18 game's content was revealed it was panned by Mediawatch UK as being in 'incredibly poor taste'. Call of Duty 2 also caused outrage when it was revealed players could kill 'civilians'. There are currently at least 40million active players across all of the Call of Duty titles. In Call of Duty gamers are armed with an arsenal of weapons and encouraged to take part in violence .","Letter sent to parents warning about children playing computer games .

"What are the chances you will live for another ten years? While your GP might give you some idea, scientists now say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill. The process involves running in three-minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed and at a growing incline. Scroll down to read DailyMail.com review of the test... Scientists say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill. The process involves running in three-minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed . Runners then plug in their vital statistics into a basic formula to find out how likely they are to die over the next decade. Dubbed the FIT Treadmill Score, the test was created by cardiologists at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland after studying 58,000 stress exams. 'The notion that being in good physical shape portends lower death risk is by no means new,' said lead investigator Haitham Ahmed. 'But we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age, gender and fitness level, and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test.' The test consists of three-minute segments that increase in speed and incline. Follow the below stages in order to see which MET score you reach. Make sure you record your heart rate during each exercise. Stage 1 - 1.7 mph/10 per cent grade/5 METs . Stage 2 - 2.5 mph/12 per cent grade/7 METs . Stage 3 - 3.4 mph/14 per cent grade/10 METs . Stage 4 - 4.2 mph/16 per cent grade/13 METs . Stage 5 - 5.0 mph/18 per cent grade/15 METs . Stage 6 - 5.5 mph/20 per cent grade/18 METs . Stage 7 - 5.5 mph/22 per cent grade/20 METs . Then put in your details in to the following formula: . (12 x METs) + (% of maximum predicted heart rate) – (4 x age) + 43 if female. Maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 – age. Heart rate achieved during exercise should be divided by maximum predicted. If you have at least zero, your survival rate is 97 percent in the next decade. In the study, scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200. If you score 100 or higher, you have have a two percent risk of dying over the next 10 years, while those with scores between 0 and 100 face a three per cent death risk over the next decade. If you have a score between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 per cent risk of dying in the next 10 years, while scores lower than negative 100 have a 38 per cent risk of dying in a decade. As well as age and gender, the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so-called metabolic equivalents, or METs . As well as age and gender, the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so-called metabolic equivalents, or METs. This is a gauge of how much energy the body expends during exercise. More vigorous activities require higher energy output – or higher METs. An activity such as slow walking equals two METs, compared with eight for running. For the study, the team analysed information on 58,020 people, ages 18 to 96, from Detroit, Michigan, who underwent standard exercise stress tests between 1991 and 2009 for evaluation of chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting or dizziness. The researchers then tracked how many of the participants within each fitness level died from any cause over the next decade. 'Get busy living or get busy dying'. These were the famous words of advice Andy offered to Red during his life sentence in Shawshank Redemption. They were the same words that were going round my head as I stepped up to the 'When am I going to die challenge'. I'm a 33-year-old man of average height and build with an emerging paunch. I spent my twenties drinking and smoking but thanks to a second go at hypnosis, I knocked the smokes on the head last year. I consider myself fairly healthy having passed my formative years swimming, cycling and playing football. Now, when I can be bothered, I go to Bikram yoga and run. The paunch bothers me. I looked at the test and thought: Easy, before hauling myself off to the Young Man's Hebrew Association on 14th. I fired up the treadmill and got going. Stage 1 - 1.7 mph/10 per cent grade/5 METs . Easy. I walk twice as fast. Stage 2 - 2.5 mph/12 per cent grade/7 METs . Still easy but it reminded me why hate treadmills. They make walking and running so boring. Should have brought my headphones. Stage 3 - 3.4 mph/14 per cent grade/10 METs . Incline jump is considerate and I'm starting to feel it. What is wrong with me? The Grim Reaper is on my tail. Stage 4 - 4.2 mph/16 per cent grade/13 METs . It was all that food and booze at Christmas. I should have done Dry January. Must stop going to Ray's pizza. I'm not going to finish this I know it. Stage 5 5.0 mph/18 per cent grade/15 METs . No can do. Treadmill doesn't go up as far as 20 per cent and thank God. I'm beat. I'm done. No way I can do last two stages. Pathetic. So there. 12 mins no more. It was the incline that got me. Much harder than I thought. If the test is accurate I've got two per cent chance of dying in the next ten years. I'll take that. Not as bad as I thought. Unlike Andy from Shawshank Redemption, I haven't got to start digging just yet. Sean O'Hare for DailyMail.com . The results reveal that among people of the same age and gender, fitness level as measured by METs, and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk. Fitness level was the single most powerful predictor of death and survival, even after researchers accounted for other important variables such as diabetes and family history of premature death. Scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200, with those above 0 having lower mortality risk and those in the negative range facing highest risk of dying. Patients who scored 100 or higher had a 2 per cent risk of dying over the next 10 years, while those with scores between 0 and 100 faced a 3 per cent death risk over the next decade. People with scores between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 percent risk of dying in the next 10 years, while those with scores lower than negative 100 had a 38 per cent risk of dying. 'The FIT Treadmill Score is easy to calculate and costs nothing beyond the cost of the treadmill test itself,' says senior study author Michael Blaha. The results reveal that among people of the same age and gender, fitness level as measured by METs, and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk . Exercise stress tests usually measure how well the heart and lungs respond to physical exertion while a person is walking on a treadmill at progressively higher speed and elevation. The test is stopped once a person reaches the point of exhaustion or develops chest pain, dizziness or heart rhythm abnormalities. Those who have normal readings and no alarming symptoms while exercising are said to have 'normal' results and typically do not require further testing. However, the researchers say, the new data show varying degrees of fitness among those with 'normal' stress test results that reveal telling clues about cardiac and respiratory fitness and, therefore, overall death risk over time. 'Stress test results are currently interpreted as 'either/or' but we know that heart disease is a spectrum disorder,' Dr Ahmed says. 'We believe that our FIT score reflects the complex nature of cardiovascular health and can offer important insights to both clinicians and patients.'","Test involves running in three-minute segments on a treadmill .

"Trevor Noah, the new host of The Daily Show, has spoken out in defense of himself following a social media backlash over comments he made about women and Jews in tweets dating back to 2009. The South-African comedian, who is little-known in the US, rocketed to national fame on Monday after he was named as longtime host Jon Stewart's replacement on the satirical news program. However, the excitement surrounding the announcement was tinged by hundreds of Internet users accusing the 31-year-old - who is a quarter Jewish - of anti-Semitism for his 'offensive' posts. But in a tweet on Tuesday, Noah told his two million followers: 'To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn’t land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian.' It comes as Comedy Central, which hired Noah as a correspondent on the show just three months ago, has defended its newest star as a 'provocative' comedian who 'spares noone, himself included'. Scroll down for video . Response: Trevor Noah (pictured), the new host of The Daily Show, has spoken out in defense of himself following an online backlash over comments he made about women and Jews in tweets dating back to 2009 . 'Not a true reflection': In a tweet on Tuesday, Noah told his two million followers: 'To reduce my views to a handful of jokes that didn’t land is not a true reflection of my character, nor my evolution as a comedian' This is one of the five tweets dating back to 2009 that bloggers have been dragging up and complaining about . One Twitter user accused Noah's remarks as being 'a tad stereotyped', as well as 'borderline anti-Semitic' Another user told Noah to 'grow up', adding  he was 'no longer a fan' of the 31-year-old South African comedian . In a statement, the network said: 'To judge him or his comedy based on a handful of jokes is unfair.' It added: 'Trevor is a talented comedian with a bright future at Comedy Central.' Noah, the son of a half-Jewish Xhosa mother and a Swiss father, was a trending topic on Twitter on Monday night as he drew fire for jokes that were described as tasteless, hateful, and unfunny. The controversial tweets were posted between 2009 and 2014. In May last year, Noah tweeted: 'Behind every successful Rap Billionaire is a double as rich Jewish man. #BeatsByDreidel.' A year earlier, he posted: 'Note to self - Langostines are not Jewish prawns.' Meanwhile, during a soccer match in January 2012, he joked: 'Messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him, but Messi doesn't go down easy, just like jewish chicks. #ElClasico.' He also slammed the United States' midsection in a 2013 tweet, writing that 'When flying over the middle of America the turbulence is so bad. It's like all the ignorance is rising through the air.' And in 2009, Noah, who can speak an impressive six languages, wrote: 'Almost bumped a Jewish kid crossing the road. He didn't look b4 crossing but I still would hav felt so bad in my german car!' On Tuesday, the tweets were being posted online by enraged bloggers, who slammed Noah as 'racist'. One said: 'Jon Stewart, born Leibowitz, won't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets.' Roseanne Barr was among those calling out the  comic, who has a global following and two million Twitter followers, writing: 'U should cease sexist & anti semitic 'humor' about jewish women & Israel.' Meanwhile, a blogger posted Noah's tweets in an article, with the comment: 'Trevor Noah, the racist, hack taking over for Jon Stewart is also quite the anti-Semite too. Obama and progressive liberals really will love this guy. Among some of the skits that Trevor Noah came up with was the Black Hitler.' However, one Twitter user, Jack Obora@JackObora, had a different opinion on the matter. He tweeted: 'Seriously who reads through six years of tweets to try and find something to be offended about? #TrevorNoah #DailyShow.' Viewers have lamented the end of Jon Stewart's 16-year stint on the show . Regardless of users' opinions, the tweets showed a different side to Noah than the picture painted by Comedy Central and the comedian himself just a day earlier. In a phone interview on Monday from Dubai, where he was traveling on a comedy tour, Noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on-air - likened himself to New York-born Stewart. He said: 'One thing we both share: We are both progressives,' adding: 'traveling the world I've learned that progressives, regardless of their locations, think in a global space.' Noah, who joined The Daily Show just three months ago and speaks an impressive six languages, was being pitched by Comedy Central as reflecting a new age of global multiculturalism. He is  'a citizen of the world,' in the words of Michele Ganeless, the network's president. His dry, cutting humor was also singled out by producers as the winning formula to win over viewers. Successor: The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has been named successor to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year . Appearance: In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show (pictured). In 2013, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman . Noah was named as the program's new host a little more than a month after Stewart unexpectedly announced he was leaving The Daily Show following 16 years as its principal voice. According to The New York Times, a slew of better-known potential replacements chose to move on to competing networks. However, the reaction to his appointment was overwhelmingly positive. Noah brings a wealth of hosting experience helping him, in Ganeless' words, check 'off every box' on her network's list of requirements. Also important: he has kindred spirit Stewart's blessing. 'All I needed in my life was Jon's blessing. That's what I have, so I'm looking forward to being part of The Best Damn News Show in the World,' Noah told the Associated Press. Although no dates have been disclosed, Stewart will likely depart by the end of the year. Noah, who grew up in Gauteng and starred on the South African soap opera, Isiding, will take over soon after. Tough act to follow: Noah was not surprisingly reverent of extremely popular departing host Jon Stewart as he tweeted Monday about the news he's the next host . On Monday, Ganeless spoke of the advantage of introducing Noah to a mainstream U.S. audience through The Daily Show, with viewers coming to the show he hosts with no preconceptions. 'They will get to discover him, and form their opinions of him, as they watch him host,' he said. But by Tuesday, some opinions were already forming. Weighing in on Noah's selection, a Slate column compared his vetting to that of Sarah Palin as a running mate for presidential candidate John McCain. The choice of a new host for The Daily Show is a critical decision not only for the satirical-news program, but for the network, whose identity has largely been forged by the Daily Show franchise, which for years was followed by the likewise signature The Colbert Report. By the end of this year, Comedy Central will have completely remade this programming block. In January, African-American comic Larry Wilmore replaced the The Colbert Report hosting The Nightly Show. Born to a black mother and white father in South Africa, 31-year-old Noah was not allowed to live with either parent and even passed off by family as albino because, under apartheid laws, different races could not mix . Trevor Noah, 31, grew up in Soweto, South Africa, the son of a Xhosa mother and Swiss father. 'My mother had to be very clandestine about who my father was,' Noah told the Times. 'He couldn't be on my birth certificate.' For much of his childhood, his African family passed him off as an albino. Under apartheid laws, different races could not mix and he was not allowed to live with either of his parents. He reportedly once cracked to an audience, 'I was born a crime.' Noah began doing stand-up in South Africa in his twenties and has since leveraged his ability to speak six languages into an international career. He's hosted his own late-night show in South Africa, radio shows and awards shows. Noah is also the only South African comedian to ever perform on The Late Show and Tonight Show. But don't be too quick to connect him to the Dark Continent. He told Letterman in 2013: . 'They make it sound like a guy in leopard skin's going to come running on the stage.' Nonetheless, Noah's past is firmly rooted in South Africa's turbulent racial history. 'I didn't live a normal life,' he told the Times. 'I grew up in a country that wasn't normal.' More specifically, Noah says that after he began to do stand-up in his 20s, he quickly became aware that 'speaking freely about anything, as a person of color, was considered treason.' News of his new role spread quickly in South Africa. 'Over the years, Mr. Noah has proved that laughter is the best medicine and has helped our country and its people to find healing through laughing at themselves,' said Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa. 'South Africa is a microcosm of the world and there is no doubt that a global audience will find resonance in his humor,' he added in an email.","Trevor Noah, 31, spoke out in defense of 'anti-Semitic' tweets on Tuesday .

But just three months after her first skating lesson, the determined 24-year-old from Mackay in Queensland was performing high-intensity tricks in cirque shows across the world with her real-life partner.

Jessica Ritchie and real-life partner Jeronimo Garcia perform high-intensity tricks in cirque shows across the world and a currently performing across Australia in Le Noir . The pair had been dating for two years when the strain of not seeing each other for six months at a time became too much. 'We basically started to see each other and after that one thing led to another, but we had that lovely big ocean between us,' Jessica told Daily Mail Australia. While they were luckily based on the same cruise ship several times together, they repeatedly had to go their separate ways with different contracts.

'It started to become a lot trickier. I went to Mexico to see him because I hadn't seen him in six months and we decided we didn't like being apart.' The couple were thinking of unique routines they could perform as a duo so they could tour together when Jeronimo suggested roller skating. 'I'd never skated before - he bought me knee pads, a helmet, wrist guards. He took me to the park and taught me. He knew how to stand on skates but I didn't,' she said. 'The first step was me trying to move on the skates, but then we progressed to spinning and aerials.

"ITV's This Morning faces an investigation over a Fifty Shades of Grey feature named 'Bondage for Beginners' where they discussed and tested sex toys at 11am. Ofcom said today it had received 120 complaints about the February 3 show where a scantily-clad couple were seen on a bed playing kinky games on live television. Presenter Philip Schofield had said before the segment it would be in 'good taste', but viewers disagreed, calling it 'pornographic' and 'highly inappropriate' for morning television. Several complained that they were forced to answer questions about bondage from their children, who had been watching it with them. Investigation: ITV's This Morning  segment called Bondage For Beginners, which featured a live demonstration of 50 Shades of Grey inspired sex toys, now faces an Ofcom investigation . Presenters Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield giggled their way through the segment, but maintained it was in 'good taste' An Ofcom spokesman said today: 'Ofcom has opened an investigation into whether an item about 'bondage for beginners' was suitable for broadcast before the watershed.' The 'Bondage For Beginners' session was inspired by the new film of the controversial erotic novel 50 Shades Of Grey, which opened in cinemas in mid-February. Presenters Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield giggled their way through the show, which also featured a discussion about sex toys. Two models in their underwear were shown in bed using a 'feather tickler' and discussion moved on to other sex toys like nipple-clamps. Mr Schofield, 52, had warned viewers shortly after 10.30am that they would be discussing bondage equipment in three stages – beginners, intermediate and advanced – throughout the show with 'sexpert' Annabelle Knight. However he assured them it would 'be done in good taste'. Yet at one point he was so distracted by the romping models that he missed his cue to introduce the next section, while Miss Bleakley, 36, who is engaged to footballer Frank Lampard, found herself laughing uncontrollably. Campaigners said it was an error of judgment to air the discussion at that time of day. Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch UK, said the show had set a dangerous example: 'It's not enough to say most children will be at school [at that time] because that's just not good enough. 'Quite apart from issues of taste and the fact that people might not want to speak to their children about this, I think it is dangerous to normalise this kind of behaviour. [50 Shades Of Grey] is putting across ideas that humiliation is pleasurable and torture is gratifying and I don't think those are healthy for anybody at all. 'But if it is dangerous for adults then it is doubly dangerous for children watching this'. Pre-watershed: At 11am on Valentine's Day two models in their underwear were shown in bed using a 'feather tickler' and discussion moved on to other sex toys like nipple-clamps. Viewers were not impressed either and expressed their anger online. Tracey Johnson tweeted: 'Used to love This Morning but today was final straw, sitting with my mum, on comes the bondage #nothanks.' Mother Nikki wrote: 'Ok bondage for beginners had to be turned over, can't cope with questions from the nine-year-old.' Another said on Twitter: '#BondageForBeginners is ridiculously inappropriate. This programme is on at my health club where there are children.' A friend added: 'Too early for this talk #BondageForBeginners. This is porn now @itvthismorning #FiftyShades #inappropriate.' ITV defended itself at the time and said it had warned viewers. A spokesman said: 'This Morning is a lifestyle programme that cover a diverse range of human interest topics. 'The programme has dealt with advice on sexual matters many times in the past, and a suitable announcement was given at the start.'","TV watchdog Ofcom launches probe into 'Bondage For Beginners' segment .

"Wellness guru Sarah Wilson has weighed in on the Belle Gibson controversy, saying too many health bloggers do not understand their power and responsibility. Ms Gibson, founder of the popular Whole Pantry app, has faced intense criticism since doubts were raised about whether she has terminal cancer. Ms Wilson, author of I Quit Sugar, told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'unfortunate' and that health bloggers have a huge responsibility to their followers. 'The real issue that's going on is there's a lot of people out there not taking on board the responsibility that comes with all this,' she said. Scroll down for video . I Quit Sugar author Sarah Wilson told Daily Mail Australia many bloggers are 'not taking on board the responsibility' that comes with publishing . Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson last week said she would issue an explanatory statement, but it has not materialised . 'I don't know that you need to be a dietitian to share information about your health journey. 'If you are somebody who works online and you claim to be a (health) blogger you have to take on certain responsibilities. 'You have to ensure you train yourself up in all of that (science). That's what I see isn't happening. 'There's a lot of people out there who are't taking on the responsibility of being a disseminator of information. 'We've got to be very transparent and acknowledge the science is not categorical - but respect the science that is there.' Ms Wilson has said in a blog about the issue that 'diet can't cure disease'. Ms Gibson has stayed mum about her health since admitting in an interview with The Australian that her previous claims cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, uterus and liver may have been a 'misdiagnosis'. In the weeks since doubts were raised about Belle Gibson's cancer and charitable donations, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books . In the weeks since, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books. The Whole Pantry iPhone app has been removed from the Apple Store and her much-touted Apple Watch app is no longer showcased on the technology company's website. In an interview with Daily Mail Australia last Tuesday, Ms Gibson said she understood why many of her followers were upset, but she criticised the 'maliciousness' of some critics. She said she would release a statement addressing concerns about her, but that it was 'taking longer than anticipated' due to 'constantly arising issues' and articles she needed to stay on top of. Asked if the statement would address concerns about her medical history, she said: 'Of course, and every which otherwise possible.' The statement has not been released and she has not responded to questions.","I Quit Sugar author Sarah Wilson has said too many 'wellness warriors' are not taking responsibility for their actions .

"Warlord Joseph Kony's bloodthirsty Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) is slaughtering elephants at an unprecedented rate and trading their valuable tusks for bullets. The poaching of elephants in Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is increasing rapidly, with more than 130 killed in the southern region in less than 12 months. Poaching is not uncommon in African parks, but rangers at Garamba have made a worrying discovery - the ivory is helping fund the LRA's war. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army is responsible for the slaughter of elephants in Garamba National Park . The poaching of elephants at Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is increasing at an unprecedented  rate . Sasha Lezhnev, associate director of policy at the Enough Project, an organisation which works to end genocide and crimes against humanity, this month interviewed an LRA defector. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'It is very concerning the LRA are selling tusks to fund their operations. 'The elephant population in the Central African Republic parks and Garamba could be entirely decimated if the problem continues. In Garamba there are still elephants but poaching really has been on the rise.' Mr Lezhnev, who returned from the DR Congo last week, has learned that a single elephant tusk can be traded for  18,000 bullets. 'They don't need guns, they have plenty of available guns, it's really bullets they need,' he added. 'It takes only one bullet to kill an elephant.' The LRA - a violent rebel group led by Kony - is renowned for being one of the most brutal forces in the world. 'Worrying': 'The elephant population in the Central African Republic parks and Garamba could be entirely decimated if the problem continues,' said Sasha Lezhnev, associate director of policy at the Enough Project. Park Rangers are pictured here with elephant corpses . High tech: There is evidence of at least nine of the 131 elephants killed in Garamba in the past 12 months being shot from helicopters. Here, Garamba National Park staff examine the carcass of an elephant . They have become notorious for murder, mutilation, rape, widespread abductions of children and adults, and sexual slavery. The LRA first emerged in northern Uganda in 1986, where it claimed to fight in the name of the Acholi ethnic group against the government of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. Over the years, the LRA has moved across the porous borders of the region: it shifted from Uganda to sow terror in southern Sudan before moving to northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and finally crossing into southeastern Central African Republic in March 2008. Combining religious mysticism with an astute guerrilla mind and bloodthirsty ruthlessness, leader Joseph Kony has turned scores of young girls into his personal sex-slaves while claiming to be fighting to impose the Bible's Ten Commandments. As well as the rebel group, a recent report by the Enough Project revealed renegade elements of the Congolese national army and armed poachers from Sudan are responsible for the recent upsurge in poaching. In the past, poachers have used very basic methods to slaughter the elephants, killing just one or two at a time. Now, heavily armed groups are using professional techniques and are bringing down three to eight of these majestic animals at a time. Their tusks are then cut off with chainsaws. There is also evidence of at least nine of the 131 elephants killed in Garamba in the past 12 months being shot from helicopters. In May last year, ten elephants were murdered in one day alone in Garamba, according to African Parks, a conservation group that manages the park with Congolese authorities. At Virunga National Park, also in the DR Congo, the elephant population has decreased by 90 per cent in the last twenty years, according to UNESCO. Garamba in the north eastern corner of the Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the oldest national parks in Africa . Spotted: A group of suspected LRA fighters escort captives carrying supplies in Garamba National Park . High price: On the black market in Asia, elephants tusks are valued at between £13,300 and £117,000 depending on their size. These tusks have been seized from poachers . The elephant tusks are helping fund murder, mutilation, rape, widespread abductions of children and adults, sexual slavery. Park rangers display tusks recovered in the park . Mr Lezhnev stressed that rangers at the national park are working hard to prevent poaching, but they need more help. Tracking poachers through the 3,000 sq-mile park is not only daunting, but dangerous, and rangers have been involved in deadly gun battles. 'A lot of the north region is not patrolled very well,' Mr Lezhnev said. 'The rangers are active but are severely under capacitated. 'To solve this problem, first of all the park rangers need significantly increased assistance. They have reported a pretty dramatic rise in poaching over the last decade.' Killings: Elephant numbers in the national park have fallen dramatically to about 2,400 from approximately 20,000, largely due to poaching . The LRA - a violent rebel group led by warlord Kony (right) - is renowned for being one of the most brutal forces in the world . One of the reasons for the increase in elephant poaching is likely to be the rise in the price of ivory, which is at a record high because of demand in parts of Asia, according to the Enough Project. On the black market, elephants tusks are valued at between £13,300 and £117,000 depending on their size. Since the 1980s, the Garamba elephant population has fallen to about 2,400 from approximately 20,000, largely due to poaching. Mr Lezhnev added: 'If not enough action is taken, we could see the entire elephant population eliminated from these regions in the next 10 years.' Help needed: Rangers (pictured) at Garamba are active, but need more help to tackle the problem, Mr Lezhnev said .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin joined tens of thousands of cheering supporters to mark one year since his takeover of Crimea - a move that shattered ties with Ukraine and the West. Putin appeared on stage today at a celebratory concert by the walls of the Kremlin to make an impassioned justification for seizing the Black Sea peninsula. Scroll down for video . Impassioned justification: Russian President Vladimir Putin told crowds the takeover of Crimea was to help and support 'our compatriots' An estimated 110,000 people attended the concert marking one year since Putin's takeover of Crimea . Putin looked energetic and spoke forcefully to the enthusiastic crowd, which gathered just off the Red Square near St Basil's Cathedral . Festivities: The concert was the culmination of days of highly-choreographed nationwide celebrations . 'We understood that in terms of Crimea it was not a matter of just some territory, however strategically important it is,' Putin told the flag-waving crowd before joining in a rendition of the national anthem. 'It was a matter of millions of Russian people, our compatriots, who needed our help and support.' Putin, who resurfaced Monday after a 10-day absence from public view that fueled intense speculation about his health and hold on power, looked energetic and spoke forcefully to the enthusiastic crowd, which gathered just off the Red Square near St Basil's Cathedral. A member of the crowd said: 'It means a lot to us, it was always ours after all. Our grandparents shed their blood for it' Women dance in the street and a Russian flag is waved in the background at the anniversary celebrations .

Missing: Putin resurfaced Monday after a 10-day absence from public view that fueled intense speculation about his health and hold on power . Bust unveiled in President Vladimir Putin's honour . Russian President Vladimir Putin has been immortalised in bronze. The bust will be installed near St Petersburg in May by Russian Cossacks. The statue portrays Putin as Roman emperor Julius Caesar. The concert in Moscow - believed to have been attended by 110,000 people  - was the culmination of days of highly-choreographed nationwide festivities to mark the anniversary. He ended his speech with three words: 'Long live Russia.' Despite condemnation from the West and Kiev that the radical redrawing of Europe's borders amounted to an illegal land grab, people at the event echoed the belief of many Russians that the annexation had corrected a historical injustice. 'It means a lot to us, it was always ours after all. Our grandparents shed their blood for it,' said security guard Alexei, 39. Putin signed a treaty claiming the Black Sea region of Crimea as Russian territory with Crimean prime minister Sergei Aksyonov two days after more than 97 per cent of Crimeans voted in favour of joining Russia in a disputed referendum on March 16 last year. The poll - unrecognised by the international community - was held under the eyes of elite Russian troops who had swarmed key sites across Crimea two weeks earlier in unmarked uniforms. Women wave the flag of Moscow during the celebrations, led by Russian president Vladimir Putin today .

Supporter: A man attending the celebrations holds a banner reading: 'Russia and Crimea are together forever' Putin claims he was forced to take over Crimea - home to Russia's key Black Sea Fleet - to protect ethnic Russians in the wake of the ouster of Ukraine's Kremlin-backed president Viktor Yanukovych. To many Russians, it was considered justified payback for Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev handing the region to Ukraine in 1954 in what was then a largely symbolic move since Ukraine and Russia were both part of the USSR. The move sent relations with Kiev and the West into a tailspin that has seen sanctions batter the Russian economy and Crimea placed under an effective economic blockade by Ukraine. A pro-Russian rebellion - which the West says has been orchestrated by Moscow - quickly also engulfed part of Ukraine's industrial east, sparking a nearly year-long conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives. Celebrations in Crimea: People also marked the anniversary on March 18, 2015 in Sevastopol, Crimea .

To many Russians, the takeover was considered justified payback for Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev handing the region to Ukraine in 1954 . Ukraine and the United States have said that they will never accept the annexation of Crimea by Russia. While some Russians celebrated having recovered Crimea, Amnesty International accused the region's pro-Kremlin authorities of an 'unrelenting campaign of intimidation to silence dissent' under Russia's rule. 'Since Russia annexed Crimea, the de facto authorities are using a vast array of bully boy tactics to crack down on dissent; a spate of abductions between March and September have prompted many vocal critics to leave the region,' John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International'sdirector for Europe and Central Asia, said. 'Those remaining face a range of harassment from authorities determined to silence their opponents,' he said in a statement.

"While most parents choose to enrol their children in cricket or tennis, a rising number have embraced the taboo of pole dancing as an after-school activity through a new brand of all-ages 'pole fitness' classes. The growing number of dance studios around Australia offering classes to children as young as four has sparked criticism from advocates against the sexualisation of young girls as well as the Australian Family Association, but many in the industry claim pole fitness is purely about exercise. 'Unfortunately in Australia pole is still associated for the majority as something that takes place in a strip club, [but that] is an adult stereotype that is placed on a perfectly legitimate workout,' Lisa Singh, who runs classes for children from her studio in Melbourne's east, told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . A growing number of dance studios around Australia are offering classes to children as young as four, including Justice Hailey (above) Lisa, a former showgirl in the exotic industry, owns and operates Vertical Fitness and offers pole fitness classes for children aged four to 15 years old, including her 11-year-old daughter Justice Hailey. While the studio also offers classes for adults, she maintains that none of the moves that the juniors are taught could be considered sexual and that the activity is a fantastic activity for children and teenagers. 'For a lot of parents it can be difficult to motivate teenagers to exercise and get involved in sports, pole is just another avenue that can be utilised to help build strength, stay healthy, active and build confidence,' she said. The classes, which require parental consent, usually involve a warm up, basic gymnastic routines, spins on the pole, and pole routines, depending on age and skills level. Lisa Singh (left), who owns Vertical Fitness in Melbourne, is pictured with her daughter, Justice (centre), and partner Ro . Justice's mother is a former showgirl in the exotic industry and said pole fitness was a sport . Lisa said there was a distinction to be drawn between pole dancing and pole fitness or 'sport', which focuses on the athletic benefits of the activity rather than performers who 'adapt a more exotic dance style choreography into their classes'. But Melinda Liszewski, spokesperson for Collective Shout, a grassroots movement against the sexualisation of girls, said the sport was still connected to its strip-club association, which could place children in a vulnerable position. 'If this is purely about fitness, then why wouldn't you choose gymnastics instead of placing them in a context which they don't have enough knowledge about to consent to?' Ms Liszewski said. 'Let them be kids, instead of participating in an adultified form of gymnastics. I would question why parents would choose to put their children in such a scenario if pole dancing was purely for fitness.' But Melinda Liszewski, spokesperson for Collective Shout, a grassroots movement against the sexualisation of girls, said the sport was still connected to its strip-club association . Terri Kelleher, spokesperson for the Australian Family Association, said the argument that pole fitness was purely an exercise based activity was not a new one . 'Teenagers can now enrol in burlesque and lap dancing classes. In the current context the uniform of pole dancing is high heels, feather boas, and spread legs,' she said. Terri Kelleher, spokesperson for the Australian Family Association, said the argument that pole fitness was purely an exercise based activity was not a new one. 'It is wonderful for children to exercise and get fit, and it's been argued that it increases body strength for at least four years now, but there are other, less sexualised, ways to get fit,' Ms Kelleher said. 'I do think it sexualised and if you have children competing publicly those moves are on display.' As well as running Vertical Fitness, Lisa also heads up the National Pole Fitness Championships in Australia, which introduced a junior category for the first time this year, in response to what she claims a growing acceptance of pole dancing in the mainstream. Pole dancing has seemingly exploded in Australia over the past decade, with many women- and men- embracing the activity for recreation, fitness, and almost everything in between. Lisa Singh (left) also heads up the National Pole Fitness Championships in Australia . The national championships have introduced a junior category for the first time this year, in response to what she claims a growing acceptance of pole dancing in the mainstream . Justice Hailey attends her mother's pole fitness classes and can contort herself into many different position on the pole . From hens nights and 21st birthdays, to circus performers and festival attractions, pole dancing has enjoyed a good run- indigenous dancer Matthew Shields auditioned for Australia's Got Talent in 2011 with his pole dancing routine. However Ms Kelleher said that while adults have the ability to make an informed decision about whether to engage in pole dancing, children are not in a position to do the same. 'It’s really up to the parent to decide if they want to enrol their children, but they need to be fully informed and empowered to make decisions for children when they’re too young,' she said. Lisa said that children were unaware of the sexualisation of pole and were more likely to be monkey-like in their movements, rather than imitate any racy dance moves they might see. 'Kids are not aware of the stereotypes some surround pole with and innocently participate in an activity which is fun, challenging and rewarding, it is the negative attitudes of adults who create the stereotypes stigma of kids doing pole,' she said. 'Any pole trick that is performed usually has its counterpart or similar in gymnastics or ballet. Pole originally has been performed in China and India for 100’s of years by predominantly men in circus and as a sport.' Chynna Roberts (above) began pole dancing when she was 15 years of age . Shayla Barlett runs Pole Catz Studio in NSW's Tweed Heads, which also offers teen pole dancing lessons and said that every studio she has been to has offered classes to children 12 years and over. 'I signed up at 17 years of age, so it’s not something I really think about. As long as we have a parent’s permission, with written consent, I do not think there is anything wrong with children or teenagers attending classes,' Shayla said. 'Pole dancing is a sport which requires athleticism, tremendous strength and skill. It is another art form of dance and expression, using a vertical pole as the apparatus,' she said. 'Ultimately, I would like to see stereotypical and preconceived ideas regarding pole dancing continue to be challenged, so pole dancing and the people who choose to do it, are respected for their talent, skills and the strength they have achieved.' Chynna said she was drawn to pole dancing after seeing a video and signed up immedidately . 'Pole fitness isn’t about being sexy and stripping, it’s about setting a goal and achieving it,' Chynna said . Chynna Roberts, now 18, began pole dancing lessons at Pole Catz at the age of 15, and said that when she tells people she does pole dancing they will often ask if it involves stripping, but that she doesn't see the sport as sexual. 'Pole fitness isn’t about being sexy and stripping, it’s about setting a goal and achieving it. In my opinion, pole sports does not sexualise young girls, we’re not promoting pole to be sexual we’re promoting it to be a fitness,' Chynna said. 'Personally, I think young girls should be allowed to do this sport, it is an amazing way to get fit. I think children and teens should have all rights to start at any age, there is no age limit to being fit.' 'Personally, I think young girls should be allowed to do this sport, it is an amazing way to get fit,' said Chynna . Pole Catz Studio in NSW's Tweed Heads offers classes for teenagers (2015 graduation concert above) Ms Lizsewski said that she believed studios were taking pole dancing and 'white washing' it of all connections to the sex industry and 're-branding as fitness'. 'Pole dancing still refuses to distance itself from the sex industry. There is a definite crossover, pole dancing is still featured at Sexpo, and I think it's really sinister to enrol kids in pole dancing classes because they have no idea of the context of it,' she said. 'If they are performing routines that are used by adults in connection to the sex industry that is a real burden on a child.' Ms Kelleher said that she was concerned that children engaging in pole fitness would not realise the impact of their movements, and that as they got older if the activity had been presented as a legitimate sport it could cause issues. 'I think there needs to be some caution exercised, because we can't control people's perceptions. I don't know how controlled the competitions are and if I had a daughter I'd be very concerned,' she said. 'It reminds me of beauty pageants, little girls all done up and makes me feel very uneasy. They gorgeous and completely innocent and unware of the message they are sending out into the ether.'","Pole fitness classes are now offered for children as young as four years old .

"Thailand officials are set to release a  two-minute animated video in Chinese to discourage tourists from taking their clothes off in inappropriate places when on holiday. The move follows a public outcry after an image of a woman going topless in the common area of the toilets at at Don Mueang international airport in Bangkok while getting changed went viral. Although the nation has a reputation for vibrant red light areas, public nudity is strictly forbidden in Thailand and even taking one's clothes off in the relative privacy of the ladies is apparently considered by locals to be offensive. The image that caused a public outcry of a woman changing in the toilets at a Bangkok airport . The woman in the picture is said to have been Chinese, although this cannot be verified, and while the incident raises barely an eyebrow with many - when shared on English speaking sites the woman who took the photo was vilified more than the woman changing - the Thai government felt moved to act. Another woman in the toilets took the above image and posted it to the Facebook page of CSI LA with the comment: 'Chinese tourists are terrible! I saw a group of Chinese tourists stripping in the ladies' room. Some were topless, some bottomless. So disgraceful!' The image, which has since been shared widely on social media platforms, shows only one woman and her reflection in the mirror - it has since been removed from the site. A spokesperson for Don Mueang airport confirmed the incident took place there but was keen to not blow the incident out of proportion. A spokesperson for Don Mueang international airport in Bangkok confirmed the incident happened there . 'In general, Chinese tourists in Thailand are well-behaved and have brought substantial revenue to the country. If we see something inappropriate, we'll issue a warning or impose a penalty on a case-by-case basis,' the airport stated. The Ministry of Tourism and Sports is going a step further with a video telling tourists how to behave in their country, and instructing them to keep their clothes on, set to appease public outrage. The video will be posted on travel blogs and tourism websites as soon as this week in a move they hope will go some way to ending some Thai locals' animosity towards Chinese visitors.

When it opened on 1 December 1887 the hotel had just 10 rooms and was a bungalow-style building overlooking the beach and the South China Sea. The property at 1 Beach Road was leased from its wealthy Arab owner to the Armenian Sarkies brothers, Tigran, Aviet and Arshak who transformed it from beach front home to hotel. In 1890 a pair of two storey wings with 22 new suites were added. The hotelier family enlisted the help of R. A.

"These stunning photos look like scenes from a make-believe magical kingdom from the hit Disney film Frozen. But they were snapped inside a real-life lair of ice by an intrepid photographer who was forced to abseil inside Iceland’s Breidamerkurjokull glacier. Nicolas Brousse’s effort was well worth it as he emerged from the popular tourist spot with breathtaking photos of an emerald blue world. Scroll down for video . Nicolas Brousse captured incredible scenes while exploring the interior of the Breidamerkurjokull glacier in south-east Iceland . It looks like the interior of a make-believe kingdom from the hit film Frozen, but the ice cavern is a popular destination for tourists . This image of an entrance to the ice cavern, snapped by Nicolas Brousse, makes it appear as though the sea is parting . The 27-year-old Frenchman’s snaps reveal intricate patterns and stunning colours, including black layers of volcanic ash, that make the rippled ceiling look like crystal and the icy floor look like a pane of glass. Nicolas' group went on the thrilling expedition with an experienced guide, and he used natural light as well as his camera’s flash to capture his incredible photos. Breidamerkurjokull is an outlet glacier of Vatnajökull, or the Vatna Glacier, which is one of the largest ice caps in all of Europe. There are several volcanoes located under the ice cap. Nicolas, who now lives in Malmo, Sweden, captured the images as he spent six months traversing Iceland and exploring its amazing scenery.

Nicolas, who lives in Malmo, Sweden, captured the images as he spent six months traversing Iceland and exploring its amazing scenery . ‘The black layers of volcanic ash trapped inside the ice is what makes Icelandic glaciers special - it creates beautiful black veins inside the ice.’ While he exploring the cave, Nicolas and his guide passed through a narrow galerie created by a stream that flows through the glacier in the summer time. He said: ‘The curvy shape of the tunnel and the blackness of it was really beautiful, and I knew it would make really nice pictures. Nicolas Brousse said the black layers of volcanic ash trapped inside the glacier create 'beautiful black veins inside the ice' The intrepid photographer and his group had to abseil into the glacier in order to explore the icy paradise inside . ‘In my work as a photographer I try to focus on the magnificence of what I experience in nature. ‘My goal is to show beauty as I perceive it and as it touches my feelings. ‘I am also a landscape architect and I so I am always observing the environment.’","Nicolas Brousse captured the breathtaking scenes inside Iceland’s Breidamerkurjokull glacier .

"These are the incredible shots of polar bears boxing that would not look out of place in the ring. Alberto Ghizzi Panizza, 39, looked on with amazement as the enormous mammals traded blows on the icy lands near Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada. The full-time photographer, from Parma, Italy, watched the drama unfold as the polar bears play fought for several minutes before throwing in the towel and going their separate ways. Scroll down for video . Polar bears, engaging in what looks like a round of knuckle boxing, were photographed in the province of Manitoba, in Canada . Italian photographer Alberto Ghizzi Panizza, aged 39, captured the stunning shots while visiting the remote northern area . Alberto said he was wary about keeping his distance from the giant mammals, but admitted he eventually had to put down the camera and simply appreciate the dramatic scenes with his own eyes. He said: 'It was one of the first polar bear encounters I'd ever seen. 'Seeing these huge, strong and incredible animals was a unique emotion for me. The bears had a brawl on the icy lands near Wapsuk National Park, in Manitoba, located along Hudson's Bay . The mammals traded blows as the photographer, from Parma, Italy, looked on in amazement as he snapped the action shots . The polar bears were reportedly play fighting for several minutes before going their separate ways . Alberto Ghizzi Panizza was wary about getting too close, but soon put down his camera so he could freely watch the incredible scene . 'They are truly amazing creatures. 'I was totally astonished when I saw them fighting with each other. 'While I was taking pictures of them I had to stop sometimes and look them with my own eyes. Panizza describes his reaction as 'being astonished' when he saw the bears fighting with each other in the clearing . One of the photographer's first-ever polar bear encounters, it made the experience even more special . The scene was so wonderful that Panizzi admits that it wasn't enough to simply look at it through a lens, he had to lower his camera .

"Sure, St Andrews is the home of golf and Monaco hosts the most glamorous race on the Formula One circuit, but the sporting world offers so much more than what can be seen on television. With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkajärvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkajärvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill . While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since. Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. To see it in action this year head to Cooper’s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25. The World Bog Snorkelling Championships in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales, will be held this year on August 30 . BOG SNORKELLING: LLANWRTYD WELLS, WALES . Much like the cheese rolling, those who compete in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships have a bit of a screw loose but also have a ball of a time in the process. The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13. Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali. The winner is the fastest to navigate a 180ft peat bog wearing a snorkel and flippers, the only means by which they can propel themselves. A competitor in the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel plays handball in the mud flats of the River Elbe . A women feels the cold of a hose as competitors attempt to wash away the mud after a day of competition . MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY . It’s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more. The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty. Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than €250,000. Camel wrestling has taken place in Turkey for more than 2,000 years and attracts crowds of more than 20,000 . CAMEL WRESTLING: SELCUK, TURKEY . Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years. More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984. The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey’s south coincides with mating season. A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary . PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA . This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you’d expect. Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965. Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they’re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply. When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies. Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar . NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA . The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators. The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours. Gregor Edmunds competes in the caber toss (left) and weight over a bar at Cowal Highland Gathering . HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND . As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894. Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar. Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap . SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND . One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though. However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair. VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks. Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31. The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy. With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.","Traditional sports in Scotland's Highland Games and Mongolia's Naadam .

"It plunges 586ft underground - twice the height of the Statue of Liberty - and the interior has been described as 'pitch black'. But these adventurers have descended into Fantastic Pit in Ellison's Cave, Georgia, famed as the deepest pit in America. Intrepid explorer Amy Hinkle and a group including Shane Streetman and Elliot Hellman tackled the pit  last month and were able to produce a stunning set of photographs from their challenge. Scroll down for video . Fantastic Pit in Ellison's Cave, Georgia, USA, is 586ft deep - almost twice the height of the Statue of Liberty . The climb is strictly for the experienced, and the equipment as well as the training for the descent has to be of the highest standard . The pit is part of a 12-mile-long underground system, has been on the bucket list of the explorers for some time . Amy revealed the pit, which is part of a 12-mile-long underground system, has been on her bucket list for some time. In order to capture her spectacular shots she carries a lightweight camera kit and travels with a lighting assistant, Brian Stoltz. Amy, 28, from Huntsville, Alabama, said: 'I've been doing this for quite a few years now so the depth doesn't bother me as much. 'I just think to myself 'yes, that's a deep pitch-black hole in the floor'. Fantastic Pit, that is taken on as a challenge by many thrill-seekers, is almost twice as high as the Statue of Liberty . One of the group, Amy Hinkle, insists if proper training is done, 'caving is a relatively safe sport' Climber Ken Williams gets himself warmed up, before descending the 586 feet of America's deepest pit . Intrepid explorer Amy Hinkle (pictured) and a group including Shane Streetman and Elliot Hellman tackled the pit last month . 'We communicate via radio so I can direct the lighting for the shot. 'Caving is a relatively safe sport if it is done with proper training, gear and experience.' Also in the area is Incredible Pit, the second deepest pit in the US at 440ft. Due to the technical and dangerous nature of Ellison's Cave, it is generally explored by only the most experienced and capable cavers. Beginning cavers  are severely discouraged from entering and negotiating the cave. There have been a number of deaths, largely due to hypothermia, on various climbs in Ellison Cave . The vertical sections of the cave require extensive knowledge and practice of single rope technique climbing, including practice on heavy ropes and in wet environments. There have sadly been a number of fatalities concerning Ellison Cave. On March 10, 1999, a caver climbing the Incredible pit became tangled in multiple ropes and was stranded 140 feet off the cave floor underneath water falling into the pit. The incident resulted in fatality due to hypothermia. The vertical sections of the cave require extensive knowledge and practice of single rope technique climbing . The entrance to the pit is very deceiving, and you wouldn't believe it hides an underground world . Then on February 12, 2011 two University of Florida students died of hypothermia after becoming stuck on rope near a waterfall close to the bottom of a 120 foot pit. On May 26, 2013 a caver was rescued and hospitalized after falling 40 feet in the cave. It took 21 hours to evacuate the caver, including hauling up Fantastic Pit.","Fantastic Pit in Ellison's Cave, Georgia, USA, is 586ft deep - twice the height of the Statue of Liberty .

"An expansive replica of the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave is scheduled to open to the public next month in France. The original Chauvet Cave is famous for its 36,000-year-old art, which dates back to prehistoric times and is believed to be the oldest in the world. In order to recreate the cave and its drawings with accuracy, 3-D modelling was used and some 6,000 digital images were overlapped in developing sketches. An expansive replica of the Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave is scheduled to open to the public soon in southern France . In total, £45million ($67million) has been spent to create the replica cave complex, which is situated inside a larger educational exhibition. Located one and a half miles from the original caves, construction began on the project in 2012 and is finally expected to be completed by April. The Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave, discovered in 1994, is the length of two-and-a-half football fields and covers 68,000 square feet. Its five enormous chambers are not replicated to exact original proportions, but greater focus is given to highlighting the cave's impressive prehistoric art.

"Staring at a scrawled picture of a bright orange pumpkin surrounded by purple and pink witches, Andrew is nearly moved to tears. ‘When he’s drawing I see my son going in and out of his crayon box like 50 times and now I see why,’ he says, his voice quiet with pride and his mouth turned up at the corners. One of 300 million people worldwide, Andrew has colour blindness, meaning he has never been able to truly appreciate his son’s sketches. Scroll down for video . A moving video shows colour blind people given new glasses by EnChroma which allow them to see colour for the first time. Keith is pictured, amazed by the sight of wool in rainbow colours . The glasses can assist with colour blindness, a condition that affects 300 million people worldwide. Andrew is pictured avidly staring at a colourful display . He is trialling new glasses which correct the condition, allowing him to experience normal vision for the first time in his life. Valspar, a US- based paints company, have released a video showing colour blind people using the glasses for the first time. In the film, Andrew is later seen staring at a warm sunset. He laughs with joy, exclaiming ‘Is this what you guys see every day?’ EnChroma, who manufacture the glasses featured in the film, claim the spectacles allow wearers to ‘gain faster and more accurate discrimination of colours such as in traffic signals and signs’. They can also ‘improve confidence with colour naming’, and increase the perception of detail and depth in coloured objects. But best of all, EnChroma says the glasses give people who view the world in varying shades of grey the ‘profound experience of a bright and vivid world of colour’. Andrew is pictured looking at his son's drawings and being able to see the colours for the first time. He said: ‘When he’s drawing I see my son going in and out of his crayon box like 50 times and now I see why’ The EnChroma glasses allow people with the condition to distinguish between colours. For colour blind people, red and black may look the same. Christopher is shown viewing flowers with the glasses . EnChroma says the glasses give people who view the world in varying shades of grey the ‘profound experience of a bright and vivid world of colour’. Atlee is pictured staring at a sunset . Robert Sprujit, a perceptual psychologist featured in the video, said: ‘Colour blindness is a situation where, because your eyes are different from someone else’s eyes you don’t see the world in the same way. ‘Commonly, red and green don’t look different, they look the same. ‘If there’s a colour filter, like glasses,  that can separate colours they suddenly can see red and green again. Donald McPherson, co-founder of EnChroma, added: ‘There’s nothing wrong with the wiring. ‘The problem exists in the eye, with the photopigments. So Valspar is working with us at EnChroma to bring colour to everyone. ‘We developed these glasses to enable colour blind people to see colour for the first time in their lives’ Colour blindness, also known as colour vision deficiency, is where a person finds it difficult to distinguish between different colours. For example, completely different colours like red and black might appear the same. In most cases, colour blindness is inherited, but it can also develop as the result of a pre-existing health condition, or as a side effect of certain medicines. It occurs due to an abnormality of the retina, the layer of cells at the back of the eye that are sensitive to light. The cone cells in the retina are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. For people with normal vision, the brain compares the signals from all three cones, enabling a person to see the colour of an object. But for people who are colour blind, one or more cones will be missing or won't function normally, which means they will be unable to see the full spectrum of colours.

But for people who are colour blind, one or more cones will be missing or won't function normally, which means they will be unable to see the full spectrum of colours. For example, one of the cones in the eye will absorb too much red light, creating a phenomenon called ‘spectral overlap’. EnChroma says spectral overlap is analogous to how to radio stations played at the same time might bleed together. The two streams of information conflict, and the more the signals overlap, the greater the extent of the colour blindness. The glasses, which cost upwards from $349.95 (£235), work by correcting the overlap, separating the signals and providing better perception of colour. However, EnChroma adds that the glasses are not a cure for color blindness – it is a product that can assist with it.

Kalon: I wanted to go into the military and trying to be a navy sail and that’s where I found out I was colour blind. It changed the direction I was going it, I stayed in the military but I wasn’t able to pursue being a navy seal. I’ve always wanted to see the colours of the flag, but to actually be able to see and distinguish the red clearly. Before, red looked like a brown to me. It’s hard to even put into words how to describe seeing it for the first time. That alone is priceless to me. The flag has a lot of importance for me. Christopher: I found out when I was in elementary school, in third grade. The teacher had crayons out in school and she asked me to identify the crayons and I couldn’t and that was the first experience of realising I was colour blind. I looked at it as a curse. For me, it was a setback. You have goals, you have things you want to achieve and being colour blind holds you back. I wanted to join the marine forces, but because of my colour vision deficiency that’s not the door. I can’t work in special ops, I can’t work in combat. With the glasses it makes it a lot better. I’ve had the opportunity to see colour in a way I never have in my entire life, so for me that’s exciting. Atlee: I think my colour blindness was discovered in kindergarten. I was drawing my flowers brown and my oceans black and skies were purple. I was officially diagnosed. I think its 0.5 per cent that a girl is actually colour blind. When I used the glasses I thought ‘Is this what it really looks like to you guys?’. For a second I felt sad, like I’d been missing out on how vibrant it all is. But then I thought how cool it is that I get the opportunity to see the world in a different way, and its special to me. Keith: When I smell roses I think of my mother. When I was a little boy we had a rosebush in the back yard and it was yellow with red tips. And I still see it today and I think ‘it’s so beautiful’. But I think ‘what was I not seeing in that rose’. If I were to see that rose and there were other colours there I would think that was kind of poetic. On the first day of school she would take me to the back yard and she would cut me a rose to give to my teacher. What if saw that rose and I saw all these colours that I never saw before? I think it would be in a way like my mother was speaking again to me.","Colour blindness, or colour vision deficiency, affects around 300 million people worldwide .

These incredible images snapped by Russian photography group AirPano depict some of the world's most iconic cities as round planets. Using a pioneering method of aerial photography, plus some skillful manipulation in Photoshop - known in the trade as 'stereographic projection' - each location can now be seen at a full 360-degree angle, with jaw-dropping results. Manhattan in New York City as you've never seen it before. The images were taken by Russian photographic group AirPano . The stunning harbour in Sydney, Australia and the world-famous Sydney Opera House look like they're at the centre of the world . The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco looks mystical shrouded by the famous fog that frequently descends on the region . Think you know Rome in Italy? The Spanish Steps look almost unrecognisable in this stunning aerial shot . The sweeping panoramas were taken over the space of eight years using helicopters, airplanes, dirigibles, hot air balloons, helium balloons and even  radio-controlled drones to capture the images from staggering heights. Images of San Francisco, Berlin, Venice and Sydney are among the collection, which show hundreds of miles of landscape in some instances. Shanghai in China is full of surprises in this jaw-dropping photograph. The Aurora Tower and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower can be seen here . The winding canals of Venice, Italy were one of the scenes snapped by AirPano over a period of eight years . Sergey Semenov, the 32-year-old coordinator behind the project, said: 'To make these images, firstly we create aerial spherical panoramas, but this is not an easy task. 'We often photograph from a drone, but we also photograph from helicopters, airplanes, dirigibles, hot air balloons and helium balloons. 'Since the beginning of the project, AirPano team has created panoramas of the most interesting and significant places and cities of the Earth. The Octavio Frias de Oliveira Bridge in Sao Paulo, Brazil looks like something out of a film set in this photograph . This jaw-dropping shot of the Miami River in Miami, Florida has been created using skillful manipulation in Photoshop . The sun creates a magnificent glow in this image of the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City . 'The only problems we have are with permission usually, in some places, like Stonehenge, it's strictly forbidden to fly near the monument. 'We plan to visit many more cities yet, including the likes of Indonesia, Japan and Great Britain in the next three months.' This image of Wolf Point in Chicago - snapped by a group of Russian photographers - has glowing rings thanks to the position of the sun . The historic Reichstag building is clearly visible in this image of the Platz der Republik (Square of the Republic) in Berlin . The Incredible rooftop infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore can be spotted in this shot of Marina Bay . In this image of Madrid, the Plaza Mayor appears to be a cavernous opening in the middle of the Spanish capital . You probably don't have a holiday snap quite like this one from Cannes, in the French Riviera . Plaza del Ayuntamiento in Valencia, Spain looks overwhelmed by the sprawling city in this 360-degree shot .","Jaw-dropping aerial photographs were taken by Russian photography group AirPano .

"Hopping mad or toadly awesome? A Japanese nature museum is launching a bizarre menu to celebrate the opening of their Deadly Poison Exhibition. The 'Frog Menu' signature dish will feature a deep fried amphibian, sandwiched between a black bun burger, complete with legs dangling out the side. Guests will be able to see 25 live different poisonous animals from around the world at Orbi Yokohama, in South Toyko, before heading to the cafe to devour a frog of their own. Scroll down for video . Tastes like chicken? Frog burgers to be the dish of the day at Orbi Yokohama's new poisonous animals exhibition . Frog legs have long been a delicacy in France, watch this space to see if the burger variety follows suit . The limited edition dish can be bought  for the tempting price of 1,000 yen (around £4.50). Thankfully the frog is less toxic than its exhibition counterparts, and the black bun can be attributed to a bamboo charcoal dye. Orbi Yokohama is not the first place to use the dark bun, with Burger King in Japan launching a range  in 2014. If the protruding legs of this dish are enough to put you off, guests can always sample the tamer Frog Egg Sweet for 580 yen (£3.17). This dessert dish incorporates a family theme, with a frog and 'spawn' - thankfully only made out of almond tofu and jelly. Sega and the Sunshine Aquarium have teamed up to bring the exhibition to the museum in Yokohama from March 21 to May 17. The Frog Egg Sweet dessert includes a frog and eggs. The dish costs 580 yen (£3.17) and thankfully is only made out of almond tofu and jelly. Other poisonous animals at the exhibition include spiders, stingrays, puffer fish and other animals. Admission to Orbi is 600 yen (£3.28), frog burger not included. Bon appetit!

"Drive-through zoos are popular for allowing people to get closer to animals in their natural habitat. But one lady got a little bit closer than she would have wanted to an over-friendly buffalo with a very long tongue. Filmed at Olympic Game Farm in Washington, the video begins with a couple of buffalo pursuing a car at a canter. That's close enough! The buffalo pursues the car until it gets a mouthful of bread from the lady . A lady holds bread from the window as they approach and without warning one sticks its whole head into the car to take the food. Recoiling as a large tongue winds itself out of its mouth, the squealing woman drops the bread, which is swallowed immediately, before returning to get another piece. Spotting the bread the buffalo puts its head back through the car’s window, making the woman scream in excited panic once more. Without warning the buffalo sticks it head inside the car window, causing the lady to recoil . Keeping up with the car, the buffalo winds its long tongue around the food and licks the lady as it devours it . Another lady in the car shouts: ‘Windows up guys, windows up,’ as the animal looks around for its next bite. And after receiving its final piece of bread, the mammal extends its head even further in through the window to give the woman a great big lick. Speaking online, the filmmaker wrote: ‘This buffalo chased and licked us while [we were] feeding him and the other deer in the park.’ Extending its head through the car window, the buffalo goes in search of more food and gives the lady a big lick . Olympic Game Farm was first opened to the public in 1972 and initially only offered guided tours. Now a drive-through zoo, customers are allowed to feed animals including buffalo, deer, elk, bears, yak and llamas with bread.","Two buffalo pursue car at a canter in search of bread at Washington zoo .

"A Swedish football team has told of how they narrowly escaped death after a last-minute decision against booking their players on Germanwings Flight 4U9525. Four Lufthansa subsidiary flights left Barcelona around the same time on Tuesday morning and Division 1 team Dalkurd FF, from Borlänge, central Sweden, had players on three of them. The team had initially planned to travel on Flight 4U9525 to Düsseldorf, but instead split the team over the three remaining flights from Barcelona, via Germany. Scroll down for video . Swedish Division 1 team Dalkurd FF had initially planned to travel on Flight 4U9525 to Düsseldorf . When the Dalkurd FF delegation of 29 players and staff landed, they found out that the fourth flight had crashed, and the passengers next to them at check in a few hours earlier had died. All 144 passengers, including two babies and 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives. The Airbus A320 ploughed into the mountainside in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany at more than 400mph. 'We were supposed to have been on that flight. We checked in with all of the passengers. It's surreal,' Dalkurd FF's sports chief Adil Kizil told Aftonbladet. 'When we got to the airport in Barcelona there were four  flights leaving that time, flying north over the Alps. All 144 passengers, including two babies, 16 teenagers and six crew members lost their lives . Video from the scene of the crash shows debris of the Germanwings Airbus A320 at the crash site . Crews in the first helicopter to reach the site said they had seen no survivors and found chunks of plane . 'Four flights and we had players on three of them. Let's just say we were very lucky.' Dalkurd FF, formed in 2004 by Kurdish immigrants, play in Sweden's Division 1, the third level  of Swedish football. The team had been on a week-long training camp in Barcelona and were flying home. Mr Kizil told the newspaper how they had tried to fit the entire team on the Germanwings flight, but that the connection time in Düsseldorf to continue their journey home to Sweden was too long. Instead they split the team onto the three other  flights, with one group flying via München and two others via Zürich. Mr Kizil said the players are still shocked, and that their thoughts are with the families of the victims. 'All the people on that plane were at the same check-in as us. We also flew with a subsidiary to Lufthansa, so everyone went to the same gates.'

"Devon Still shared some amazing news about his daughter Leah on Wednesday. The Cincinnati Bengals star wrote that 4-year-old Leah, who has been bravely battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma for the past year, was told that her cancer is in remission. 'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram. Scroll down for video . Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Wednesday that his daughter Leah's cancer was in remisison . Leah has been been battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma since last June, and captured the hearts of millions as she fights the disease . 'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram . He went on to say; 'After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her.' He then went on to thank everyone from the doctors who helped his daughter to those who wrote her notes and everyone who shared her story. Leah's journey has been followed by millions since she first began receiving treatment last June at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In September she had a tumor removed from her abdomen, and last month received what could be her final round of chemotherapy. She has also stayed remarkably active, walking in the Levi's Kids fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February and appearing in a music video for the song Truly Brave, a mashup of the Sara Bareilles song Brave and the Cyndi Lauper classic True Colors that was commissioned by Today anchor Hoda Kotb to raise funds for pediatric cancer research. In addition, she and her father have written a children's book to help other kids that are going through cancer treatment. Leah and her dad have also written a book that aims to help children who are battling the disease . The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad during the preseason so he could spend time with his daughter and receive their medical insurance . Leah's MBIG scans showed no active disease in her body, though the family is still waiting on an MRI and bone biopsy results . Last November, the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Still jerseys. The team also honored Leah during a ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game since she had begun her treatment - and see her father play. The Bengals also helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. And they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage. June 2, 2014 and March 25, 2015 are days I will remember for the rest of my life. As everyone probably knows, June 2nd was the day doctors walked into the waiting room to tell me my daughter had cancer. It was the most devastating day of my life. March 25th , however, is feeling like the best day of my life. Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION! After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her. It was not easy but every day, and every treatment Leah fought like hell and kicked cancers butt! I'm so proud and blessed to call her my daughter. She has made an impact on me and on the world, at the age of four, that I can only wish to make in a lifetime. Thank you to my family and friends for the support through all those tough days. Thank you to everyone who has sent a letter to give Leah and our family motivation to keep fighting, a toy that helped Leah get through her days in the hospital, and more importantly a prayer that helped God hear our cries for healing. Thank you to the doctors at CHOP for putting together the best plan of action for my daughter. Thank you to Child Life members Sarah, Laura, and Lindsey for really turning what could be a scary place into a place where Leah would enjoy going because she knew she would have fun with you guys. Thank you to the Bengals for taking on my situation and standing by me and my family and for helping to raise money to fight pediatric cancer. To every media outlet and persons that helped raise much needed awareness, thank you. Leah is not done with treatments yet. She still needs more to make sure the cancer cells do not return and to build back up her immune system and other damage from the chemo but I know my little warrior will get through it!","Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Wednesday that his daughter Leah's cancer is in remission .

"American socialite Justin Ross Lee is the star of an outrageous feature video where he is portrayed as a Frank Abagnale style travel industry hack. Basing himself on the fraudster who posed as a pilot and inspired the Hollywood movie Catch Me If You Can, the socialite has shared a host of controversial hacks on how he secures upgrades and better hotel rooms when travelling. His video tips, which can only be taken as tongue-in-cheek, appears to show the young globetrotter adopting multiple personas as he travels in order to achieve elite status at airports. Justin claims that he uses the first class lounge as an office space because there is WIFI, free food and unlimited alcohol . He claims that he doesn’t scam airlines, but instead takes advantage of where there are holes before referring to himself as an ‘international Jew jetter’ – a term he uses to describe his lifestyle. He then states that people find serenity in places like central park and that he finds his grounded at JFK airport. ‘I use the first class lounge as an office space. There’s WIFI, free food, unlimited alcohol,’ he says. Justin has a tip for getting your seat moved during a flight and it involves chutz pah and a bag of peanuts . ‘Why spend money on an office space when I can just come here?’ It is at this point that the socialite begins revealing hacks by explaining to the viewer what it is they have to do if they want to stay in the first class lounge for free all day. And, according to Justin, it’s as simple as buying a refundable ticket to get past security and cancelling it at the end of the day. The American socialite compares himself to Frank Abagnale, the con-artist the film ‘Catch Me If You Can’ is centred around . Depart at arrivals . According to Justin the best way to arrival at an airport is to do so via arrivals. This way there is no queuing while getting in and you are only required to use a single escalator once through the doors. Never lose your luggage . It’s the age-old problem with airlines, the worry of losing your luggage. But Justin has an inadvisable way of supposedly ensuring that doesn't happen. He believes that by simply packing a gun – not necessarily a real one – and then declaring it will ensure the airline keeps a close eye on baggage throughout the journey. Get your seat moved . Now on the plane, Justin has a tip for getting away from someone you don’t want to be sitting next to. Involving a prop this time, the socialite recommends crushing a packet of peanuts, feigning an allergy and simply requesting to be moved. Upgrade your room . So you’ve arrived at the hotel but you don’t like your room. Justin has the solution. By doing ‘at least 45 minutes worth of research’ the socialite looks for the most empowered, weakest link among the staff and appears to prey upon them with complaints until they break. Business cards . Finally Justin recommends getting yourself an array of business cards, which show that you work for a number of different businesses. This way if there is a particular offer for that company you are eligible for it. Next the socialite compares himself to Frank Abagnale by suggesting that he has ‘chutz pah’ (shameless audacity) just like him. The video concludes with Justin reading through some of the hate mail he has received before stating that he is doing something right because he has given them something to talk about. And noting that he would hate to be normal. The video shows Justin supposedly talking to the 'most empowered, weakest link' of a hotel to instigate a room upgrade . Justin Ross Lee is an internet celebrity and socialite who in 2011 founded Pretentious Pocket, a silk pocket square business. Born in Scarsdale, New York, Justin attended private preparatory high school Brewster Academy. He holds an undergraduate degree in entrepreneurship as well as a Master's Degree in Business from University of Hartford.

"It is the dream of many young children, the chance to be sheriff of their very own Wild West town. And it seems wannabe cowboys can make that dream come true after an entire Wild West town went up for sale in California, with a guide price of $900,000 (£600,000). For buyers who want to recreate their very own Western, the town boasts a general store, a saloon and a jail, as well as a real residence. The Wild West Town in California even has an on-site barbershop, but you might have to hire in a professional . With the ticket office temporarily closed, there doesn't look like being any outward train journeys out of the Wild West . The two-bedroom house is ready to move in, and is decked out in beautiful Wild West memorabilia . On John Wayne Avenue stands the General Store, where you can tie your horse up outside and get the day's necessities . And wannabe sheriffs can also set up home in the town as there's a house two-bedroom house ready to move into. The town in Valley Center, San Diego, has been used for advertising and movies and is now up for grabs to be turned into a family home. All of the buildings - including a blacksmiths, a barbershop and a print shop have been furnished with Western antiques collected over the last 60 years. And the town's residential property has a stone fireplace and two wood burning stoves. The interior is linked back to the days of rodeo and gunfights of the Wild West, but the furniture is exquisite and tasteful . Those who didn't obey the strict laws in the Wild West often met a grisly end - thankfully this graveyard is just an added 'decoration' The Wild West Town in California will cost $900,000 (£600,000) and will provide a truly unique living experience . A quick dust around and you could make this your sheriff's office in the town found in Valley Center, San Diego . Valley Center is well in tune with its Wild West history. Once a year, parts of the town are closed down for an event known as Valley Center Western Days. This event is traditionally held over the Memorial Day weekend and consists of a community parade, a festival at the Valley Center Community Center and the Valley Center Stampede Rodeo. Jalhouse Rock! For anyone who misbehaves, they may find themselves 'in the slammer', but at least they will get a bed to sleep on . On taking over the town, the ticket office can finally open for business at Bear Valley Station . After a hard day riding your horse around the plains, what better way to relax than have a beer in your own saloon . The interior of the bar is a tribute to the Wild West, but you might have to share a table with the Indian chief seated left . For the weeks leading up to the event, local organizations put on western-themed events and fundraisers. So there's no excuse after buying this property to be caught short when getting involved in the celebrations.","The town in Valley Center, San Diego, has been used for advertising and movies and is now up for grabs .

"It’s the type of encounter that can send panic through a herd, but this fearless impala refused to turn and run after a crocodile popped out of the water in front of it. At one point the predator’s snout was just inches from the impala's nose, but the bold gazelle didn’t back down as it casually sipped from a watering hole. Tourist Graham Hewer snapped the jaw-dropping scene as he visited Kruger National Park in South Africa. Photographer Graham Hewer captured the jaw-dropping encounter during a visit to Kruger National Park in South Africa . The 29-year-old said the imapala simply walked away from the crocodile without giving it a second thought. The crocodile was close enough to attack the impala, but its would-be prey remained calm and seemed oblivious to the fact that it was at death’s door. Graham’s series of photos show a herd  sipping from the lake as they keep a watchful eye on a group of much larger crocodiles nearby. The bold impala survived the strange meeting, which photographer Graham Hewer puts down to the crocodile not feeling hungry . His snaps then show the lone impala drinking from the watering hole, moments before its encounter with the crocodile. The final photo shows the crocodile alone, with its razor-sharp teeth visible inside its gaping mouth. Graham, a self-taught photographer from the South African capital of Pretoria, revealed he watched on in suspense, expecting the crocodile to kill the impala almost instantly. After getting its fill from the lake the impala simply walked away from the crocodile without giving it a second thought . But bizarrely it survived the strange meeting - which he puts down to the croc not feeling hungry. He said: ‘I got the camera ready just in time as the impala made their way towards the water. ‘One got close to a crocodile laying in the shallow water so I was expecting a straight kill. Graham Hewer's photos show a herd sipping from the lake as they keep a watchful eye on a group of large crocodiles . ‘But the impala and the crocodile just had a face-to-face meeting. ‘All the people who have seen this image are amazed to hear the impala survived this face-off. ’That's what fascinates me about photographing animals - its unpredictable, you never know what they will do.’","Photographer Graham Hewer captured the jaw-dropping scene at Kruger National Park in South Africa .

"A group of tourists to the Bahamas enjoyed one of the country’s unique attractions when they were greeted on a boat by a herd of swimming pigs looking for a snack. An amusing video shows the pigs leaving the beach and paddling through the crystal clear water as they make their way towards the boat. The pigs swim to the side of the vessel and jockey for the best position as the tourists squeal in excitement. The two pigs swim over to the tourist boat and begin treading water around it before begging for food . With the prospect of food and none as of yet being provided, the two animals becoming increasingly demanding as they tread the shallow water. They soon jump onto the edge of the boat, hang their trotters over the side of it and begin begging for food from those on board. Eventually the two pigs receive food from the people on the boat and continue to hang onto the side of it with their mouths wide open in anticipation. The video concludes with the two pigs – with satisfied appetites – returning to the beach. Jumping up onto the boat the two pigs hang their trotters over the side of it in search of a snack . There they are greeted by even more of their kind and collectively make their way over to another boat in the hope of receiving even more food. Discussing the encounter, the filmmaker wrote online: ‘They nearly turned our boat over.’ The video was taken on Big Major Cay – known locally as Pig Beach – on Exuma, a district of the Bahamas that consists of over 360 islands. Becoming more vocal, the two pigs hang off the side of the boat and demand that they be fed . Eventually the pigs' cries for food are answered and they are fed by a person on the boat . There are many theories as to how the pigs arrived at the island. Some believe that a group of sailors dropped the pigs off at the beach with the intention of coming back to cook and eat them, but they didn't return. Others say that the pigs survived a shipwreck and managed to swim to shore. And perhaps the most cynical and least romantic suggestion is that the pigs are part of a business scheme to attract tourists to the Bahamas.","The pigs swim through the crystal clear sea and tread water by the boat .

Pippa had been in talks to join American TV station NBC as a 'special correspondent', but negotiations for the £400,000 role disintegrated after she was deemed not to have a 'breezy' enough manner . The Vanity Fair Contributing Editor and Ocado magazine columnist, who was catapulted to fame following her sister's wedding to Prince William in 2011, has long been keen to make a name for herself in the U.S. But a source close to NBC says Pippa’s screen trial, which can be watched online, was a flop. In the clip the writer looked uncomfortable as she danced with an aged local in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for no ascertainable reason. And came across as ‘a bit grand, awkward and bored, rather than enthusiastic’, according to one insider. ‘Cringe-worthy’ said another . Not that you would know it from her December 2014 column for the Spectator. Excitedly describing her visit to Wyoming, Pippa gushed about her experience of line-dancing and talked of the 'stunning' mountain scenery. 'Wyoming is real cowboy country,' she continued. 'Everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big, non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards.' Not one to claim the laurels undeserved, she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. 'It’s easy to get carried away with the whole free-riding atmosphere. My dance partner was about 80, and I did my best to keep up,' she continued.

NBC apparently agreed. Ultimately NBC, it is said, was keen not to repeat the expensive mistake it made a couple of years back with Chelsea Clinton. They were concerned that by spending a lot of money on a famous-by-association personality with no apparent aptitude for TV presenting, they would look gullible when that person failed to produce ratings.
