"Scotland's UKIP leader is today facing calls to resign after he compared the country’s only Muslim minister to the convicted terrorist Abu Hamza. In conversation with the Scottish Daily Mail, David Coburn, who was elected as an MEP last year, referred to ‘Humza Yousaf, or as I call him, Abu Hamza’. Mr Yousaf, the SNP’s Minister for Europe and International Development, said the ‘Islamophobic’ comment was one of the worst insults he had ever received. David Coburn (left), Scotland's Ukip leader, is facing calls to resign after he compared the country's only Muslim minister, Humza Yousaf (right), to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza . He has written to party leader Nigel Farage to call for Mr Coburn to be expelled and is also planning to complain to the EU Ombudsman and European Parliament president Martin Schulz. The row comes in the same week that Mr Farage was embroiled in a racism row, after he suggested most of Britain’s race relations laws should be scrapped. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said comparing her colleague to a ‘convicted terrorist’ was ‘reprehensible’ and said Mr Coburn should ‘face consequences for that’ and be kicked out of UKIP. Last night, Mr Coburn – who is also standing to be the MP for Falkirk in May’s General Election – offered his ‘sincerest apologies’ for his comment. Ironically, earlier this year he sparked controversy by branding the SNP a ‘racist party’. Hook-handed Abu Hamza was earlier this year handed a life sentence by a New York judge for supporting terrorism. Abu Hamza was this year handed a life sentence by a New York judge for supporting terrorism . The hate cleric was convicted last May of multiple charges, including hostage-taking and plotting to set up a terrorism training camp in America. His trial followed his extradition from the UK to the US in 2012 at the end of an eight-year legal battle. Mr Coburn’s comment was made during a telephone conversation, in which he spoke about his appearance on BBC Two show The Big Immigration Debate on Tuesday. He claimed that Mr Yousaf was supposed to be on the show, and said: ‘Humza Yousaf, or as I call him, Abu Hamza, didn’t seem to turn up.’ Challenged by the Mail during the conversation, Mr Coburn said the remark was intended to be private. However, there had been no prior agreement that the discussion was off-the-record. Glasgow-born Mr Yousaf was yesterday alerted to the comment by the Mail, and replied: ‘I am utterly appalled, disgusted and hurt by the comments allegedly made by David Coburn MEP. ‘This is Islamophobia of the worst kind. If this was shouted at a Muslim on the street none of us would tolerate it, the fact this abuse has come from an elected member of the European Parliament is completely unacceptable. 'Nigel Farage has been plagued by accusations of leading a racist party and this outburst from David Coburn MEP shows that UKIP are not just a party with a few rotten apples but rotten to the core. ‘If Nigel Farage is serious about UKIP being a party that will not tolerate xenophobia in any form then I expect David Coburn to be expelled from UKIP immediately and have written to Nigel Farage in that vein.’ He added: ‘David Coburn has been exposed making Islamophobic remarks and should do the honourable thing and resign.’ Mr Yousaf has written to party leader Nigel Farage (right) to call for Mr Coburn (left) to be expelled and is also planning to complain to the EU Ombudsman and European Parliament president Martin Schulz . First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (left) said comparing her colleague Humza Yousaf (right) to a ‘convicted terrorist’ was ‘reprehensible’ and said Mr Coburn should be kicked out of UKIP . His letter to Mr Farage states: ‘UKIP has been plagued by a number of incidents where senior party members have made xenophobic, racist or Islamophobic remarks. 'I am sure you will wish to distance UKIP from such attitudes and I note you have taken disciplinary action against those found to make such prejudiced remarks in the past. ‘I therefore call on you to immediately suspend David Coburn while you investigate this matter and if he is indeed found to guilty of making these remarks then I expect he will be expelled from UKIP.’ First Minister Miss Sturgeon said: ‘There seems to be no depths below which Mr Coburn will not sink. Nigel Farage should remove him from his party.’ A UKIP spokesman said: ‘Mr Coburn’s comments were made in the spirit of jest and he thought it off the record but they were in very bad taste. He has obviously caused offence and he is very sorry to have done so. ‘He has written to Mr Yousaf offering his sincerest apologies.’ David Coburn (right) pulls a face behind Labour MEP's Catherine Stihler (centre) and David Martin (right) David Coburn has managed to offend politicians from most parties in his short tenure as an MEP. The 56-year-old has claimed Alex Salmond would be ‘hanging from a lamppost’ if there had been a vote for independence, has described Nicola Sturgeon as ‘Helmet Hairdo’, was overhead on a train calling then Scots Labour leader Johann Lamont a 'fishwife' and dismissed the Greens as a 'cult, like scientology'. Last year, the MEP - who is openly gay – sparked controversy when he claimed same-sex weddings only mattered to 'some queen who wants to dress up in a bridal frock and dance up the aisle.' Born in Glasgow, Mr Coburn was educated at Glasgow High School, where he was a milk monitor and later became head boy. He went on to study law at Leeds University but failed to receive a degree. Moving to London, he found a job in the City as a trader and set up an antiques dealership. Prior to his election victory last year, his main source of income was an air freight business he set up, which he was uncharacteristically reticent about when quizzed by the Mail at the time - refusing even to reveal the name of the company. Certainly, not all of his business ventures are successful. He once ran the Lexicon School of English in London's Kensington, which was dissolved in 1993 by the Companies Registrar after failing to file accounts. He now receives a taxpayer-funded salary of nearly £80,000 after his party attracted the support of more than 140,000 Scots in the European election. When his success was announced by Scotland's Returning Officer Mary Pitcaithly last May, Mr Coburn’s address - in Kensington, London - was greeted with amusement. Neighbouring properties in that street have sold for around £4million in recent years, but he says he now lives north of the Border.","David Coburn apologised after comparing Humza Yousaf to Abu Hamza .

"A firefighter crashed through the roof of a burning building and was engulfed by flames as he tried to put out a fire. The man, who is believed to have 25 years experience as a firefighter, fell through the roof of a garage while attempting to control a blaze at a home in Fresno in California. Officials said he is undergoing treatment in hospital and is in a critical condition after suffering burns to most areas of his body. Scroll down for video . A firefighter is believed to have suffered burns to up to 70 per cent of his body after he scaled a roof of a burning garage in California and fell through the structure, then being engulfed by a large fireball . Crews were called to the blaze in Fresno on Sunday afternoon. The firefighter climbed onto the roof of the one storey at about 1.30pm to try and control the flames, which officials confirmed was standard operating procedure. In video footage captured by bystander Sooji Lee, he is seen edging across the roof among vast plumes of smoke to try and ventilate the fire. The roof then appears to disappear from under him and the firefighter falls through, and is engulfed by large flames. Screams from people standing nearby can be heard on the video. Firefighters then removed the front of the house in just minutes to get the fireman from the house and douse him in cold water. The firefighter had been trying to ventilate the building as he scaled the roof before falling through it . He was then taken to Community Regional Medical Center. Fresno Fire Chief Kerri Downs, said: 'I believe he suffered burns on his hands and around his face, as well as other burns on his back and his face. They were pretty much all around his body.' The firefighter, who is married and has a daughter, is believed to have suffered between 60 and 70 per cent burns. Battalion Chief Todd Tuggle said hearing the screams from bystanders was harrowing. He said: 'We could hear people screaming and we could hear people trying to help.' After the fireman fell through the roof a large fireball emerged from the building, engulfing him in the flames . Dozens of crew members have turned up at the hospital to offer their support. 'There's no doubt in my mind that individual trained most of us here,'  Fresno Firefighters Local 753 President Pete Flores, told the Fresno Bee. 'I've trained with him as well. There's a lot of experience and knowledge, so to see someone like that suffer these injuries is pretty detrimental to our family.' Joe Reyes, a former Marine, was driving past at the time of the accident and helped clear trashcans and used an axe to hack into the garage to help firefighters rescue the man. A total of 11 trucks and 31 firefighters were called to battle the blaze on Sunday afternoon. Investigators are examining how the fire started and if the fall could have been prevented.","Crews were called to a large fire at a house and garage in Fresno .

"Lord Ashcroft today stopped the last Dambusters pilot auctioning off his medals to pay for the upkeep of the Bomber Command Memorial by donating £75,000. Squadron Leader Les Munro, 95, had planned to auction his decorations to pay towards the maintenance of the monument in Green Park, central London. But he has now accepted Lord Ashcroft’s offer to donate £75,000 to the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund in return for gifting his decorations and medals to a museum in his native New Zealand. War hero: Les Munro had planned to auction his decorations to pay towards the monument's maintenance . Remembrance: The memorial in London - which features a sculpture of seven aircrew - was unveiled in 2012 . Team: Mr Munro (centre at front) with his crew in front of Lancaster, which they flew on the  Dambusters raid . Donation: Lord Ashcroft has stopped the pilot auctioning off his medals to pay for the memorial's upkeep . Mr Munro, one of only two New Zealanders to have taken part in the 1943 raid, said: ‘I am content that I have achieved my goal of doing all I can to ensure that the men of Bomber Command who lost their lives during the Second World War will be remembered with pride for generations to come. ‘I have been astonished and very touched by the huge interest that the sale of my medals to raise funds for the upkeep of the memorial has aroused. ‘In the end, in consultation with my agents Dix Noonan Webb, I have decided that there was a delicate balance to be achieved between raising funds for the RAF Benevolent Fund and ensuring that my medals are preserved for future generations of New Zealanders to appreciate. ‘Lord Ashcroft’s very generous proposal represents the best way of attaining both these objectives. I am extremely grateful to him.’ Leaning out: Mr Munro in the cockpit of Lancaster 'W for William', which he flew on the  Dambusters raid . Royal appointment: Mr Munro (left) being introduced to George VI by Wing Commander Guy Gibson VC (right), who led 617 Squadron on the Dambusters raid . Servicemen: Mr Munro (left), sharing a lighter moment with Wing Commander Leonard Cheshire VC (right), who took over as 617 Squadron commander, at a 1986 reunion in New Zealand . Collection: The decorations and medals awarded to Mr Munro, which are: New Zealand Order of Merit, Companion's neck badge (top), then (from left to right) the Distinguished Service Order, New Zealand Queen's Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross, 1939-45 Star; Air Crew Europe Star with clasp France and Germany, Italy Star; Defence and War Medals 1939-45, New Zealand Service Medal 1939-45, New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal . Mr Munro’s original decision to sell his decorations for an estimated £50,000 sparked a row in his native New Zealand, where the government wrongly claimed the medals were protected objects. The Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park . The Bomber Command Memorial that honours 55,573 airmen killed in the war is maintained by the RAF Benevolant Fund. A permanent monument was not built for 67 years due to the controversy of thousands of German civilians who died during the bombings of its cities. The memorial - which features a sculpture of seven bomber aircrew - was eventually unveiled in June 2012 at a dedication attended by the Queen. A flypast of five Tornados in a ‘V’ formation was provided, and a Lancaster dropped thousands of poppies over Green Park. But one year later in May 2013 a thug scrawled the word ‘Islam’ on the memorial using red paint - an act that veterans described as 'shocking' and 'appalling'. Les Munro piloted one of 19 Lancaster bombers on the Second World War raid to bomb a series of dams in the industrial heartland of Germany. The mission resulted in eight of the planes being shot down and 53 crew out of 133 killed. Despite the losses, the raid was a success with two dams breached by the ingenious bouncing bombs, wiping out scores of armament factories in the Ruhr Valley. Mr Munro’s Lancaster was struck by an anti-aircraft flak shell on the raid over Holland, knocking a gaping hole in the fuselage and putting all communications out of use, forcing the crew to turn back still carrying its mine. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for the raid and other sorties. Guy Gibson, who led the mission, received the Victoria Cross. In 2013 Sqn Ldr Munro visited the monument - which had been unveilved a year earlier - and afterwards said he was inspired to sell his medals in order to pay for a year’s maintenance of the memorial to keep it in pristine condition . But the medals, log books and other associated memorabilia will now be donated to the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland. Lord Ashcroft, who owns the world’s largest collection of Victoria Crosses, said on Twitter: ‘Delighted that last Dambuster pilot Les Munro has accepted my medals offer.’ In addition to the peer’s donation, auction house Dix Noonan Webb has waived its fees and expenses on the understanding that the Auckland museum makes a further donation of £10,000 to the RAF Benevolent Fund. Christopher Hill, director of client liaison at Dix Noonan Webb, said: ‘We are delighted to have helped Mr Munro realise his aim of raising a substantial amount of money towards the upkeep of the Bomber Command Memorial. ‘We share his belief that the memory of more than 55,000 aircrew who gave their lives should be preserved and we have been in close consultation with him throughout this process.’ Mr Munro's medals include the Distinguished Service Order and Distinguished Flying Cross . As well as his efforts in the Dambusters raid, he also led successful raids to wipe out E-boat and U-boat pens in Le Havre and Boulogne - missions that helped the Allied take control of Normandy and France. He bombed German aircraft and armament factories, V1, V2 and V3 rocket sites and dropped aluminium strips in the English Channel to trick German radar operators into thinking the D-Day landings were taking place at Calais rather than Normandy. Mike Neville, director of fundraising at the RAF Benevolent Fund, added: ‘Lord Ashcroft’s most generous donation, in support of Les’s desire to see his efforts of the Second World War continue to bear fruit today and into the future, is simply terrific. ‘We are very pleased for Les and delighted that he has realised his aim of supporting the RAF Benevolent Fund in their duty of maintaining the Bomber Command Memorial in perpetuity. 'Les’s sacrifice and Lord Ashcroft’s donation will help ensure the long-term future of the memorial.’ Bomber Command suffered huge losses in the war, with 45 out of every 100 airmen killed.","Les Munro, 95, had planned to auction his medals to fund maintenance .

"Some restaurant owners have tired of their negative Yelp reviews and are fighting back at their unhappy customers, seasoning their retorts with a dash of name-calling and a sprinkle of insults. Francesco Macri, who owns Park Italian Gourmet Deli in Manhattan, isn't afraid to call his customers douchebags or tell them they're 'full of s***'. Yelp user Scott E. awarded the deli one star after he  asked the owner why they stopped serving breakfast at 10am and said he was told 'not to come back'. Macri wrote back that he remembered Scott was 'not kind at all' and that he wasn't worried 'because if you came back, I'd kick you out again'. Francesco Macri, who owns Park Italian Gourmet Deli in Manhattan, hasn't been afraid to call his customers douchebags or tell them they're 'full of s**t . Macri is even happy to lob insults in different languages. When Joe T. said that as an 'Italian from Brooklyn' he knew this was 'not a good place to eat,' Macri wrote in Italian 'you are such an idiot...you're in Brooklyn, please' When Karl K. complained on the site that the sandwich he had shared with a friend had 'no complexity,' Macri told him there was an 'overall douche-baggery to your review'. Macri said he was 'ultimately content' that Karl didn't have a good experience, and quipped 'I haven't shared a sandwich with anyone since I was maybe six years old'. After vegetarian Salman M. complained about the deli's 'restricted' options and said the price was too high, Macri responded that he was 'full of s**t*', adding that he was 'not sure if that's considered vegetarian or not'. Macri is even happy to lob insults in different languages. When Joe T. said that as an 'Italian from Brooklyn' he knew this was 'not a good place to eat,' Macri wrote, in Italian, 'you are such an idiot'. But the owner's comebacks aren't always insult-packed. When one reviewer wrote she was disappointed with the deli after hearing good things, he responded with a link to the music video for Public Enemy's song Don't Believe The Hype. Macri told the New York Post that he wasn't 'a nice person' and that he was just defending his business from 'a public complaints department'. After two customers at a Boston restaurant took a table without a reservation and began obviously posting on Yelp as a threat for service,  chef Michael Scelfo snapped their photo and posted it on his Instagram page . Although the deli owner may be one of the most active restaurant owners when it comes to responding to negative Yelp reviews, he's hardly the only one. When one Yelp user accused Gaia Bagnasacco, owner of Gaia Italian Cafe in New York, of having a 'horrible attitude' she called him out on what she said was his 'nasty' behavior. Bagnasacco told Peter B., who had previously given her a five-star rating before the new two-star post, that the restaurant was tired of his attitude. 'We have been patience [sic] in the past many time,' she wrote. 'Is [sic] not fair Peter and we are sure you will find the right place for you. Ciao.' In another response Bagnasacco wondered where all the 'educated' customers who 'understand quality' had gone. But sometimes, when the customer takes it too far, the restaurant owners are unafraid to give more than a strong-worded response. After two customers at a Boston restaurant took a table despite not having a reservation and began obviously posting on Yelp as a threat for service, chef Michael Scelfo snapped their photo and posted it on his Instagram page. Macri said that he wasn't 'a nice person' and that he was just defending his business from 'a public complains department' with his Yelp responses . When one Yelp user accused Gaia Bagnasacco, owner of Gaia Italian Cafe in New York, of having a 'horrible attitude' she called him out on what she said was his nasty behavior . ‘Shout out to these two winners for seating themselves with no reservations, insulting and berating our staff, refusing to leave and all the while yelping away in front of us as a means of threat,' he wrote. He included the hashtag 'WeDoNotNegotiateWithYelpers'. Some Yelpers have been left scared to share their opinions after a few businesses skipped angry responses or shaming posts and jumped straight into the courtroom. Last year a Virginia woman was found guilty of defaming a contractor on the site after she wrote a review that he had mishandled her home renovation and stolen her jewelry on the job, according to Yahoo News. The woman was being sued for $750,000 but ended up not having to pay a dime when the jury found the contractor likewise defamed her when he responded to her allegations. California has been the first state to protect users, creating the Yelp law. The legislation prohibits companies from using online reviews as a means for fining customers, according to CNN. The law bans protective 'disparagement clauses' and states that companies who try to enforce a fine for a negative review could be forced to pay anywhere from $2,500 to $15,000.","New York deli owner Francesco Macri has called customers 'douchebags,' 'idiots' and told them they're 'full of s***'

"The swashbuckling drama Poldark launched last night on BBC to rave reviews by critics. What captured the attention of viewers was not only the tousle-haired Captain Ross Poldark, played by Aiden Turner, but the rugged Cornwall which served as a backdrop to the action. Tourism bosses are predicting a stampede of the show's fans to be booking West Country hotels, guest houses and campsites, to experience the spectacular scenery. The swashbuckling Cornish drama, Poldark, debuted last night on BBC One, featuring Aiden Turner as the lead, (left), and Eleanor Tomlinson as kitchen maid Demelza, (right) The drama is set in 18th century Cornwall, with filming locations Gunwalloe, Charlestown and Porthgwarra taking the spotlight. Pictured here is the coast near Gunwalloe Fishing Cove . Porthgwarro, near Land's End, served as a backdrop to the passionate mining drama, which is set for an eight week run on BBC One . Spectacular scenery: Cliffs and sea at Porthgwarra Cove are featured in the drama which sees Captain Ross Poldark returning from war in America to find his father has died, his tin mines are in disarray and his house is a wreck . Holidaymakers are set to flock to filming locations such as Gunwalloe, Charlestown and Porthgwarra, which take their turn in the spotlight in the 18th century family drama. Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall for Cornwall Development Company said that if Downton Abbey can put Highclere Castle on the map, the West Country can expect similar hoards of crowds. The adaptation of Winston Graham's book debuted last night on BBC One, and tells the story of Captain Ross Poldark, who has returned from war in America to find his father has died, his tin mines are in disarray and his house is a wreck. Tousle haired Captain Ross Poldark set pulses racing in the 18th century drama debut last night, which is set for an eight week run on BBC One . A passionate plot weaves around the 18th century mining history of the area, and Visit Cornwall is predicting tourists will be lining up to see the sights of the county where it is set. Mr Bell said: 'Prime-time coverage such as this can have substantial impact on a destination. 'If the initial reviews are anything to go by, Poldark looks set to be a massive hit, and with 12 novels in the Poldark series there is potential for it to run and run. 'The opportunity is there to be seized and I look forward to working with the tourism industry to turn the success of the production into a success for Cornwall.' Charlestown was one of the filming locations for the family drama. It is estimated a production of the scale of Poldark can bring in £32,000 per day in the region through hotel stays for the team, food, transport and hiring local crew . The drama was filmed at various locations across Cornwall from Charlestown to Porthgwarra last summer and the series put the spotlight on the county's breath-taking landscapes . The tourism service is preparing to maximise on exposure from the eight week series by creating Poldark-themed holiday ideas and competitions. Kaye Elliot, head of production services at Creative England agrees, saying: 'Filming can bring a huge amount of money into a region. 'When a production like Poldark comes to town, they can spend up to £32,000 per day in the region, on things like hotels, food, transport and hiring local crew. 'Over the last year, filming has brought £11 million of inward investment from on location spend into the South West - and that's before you consider the impact of tourists visiting their favourite film locations.' Love triangle drama! When Captain Ross Poldark returns from war, he find his love interest Elizabeth, (left), played by Heida Reed,  thought he was dead and has married his cousin. Poldark hires the fiery Demelza to help out at his Nampara estate, kickstarting one of the most popular love triangles of modern fiction . Cornwall councillor Julian German, portfolio holder for economy and culture, said: 'Through Poldark, Cornwall has been offered a valuable showcase. 'With the series running until the end of April, the profile boost will coincide with the Easter break and when people are starting to make bookings. 'It is hoped that the stunning scenery will inspire viewers to visit for themselves and discover the mining heritage which plays a central role throughout the story.' The original adaptation of the  book series by Winston Graham was a huge success with the series being broadcast in more than 40 countries. If this is anything to go by, the remake is set to bring flocks of holidaymakers to its Cornish backdrop .","The 18th century drama began on BBC One last night to positive reviews from critics .

"Charla Nash never served in the military. She was horribly disfigured, not in combat, but in a 2009 attack by a rampaging chimpanzee. The Pentagon, though, is watching her recovery closely. The U.S. military paid for Nash's full face transplant in 2011 and is underwriting her follow-up treatment at a combined cost estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the hope that some of the things it learns can help young, seriously disfigured soldiers returning from war. In the coming weeks Nash will take part in a military-funded experiment in which doctors at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital will try to wean her off the anti-rejection drugs she has been taking since the transplant. Scroll down for video . Charla Nash (pictured last month) was seriously disfigured after being attacked by her employer's 200-pound pet chimpanzee in Stamford, Connecticut . The 61-year-old (pictured) was working as a dispatcher for a towing company at the time of the attack . The U.S. military paid for Nash's full face transplant in 2011 and is underwriting her follow-up treatment at a combined cost estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars . Nash jokes about sometimes feeling like a science project. But the 61-year-old daughter of an Air Force veteran said she gets real satisfaction out of letting the doctors use her for research, and sees it as an opportunity to help wounded soldiers and 'do something good out of all of this bad.' 'They asked me, could they? I said, `Yeah, I'd be thrilled to help out in any way I could,'' said Nash, a former Connecticut resident who now lives on her own in Boston with the help of part-time aides. Nash lost her nose, lips, eyelids and hands when she was mauled by her employer's 200-pound pet chimpanzee in Stamford, Connecticut. Doctors also had to remove her eyes because of a disease transmitted by the chimp. She later received new facial features taken from a dead woman. She also underwent a double hand transplant, but it failed when her body rejected the tissue. Now blind, Nash spends most of her days listening to AM radio and books on tape - lately, 'War and Peace' - in her modest, second-story apartment. Military bosses hope that some of the things it learns from funding Nash's treatment will end up helping young, seriously disfigured soldiers returning from war . Charla Nash is set to take part in an experiment in which doctors  will try to wean her off the anti-rejection drugs she has been taking since the transplant . A care worker brushes Charla Nash's teeth, which were provided by an organ donor along with her face, at her apartment in Boston . Nash lost her nose, lips, eyelids and hands after she was attacked by her employer's chimp Travis (pictured) in 2009 . Attack: Charla was mauled by Travis, pictured, as she tried to help the chimp's owner catch the animal . She also exercises a couple of days a week with a trainer at a gym to build her strength and stay healthy. A GoFundMe account is being set up to help raise money for prosthetic hands. Her life today is a stark contrast to her younger years, when she was a barrel racer on the rodeo circuit from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. Over the years, she also did some horse-jumping, worked on a farm and manned a computer help desk. She was working as a dispatcher for a towing company at the time of the attack. About every six weeks, Nash undergoes lab tests for the military at Brigham and Women's. She is also subjected to MRIs and CT scans to determine how well her brain is sending signals to her new face. In addition, doctors examine how well the arteries are delivering blood to the transplant. The military is also interested in such things as any scarring around the mouth and how well her eyelids work. Charla Nash grabs the arm of shuttle driver Roland Copeland as they walk from her apartment in Boston . Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, the Director of Plastic Surgery and Transplantation at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, talks with Charla Nash during an appointment . About every six weeks, she undergoes lab tests for the military at the hospital. She also exercises a couple of days a week with a trainer at a gym to build her strength and stay healthy . 'It makes sense for us to look at the civilian community and the experiences that are gained through the involvement of non-uniformed people to assess if this is a good solution for the military,' said Dr. Brian Pfister, a portfolio manager for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command's Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine research program. About 35 full or partial face transplants have been performed worldwide since the first one was done in France in 2005. The Defense Department estimates 560 soldiers have suffered severe facial wounds in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of those, about 50 or 60 might be candidates for a face transplant, Pfister said. The Pentagon is providing grants to 14 medical facilities across the U.S. through its hand and face transplantation program. The face and the extremities are the two most frequently injured parts of the body in war. Charla Nash (pictured) drinks a cup of hot coffee through a straw while visiting a cafe in Boston . Medics insist Charla Nash (pictured) is doing 'remarkably well' and has experienced very few rejection episodes, making her a good candidate for the experiment . Now blind, Charla Nash spends most of her days listening to AM radio and books on tape - lately, 'War and Peace' - in her modest, second-story apartment . The new experiment, involving the suspension of anti-rejection drugs, will eventually include other patients, and its findings could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of people, military and civilian alike, doctors said. The immunosuppression drugs that transplant patients are typically given for the rest of their lives carry such risks as cancer, viral infections and kidney damage. Because of those dangers, many transplants of non-vital body parts, such as thumbs, are not considered worth doing. But that could change if the drugs don't have to be a lifelong commitment. 'Suddenly, it's not as crazy to think about transplanting individual fingers or an ear,' said Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, who led Nash's transplant surgery team.

"Homeland will not be featuring any stories based on ISIS because its producers think the group are too barbaric and too 'evil' to appear on their show. The Showtime series has dealt with terror cells and double agents across the world, but dramatizing ISIS and one its leaders Jihadi John is not on the agenda. Executive Producer Alex Gansa revealed that writers have been asked to steer clear of the subject matter as he cannot see any way of humanizing their vile actions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Steering clear: Homeland will avoid portraying the Islamic State or one of its murderous members Jihadi John because producers do not want to give the terror group a platform - despite documenting terror and torture . 'They are just too evil to dramatize on TV': Executive producer Alex Gansa (pictured, right, with lead actress Claire Danes) made the comments at a pop culture festival held annually at The Paley Center in Los Angeles . Gansa spoke at the opening night of Paley Fest in Los Angeles for on Friday night. He confirmed that the show will not be ending anytime soon and leading star Claire Danes insisted that she is committed long term too. Asked about whether ISIS plot lines would be considered, Alex replied: 'It's a very good question because Homeland for the last four seasons has tried to portray our adversaries and tried to humanize them. 'And if you look at Abu Nazir, even look at Brody, or look at Haqqani this past season there was a real effort to make their concerns and their lives understandable. 'That is very hard to do with ISIS. 'It's very difficult to do because what they are doing on the ground feels so medieval and so horrible that you give them a platform on television I'm a little wary of; to try to make what they are talking about understandable or relatable is very difficult. Gruesome: Homeland earned a reputation for pushing the envelope with episodes about terrorism and the CIA . ISIS has lured converts from around the world to join their murderous rampage across Iraq and Syria . 'So we are struggling with that. Maybe this is too soon, Maybe we don't understand them well enough; It may be that they are just too evil to dramatize on television.' Homeland has featured drama based on real life encounters that US intelligence services have dealt with across the world. However Gansa feels that even attempting to portay a character like Jihadi John would not work for his critically acclaimed TV series. 'I think to humanize or to create a sympathetic member of IS right now is a very tall order, that I would be nervous about doing; I really would; I think right now the intelligence communities, the United States government doesn't really even know how to deal with them on the ground right now. 'From what I understand Iran and Iraq are leading the charge against IS right now. in that part of the world, and the United States is loathed to put boots on the ground and; we want to stay in the air with these it strikes how effective is that going to be? We don't know. 'So it is a very interesting question and one that we wrestle with because one of the great things about Homeland is that we are able to comment on on current events in a way is a lot of shows aren't able to do.' Since 2010 Homeland has been a high hit around the world picking up honors for its writers and actors including Damien Lewis and Danes. While offers have flooded into the stars to go elsewhere Gansa feels the unique bond between the cast and crew has kept their show together. He also will delight fans by saying Homeland will only get better. 'I don't think we've been at the top yet I really don't. We were so fortunate to win the Emmy in the first year, but we are just getting started on that kind of thing. 'The great thing about Homeland is that if you look at every single season is very distinct; So we are not doing the same show over and over again. 'You will see season five is so radically different from season four. We are going to be two and a half years into the future from from season four, we going to be shooting the series in Europe, the show will be set in Germany this year, Carrie will be out of the intelligence agency is going to be a different show again and that is what is it fresh and that is what keeps it ask wanting to do it and we want to keep producing it as a higher level. Radically different: Season five (pictured) will be set in Europe with Carrie out of the intelligence agency . Reinventing: Gansa insists the show has the potential to change rather than sticking with Middle Eastern terror . Claire Danes announced she is staying on as the lead character, adding that it is her 'dream job' 'And once we stopped doing that then we will stop. We're here to stay for as long as we can make the show that we want to make and feel that it is at a certain level.' Speaking soon after, leading actress Claire Danes confirmed she was committed to the show long-term too. She laughed: 'I have to come back. I am contractually obligated.' Then turning serious, she added: 'It is a dream job and it is a dream company. 'I am never bored the writers are relentless in redesigning the show every season and she's naturally dynamic but they put her in such different circumstances and environments that she had different facets of her revealed and to me even. She remains vital and novel.' Claire said she was looking forward to working in Berlin for the next series. Paleyfest is an annual festival that salutes creative excellence and highly acclaimed TV programming, and offers a weeklong pop-culture experience that connects fans with the casts and creators of their favorite TV series. Paleyfest - sponsored by Citi - benefits the Paley Center's preservation and archival digitization efforts, and its ongoing mission to explore the significant impact of media on our culture and society.","Alex Gansa says he can't see any way to humanize Islamic State's action .

"A petty feud between the two most powerful women in Ed Miliband’s inner circle has rocked the Labour Party. The dispute between the party’s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell – who is tipped as a future Labour leader – to attend the Brits ‘pre-party’ where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.’ The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the ‘second jobs’ debate was partly the responsibility of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London’s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co’ at the Brits . She learned her backroom wheeler-dealing skills from her mentor and close friend John Prescott, who gave her first break in politics – as tea girl in his office in 1980. Stylish Lancashire-born brunette Ms Powell has had a meteoric rise through the party’s ranks. Only two years after becoming an MP, Miliband put her in charge of his Election campaign in November. A Labour MP said: ‘Lucy and Rosie are a generation apart and totally different in their approach to politics. ‘We have been waiting for this dust- up to occur.’ A Labour spokesman said last night: ‘There is no truth in this allegation.’","Election chief Lucy Powell planned to mingle with stars at Brits pre-party .

"Hero: John Collier survived 63 bombing missions in the Second World War and helped plan the Dambusters raid . The secret history of a decorated Bomber Command hero who survived 63 missions, bombed Hitler's barges and planned the Dambusters raid has been uncovered after his death. John Collier was awarded three top medals for his heroic and brave service during the Second World War, but lived a humble life after he left the RAF and rarely spoke of his incredible achievements. He died aged 83 in 2000, only for an unpublished memoir recording his feats to be unearthed by his family in his home in the New Forest, Hampshire. Now his story has been told in a biography - titled Group Captain John 'Joe' Collier - written by family friend Simon Gooch. Mr Gooch and the family of Mr Collier discovered that the airman's first mission took place mere hours after war against Germany was declared on September 3, 1939. The mission was one of the first bombing missions of the war and involved searching for German warships in the North Sea. Another mission described in the memoir described Mr Collier flying a twin-engined Hampden bomber on a raid on a canal lock in Munster, Germany, on August 12, 1940, when his plane was hit. He recalled later: '""Hell"" my navigator said, ""I have been hit in the bottom and am bleeding - what shall I do?"" '""Sit on it"", I said, ""until we're out of this"". And sit on it he did without a murmur of complaint...' Squadron Leader Collier was mentioned in despatches and is aid to have been recommended for a Victoria Cross. He might have been given that highest award for valour if another person on the operation had not got the VC. 'There seems to have been a rule of one per op,' Mr Gooch wrote. He went on to become one of the most decorated pilots of the early years of the conflict in the desperate days when Britain seemed certain to be invaded and then defeated. His second war career came in planning bombing missions as Britain and its Allies gradually gained the upper hand. Later he would plan the pinpoint missions to stop the Germans' revolutionary rocket weapons that John feared might swing the conflict back in the Nazis' favour. Bomber: The brave airman's first mission took place mere hours after war against Germany was declared . After being presented with three medals for his service as a courageous bomber, Mr Collier (standing second from left) was transferred into a crack team of specialist mission planners . Seven days after the Munster raid, Mr Collier was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), jointly for that mission and an attack on oil tanks in Bordeaux. Little more than a week after that award he suffered severe concussion and was lucky to survive when his bomber crashed on landing. Others were less fortunate. His close friend Guy Gibson VC - one of the most famous airmen of the war - noted sadly that by late 1940 most of the original comrades of 83 Squadron were dead, missing, prisoners of war or wounded. In 1941, after a six-month convalescence, he was transferred to 44 Squadron and later that year was awarded a Bar to his DFC - the equivalent of a second medal. In March 1942 he was put in command of 97 Squadron flying the newly-introduced four-engined Lancaster, and took part in the first 1,000-bomber raid on Cologne on May 30, 1942. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order after his last raid on a German engine factory in Augsburg in August 1942. He recounted how he would stand the bomber 'almost on its nose and dive furiously towards the earth, when I thought that the anti-aircraft (guns) had the measure of me - a bit nerve-racking for the rest of the aircrew, but an effective measure of evasion to which I consider I owe my life on more than one occasion'. Mr Collier stopped flying because the Air Ministry needed an experienced bomber officer to join a crack team of specialist mission planners, where he stayed until the end of the war. Mr Collier was given the Distinguished Flying Cross, was awarded a bar to it and was also given the Distinguished Service order, among a host of other medals . Writing shortly after the war ended, Mr Collier said: 'It is difficult to imagine that adventure can be found in the Ministry, surely the excitement and glory of War is on the Battlefield? 'I suppose it could be said I had my fair share of adventure during the four years I was on operations in Bomber Command. 'I refrain from writing about these adventures because they were in no way different from those experienced by so many airmen of that gallant Command, and further so many books have been written by real heroes, and my personal friends, such as Guy Gibson VC and Leonard Cheshire VC, both of whom are household names today.' Mr Collier died in 2000 aged 83, with loved ones only realising the extent of his achievements when his memoir was unearthed . 'I found my adventure in this war in the Air Ministry.... I was in a privileged position to watch the most interesting period of the war in Europe during the two most vital years. 'I had my sense of great thrill and disappointment, and occasionally of achievement, event though such achievements were initially on paper.' Mr Collier's work in the Ministry was outstanding and vital. He liaised with Barnes Wallis, designer of the 'bouncing bomb', and with Wing Commander Guy Gibson on the Dambuster Raid in which the weapon was successfully used. German reservoirs, hydroelectric schemes, armaments factories and dozens of bridges were destroyed - all in one mission. Even late in the war, with Allied troops closing in on victory in Europe, Mr Collier and his team were doing vital work targeting and attacking the factories making and supplying the 'V' weapons that were wreaking havoc in Britain. The V1 and V2 missiles caused terror among civilians in London - and even struck fear into Mr Collier. 'I wasn't aware until reading his memoir, and other reading around it, that they were worried that the missiles would carry some sort of nuclear warhead or biological agent,' Mr Gooch said.. After peace in 1945, John served in Sri Lanka, Japan and the RAF Staff College in Bracknell, Berkshire. After leaving the military, John worked as a land agent and after retiring from paid work devoted time to helping the children's charity Barnardo's. He was fully retired and living in the New Forest when Mr Gooch got to know him. 'He did not indulge very much in reminiscing,' the family friend said. 'His relations rather looked up to him. I had a feeling there was something special about him but I was not bold enough to ask him.' 'He was very genial, very sympathetic, a benign presence.' RAF Bomber Command's role during World War Two was to bomb the enemy's airbases, shipping, troops, communications and other industries connected to the German war effort. Britain had to use long-range bombing after Dunkirk in 1940 until D-day in 1944 as it had no other way of attacking the Germans. The job fell to RAF air crews - some of who were just 18 - who flew increasingly heavier types of long-range bombers. It was so successful that Hitler was forced to divert nearly a million men, 55,000 artillery guns and a large part of the German air force on to defending the nation instead of fighting offensively. Bomber Command flew almost every day and mostly at night during the war to avoid being shot down - but this meant it was difficult to locate small targets. In 1941 it was decided whole industrial cities should be priority targets. Larger four-engine bombers and improved navigation equipment then followed to create a formidable fighting force. The repeated and persistent attacks on German cities which followed became a critical factor in the liberation of Europe and the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.","Bomber Command hero John Collier survived 63 dangerous WWII missions .

"Celebrated propaganda painter in Maoist China, Shen Jiawei, has recently added the Vatican to his list of clientele. Starting his career during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, his most famous works depicting Chinese soldiers were transformed into propaganda posters which were distributed en masse all over the country. Four decades on and a far cry from charging tourists $30 for a portrait in Sydney's Darling Harbour, Shen found himself painting one of the world's most influential men when he was commissioned to produce the first official portrait of Pope Francis. Scroll down for video . Highly regarded Chinese-Australian artist Jiawei sits next to his portrait of Cardinal Pell . More recently, the 66-year-old artist found himself on a Vatican balcony, using his gift to create a lifelike portrait of the Catholic Church's money man, Cardinal Pell. Commissioned by a Catholic university, the classic portrait features the Australian prelate looking over St Peter's Square. After his history as a Chinese propaganda artist, Shen maintains he doesn't see his artwork for the Catholic Church in the same light . Shen's journey from favoured propaganda artist of the People's Liberation Army to papal portraitist is an unusual tale of talent and timing. 'For me, one door closed but another always opened,' Mr Jiawei said of his career in a recent phone interview from his studio in Bundeena, south of Sydney. Shen was about to complete high school when Mai Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution, a decade long campaign to restore ideological purity to China's anti-capitalist revolution. Universities were shut down, along with Shen's aspirations of attending art school. Fully embracing the communist spirit of the times he joined the Red Guards and then the People's Liberation Army. Caught in the maelstrom of the revolution his artistic talents were recognised and he because one of the many propaganda artists who glorified workers, farmers and soliders in the Socialist Realisim style seen in Soviet propaganda. In a bid to depict soldiers as strong and heroic Shen's most famous work, 'Standing Guard for Our Great Motherland', was altered to fit regime standardsfor revolutionary art. Mr Jiawei then shot to fame in the 1970's and 1980's becoming one best known artists in China. Shen takes pride in knowing his art rose to fame in a very challenging time where oil paintings were not easily obtained. He says he didn't sell out to the idealised standards of propaganda art that most other Chinese artists copied. Instead, he says he relied on nature to guide his brush. Shen takes pride in knowing his art rose to fame in a very challenging time where oil paintings were not easily obtained. 'This is why today if you look back at that time, in China, most artwork is different than mine,' he said. 'I'm proud of that.' Shen maintains his propaganda days are over saying his new works of Pope Francis and Cardinal Pell are a part of normal art history. 'I stopped my propaganda work in the 1970s,' he said, adding, 'even church commission work, this is part of normal artwork, part of commission and part of history.' Byron Hurst, Chairman of Hazelhurst Gallery, told Daily Mail Australia that Shen first caught the attention of Australian church officials with a 1994 portrait of Mary MacKillop, the 19th-century nun who ministered to the poor and in 2010 became Australia's first saint. Mr Hurst said completing the painting meant a lot to the 'highly regarded international portrait artist' who had been given refugee status in Australia after The Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. 'For Jiawei, it was a way to say thank you to Australia for giving him a home' 'For Jiawei, it was a way to say thank you to Australia for giving him a home and of course it was an opportunity to pick up three other important commission with Greg Craven, Sir Peter Cosgrove and Cardinal Pell,' Mr Hurst told Daily Mail Australia. Basing the portrait on photographs, Shen painted Francis with outstretched arms, a white dove about to land on his shoulder. He is surrounded by people Shen painted from the photos of crowds at papal audiences, slipping in an image of his daughter for fun. There are several birds in the painting, homage to Francis' namesake, the nature-loving St. Francis of Assisi. 'When the pope approved this project and they sent me the photos, (they said) the pope wants a painting with people together,' Shen said. Shen is very highly regarded in the art community and has completed works of other high profile Australian such as John Howard and Princess Mary. The painting now hangs in a villa in the Vatican gardens that houses the Pontifical Academy for Sciences, which deals with Francis' pet projects on human trafficking, slavery and youth culture, among other issues. Geoff Raby, Australia's former ambassador to China who has a print of Shen's 'Standing Guard' in his collection of propaganda art, said Shen's portrait career is a natural progression from the propaganda art and historical paintings that he is most famous for. 'He's painting subjects that he has philosophical connection to and sympathy with,' Raby said in a phone interview. But he added: 'He also has an eye to commercial reality.' Shen is very highly regarded in the art community and has completed works of other high profile Australian such as John Howard and Princess Mary.","Shen Jiawei was a celebrated propaganda artist in Maoist China .

"Animal rights activists were stunned when the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Feld Entertainment, announced it would eliminate elephants from its circuses by 2018. The elephants will then be retired to a conservation center in Florida. 'Monumental and long overdue,' was how the Animal Welfare Institute put it. 'Startling and tremendously exciting,' The Humane Society of the United States said in a statement. And the International Fund for Animal Welfare called it 'a giant step in the right direction.' But activists soon focused on the timing, questioning why it will take three years to phase out the elephants from the traveling circus shows. Elephants perform at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus said it will phase out its iconic elephant acts by 2018 . Just days before the announcement, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis (TB). TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact. A statement from PETA frames Ringling’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country. 'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone’s safety,' the statement read. Scroll down for video . Elephants with the Ringling Bros. show appear in front of the Capitol in Washington in 2013. PETA says the company's move to retire its elephants heads off a scandal about the animals having TB while touring . As many as one-third of the elephants having tested positive for tuberculosis, and several Ringling employees have been treated for the disease . Ingrid E. Newkirk, president of PETA, said: 'Many of the elephants are painfully arthritic, and many have tuberculosis, so their retirement day needs to come now' The documents obtained by PETA reveal that in 2010, at least 11 elephants with the circus tested positive for TB, and that elephants used by Ringling have had TB since at least 1978. As many as one-third of the elephants having tested positive for the disease, and several Ringling employees have been treated for TB. TB carried by an elephant was linked to an outbreak among eight humans at an elephant sanctuary, some of whom had no direct contact with the elephant. PETA said the documents also show that Ringling consistently opposed efforts by officials to improve testing requirements for TB in elephants. According to former USDA attorney Kenneth Vail, who is now the Animal Welfare Act compliance officer for Feld Entertainment, TB is 'probably going to be the downfall of Feld’s elephants'. Ingrid E. Newkirk, president of PETA, added: 'Many of the elephants are painfully arthritic, and many have tuberculosis, so their retirement day needs to come now.' 'If the decision is serious, then the circus needs to do it NOW.' Kenneth Feld (left), CEO of Feld Entertainment, and his daughters, feed elephants at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation, in Polk City, Florida . However, executives at Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, say it will take three years to build proper facilities for them on the 200-acre plot of land in central Florida that's already being used as an elephant conservation center. They have repeatedly denied that the elephants are mistreated in any way in the circuses. 'Each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area,' said Stephen Payne, Feld's spokesman, adding that permits, drainage issues and other logistics must be worked out. The company intends for the elephants to live out their years on the property, and since one elephant is 69, they must plan for the long haul to care for the crop of gentle giants. The decision to phase out elephants from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus comes at a time when cities across the United States are cracking down on exotic animal displays. Even before Thursday's announcement that the elephants will be phased out of Ringling's performances by 2018, company officials already said they were pulling out of certain cities because of newly enacted restrictions. Feld executives said the decision to end the circus's century-old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length. Elephants have often been featured on Ringling's posters over the decades. 'There's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers,' said Alana Feld, the company's executive vice president. 'A lot of people aren't comfortable with us touring with our elephants.' Feld owns 43 elephants, 29 of which live at the company's 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida. One elephant is on a breeding loan to the Fort Worth Zoo. Thirteen animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018. The company plans to retire its remaining 13 touring elephants to its conservation center in Florida in 2018 . Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, say it will take three years to build proper facilities for all thirteen elephants to join the 29 already on site at the 200-acre plot of land . Each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area, and permits, drainage issues and other logistics must also be worked out before the elephants can retire to the center . Another reason for the decision, company President Kenneth Feld said, was that certain cities and counties have passed 'anti-circus' and 'anti-elephant' ordinances. The company's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year, and Feld said it's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction. It's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations, he said. Carol Bradley, who wrote a book about the freeing of an elephant, called the decision 'earth-moving' and thought the Felds would never change their minds . 'All of the resources used to fight these things can be put toward the elephants,' Feld said during an interview at the conservation center. 'We're not reacting to our critics; we're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the Asian elephant.' Carol Bradley, the author of the book 'Last Chain on Billie: How One Extraordinary Elephant Escaped the Big Top,' which is about a non-Ringling circus elephant, said she believes the Feld family 'realized it was a losing PR battle.' 'This is an enormous, earth-moving decision,' she said. 'When I heard the news, my jaw hit the floor. I never thought they'd change their minds about this.' In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal-rights groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year legal battle over allegations that Ringling circus employees mistreated elephants. The initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former Ringling barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $190,000 by the animal-rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit. The judge called him 'essentially a paid plaintiff' who lacked credibility and standing to sue. The judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial. Kenneth Feld testified during that trial about elephants' importance to the show. 'The symbol of the 'Greatest Show on Earth' is the elephant, and that's what we've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years.' When asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants, Feld replied, 'No, it wouldn't.' The circus will continue to use tigers, dogs and goats, and a Mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders joined its Circus Xtreme show this year. The symbol of the 'Greatest Show on Earth' is the elephant but Feld Entertainment now admits that the public is no longer comfortable with them touring with elephants, and keeping up with changing regulations is tough . The circus business is changing and Feld is now investing in more motor sports. In 2010 it created a motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz (pictured) and has acquired a number of other acts . More motor sports, daredevils and feats of human physical capabilities will likely be showcased. In 2008, Feld acquired a variety of motor sports properties, including monster truck shows, motocross and the International Hot Rod Association, which promotes drag races and other events. In 2010, it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz. Roughly 30 million people attend one of Feld's 5,000 live entertainment shows every year. Ringling's popular Canada-based competitor, Cirque du Soleil, features human acts and doesn't use wild animals.

"The 42-year-old former lawyer has been nicknamed 'Ms U-turn' after she softened the Government's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage . Controversial Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will keep her job if the Tories win the election, the Prime Minister revealed yesterday. David Cameron said Mrs Morgan will be put in charge of plans to create 500 new free schools, which he claimed would drive up standards across the country. He said the schools – which can be set up by parents, faith groups or other organisations – were helping to wrest control of education out of the hands of 'pointy-heads in Whitehall'. He claimed the Tories are 'the only party that is opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children', adding: 'With me as Prime Minister and Nicky Morgan as Education Secretary, that's exactly what you're going to get.' Mrs Morgan is said to be 'delighted' to be the first Cabinet minister to be guaranteed her job if her party wins in May. But the move will alarm critics, who have accused her of watering down the radical approach to schools reform taken by her predecessor, Michael Gove. The 42-year-old former lawyer has been nicknamed 'Ms U-turn' after she softened the Government's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage, which she opposed before joining the Cabinet. But friends say she is only carrying out Downing Street's orders to mend fences with the teaching establishment, which Mr Gove derided as 'the Blob'. A Tory source said last night: 'The Prime Minister is a big fan of Nicky Morgan – he thinks she is doing a good job.' The Education Secretary confirmed that a future Tory government would not allow free schools to make a profit – an idea that was floated by Mr Gove but blocked by the Lib Dems. Free schools legislation allows groups to establish new state-funded schools which are independent of local authorities. As with academies, they do not have to teach the National Curriculum. Fewer than 300 have been opened to date, although 49 were given the green light yesterday. Labour has claimed it would not allow any more to open – and warned existing free schools could be placed under some form of local authority control. The move will alarm critics, who have accused her of watering down the radical approach to schools reform taken by her predecessor, Michael Gove (pictured) But Mr Cameron said a Tory-led government would open 500 new free schools after the election. Speaking at an academy in West London yesterday, he hailed the reforms as 'the most successful schools programme in recent British history'. He also insisted he is not trying to block controversial plans to allow a grammar school in Kent to expand by opening an 'annexe' in another town, saying: 'Grammar schools are good schools and I like good schools. 'Like other schools, if they are good, and want to expand, they should be able to.' Mrs Morgan is expected to take legal advice in the coming days on whether she can approve the expansion of the Weald of Kent Grammar School in Tonbridge, which wants to open a new site nine miles away in Sevenoaks.","PM says Mrs Morgan will be in charge of plans to create 500 new schools .

"In a terrifying abduction attempt a Sydney nurse has fought off a stranger who tried to drag her into the boot of his car. The 28-year-old nurse was walking along Falcon Street after finishing a late shift at North Shore Private Hospital when a silver BMW pulled up and a man jumped from the car. He grabbed the nurse, put his hand over her mouth and tried to drag her into the boot of the car. It was only after the nurse hit the man in the groin that he released his grip and she was able to make her escape. The nurse luckily only suffered cuts and bruises, although badly shaken by the incident. CCTV footage shows the nurse in her uniform strolling down a busy Sydney road late on Wednesday night . Her alleged attacker drives by in his car as she walks along the street . Police said that the car was a silver BMW driven by a man of Middle Eastern or Indian descent . Police described the man as Middle Eastern or Indian, aged in his 30s and about 175cm tall with a stocky build. CCTV footage showed the nurse in her uniform strolling down a busy Sydney road late on Wednesday night. She follows the Pacific Highway bend at Crows Nest and turns onto Falcon St. After the attack the man is last seen at about 10.25pm driving up Sophia Street, a narrow one-way lane lined with houses. Residents said they heard the woman scream before she ran to a nearby Caltex station where the attendant tried to calm her down until police arrived minutes later. Officers took footage from cameras at businesses on Crows Nest's main drag, including some showing the nurse walking on her own . After the attack the man was last seen driving up Sophia Street, a narrow one-way lane lined with houses . Detectives have collected CCTV footage from the station, believed to show the traumatised woman running inside. Officers also took footage from cameras at businesses on Crows Nest's main drag, including some showing the nurse walking on her own. Superintendent Allan Sicard says every detective in his local command is on the case and the Sex Crimes Squad is involved. Supt Sicard said getting kicked in the groin must have left this man in pain and anyone he might have gone home to might have noticed. The terrified nurse ran to a nearby petrol station and contacted police . ‘Someone will know this man,’ he said. ‘He might have come to someone's house, someone's unit, someone's social group, been in a degree of pain, anxious or maybe sweating.’ He said the attack was extremely out of character for the lower north shore area and asked the public not to let the fear of crime rule their lives. In wake of the attack, the hospital has advised staff to avoid walking home alone in the dark.","The nurse had finished a late shift at North Shore Private Hospital .

"An 85-year-old man has been plagued by non-stop egg attacks on his house for an entire year. Albert Clemens Senior’s home first became a target in March 2014, and the attacks have yet to stop, confounding neighbors, local government officials and even the police in Euclid, Ohio. Despite there being no let-up in the egg onslaught, no one has been able to identify the culprits. The attacks are ruining the elderly man’s green two-story house on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago. Clemens’ wife has passed away, but he continues to live in the house with his 51-year-old son and 49-year-old daughter. ‘The accuracy is phenomenal, because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit the front door,’ says Clemens. Dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint. The police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home . The frequency is troubling too, as the house is pelted with eggs several times a week, occasionally more than once a day. The egg offensive always begins after dark and lasts about 10 minutes. The latest an attack has come is 2 a.m., and the noise as an egg hits the front door or aluminium siding of the house has been compared to the crack of a gunshot. Al Clemens Jr told Fox8 Cleveland that eggs are about 80 per cent of the items thrown at his home. There have also been apples, oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits and canned goods. Dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint. Albert Clemens Sr, 85, lives in the house with his 51-year-old son and 49-year-old daughter . The police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home and other than one or two mis-aimed eggs, few hit neighboring homes. ‘Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason,’ Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser told Cleveland.com. Local police are not taking the investigation lightly, trying undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighbourhood, installing surveillance cameras, and even sending eggshells to a crime lab for testing. At one point the entire community policing unit was on the case. Luckily for police the home is less than a mile from the police station and officers are able to respond quickly to each attack. The finger has been pointed at a couple suspects in the neighborhood over the course of the year since the attacks began. Clemens was once confronted by a young man across the street who asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighbourhood – suspected drug activity. Another nieghbor was suspected, but police saw him standing outside during an attack. The eggs have been traced back to a nearby Amish farm, but that yielded no further clues. Fingerprinting the eggs turned up nothing and the protein in eggs destroys any DNA evidence. Other lines of inquiry have suggested that the culprits are taking bad eggs from businesses that throw them away. The attacks are ruining the elderly man’s green two-story house on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago . The attacks have been so frequent that Clemens has been unable to keep up with the clean up . Officers visited local restaurants and outlets to ask about missing eggs. Neighbors have been questioned and fliers have been handed out, but nothing has turned up any leads. ‘The person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped apparently,’ Houser said. ‘I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it.’ Houser said he's never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work. Indeed police involvement seems to do nothing to deter the perpetrators. An officer was hit on the foot by an egg while he was at the house when an attack was launched. ""The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge,"" Houser said. A reward of $500 was offered, and that was then upped to $1,000, but still no one came forward. If caught, the culprit will be charged with felony vandalism and criminal damage, and officers are not ruling out hate crime charges if there is evidence. Clemens (pictured) is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving: ‘I like the neighbourhood. I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house – but it's been kind of a nightmare’ Clemens used to clean up after each attack but hasn’t been able to keep up. Worse, his insurance company will not settle any claim until the attackers are stopped, so no repairs can be made. The harsh winter has offered some respite for the family, as the egg attacks became less frequent. However once warmer weather comes, both Clemens and Euclid police expect the eggings to start again. Clemens is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving from his beloved home despite the onslaught of eggs. ‘I like the neighbourhood. I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house – but it's been kind of a nightmare.’","Albert Clemens Sr’s home first became a target in March 2014, and the attacks have yet to stop, confounding the police in Euclid, Ohio .

"Video emerged today apparently showing the three runaway British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled into Syria to become brides for Islamic State militants. The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy who was yesterday arrested for helping the trio cross the border. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, can be heard talking to an Arabic interpreter about  fake Syrian passports while laden with bags. The girls are said to have first arrived at Istanbul Ataturk Airport before heading to the southern city of Gaziantep close to the Syrian border. From there, they reportedly take a taxi to an arranged meeting point where they are greeted by the spy, named by Turkish media as Muhammed Al Rashad. Scroll down for videos . On the run: New footage has emerged that claims to show three British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled across the border in Syria to become jihadi brides for ISIS militants . Caught on camera: The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy working for the Canadian intelligence service who was arrested on Thursday for helping the trio cross the border . Runaways: Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, are understood to have since reached the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK to join a friend last month . Footage shows him instructing them to take their baggage and not leave anything behind and says they will be in Syria within the hour. Al Rashad can be heard saying 'Come on sisters ... Don't forget anything. You will be there in an hour insh'Allah,' before the girls' luggage is unloaded from the taxi and the trio are helped into a silver minivan. He speaks both English and Arabic in the four minute-long video and his face is visible at several points. Al Rashad then allegedly delivered the girls to ISIS and returns to Turkey, where he is arrested, according to Daily Sabah. Separate footage released by Daily Sabah appears to show Al Rashad being taken into custody in Sanliurfa near the Syrian border. One report said he was a Syrian who was working for the Canadian intelligence service. Another said that he was a dentist. Turkish news agency Dogan said Rashad has been held in solitary confinement in a prison in Sanliurfa province since being caught. Citing his testimony to police, it said he had identified fighters he helped enter Syria to an official at Canada's embassy in Jordan. 'I have no intention of spying. My aim is to prevent terrorist activity,' Dogan quoted him as saying. Rashad also allegedly told the agency he had accompanied at least 25 foreign fighters so far to Gaziantep. He said: 'Border commanders within Islamic State instructed me where to drop these people. I drove them to Gaziantep city centre in a cab and handed them over to others. 'I don't know how and from where they took them to Syria.' Evidence: The secret camera shows an alleged spy working for the Canadian intelligence agency helping the girls with their bags and arranging their fake Syrian passports . Suspect: Separate footage claims to show the Canadian intelligence agent being led to the courthouse by plain-clothed police officers after he was arrested on suspicion of helping the cross into Syria . The film featuring the three girls was confiscated after his arrest. Turkish foreign minister Mehmet Cavusoglu yesterday said the suspect worked for the intelligence agency of a country that is part of the US-led coalition fighting ISIS. But he did not identify the country, saying only that it was not the United States or a member of the European Union. Canada's Office of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness said: 'We are aware of these reports. 'We do not comment on operational matters of national security.' The footage shows the girls walking with another man who is suspected of helping them cross into Syria . Mr Cavusoglu, who was interviewed on Turkish channel A Haber TV, said he had shared the information with his British counterpart - Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Britain's Foreign Office had no immediate comment and a spokesman for the Metropolitan police said he had no information. The schoolgirls are understood to now be in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK last month. It emerged earlier this week that the three girls had paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. A man has been arrested for allegedly helping three British schoolgirls - Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 (above) - cross into Syria to become Jihadi brides for Islamic State militants . The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes . Police discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash. Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year. The former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to Syria and marry a militant fighter. One of the girls, Shamima Begum, used her Twitter account to try to contact her directly, asking for her to open a private line of communication. Friends suspect the girls were in touch with Mahmood and Islamic State recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before Christmas. On the run: (l to r) Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. They are understood to be in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes. They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria. They are now believed to be in Raqqa, Islamic State's stronghold and scene of some of its most barbaric atrocities. Sought advice: Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with Aqsa Mahmood (pictured), a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year . It is thought they were staying with a British girl – believed to be a pupil from their school who went missing in December and is believed to have joined ISIS. The 15-year-old student, the first to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, has not been identified by the authorities. Mark Rowley, who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism, said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the UK. 'We have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences,' he said. Over the weekend it also emerged that letters from Scotland Yard to the girls' families – explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend's disappearance – had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted that 'with the benefit of hindsight' officers should have communicated directly with the families. But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology. However, the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers' actions when they appeared before a committee of MPs earlier this week. Instead, they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children's potential radicalisation. They were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. He accused Scotland Yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in February and their close friend in December. Extreme beliefs: The Al-Khansa Brigade (pictured with automatic weapons) in Raqqa has said children as young as nine should be encouraged to marry and it is women's duty to obey men - who are their masters . Evidence: Khadiza's cousin Fahmida Aziz (left), Shamima's sister Sahima Begum (centre) and Amira's father Hussen Abase (right), appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee earlier this week . The country's top police officer was later forced to apologise to the families over a misplaced letter relating to the fourth girl's disappearance. However, senior figures, led by David Cameron, insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs. 'Everyone has a role to play,' said the Prime Minister. Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond echoed the comments saying: 'Parents have responsibilities, schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators.' At least 22 young women, the vast majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months. Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected. Islamic State seized large swathes of land last June, including territory close to the Turkish border. The U.S.-led coalition is using mostly air power in an attempt to push the Sunni militant group back.","Schoolgirls are heard talking to Arabic interpreter about a Syrian passport .

"The days of long, luxurious showers on holiday could be numbered. That's if the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gets its way. The agency has paid researchers $15,000 (around £10,000) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use in hotel room showers. 'Hotels consume a significant amount of water in the U.S. and around the world,' says a proposal on the EPA's website. The gadget will fit onto hotel shower fixtures and transmit  data back to an accounting system using an app . 'Most hotels do not monitor individual guest water usage and as a result, millions of gallons of potable water are wasted every year by hotel guests.' Which is why they want to create an app to monitor the amount of water hotel guests are using - and, they hope, compel people to shorten their shower time by a minute. The gadget will fit onto existing hotel shower fixtures and transmit water usage data back to a central hotel accounting system using an app, which it is hoped will be doled out in major hotel chains. It will be made up of a flow metre, an embedded system and software, and a resource accounting system, and will allow  hotel guests to monitor their daily water online or using a smartphone app. The EPA has paid researchers $15,000 (around £10,000) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use . The proposal will be marketed to the hotel industry to reduce costs by promoting water conservation among hotel guests. The current average length of shower is estimated to be 8.2 minutes or 17.2 gallons - but it's unknown how hotels will encourage guests to limit this. A spokesperson for the EPA told The Washington Free Beacon that calling for the device was not intended to enable the monitoring of guests shower time. 'It’s ultimately up to hotels to use technology like the monitors being developed at the University of Tulsa. EPA is encouraging creativity with water conservation efforts,' they said.","U.S researchers given £10,000 to develop a device to monitor shower use .

"Kelly Lynn Miller, a fugitive DUI killer who fled to Thailand from America to dodge her prison sentence. She is pictured here  in 2004 . The mother of Australian Brodie Smith, who died after taking a 'miracle' drug addiction cure in Thailand, has claimed the American woman who has been arrested by Thai police worked at the treatment centre that's accountable for her son's death. Diane Tucker says 36-year-old Kelly Lynn Miller, a fugitive DUI killer who fled to Thailand from America to dodge her prison sentence, helped run the centre which provides Ibogaine on Ko Phangan - an island in the Gulf of Thailand, Andrew Drummond reports . Ms Tucker further alleges that Miller, who was reportedly an exotic dancer from Alabama, treated her 33-year-old son and girlfriend Kara Spark last year. Ms Spark also claimed her boyfriend died after taking Ibogaine, which is an African plant with hallucinogenic properties - to 'cure' a drug addiction. According to Ms Spark, Mr Smith said he stopped breathing minutes after he took the drug. But the centre where he was receiving treatment claims he was never administered Ibogaine. Brodie Smith, from Mandurah, died on Ko Phangan - an island in the Gulf of Thailand - as his girlfriend, Kara Spark, watched helplessly as he stopped breathing . Miller admitted drunkenly smashing her car into a truck being driven by Donald Goodwin, 57, killing him instantly - but dodged her prison sentence by fleeing to Thailand . The 36-year-old fugitive was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in Thailand . Local outlet Phuket News pictured her looking nonchalant and resting her head on her hands at the event . Miller admitted drunkenly smashing her car into a truck being driven by Donald Goodwin, 57, killing him instantly - but avoided her prison sentence by fleeing to Thailand. She had pleaded guilty to a charge on vehicular homicide following the 2004 crash in Hoover, Alabama - but flew to the tropical country while on bail, and had been hiding there until Thai authorities tracked her down. Miller was hauled in front of the media by police in Phuket this week. But rather than showing contrition in front of the cameras, she took a moment to put her make-up in order. Local outlet Phuket News pictured her looking nonchalant and resting her head on her hands at the event. This comes after reports that Brodie Smith died a day after he told his girlfriend he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. But before he could propose, the West Australian man died while on a trip to take Ibogaine - a 'miracle' cure for his drug addiction, reportedly ice, derived from an African plant that tribes use as a hallucinogen. Mr Smith died on Ko Phangan - an island in the Gulf of Thailand - as his girlfriend, Kara Spark, watched helplessly as he stopped breathing, the Sydney Morning Herald reported in December. They were in Thailand to get treatment for Mr Smith's drug addiction and were planning the rest of their lives together. Just 24 hours before he died, the man from Mandurah, Western Australia, told Ms Spark he was going to propose to her. Ms Spark said her boyfriend died after ingesting Ibogaine - a hallucinogenic drug from Africa . 'The night before was the most amazing, he said he was going to propose, it was the best feeling I've ever felt, I would say yes, I wanted nothing more then to marry you,' Ms Spark wrote on Facebook. 'I knew Brodie was the one... I've honestly never been happier. 'We celebrated, made plans for 'Brand New' tattoos, this was meant to be a new beginning for Brodie and myself.' Ms Spark said they exchanged vows of love and he 'held me in his arms' that night. But these dreams were shattered when the couple went to the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on October 20. This is where Mr Smith started a treatment program that cost $5,300 and would take place over four days. There are conflicting reports about the circumstances of Mr Smith's death. Ms Spark told Fairfax Media they he was administered his first dose of the African plant at 8.30pm. The plant has been classed by the World Health Assembly as likely to cause harm to humans, and has been identified as having psychedelic and psychoactive properties. Ms Spark claims Mr Smith was given another dose of Ibogaine at 9am the next day. More than two hours later Ms Spark claims Mr Smith was told to take two blue-coloured tablets which was meant to be Valium and make him drowsy. But she claims it all went wrong when Ms Spark said her boyfriend was short of breath 20 minutes later. The hallucinogenic is part of a program to treat drug addiction in Thailand's Ko Phangan island . Ms Spark's (pictured with Mr Smith, right) Facebook is filled with tributes to her 'soulmate' Thongnaipab Beach, Ko Phangan, in Thailand, where the couple were staying when Mr Smith allegedly took Ibogane and died . 'Then he stopped breathing. He was staring at me with his eyes wide open,' Ms Spark said. She then tried to revive him but was unsuccessful in trying to bring him back to consciousness. The director of the Ko Phangan treatment centre Mike Picone told Fairfax Media Mr Smith was never given Ibogaine. Mr Picone claims Mr Smith was battling a methamphetamine addiction and as part of the treatment program he had to be clean for at least five days before he could start taking ibogaine. He said the Australian died in his hotel room after he overdosed 'from injecting illegal narcotics' that Mr Smith brought into Thailand from home. 'After he died his girlfriend, Kara, produced a freshly used syringe and gave it to the police as she was reporting to them that he had shot up in the shower and overdosed,' the director said. The Mandurah man died after he stopped breathing. Ms Spark said she tried to revive him but was not successful . 'All my hopes dreams were shattered and now become impossible,' Ms Spark wrote on her Facebook . The bay at Kho Phangan Island in Thailand, where the couple were staying . Ms Spark denies Mr Picone's version of the events surrounding her boyfriend's death. Her Facebook page is filled with constant tributes to her 'soulmate' who loved to sing in the shower and her chocolate lasagne. 'All my hopes, dreams were shattered and now become impossible,' Ms Spark said. 'I love you so much Brodie Noel Smith with every single part of me.' On her Facebook page dedicated to Mr Smith, Ms Spark wrote she would 'fight to death for justice' as his family calls for a inquest into his death and the use of ibogaine. His mother, Dianne Tucker, said she never wanted what happened to her son to be repeated. 'The parents of anyone with an addiction problem have usually been to hell and back, dealing with all the traumas that come with drug use,' she said.","The mother of Brodie Smith says Kelly Lynn Miller worked at the treatment centre that's accountable for her son's death .

"The University of Texas is investigating claims that their Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter sang the same racist song used by fraternity brothers in Oklahoma. The announcement on Tuesday comes as Parker Rice, the conductor of the University of Oklahoma chant that kicked off a national uproar, says he was taught 'there will never be a n**** SAE' by fraternity brothers. The national headquarters for SAE, one of the biggest fraternities in the US, has issued a statement denying that the racist song was part of a tradition for the organization. New investigation: Officials at the University of Texas are investigating reports that the racist song that caused outrage in Oklahoma was also sung by brothers at Sigma Alpha Epsilon on the Austin campus . Parker Rice, one of the leaders of the racist chant at University of Oklahoma SAE, said he and the other freshmen were taught the song by older fraternity brothers . However, unconfirmed reports have surfaced online that the same tune was sung by SAE brothers in Austin, Texas. And the fraternity, which traces its roots to the pre-Civil War South, admitted it is investigating reports of racist behavior at other chapters around the country. A former SAE brother at Oklahoma State University told Daily Mail Online that pledges were given 'n***** names' and made to ape picking cotton on the front lawn of the fraternity. 'Racism is part of our culture,' he said. And on Tuesday, a University of Oklahoma student told the Today show that she had heard the song two years ago and believed it was a tradition for the fraternity. University of Texas President Bill Powers  on Tuesday said that the dean of students for the Austin campus would look into the reports that the same racist chant was used there, according to the Daily Texan student newspaper. The SAE fraternity was disbanded by the national headquarters and banned from campus by University of Oklahoma officials . FIJI, another fraternity on at the University of Texas, came under fire last month for throwing a 'Border control' party, which was rife with Mexican stereotypes . Rice, a freshman who was first identified by Daily Mail Online as the conductor of the racist Oklahoma chant, said in an apology statement to the Dallas Morning News that: 'Yes, the song was taught to us, but that too doesn’t work as an explanation... For me, this is a devastating lesson and I am seeking guidance on how I can learn from this and make sure it never happens again.' The song, set to the tune of 'If You're Happy and You Know It,' goes: 'There will never be a n***** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** SAE.' The student who spoke to Today show confirmed that she had heard the song before: 'I would definitely say this is not an isolated incident. 'It was really offensive to sit there and listen to that especially because they would just chant it and then laugh after and they thought it was funny.' Powers, the president of the University of Texas, also addressed other reports of racism in the college's fraternity system. These include a February 'border control' party thrown by the FIJI fraternity, which saw revelers wearing sombreros and ponchos and going by stereotypical Mexican names. Additional, he said that a memo from the FIJI that mandates 'no Mexicans' and 'no interracial dating' for pledges has been circulating online for years - and its authenticity has never been confirmed.","University of Texas has commented on reports that the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter in Austin used the same chant as SAE brothers in Oklahoma .

"A woman who hated her nose for 'as long as she can remember' was finally spurred on to go under the knife after a total stranger told her she'd be more beautiful if her feature was made smaller. Speaking about her nose, Kelly Smith, 26, from Essex, told FEMAIL: 'Everyone has body hang-ups growing up. Like all teenage girls, I had plenty. But while I grew out of some of the others and became generally happy with my overall appearance, my nose just seemed to get worse with age. And given that it’s right in the centre of your face, it’s not something you can hide away.' Kelly felt that her feature was too large for her face and never felt able to wear her hair up because she was convinced that her nose dominated her face. Kelly Smith, 26, always felt insecure about her nose, left, and was spurred into researching rhinoplasty after a drunk stranger on a train told her that her nose was 'huge'. She is thrilled with the results, right, and believes the confidence boost has helped her land her dream job . More than the physical impact, was the emotional she experienced. She said: 'I was unhappy with my appearance, and this showed. I could spend ages doing my hair and make-up, but I couldn’t change my nose, I couldn’t hide it. 'I’d never catch a glimpse of myself and smile, no matter how long I spent trying to make myself look good, because my nose dominated and overshadowed everything.' It wasn't until a complete stranger criticised her nose that she decided to do something about it. Kelly says she is 'so glad' she took the plunge and had the surgery done. She applied for a graduate project manager role in construction prior to the procedure, and secured the position post procedure . Kelly says she has achieved what she set out to do and finally feels her facial features are all in proportion . Kelly said that before she made the change, pictured,  no matter how long she spent trying to make herself look good, she couldn't because she felt that her nose dominated and overshadowed everything else . 'I was on a train into London  to meet friends that she when I noticed a drunk man making his way towards me,' she explained. 'I hate situations like that, and tried to shrink into my chair but he was making a beeline for me. The man sat opposite me, and said: ""Wow, you are really beautiful. Except for your nose. It's huge!"" 'I felt like the whole train was watching me as I tried to laugh it off while dying inside from embarrassment. But, finally, someone had said it. I wasn't being paranoid, it was huge. And I needed to hear it.' Kelly said that she finally felt as though she could explore cosmetic surgery with a legitimate reason and it wasn't all in her head. But while she admits the stranger's comment did spur her into looking into getting rhinoplasty, this wasn’t the reason she had the surgery done. For years, Kelly had avoided having photos sideways on and it wasn't until a drunk man on the train pointed it out that she looked into getting something changed . 'To get it done because a drunk stranger commented on it would be silly,' she said. 'Why should I care what he thinks? I had the surgery done for me. For years, my friends had got used to sending photos from nights out and birthdays to me for screening and editing before uploading online. 'For years, I’d avoided having photos sideways on. For years, I’d stood talking to friends, family, strangers wondering if they’d noticed my horrible nose. Finally I decided it was time to bring that to an end. 'Why live like that when cosmetic surgery could put an end to it? I’d watched friends spend money on expensive cars and expensive clothes. I’d always been so careful with money, I’d never really blown money on something selfish. 'I had a good job and money in the bank, and decided it was time I did something that was just for me. The only resolution was cosmetic surgery. And it would be money well spent if it helped improve my confidence and my happiness.' Kelly didn't talk to too many people about the procedure but told her boyfriend, and while she says he loves her for who she is, he was supportive as he just wanted her to be happy. Speaking about her decision to go under the knife, Kelly said: 'For years, I'd avoided having photos sideways on. For years, I'd stood talking to friends, family, strangers wondering if they’d noticed my horrible nose. Finally I decided it was time to bring that to an end' Kelly underwent the procedure at Transform clinic and said she was 'stunned' at the result. She said: 'My nose was smaller, straighter and immeasurably better than it was before. I had been scared that I wouldn’t look like ""me"" any more, but I was wrong. 'While the surgery had altered the look of my whole face, I still looked like me. With my nose now so small and straight, I’d look in the mirror and see my whole face - not just my crooked nose.' Kelly says she is 'so glad' she took the plunge and had the surgery done. She applied for a graduate project manager role in construction prior to the procedure, and secured the position post procedure. One of the reasons she had the surgery was to increase her confidence for a potential role as a woman in construction. She added: 'I have achieved what I set out to do and I finally feel like my facial features are all in proportion. I’ve changed career, and I can say with certainty that the confidence I have gained from having the procedure has had a positive impact on both my working and private life. 'My boyfriend, friends and family have all noticed not just the physical change, but more importantly the emotional change. I am still me - but with a bigger smile.  I now have the nose I feel I should have been born with.' Kelly didn't talk to too many people about the procedure but told her boyfriend, and while she says he loves her for who she is, he was supportive as he just wanted her to be happy .","Kelly Smith, 26, from Essex, was always insecure about her big nose .

"Top Obama administration officials continue to consult with disgraced former CIA Director David Petraeus about how to fight the ISIS terror army, even though he has admitted giving classified material to his biographer and mistress. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest admitted to reporters on Monday that Petraeus, the architect of President George W. Bush's Iraq 'surge' operation, is still on speed dial despite reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors. 'He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq,"" Earnest said during a press briefing. 'So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . TOO IMPORTANT TO FAIL? Josh Earnest told journalists on Monday that administration officials were still consulting with disgraced former CIA chief David Petraeus about fighting the ISIS terror army in Iraq . AFFAIR: Petraeus will plead guilty to a charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified information after he handed over sensitive material to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, right . Earnest defended the decision by noting that Petraeus – who no longer has a CIA security clearance, according to Newsweek – nonetheless has kept up his strong relationships with military and political leaders in Iraq. 'Obviously, General Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq,' the president's chief spokesman said. 'He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country. Over that time, he developed strong relationships with some of his Iraqi counterparts and with some of Iraq's political leaders.' Iraq is one of the two countries – Syria is the other – where ISIS, the self-anointed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, has managed to run roughshod over government armies and claim territory since the Obama administration pulled American troops out at the end of 2011. A retired four-star general, Petraeus' storied career suffered a major blow from revelations he gave the biographer, Paula Broadwell, eight binders of classified material he had kept improperly. Documents filed in federal court state that between August 2011 and April 5, 2013, Petraeus did 'unlawfully and knowingly' take classified materials and retain them at 'unauthorized' locations. In one August 2011 taped biographical interview with Broadwell that prosecutors used against Petraeus, he can be heard saying of papers in front of them both: 'They're really – I mean they are highly classified, some of them. They don’t have [""top secret""] on it, but, I mean there’s ""code word"" stuff in there.' Prosecutors say he gave her classified binders, called 'black books,' which included notes about his discussions with President Obama. He left the books with her so she could use them as source material for the biography, prosecutors said. Days later, Petraeus brought the books back to his home in Arlington, Virginia. The FBI later seized the materials in a search of Petraeus' home. He later lied to FBI agents about providing them to Broadwell and said he never gave her classified material, according to court documents. In late August 2011, he took the books to the home where Broadwell was staying during a week-long trip to Washington, D.C., according to the documents. The 62-year-old agreed on February 22 to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count that carries a possible sentence of up to a year in prison. But he is expected to get two years of probation and a $40,000 fine. The plea agreement was filed in federal court on March 3. Petraeus is expected to be in federal court next on April 27 for a hearing on the deal. Earnest was asked if any special security precautions were being taken because of Petraeus' legal situation. 'Not that I'm aware of,' he replied. The federal judge who will sentence Petraeus later this year is not bound by federal prosecutors' recommendations and could make a decision to send Petraeus to prison. By reaching a deal with the government, Petraeus will avoid an embarrassing trial that would detail his relationship with Paula Broadwell. He stepped down as head of the CIA after their affair emerged in November 2012. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012 . Scandal: The affair was revealed after Florida socialite Jill Kelley, pictured, contacted the FBI over threatening emails she had received. It emerged that Broadwell had sent the emails . Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012. But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails. The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two. As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down. In May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the affair. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC. 'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Petraeus was a celebrated general who was credited with helping pull Iraq from the brink of an all-out civil war. President Barack Obama turned to him to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan before moving to him to the CIA in 2011.","Top Obama administration officials are still seeking Petraeus' advice about Middle East terrorism even though he has agreed to plead guilty .

"Monty Python member Eric Idle attended the Royal School Wolverhampton . A £29,000-a-year boarding school will scrap all its fees this September to become one of David Cameron's latest free schools. The Royal School Wolverhampton, whose former pupils include the Monty Python member Eric Idle, will become a state school – with no fees to attend. The boarding school was one of 49 new free schools announced by the Prime Minister yesterday as part of a major expansion of the policy which allows schools to be set up by community groups including parents, charities or teachers. An extra 500 free schools will be opened by 2020 under a Conservative government, Mr Cameron said. The Royal School Wolverhampton is the latest of several private schools to scrap fees and take state funding via the free schools programme. The most prestigious was Liverpool College, while others included William Hulme Grammar School in Manchester, Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School in Blackburn, and Chetwynde School in Barrow in Furness. Pupils at the school who don’t board currently pay fees of £13,230 – but this will fall to nothing from September. Families of children who board will see their fees drop to a boarding charge of between £10,000 and £14,000 a year. The school, in grounds of 25 acres, currently has 538 pupils, of whom 139 are boarders. As a state school it will expand to 1,200 children, with boarders dropping slightly to around 110. Free schools were introduced in 2010 to allow parents and community groups to set up their own schools. They are independent from local authorities but must still undergo Ofsted inspections. Supporters say they help to drive up standards by creating competition with existing schools, but Labour has opposed their creation in areas with a surplus of places where they are not needed. The new plan to open at least 500 of the schools by 2020 mean an extra 270,000 places. In a speech in London, Mr Cameron said: 'If you vote Conservative, you will see the continuation of the free schools programme at the rate you've seen in the last three years. 'That means, over the next parliament, we hope to open at least 500 new free schools resulting in 270,000 new school places. 'Remember - we're the only party that is committed to this. The only party that's opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children. The Royal School Wolverhampton was one of 49 new free schools announced by the Prime Minister yesterday . 'And isn't that what every parent wants - a great education for their child? You deserve the security of knowing your child is getting just that. And with the Conservatives you should expect nothing less.' He also backed the idea of existing grammar schools. Taking questions from the audience, Mr Cameron was asked about comments he made in 2007 that a 'pledge to build more grammar schools would be an electoral albatross'. He insisted: 'I have never said that grammar schools are an albatross, grammar schools are good schools and I like good schools. I want there to be good schools for people to send their children to. 'What I've said about grammar schools is, like other schools that are good, if they want to expand they should be able to expand. I have been very consistent about that.' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said she would not allow free schools to make a profit, despite the move being supported by her predecessor Michael Gove. She said she wanted each school to 'make the right choice for them' about whether to become a free school or academy. David Cameron talks with school children during a visit to The Green School for girls in west London today . Asked if she could rule out a Tory government allowing free schools to make a profit, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Yes I can rule it out, I think having for profit education is something that would make me feel very uncomfortable and it is not something that is needed. 'We have excellent sponsors like charities and others or parent groups wanting to run schools and they are doing an excellent job up and down the country.' Mrs Morgan's insistence that there would be no profit-making schools for the whole of the next parliament suggests a shift in policy from her predecessor. Mr Gove, who lost his job as Education Secretary in July, had advocated allowing profit-making to encourage companies to set up successful free schools. In May 2012 he said: 'It's my belief that we could move to that situation but at the moment it's important to recognise that the free schools movement is succeeding without that element and I think we should cross that bridge when we come to it.' Labour has criticised the free schools policy, claiming it can lead to money being channelled to areas where there is a surplus of school places instead of being targeted at areas where classes are overcrowded.","Royal School Wolverhampton will become a state school this year .

"Rory Seager (pictured outside court) attempted to rob the bookmakers by claiming the tin of pilchards he was carrying was a bomb . A hopeless robber has been spared jail after he tried to hold up a bookmaker's shop with a tin of pilchards. Rory Seager, 18, owed a friend £1,800 and spent the day ploughing his last pennies into roulette machines hoping to win the money until he was down to his last pound. The 6ft 4in teenager then hit upon a plan to rob the bookies, where he was a regular customer. He bought a 99p tin of John West pilchards from his local corner shop and burst into a William Hill in Ilford, Essex, on 20 December last year. Seager demanded cash and claimed the tin of fish in tomato sauce he had in a black bag was a lethal explosive device, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. 'I've got a bomb,' he told astonished cashier Adeyemi Awomudu, who simply walked off into a secure room at the back of the shop. Seager hurled his fishy snack across the shop in frustration and left. Mr Awomudu had recognised him and Seager was arrested shortly afterwards, confessing to his bungled plan immediately at the police station. He admitted attempted robbery and one count of communicating false information about a bomb hoax. Edward Franklin, prosecuting, said: 'In respect of the bomb hoax, this wasn't a classic bomb hoax in that the security services weren't alerted and there's no evidence that any action was taken by the authorities. 'Both my learned friend and I agree that this is best dealt with as an attempted robbery - you can say you have a knife or a gun, in this case it was a tin of pilchards masquerading as a bomb.' Judge Karl King remarked: 'The thing that moved the man behind the counter to go behind the safe and into the secure room was undoubtedly the belief that the defendant had a bomb.' Caroline Carberry, defending, said Seager he had been suffering from diagnosed but untreated depression and psychosis at the time of the incident, and has Tourette's Syndrome. 'These are serious offences and I accept the custody threshold has been passed, and normally these types of offences would merit an immediate sentence of imprisonment.' She continued: 'He's far from someone who fits the profile of a robber of a small business, it's a great irony that Rory Seager went into a bookmaker somewhere he frequented, somewhere he was known - he knew the man behind the counter.' She added that Seager's own mother also works at a bookies, and the fact that he chose to rob a similar premises to his mother's indicated he 'hadn't given it much thought'. In a letter to the judge, Seager wrote: 'I just want the judge to know I need help and I will be an outstanding member of my community.' Ms Carberry added: 'This was entirely out of character, this was an aberration in this young man's life.' Seager was attempting to rob the William Hill in Ilford (pictured), which he had frequented as a customer . Sentencing Seager to a two-year suspended sentence, two year's supervision by the probation service and ordering him to undergo mental health treatment, Judge King said: 'There can be absolutely no doubt that what you did was to commit a very serious offence.' The court heard Seager threw the tin of pilchards across the shop in frustration when his plan to pretend it was a bomb failed . He added: 'One can only imagine how petrified he must have been. 'You secreted this item in a black bag, no doubt to give it a more convincing air to what you were doing.' He continued: 'You are young man suffering from a number of psychological conditions that had gone untreated, but you had got to the age of 18 without having descended into criminal activity. 'The disorders from which you suffered were long standing disorders and one can only commend members of your family for being able to cope for so long. 'It is in that context I have to decide how I want to deal with you, I'm satisfied that the custody threshold has been passed - what I am about to do is exceptional and does not reduce the gravity of your offence you committed. 'I am persuaded that I can suspend the sentence.' Judge King also barred him from an betting shop for the next 12 months and ordered him to pay a £100 surcharge. Seager, of Ilford, wiped away tears as his sentence was read out and thanked the judge before leaving the dock. One of Seager's family members shouted 'You are a just and a fair man your honour' as the judge left the bench.","Rory Seager attempted to rob a bookmakers' as he owed a friend money .

"A former banker who ran an insider trading scheme described as the worst to ever come before an Australian court has been jailed for seven years after making $7 million. Lukas James Kamay, 26, used leaked market sensitive data provided before its official release by Christopher Russell Hill, 25, to make  millions on the stock market. He used some of the money to buy an apartment renovated on the Nine Network's television show The Block, before his assets were frozen by federal police. Scroll down for video . Lukas James Kamay, 26, used market sensitive data to make $7 million on the stock market to try to buy an apartment renovated on the Nine Network's television show The Block . Kamay from Clifton Hill, north-west of Melbourne, pleaded guilty to six charges of insider trading, one charge of money laundering and two charges of identity theft. He must serve four years and six months before being eligible for parole. Hill, from Belconnen in the ACT, was jailed for three years and three months, with a minimum of two years to be served, for providing embargoed Australian Bureau of Statistics data to Kamay. However, he was unaware of the extent of Kamay's trading. Kamay and Hill had agreed to use the ABS data to make about $200,000 which, after the proper taxes were paid, would result in a net profit of about $50,000 each. Kamay used some of the money to buy an apartment renovated by twins Alisa and Lysandra on the Nine Network's television show The Block . The market sensitive data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics was provided to Kamay before its official release by Christopher Russell Hill (pictured) After a series of trades that netted the pair about $195,000, including some deliberate losses to mimic a normal trade, Kamay opened additional accounts he hid from Hill. The former banker used some of the money to successfully bid $2.375 million on a three bedroom apartment renovated by twins Alisa and Lysandra on The Block. He paid a $500,000 deposit on the Albert Park apartment. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said Kamay's earnings constituted the largest insider trading profit to come before an Australian court. 'Mr Hill had no idea you, Mr Kamay, had gone so far beyond the original $200,000 limit,' she said.

"Australian bat-lovers and conservationists are mourning the loss of an infant flying fox named Charlotte. Charlotte, also known as Little Miss Charlotte, was in the care of Batzilla the Bat, a bat rescue group in Brisbane, for a little over a month before the baby bat was found to have liver issues and her carers were forced to have her euthanized. Though the rescue group takes in many orphaned bats, usually rehabilitating them and releasing them back into the wild, Charlotte was different. Scroll down for video . Charlotte: Australian bat-lovers and conservationists are mourning the loss of an infant flying fox named Charlotte who was euthanized due to liver issues . Condolences: Here, Denise Wade, a videographer and carer with Batzilla, writes on the group's Facebook page about condolences she has received since Charlotte's passing . Rescued in January, the flying fox captured the hearts of bat lovers as her carers posted videos and updates of her progress on the group's Facebook page. Little Miss Charlotte weighed just under two ounces when carers with Batzilla rescued her after a homeowner found the infant bat lying in a gutter, according to the group's Facebook page. Charlotte's parents fell victim to heavy rains in Brisbane that damaged the flying fox population, according to PEOPLE Pets. 'Dehydrated, skinny, and crying for her mum,' Denise Wade, a videographer and carer with Batzilla, wrote, the little bat would have died. Massage:Here, Charlotte is seen in a video posted to Batzilla the Bat's YouTube account being massaged by a carer . The group shared Charlotte's story on the Facebook page and described her rescue as a 'little miracle,' the post was accompanied by a video of little Charlotte being cradled in the hands of one of the group's carers. From the very first post, it was clear to see that little Charlotte was special. The post of Charlotte's rescue story, along with the video, has since amassed more than 800,000 views, more than 14,000 'likes,' and more than 17,000 shares. Since the group announced her rescue, Charlotte's little face has graced the group's Facebook page and YouTube account numerous times with videos of Charlotte being massaged, fed, bathed and more. Her videos and posts on the page have amassed, in total, more than 7 million views, more than 200,000 shares, and more than 200,000 'likes.' Baby Bats: About 300 baby bats are orphaned every year in Australia after their mothers die of starvation or illness . A Facebook post indicates that Charlotte was euthanized in the morning on Feb. 21. In the post Wade wrote that the decision to euthanize little Charlotte was not an easy one and that she cried like a 'big girl.' 'We will never know if her ailment was a result of her prematurity or whether she was just born a little different,' Wade wrote, 'but either way, we had to do the right thing by Charlotte as her long term prognosis was poor.' The comment section of the post is riddled with condolences from more than 1,000 Facebook users who followed Charlotte's short journey with the rescue group. Just two days after Wade announced that Charlotte had been euthanized, she returned with another Facebook post expressing gratitude for the outpouring of support she received from bat-lovers via Facebook. Wade wrote in part: 'Words cannot express my deep gratitude at the outpouring of love and inspiration at Miss Charlotte's passing. My most heartfelt appreciation to all my Facebook friends for your words of comfort and solace.'","Australian bat-lovers and bat conservationists are mourning the loss of an infant flying fox named Charlotte .

Travel company Adventure Canada has lined up three authors to present their work on a 13-day voyage this summer, with prices starting at $5,000 per person. Kathleen Winter, who wrote the 2011 novel, Annabel -- set in a small coastal town in Labrador -- is one of the authors that will join passengers aboard the Ocean Endeavour that sets sail on July 5. Reading while riding: Adventure Canada's Arctic-bound cruise ship promises an on board book club . Triple-bill: The 13-day cruise is hosted by Canadian superstar authors Doug Gibson, Kathleen Winter and Terry Fallis . Setting sail to sell: Terry Fallis will present the first of his four national bestselling books on the cruise . The cruise will visit parts of Labrador, as well as the remote Newfoundland – perfect for spotting whales, polar bears and seals. The two other authors include Doug Gibson, who wrote Stories About Storytellers, and Terry Fallis, a novelist best known for his political satire called The Best Laid Plans. And with 24 hours of daylight during the Arctic summer months, the 198 passengers will have plenty of time to read each book. Though, some have suggested that it is not actually necessary to read the books in order to enjoy the cruise.

"As one of the UK’s most popular fast food chains, it sells almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. But now conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23million chickens a year can be shown for the first time. The images show tens of thousands of chickens kept together in huge sheds, alive for just 35 days before they are gassed. Scroll down for video . Life on the farm: Supplier Andrew in the shed filled with 34,00 chickens destined for the fast food chain KFC . The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed . A documentary tonight shows the birds living amid their excrement in conditions activists say are ‘oppressive’ – but the farmer in charge claims it’s ‘a very good life’. Footage to be screened this evening on BBC1 focuses on one farm where about 34,000 chickens are penned into a shed with few windows. When they are large enough the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to warehouses in large trays where they are then distributed to branches nationwide. The farmer in charge claimed the birds had 'a very good life' and showed how they were healthy . Farms supply KFC with around 23 million chickens each year and its chains sell almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. At one farm around 34,000 chickens are penned into sheds with few windows . About 1,000 farms in the country supply KFC with 23million chickens a year. The programme focuses on a farmer called Andrew who says the chickens at his farm – left to do nothing but eat and drink until they reach the required weight – have a good life, saying he ‘wouldn’t mind being a chicken in here’. Scenes show the chickens as they walk around in their own excrement while a layer of sawdust has turned murky brown from mopping up waste. Asked if he thinks this is a problem, Andrew says: ‘No, no, no, that’s not a problem at all, because you see here, this is all sawdust, so the idea is to keep this as dry as possible.’ The supplier, who has 35 years’ experience, says: ‘As you can see, they’ve got beautifully clean feet and that is a good sign that these birds are healthy and they’ve been grown on good litter. You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can’t think there’s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.’ Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: ‘No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.’ Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were ‘oppressive’. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, said: ‘These birds have no meaningful life. They endure a wretched existence in giant windowless sheds stinking with ammonia. A very large number die from starvation or dehydration. About 900million of these birds are produced in country each year about 30million-plus die in the sheds. When the chickens are large enough they are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to the warehouses in large trays . The trays of chicken are then distributed to KFC branches nationwide and sold to customers . This is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. The fast food chain say animal welfare is 'essential' Fast food: One of KFC's branches. KFC say that all their suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements . ‘Millions of these birds, just like the ones KFC is commissioning to be produced die in sheds wretchedly and painfully every year. ‘These birds are deprived of everything that makes life worth living. The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter. A great number suffer broken bones during this process.’ A BBC spokesman said the documentary offers ‘an impartial look at KFC, one of the UK’s most recognisable businesses’. It is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. A KFC spokesman said: ‘Animal welfare is essential for high quality food and is important to our customers, and all of KFC’s suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements.

"Serious failings in NHS care for cancer patients have been laid bare by three separate reports. They reveal waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years, there is an 'unacceptable' postcode lottery in treatment and how Britain spends far less on new drugs than elsewhere in the Western world. Today the NHS will also announce which life-extending medications will be axed from its Cancer Drugs Fund because they are too expensive. Avastin, which is used for bowel and ovarian cancers, is one of the drugs at risk of being cut . Meanwhile GPs in the South of England have complained that NHS managers are delaying patients from having cancer tests to meet waiting times targets. As MPs warned that cancer care on the NHS had been 'diluted' and was 'going backwards', a string of reports revealed how: . ÷ A total of 18,740 patients in January waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer. The figure from Public Health England represents a 40 per cent increase in a year and the highest number since February 2008. ÷ There is 'unacceptable' and 'unexplained' variation in cancer detection and treatment across England – particularly for the elderly. ÷ Evidence emerged showing the NHS spends less on new cancer treatments than the US, Spain, Germany and Scotland. The report by data analysts blamed NICE, the medications rationing body, for turning down too many drugs which are not deemed 'cost-effective'. Not all the patients waiting for screening, such as CT scans, X-rays and ultrasounds, will have cancer. However, it is crucial diagnosis happens as quickly as possible so any tumours found can be removed or treated before they spread. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is chairman of the committee, said that despite the increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer, the money being ploughed into the services had declined . Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe and this has partly been blamed on late diagnosis as well as lack of availability of effective treatments. A report by the Public Accounts Committee warned of a postcode lottery in cancer detection and treatment across England. MPs were particularly concerned about the care for older patients – the group most at risk of cancer – who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery as they are thought to be too frail. Andy Burnham, Labour's health spokesman, said: 'Cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need' Jevtana (cabazitaxel) Use: Advanced prostate cancer. Benefit: Extends survival for an average of three months but some men have lived for three more years. Cost: Around £22,000. Zaltrap (aflibercept) Use: Bowel cancer. Benefit: Gives six weeks extra survival. Cost: £6,000. Avastin (bevacizumab) Use: Bowel and ovarian cancers. Benefit: Prolongs life for between five and nine months. Cost: £12,000 for bowel and £16,000 for ovarian cancer. Tykerb (lapatinib) Use: Breast cancer. Benefit: Four months extra survival. Cost: £1,600 a month. Alimta (pemetrexed) Use: Lung cancer. Benefit: Three months extra life. Cost: £7,000. Yondelis (trabectedin) Use: Ovarian cancer. Benefit: Average survival increased by six months. Cost: £57,000. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who is chairman of the committee, said that despite the increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer, the money being ploughed into the services had declined. 'Focus on cancer has also been diluted at a local level,' she said, adding: 'It is unacceptable that NHS England does not understand the reasons why access to treatment and survival rates are considerably poorer for older people.' A report by the IMS Institute – an international firm which analyses data around the world – reveals how the NHS in England spends less on new cancer treatments per patient compared to Scotland, Sweden, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, the US, Italy and Spain. It allocates an average of £7,671 per new cancer patient compared to £16,661, the highest of the ten countries. Juliet Bouverie, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'Cancer care in England is in urgent need of improvement.' Sarah Woolnough, of Cancer Research UK, said: 'It is depressing that too many patients are waiting longer than they should.' Andy Burnham, Labour's health spokesman, said: 'Cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need. This slump in cancer standards is a scandal that needs to be stopped.' It comes as GPs in the South of England have accused hospital managers of downgrading patients' cancer risk to meet waiting time targets. It means that instead of being seen in two weeks, patients could have to wait up to six months. A letter obtained by Pulse magazine reveals how NHS officials have written to hospitals in Dorset and Hampshire warning them that the practice is 'inappropriate' and 'against patients' best interests'. The Department of Health claimed that waiting times for scans are increasing because more patients are being referred by GPs. A spokesman said that five million more tests had been carried out last year compared to 2010 adding that cancer survival was at 'record levels'.","18,740 patients in January waited longer than six weeks for cancer tests .

"Scott Kelly and his girlfriend will be giving a whole new meaning to the term 'long-distance relationship' when he sets off for a 12-month trip to the International Space Station on Saturday. 'For me it's like the most romantic long-distance relationship ever,' the NASA astronaut's girlfriend of five years, Amiko Kauderer, told ABC News. Kelly, who has spent a total of six months away from Kauderer on previous trips to space, will be able to call her whenever he likes and will be able to video chat  once a week. But they both know what they'll miss. Scroll down for video . Long distance relationship: Astronaut Scott Kelly will leave for the International Space Station for a 12-month mission on March 28, leaving his girlfriend of five years, Amiko Kauderer, right, behind on Earth . Mission: The couple, pictured, said it will be tough but that they know it is for a greater good . 'It's the human touch thing,' she told WFMY. 'We get to connect on phone calls. We get to have our face conference. I can upload videos. But you can't upload human touch.' Kauderer, 41, works in NASA's public affairs department in Webster, Texas; she has been with the agency since 1998. Last year the fitness fanatic tried out to become a Houston Texans cheerleader, but failed to make the squad. Scott, 51, who has two young daughters from a previous relationship, said he will miss food on Earth as well as 'the rain, the breeze, the change of seasons'. But 'most of my concerns with this flight, being gone for a year, is the stuff that can happen to people on Earth while I'm gone,' he told CBS Sunday Morning. Still, the couple say they are more excited about Kelly's return home and what his record-breaking trip will achieve. 'We kind of really appreciate challenge and things that are hard, because we often know at the end of it, that you can kind of go, ""Yeah, we DID that,"" you know?' Kauderer said. 'And the homecoming's really good after a year,' Kelly quipped. Left behind: Speaking from their Houston, Texas home, the couple agreed they would miss human touch during the 12 months apart but were already looking forward to the homecoming . Family: Kelly said he also worries about being away from his two daughters from a previous marriage . Kelly, together with Russians Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka, will launch from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in the early hours of Saturday. The trip will test how the human body copes with prolonged space travel by comparing Kelly's health to that of his identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, who will remain on Earth. Called the Nasa Twin Study, the Kellys will be subjected to 10 experiments in four areas: human physiology, behavioral health, microbiology and molecular. 'Maybe there is a little cliff out there that you fall off with regards to the radiation, bone mass, bone density, those type of things, so, I am all in,' Mark told ABC News. Still, Mark, who is married to former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, says he has no intentions of consuming bland space-type food or working out and running two hours a day on a treadmill, as his brother will be doing in space. 'This is a chance in a lifetime,’ said Dr Craig Kundrot, the deputy chief scientist of Nasa's Human Research Program. Giant leaps: Scott Kelly, pictured right, will undergo tests to compare his health to that of his identical twin brother, Mark Kelly, left, himself a retired astronaut, to see how being in space affects the body . Close:  Mark Kelly, pictured left as he joked around with his brother after a news conference in the Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on Thursday, said he would not be eating the same diet  as his twin . 'In this case we've got two genetically identical individuals and we can monitor what kind of changes occur in Mark in an ordinary lifestyle and compare those to the changes that we see in Scott.' By staying on the station for 12 months, the astronauts will also provide key information on how an eventual Mars mission - estimated to last three years there and back - might play out. A mission to the red planet will require long periods of time in reduced-gravity environments, both in space and on the surface of the red planet. But, until now, crew members have only spent about six months on the Space Station at a time. Kelly and Kornienko will spend 12 months in space, while Padalka will be there for just six months. They will travel there on the Soyuz spaceshuttle. Kornienko, 54, a former paratrooper from Moscow, will also leave a wife, Irina, on Earth.  His 32-year-old daughter is a new mother. Team: Kelly is pictured with Russian Cosmonauts Gennady Padalka (center) and Mikhail Kornienko (right), who will travel with him. Only he and Kornienko will remain on the space station for 12 months . New digs: Scott Kelly, 51, sits inside a Soyuz simulator at a training center earlier this month . The Soyuz TMA-16M spacecraft is seen on its launch pad at the Baikonur cosmodrome ahead of its mission . Getting ready: An Orthodox priest blesses the Soyuz rocket at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday . His wife cried when she learned in 2012 that he'd be leaving Earth for a whole year. And she's still not happy about it, Kornienko previously told the AP. 'She understands that it's a dangerous mission. But she's getting used to the idea,' he said. On his trip, Padalka will break the record for cumulative time spent in space, which currently stands at 803 days, and will also become the first person to command the station four times. The three will join Expedition 43 Commander Terry Virts of Nasa and his crewmates, Anton Shkaplerov of Roscosmos and Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa. See below for video . Scott Kelly . This will be the fourth spaceflight for Mr Kelly, 51, a former Nasa shuttle commander and Navy test pilot whose identical twin brother, Mark, also was chosen as an astronaut in 1996. The two will conduct many of the same medical experiments over the coming year so scientists can compare the results. Scott Kelly's first two flights were aboard shuttles. He spent more than five months on the space station in 2010 to 2011. It was during that mission that his sister-in-law, then Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, nearly died after being shot in the head in Tucson, Arizona. Once he's back home in Houston, Kelly imagines it will be 'hard to walk away' from spaceflight. He'd love to pilot one of the new US spacecraft in development. But he figures if he cuts in front of other astronauts awaiting assignments, 'someone will run me over with their car.' What will Kelly miss the most, besides his loved ones? The weather. 'It never changes on the space station,' he said. 'Even though it's a pretty nice environment, I guess it's like living in Southern California, people get sick of it ... after a while.' Mikhail Kornienko . It will be the second space mission for Mr Kornienko, 54, a former paratrooper whose helicopter-pilot father was part of the search and rescue team for the first Soviet cosmonauts back in the 1960s. His father brought back souvenirs from the returning Soyuz capsules: uneaten food rations and pieces of the orange silky parachutes used for the final descent. 'Mom made gorgeous skirts out of them,' he said. 'I still have a small piece of one of those parachutes. 'I cherish it as if it were something sacred.' A religious man, Mr Kornienko is taking into orbit a folding icon depicting the Madonna and Child. His previous station stay was in 2010, 12 years after his selection as a cosmonaut. He figures he'll miss the same things he dreamed about last time he flew: water not in the form of blobs as in space, but water you can swim in, as well as grass, forests and fields. Mr Kornienko already says he'd take on another one-year mission — after a break, of course.","Scott Kelly will leave Earth on Saturday for a 12-month trip to the International Space Station with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko .

"Chinese tourists have found themselves in more hot water in Thailand – where they have a strained relationship with locals – after a group was photographed washing their feet in public sinks. The photos are circulating on Thai and Chinese social media networks, leading to outrage in Thailand as locals insist the holidaymakers have committed a cultural faux pas. The images of tourists cleaning their feet and sandals inside a bathroom on the island of Phi Phi were snapped just weeks after Thailand’s government released an etiquette guide for Chinese holidaymakers following a series of incidents. Locals said the visitors committed a cultural sin by cleaning their feet and sandals in  hand basins . In response to the outrage, authorities on the holiday island are keen to inform Chinese tourists that they are committing a cultural sin by washing their feet in hand basins, Phuketwan reported. The news website said locals avoid cleaning their feet in places where they wash the rest of their bodies, except in the shower. An island official told NetEase, a Chinese media agency, that the holidaymakers’ actions were ‘inappropriate’ and that notices will be posted in public bathrooms to discourage the behaviour. Thailand is a popular destination for millions of Chinese tourists every year, but locals have expressed frustration and outrage in response to the actions of a handful of visitors. Last month, Thailand’s tourist board announced that it would be handing out etiquette manuals to Chinese tourists who were visiting during the Chinese New Year. The relationship between Thais and Chinese tourists has been strained by a series of high-profile incidents . The manuals outlined how the holidaymakers are expected to behave while they visit Thailand. They were created after the Thai government received complaints from locals, who accused Chinese visitors of defecating in public, causing traffic accidents with reckless driving, and defacing tourist attractions. Chinese tourists were temporarily banned from even entering Wat Rong Khun, the Buddhist White Temple in Chiang Rai, after complaints that they had ruined the toilets.","Holidaymakers were photographed in bathroom on island of Phi Phi .

"A council has been forced to issue a ‘complete and utter’ apology for squandering over £500,000 of taxpayers’ money. Forest of Dean District Council accepted a humiliating motion criticising it for ‘scandalous waste’ over the past eight years after an ambush by Labour members. They forced through the vote, demanding an ‘unqualified apology’, when the ruling Conservatives were left short of numbers at a meeting this week. Forest of Dean District Council was forced to apologise for squandering over £500,000 on renovation work . The council was criticised for spending nearly £400,000 on renovating a reception area at its offices and another £120,000 on demolishing a building which they failed to sell and which has lain empty for four years. It was also attacked for shutting the district’s tourism information offices and imposing charges for pest control, bulk waste and garden waste collections and car parking. The apology has already been posted on the authority’s website and in press releases. Labour councillor Di Martin, who introduced the motion, said the Conservative administration, which has run the council in Gloucestershire for eight years, ‘has failed miserably to listen to the people of the Forest of Dean and as a result they have been badly let down, an unqualified apology is due’. Tory council leader Patrick Molyneux explained his party had abstained from voting against the embarrassing motion . She added: ‘An apology is needed for the scandalous waste of taxpayers’ money on the refurbishment of the district council’s reception area [at a cost of £383,320]. ‘The cost of refurbishment was meant to be recouped by the sale of Lawnstone House, which is now to be demolished at a further cost of £120,000.’ Last night Tory council leader Patrick Molyneux explained why his party had abstained from voting against the embarrassing motion, which he dismissed as a ‘blatant piece of electioneering’. ‘We didn’t take part in the debate. We were down on our numbers and we weren’t sure we’d have the support to win in the chamber so we didn’t vote,’ he said. ‘We don’t regret it because it’s a stupid motion – it’s ill-founded and if anybody should hang their head in shame it is Di Martin. ‘We were voted the most-improved council in the country in 2013 and if that’s something we should apologise for, she’s completely lost the plot.’ Mr Molyneux added that the renovation work to the council’s offices – which included £13,550 to replace a CCTV system – was essential as it made the building more accessible to the disabled. ‘It does seem like a lot but the old block where the reception was wasn’t disabled friendly. If she thinks that’s a waste of money, she’s missing the plot.’ Independent members of the council criticised the ‘mud-slinging contest’ between the two main parties.","Forest of Dean District Council was criticised for its 'scandalous waste'

"Antonello Tonna (pictured) has witnessed two tragedies after being aboard the Costa Fascinosa yesterday and the Costa Concordia in 2012 . The pianist on board a cruise ship from which three passengers were killed in the Tunisian museum massacre was also aboard the Costa Concordia when it capsized, it has emerged. In a remarkable coincidence, Antonello Tonna told today how he was on board the Costa Fascinosa when the shootout began at the Bardo Museum in Tunis yesterday. The anguished musician, who did not disembark the ship, had only just returned to playing at sea following the trauma of the Concordia disaster in January 2012. He described it as a 'tragic destiny' that he had been involved in the two harrowing incidents, in the space of just three years. According to The Telegraph, he told Italian media: 'Mine is a tragic destiny - to be called by journalists once again about a drama that I have been involved in. 'I'm reliving the same powerful emotions that I went through during the sinking of the Concordia.' Mr Tonna told how he had returned to sea earlier this year after a three-year hiatus. 'After three years I decided to go back because I missed the ships,' he told RAI state television. Mr Tonna also told how he had stayed on the ship when it docked in Tunis, but later heard about the attack through a text message from his wife. He said he subsequently saw teary, shaken passengers returning to their cabins. Three passengers from the ship were killed - four Italians and a Russian - and eight others were injured. 'There was a great deal of apprehension, with passengers glued to their mobiles trying to get information,' he said. 'We are hugging each other more. I have to say, there is a lot, a lot of solidarity.' The Fascinosa left port Thursday morning, bound for Spain's Palma de Mallorca, where passengers would be allowed to disembark and go home on Costa's tab if they want to cut short the cruise. A window of the Bardo Museum is filled with bullet holes after the shootout which claimed the lives of 23 people. Mr Tonna learned of the massacre after receiving a text message from his wife . Hostages flee the museum during the Tunisian special forces raid which ended in the death of both gunmen . Tunisian security forces secured the area after gunmen attacked the famed Bardo Museum yesterday . Costa said it was suspending Tunisian stops for future Costa cruises. 'The security of our guests and crew is Costa Crociere's priority and a necessary condition for calm and pleasant vacations,' it said. Earlier, Michael Thamm, the group's chief executive of Costa Group, released a statement condemning the 'barbaric and horrific terror attack'. He said: 'With great sadness we regret to report that three passengers of the Costa Fascinosa are amongst the victims of this barbaric and horrific terror attack in Tunis, and a further eight guests are injured. Mr Tonna was also on board the Costa Concordia (pictured) when it capsized off Giglio in January 2012 . 'In addition, two remain unaccounted for. We strongly condemn the attack on democratic Tunisia. 'Our deepest sympathy and our condolences go to the victims and their families. We share their sorrow. Our team in Tunis is currently taking care of the companions of the victims and the eight guests who are being treated in hospitals.' Another Mediterranean-based cruise ship, MSC Splendida, also had passengers in town at the time of the attack. British solicitor Sally Adey, one of the ship's passengers, was killed in the massacre. The MSC ship also left Tunis early Thursday, bound for Barcelona. Thirty-two people were killed when the Costa Concordia ran aground in the seas near the Tuscan island of Giglio in 2012. It was the worst maritime disaster since the Second World War. The Concordia's captain was recently convicted of manslaughter and causing the wreck.","Italian Antonella Tonna was on the Costa Fascinosa when shootout began .

Prior to the attack, Pierson was identified as a potential threat and in school documents it was revealed that administrators were aware student had the emotional capacity to carry out a plan to murder a teacher he was upset with, according to KDVR. And police later revealed that Karl had intended to target his debate coach Tracy Murphy - months after he had already shouted a death threat against the coach in a school hallway.

"David Cameron was heckled and mocked by an audience of elderly voters he was hoping to convince to vote for the Conservatives. Pensioners shouted ‘rubbish’, ‘lies’, and ‘answer the question’ - and one waved his walking stick at the Prime Minister - as he was challenged about spending on social care and agency workers employed by the NHS. Mr Cameron had given a speech outlining his commitment to annual rises in the state pension, protecting the health budget and entitlements to free TV licences and bus passes. Scroll down for video . David Cameron speaks with members of the charity Age UK during a ‘General Election rally’ in central London, in which the Prime Minister ended up being heckled by the audience for spending on social care . The AgeUK event in London yesterday descended into chaos as pensioners in the audience repeatedly called out, branding the Prime Minister's answers 'rubbish' and accusing him of not answering their questions . He finished his address to a ‘General Election rally’ held by the charity Age UK in central London by urging the audience to ‘choose what’s right for our children and grandchildren’ by voting Conservative. But in a combative question and answer session, many of the pensioners were deeply unimpressed by his answers. Alfred Clemo, 86, was angry at not getting a ‘straight answer’ after he asked Mr Cameron what he would do about the number of NHS doctors and nurses leaving to work for agencies for higher salaries. Mr Cameron said it was a ‘difficult issue’ as hospitals hired agency staff to deal with extra pressure, particularly on A&E departments. ‘The truth of it, Sir, is that well-run hospitals are less reliant on agency staff’ the Prime Minister said. ‘We need to make sure all hospitals copy the best hospitals that are less reliant on agency staff.’ He tried to move on, but Mr Clemo, a retired garage owner from Warrington who is a governor of his local hospital, replied: ‘Excuse me, you haven’t answered my question’ and repeated it. Mr Cameron said that he could not stop health service staff looking for a ‘better deal’, to jeers and cries of ‘rubbish’ and ‘answer the question’ from the audience. The Prime Minister pleaded: ‘I am answering the question, I don’t want to ban agency nurses as then hospitals that were struggling wouldn’t be able to get hold of them.’ It was revealed earlier this week that hospitals are paying locum doctors up to £3,200 a shift – of which a substantial cut goes to the agency. NHS trusts spent £1.2bn on agency staff in 2013-14 – with agency nurses being paid up to £160 an hour to make up for staff shortages in A&E. Pensioners shouted ‘rubbish’, ‘lies’, and ‘answer the question’ - and one waved his walking stick at the Prime Minister - as he was challenged about spending on social care and agency workers employed by the NHS . Cameron had given a speech outlining his commitment to annual rises in the state pension, protecting the health budget and entitlements to free TV licences and bus passes before meeting with audience members . Mr Clemo, said afterwards that without action to stop agency staff being paid double the rate of normal staff his local hospital ‘will be bankrupt in two years’. He said: ‘The agencies are getting mega-rich out of fleecing the hospital. It is ruining the NHS.’ He said he had voted Conservative and Labour in the past, and added ‘He would have won me back if he had answered my question’. Dennis Andrews, 91, was called on after waving his walking stick at the Prime Minister. He said older people had to deal with too many departments and agencies and were often ‘given the run-around’. ‘I would like a minister at cabinet level to coordinate all these agencies that make these decisions in isolation’, he said. ‘We deserve the same recognition you give to children’, to shouts of ‘hear, hear’. Mr Cameron said older people should be a priority for ‘all ministers’, to loud groans from the audience. The Prime Minister added: ‘If you are not satisfied with how elderly people are being looked after and valued by this government, don’t blame other ministers, blame me’, he said. Several people shouted back at him, ‘we do’. His appearance at the meeting in central London yesterday was mocked on social media – coming a day after Mr Cameron announced his retirement, by saying he would not seek a third term in office. Commenters on twitter said he had bruised by ‘leaving the Westminster bubble’ and that he had ‘aged five years’ in the process. Earlier this week, Cameron announced he would not bid for a third term if he is successful in May's General Election. He has since insisted he is taking 'nothing for granted' and his focus is on beating 'Ed Miliband' Mr Andrews, a retired manager at a distilling firm, runs the Nottingham Elders’ Forum, a small charity which helps older people drive improvements to local services. He said afterwards that he was ‘non-political’, but that Mr Cameron’s government had ‘not really’ done a lot for pensioners. He said: ‘I contributed for 40 years for my old age pension, and they talk about it as a benefit’, he said. ‘It’s not a benefit, I’ve paid in for it. They say it’s gone up by 5 per cent, well 5 per cent increase on nothing is nothing. It’s still only £113 a week.’ Another audience member, who did not give his name, asked Mr Cameron for a ‘cast iron guarantee’ that spending on health and social care were ‘safe at the present level’ if he was elected. Mr Cameron said ‘yes’, but shouts of ‘lies’ and ‘it’s not true’ were heard from the audience. Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve put an extra £12.7billion into the NHS in this parliament. We have promised not to cut it, we will put more money into the NHS every year that I am Prime Minister.’ Maureen Childs, of the Green party’s pensioners group accused Mr Cameron of wanting to introduce health insurance and ‘we want the NHS as it used to be – free at the point of use’. Mr Cameron insisted: ‘It is free at the point of use’. The rally was addressed by politicians from all the major parties. The Prime Minister – who said he was the only party leader to come to the conference - tried to put a brave face on the event saying it had been ‘fun’ and thanked the pensioners for their ‘lively interactions’.","PM was heckled by pensioners as he tried to convince them to vote Tory .

"If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes – the current recommended level. Researchers say short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet. File photo . Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters – few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. Performing any exercise before a high fat meal was already known to prevent this impairment in blood vessel function but the study found intensive exercise was better for blood vessel function in young people than the currently recommended moderate-intensity exercise. The study found eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes. File photo . Cardiovascular diseases including heart attacks and stroke are the leading cause of death in the UK, and researchers said the processes underlying these start in youth. Impairment in the function of blood vessels is thought to be the earliest stage of this process, and this is known to occur in the hours after consuming a high fat meal. Scientists compared high-intensity, interval exercise against moderate-intensity exercise on blood vessel function in adolescent boys and girls after they had consumed a high fat milkshake. The research showed that approximately 25 minutes of moderate-intensity cycling prevented the fall in blood vessel function after the high fat meal, but performing just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling not only prevented this fall, but improved blood vessel function to a level that was superior to moderate-intensity exercise. Dr Alan Barker, of the children's health and exercise research centre, sport and health sciences at the University of Exeter, said: 'Our study shows that the intensity of exercise plays an important part in protecting blood vessel function in young people after the ingestion of a high fat meal.' 'Furthermore, both the boys and girls found the high-intensity exercise to be more enjoyable than the moderate-intensity exercise. 'Considering that very few adolescents currently achieve the recommended minimum of one hour of at least moderate-intensity exercise per day, smaller amounts of exercise performed at a higher-intensity might offer an attractive alternative to improve blood vessel function in adolescents.' The study is published in the American Journal Of Physiology - Heart And Circulatory Physiology.","Eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes .

"In the teeming capital of Congo, where drivers often flout traffic rules, five chunky, arm-waving robots equipped with cameras and lights have been set up to watch over the roads. The 8ft solar-powered aluminium robots are huge, towering over the jammed streets of Kinshasa, as cars and motorcyles jostle for road room, their horns blasting. Each hand on the odd-looking machines - built to withstand the year-round hot climate - is fitted with green and red lights that regulate the flow of traffic in the sprawling city of nine million. The 8ft solar-powered aluminium robots are huge, towering over the jammed streets of Kinshasa, as cars and motorcyles jostle for road room, their horns blasting . The robots are also equipped with rotating chests and surveillance cameras that record the flow of traffic and send real-time images to the police station. Although the humanoids look more like giant toys than real policemen, motorists have given them a thumbs up. 'There are certain drivers who don't respect the traffic police. But with the robot it will be different. We should respect the robot,' taxi driver Poro Zidane told AFP. 'We're very happy about it,' he said, his taxi packed with passengers as drivers around him honked their horns in a desperate bid to cut through the traffic jam. Of the five robots set up across the capital, two have been regulating traffic since 2013. Each hand on the odd-looking machines - built to withstand the year-round hot climate - is fitted with green and red lights that regulate the flow of traffic in the sprawling city of nine million . The robots are also equipped with rotating chests and surveillance cameras that record the flow of traffic and send real-time images to the police station . While they may not be as terrifying as the robocop in the science fiction action film (pictured), they have proven effective at combating traffic crime . Last week, three new and improved robots developed by a Congolese association of women engineers were set up across the city. It seems that robots could be policing the streets in the US very soon. The TeleBot, created by students at Florida International University, will be able to do simple police tasks like handing out parking tickets. It is designed to be controlled remotely, and its multiple sensors and cameras mean its operator can use it to patrol the streets from anywhere. 'We want to use telebots to give disabled military and police veterans an opportunity to serve in law enforcement,' explained Jeremy Robins, who is funding the project. 'With TeleBots, a disabled police officer will be capable of performing many, if not most, of the functions of a normal patrol officer - interacting with the community, patrolling, responding to 911 calls, issuing citations.' The robot, which is about six feet tall, gets around on wheels and has three HD cameras, giving it full 360 degree vision. It also boasts cameras that point at the ground, which stops it from running into people, and its face will have an 'emotive display' which will allow it to express 'simple emotions'.  Each unit costs only $20,000. The newcomers even have names: Tamuke, Mwaluke and Kisanga. They each cost $27,500. Therese Izay, president of Women's Technology, the group behind the robots, believes the invention will help make it far more difficult for motorists in Kinshasa to get away with traffic violations. 'In our city, someone can commit an offence and run away, and say that no one saw him. 'But now, day or night, we'll be able to see him in real time and he will pay his fine like in all the serious countries of the world,' she said. The new robots 'react much more quickly' than the older models, she said. 'The electronic components work much better now than the ones from the first generation,' she said, adding that she had submitted a proposal for the authorities to purchase 30 more robots to watch over the country's highways. Five of the machines have already been sent to Katanga province, in the southeast of the country. General Celestin Kanyama, chief of Kinshasa's police force, said the new electronic cops were a welcome addition in a city where 2,276 people have died in traffic accidents since 2007. 'These robots will be an important asset for the police,' he said. But Kinshasa governor Andre Kimbuta said that while the machines could regulate traffic, they were no match for real policemen who could chase motorists who jump red lights and raise civic awareness. 'We should congratulate our Congolese engineers, but policemen also need to do their job,' he said.

"De'trick Johnson (above), 36, went to have his car serviced at CJ's Garage on Saturday morning when immediately upon his arrival, the pack of seven dogs charged underneath a fence and attacked him . An Arkansas man was brutally mauled to death in a vicious dog attack by seven pit bull terriers. De'trick Johnson, 36, of Pine Bluff went to have his car serviced at CJ's Garage on Saturday morning when immediately upon his arrival, the pack of seven dogs charged underneath a fence and attacked him. Johnson was found on the ground when responding officers arrived, and it appeared he was still alive, according to Jefferson County Sheriff's spokesman Major Lafayette Woods Jr. Johnson was later pronounced dead at the scene. While police encountered the 'aggressive dogs', four of the pit bulls were shot and killed, two were captured and taken by Pine Bluff Animal Control and one fled from the scene. On Saturday, police were still searching for the brown and white pit bull that got away. A long-time friend of Johnson's, John Smith III, who is also the son of the garage's owner, John Chester Smith, said that this is not the first time the pit bulls have attacked someone, according to KATV. He said another person was bit by the pit bull terriers just days before Johnson's death. Smith III said: 'You are my dad. I love you. De'trick, I love him too. But it's one thing about it, you [John Chester Smith] are going to need to be held accountable for the decision that you made. 'I didn't fool with those dogs and I wasn't aware that he had that many dogs, but I knew he had a couple of them. I didn't know they were that vicious.' Scroll down for video . A close friend of Johnson's, John Smith III (above), who is also the son of the garage's owner, John Chester Smith, said that this is not the first time the pit bulls have attacked someone .

When he did that, he gained attention of at least one of the dogs,' said Woods. 'The dog charged him and jumped in the car. The deputy tased the dog, and the dog continued to be combative and be aggressive. The deputy ended up actually shooting the dog.' Johnson's sister, Akimi Johnson, said she was 'not prepared' for what happened to her brother and wants something to be done. She said: 'I believe the dogs should have been tied up. If anyone goes to a garage to receive service, they should not be fearful or have to run and be afraid because dogs are a-loose.' Major Woods said that Smith (pictured left with officers) had been warned previously about his dogs and their aggressive behavior, and that police are looking into whether there are possible charges that can be brought against him. Major Woods said one cop tried to use his Taser on one of the dogs that charged at him but had to resort to lethal force after it had no effect (above responding officers called to the scene on Saturday) Johnson added: 'He didn't deserve to die like that. It was senseless and I want something to be done because that could have been a child or anyone else's brother.' Smith III along with his mom and the owner's sisters had previously told Smith to get rid of the dogs. 'I'm not just speaking because its De'trick. I am speaking on the behalf of the other victims because he wasn't the first,' said Smith III.

"A bank robber who hurriedly prepared his heist in a taxi on the way to the scene of the crime – then used the same vehicle to make his escape – has been jailed. Ryan Fuller, 24, of no fixed abode, took a taxi from a McDonald's in Milton Keynes to a NatWest branch in Bletchley, four miles away, on January 12. There, he asked the driver to wait, and went into the bank where he handed a note he had scribbled in the back of the taxi to the cashier, saying: 'Remain calm, stay silent, do not cause a panic. 24-year-old Ryan Fuller handed a note he had scribbled to the Natwest cashier Milton Keyned which read: 'Remain calm... I have a knife and I will take hostages if I have to' After the cashier in Bletchley handed him £3,379 Fuller (pictured) went back to the taxi which was waiting outside and told him someone had robbed the bank with a gun . 'I have a knife and I will take hostages if I have to. This is not a joke.' Aylesbury Crown Court heard how Fuller, who had been wearing a smart suit at the time of the robbery, had told police that he had written the note so he would be taken seriously. He said: 'I did not think they would give me money as I do not look like a bank robber.' The cashier gave him £3,379 but secretly activated the alarm. When asked if he wanted the money in an envelope, Fuller replied: 'No, I'm in a hurry.' He then ran back to the taxi, telling the driver someone had robbed the bank with a gun. He subsequently fled to the Channel Islands, but police found him and brought him back to England. Jailing Fuller for 21 months, the judge, Mr Recorder Wright, said that although the robbery had not been 'professionally planned', it had had a lasting impact on the cashier.

"Here's the scene: My husband Tony is desperately ill and I'm sitting by his hospital bed. He's been sick for weeks and at one stage I was told he was expected to die. He's now out of a coma and no longer, thank God, one of the ten sickest people in the vast teaching hospital. But still no one knows what's wrong with him. He's been moved from the intensive care unit into a small room when suddenly a consultant descends. Sarah Foot says that while with her sick husband Tony in hospital a consultant with hostile body language came crashing in and started talking down to them as she gave the diagnosis . She crashes through the door, followed by half a dozen of her juniors, who crowd round the bed and wait for her to speak. No one's in any doubt who's in charge. She talks not at us, but down to us, like some reincarnation of the monstrous Sir Lancelot Spratt (played by James Robertson Justice) from the Doctor In The House films. Except this isn't funny. Tony has been in hospital for more than a month, but how or why he got ill so suddenly no one really knows. One minute I was wondering whether he just had man flu; the next he was delirious with fever and dreadful abdominal pains, and being rushed to hospital in an ambulance. Just 48 hours later, he was in a drug-induced coma with sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by an infection, his organs shutting down one by one. When he was admitted, his symptoms suggested pancreatitis - where the pancreas becomes inflamed. I want to know if the doctors are any the wiser about what caused his body to go into free fall. Sarah accompanied Tony as he was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, and shortly after was in a drug-induced coma with sepsis . So, looking up at the sea of faces, I ask: 'Was it pancreatitis that started this?' I remain sitting, because if I stand, Tony - who is unable to speak for himself as he has a tube in his windpipe - will feel even more helpless. 'Yes,' the consultant declares haughtily, 'he presented with similar symptoms.' 'But was it actually pancreatitis?' She repeats herself impatiently: 'Yes, he presented with similar symptoms.' Her hostile body language is telling me to shut up and know my place. I try again, but still she answers like a politician, repeating the same refrain. Then she shuffles her notes and says that another consultant is coming to discuss a kidney tumour that showed up on a scan. This news floors me. 'No one mentioned a tumour.' 'Yes, they did.' 'No, they didn't.' 'Yes, they did.' For a moment we are in panto territory with someone whose life is hanging by a thread lying terrified between us. Then off she breezes. I'm torn between bursting into tears and storming into the corridor to tell those junior doctors that if they learn one thing today, it's how not to talk to the sick and their loved ones. Patient's relative meets doctors: it's a scene repeated daily in hospitals all over the country. You can guarantee the next of kin are frightened and exhausted. Life and death are routine for medical staff, but for the rest of us they are, well, life and death. Doctors will argue they are appallingly busy, would love to give people more attention, but don't have the time. Or that to do their job properly they need the emotional distance. I can understand that. But here's another story from the same hospital. Same patient, different consultant, working under exactly the same pressure and constraints as the others. And his approach was so full of kindness and compassion that I wonder whether the disparity between those who have a good bedside manner and those who don't is about individuals rather than the pressure of the job. This man became our rock when Tony's illness - whatever caused the sepsis in the first place was never identified - sparked off a chain reaction that had doctors chasing problems around his body for a year after he was admitted in March 2006. One serious ailment would be contained, only for another to present. There was massive internal damage from the sepsis to be repaired surgically, but also an aortic aneurysm (a swelling of the main blood vessel leading from the heart) to be bypassed and more infections to be cured. Not to mention that cancerous kidney tumour to be dealt with when he was well enough. 'Roller-coaster' doesn't come near the ride he was on. Much of his care fell to this one particular specialist, a urologist, who, to my astonishment, gave me his mobile phone number and told me to call if I had concerns. One Sunday night, eight months into this medical odyssey, Tony was nauseous, with his temperature rising and his remaining strength draining fast. So I rang this doctor at home at 9pm. He wanted to admit Tony immediately for intravenous antibiotics. I pleaded for a reprieve. It was Guy Fawkes night and I imagined the hospital would be busy dealing with fireworks related accidents. She had barely slept for weeks and was extremely anxious, so needed kindness and support . Plus we had a three-year-old son and he'd be thrown into turmoil. Would it be possible, I suggested, for me to give my husband more antibiotics at home and bring him into hospital in the morning? The doctor agreed, but then warned me: 'Tony may deteriorate very quickly. And if he does, I want you to call. I don't care if it's 4am.' Four in the morning? For the second time that awful year a doctor's words reduced me to tears. But on this occasion I was overwhelmed by kindness far beyond the call of duty. After a further set of operations, including a ten-hour marathon to reconstruct parts of his insides that had been destroyed by infection, this doctor would phone us at home and see how my husband was. A five-minute phone call could spare us so much distress. And if things were not good, he would tell us to come in and he'd arrange for a room to see us in. And this was not because we had private health to fall back on. Both doctors were working in the same private healthcare system. When I look back at my bedside encounter with that Spratt of a consultant, if I'm being rational, I can see that whether I knew the precise name of my husband's illness or had been forewarned about his tumour was irrelevant. It would not make any difference to the prognosis. But what she did not have was the nous (or compassion) to grasp that a patient's loved ones are rarely at their most rational. I'd barely slept for weeks and was extremely anxious. And, like all relatives, I needed kindness and support because I was going to play a crucial role in my husband's care. Doctors prescribe a pill, but it is those of us with a bedside seat who have to sugar it. The nearest and dearest have to explain, encourage and display the morale-boosting love and concern that can speed recovery. Anyone who's been a hospital patient knows what a comfort it is to have an advocate focusing just on them and making sure they get what they need. And the better informed the relative is by the doctors, the sooner they can take the patient home and free up the hospital bed. Sarah wonders some doctors so understanding and others less so . Relatives are also essential if there is bad news. Tony still remembers lying in a ward early one morning groggy from an operation when a young man in a bed opposite was visited by the doctors. The curtains were pulled round, then ten minutes later swished back. Once the doctors had gone, the young man - who was no older than 19 - was left on his own. He called out: 'They've just told me the operation didn't work. I'll be dead in six months.' My husband was too sick to help or even respond. But what has always troubled him is why that young man had been left on his own when a death sentence was passed. Couldn't someone have thought to wait until his parents arrived to tell him the bad news? Why are some doctors so understanding and others less so? However much you try, you can't legislate for compassion. Human relations are composed of too many subtleties. My husband came through his ordeal, though he still bears the scars of six operations within a year, has bits of plastic inside him keeping him alive - stents to bypass the aneurysm, another for a blood clot - and is on a strict, life-long regimen of medication. The tumour was treated successfully, and the only lasting side-effect is a pain in his leg - the result of a blood clot after one lengthy operation. I know he is fortunate to be alive. But they were hard times and I have all too vivid memories of how some doctors were a blessing from on high, but others were the complete opposite, erecting a cordon sanitaire between them and their patient. They were too wrapped up, I fear, in their own self-importance. Over the years we have had to meet many more doctors. Some are gentle and understanding. Others less so. I can't help thinking it's their decision. As with all of us, how we relate to others is our choice. I still regret that, on that miserable day, I didn't rush out after the junior doctors and demand to know: what sort of doctor do you want to be remembered as? A saint? Or a Spratt?

"A terror attack in Britain is a ‘price we should be willing to pay’ if it means spy agencies do not have access to masses of personal data, a human rights group has claimed. Isabella Sankey, Liberty’s director of policy, said it was better to let ‘some things happen’ than to give security services ‘privacy-infringing measures’ designed to catch extremists plotting atrocities in the UK and overseas. The claim that privacy should be put before national security was condemned as ‘unacceptable’ as a report revealed the extent of snooping by GCHQ. Scroll down for video . Relatives of victims killed in the London terror attacks in 2005 said Liberty was 'isolated from the real world' after suggesting allowing some preventable attacks to happen was a price worth paying . Liberty, which campaigns on civil liberties and human rights issues, was at the forefront of the criticisms of the security and intelligence services when the claims from whistle-blower Edward Snowden broke in June 2013. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee found that agents at GCHQ, the government listening post, monitor 'large numbers of items' using 'bulk interception' powers to uncover terror threats. But the committee dismissed the claims that GCHQ had ‘blanket coverage’ of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages. It said GCHQ can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ‘tiny fraction’ of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process. Isabella Sankey,  Liberty’s director of policy, said some terror attacks succeeding was a ‘price we should be willing to pay’ rather than have GCHQ use ‘bulk collection’ techniques . But this probably still means that thousands of texts, emails and Facebook messages are read every day by Government spies. Privacy campaigners argue the security services already have too much power to gather and read personal communications. Giving evidence on behalf of Liberty, Miss Sankey was asked by the committee in October if she opposed bulk collection even if it was used in a ‘targeted’ way to ‘prevent plots and contribute to national security’. Such techniques were, she said, wrong ‘in principle’ and could not be justified even if they were lawful and authorised. She added: ‘Some things might happen that could have been prevented if you took all of the most oppressive, restrictive and privacy-infringing measures. That is the price you pay to live in a free society.’ Her claims were backed by privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch. But the ISC said: 'We do not subscribe to the point of view that it is acceptable to let some terrorist attacks happen to uphold the individual right to privacy — nor do we believe that the vast majority of the British public would.' Labour MP Hazel Blears, a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee branded Liberty's views ‘unacceptable’. Pointing to the comments, Ms Blears said: ‘Their view was even if terrorist plots happened they were not prepared to allow this capability to collect information whereas that’s not a view we take.’ ‘The public will want to see they have that capability but absolutely constrained by a proper legal framework. ‘To not have the capability you’re going to accept that some plots will happen and innocent people will lose their lives because you do not want agencies to have this capability. I think it’s unacceptable.’ Labour MP Hazel Blears said it was ‘unacceptable’ to suggest capability should not be used to prevent a terror attack . The ISC report was ordered in the wake of when the claims from whistle-blower Edward Snowden broke in June 2013 . The long-awaited report into Britain's spy agencies blanks out almost every detail which would reveal the true extent of the Government's state snooping programme. The report reveals there are around 100,000 'bearers' – or underwater cables – which transmit information over the internet. All of these cables - carrying people's emails, Facebook messages and other communications - can potentially be hacked by GCHQ, the committee reveals. But only a small percentage  are actually accessed by Britain's spies, the report says. The committee also blanks out the exact percentage of information accessed off these chosen cables every day. It says only a 'tiny fraction' of the billions of items that are sent over the internet on a daily basis are snooped on. The report says: 'Only the communications of suspected criminals or national security targets are deliberately selected for examination.' It says: 'Fewer than *** of *** per cent of the items that transit the internet in one day are ever selected to be read by a GCHQ analyst.' the report says 'around *** thousand items a day' are read by the spooks. These are 'only the ones considered to be of the highest intelligence value', the report adds. Amnesty International said the report could 'absolutely no way  be considered adequate'. Yesterday Miss Sankey accused the committee of attempting to put words in her mouth. She said: ‘Instead of attempting to put words into the mouths of privacy campaigners, the ISC should have put its efforts into scrutinising the agencies. ‘There is absolutely no excuse for terrorism and society must take all proportional steps to deal with it – but the real story here is that, despite their best efforts, the committee has been unable to present any evidence that mass surveillance of innocents’ calls and emails is saving any lives.’ Graham Foulkes, whose son David, 22, was killed in the 2005 London bombings, told The Times: ‘The question that should be asked is, what's the minimum interference in our freedom that gives us maximum protection? ‘Liberty is isolated from the real world. Because it is so lauded and courted by politicians, it has lost sense of what it's all about."" The committee's 18-month inquiry said Britain's spy agencies were not breaking the law – but called for a complete overhaul of the rules governing what they were allowed to do in the interests of national security. The report says a single law is needed to keep in check the powers of the intelligence agencies to snoop on private communications, because the current legal framework governing the likes of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 is 'unnecessarily complicated' and 'lacks transparency'. Human rights and civil liberties groups dismissed today's report as a whitewash and accused the committee of being 'a mouthpiece for the spooks'. Shami Chakrabarti, director of rights campaign group Liberty, said: 'The ISC has repeatedly shown itself as - so clueless and ineffective that it's only thanks to Edward Snowden that it had the slightest clue of the agencies' antics. 'The Committee calls this report a landmark for 'openness and transparency' - but how do we trust agencies who have acted unlawfully, hacked the world's largest sim card manufacturer and developed technologies capable of collecting our login details and passwords, manipulating our mobile devices and hacking our computers and webcams?' Rachel Logan, Amnesty UK's Legal Programme Director, said: 'The oversight of the security services should be the responsibility of a properly independent body. 'The Prime Minister holds a veto over who sits on the ISC, what it can examine, and what it can report so there is absolutely no way it can be considered an adequate independent regulator of the activities of our spies.' Open Rights Group executive director Jim Killock added: 'The ISC should have apologised to the nation for their failure to inform Parliament about how far GCHQ's powers have grown. 'This report fails to address any of the key questions apart from the need to reform our out-of-date surveillance laws. This just confirms that the ISC lacks the sufficient independence and expertise to hold the agencies to account.'","Isabella Sankey said GCHQ should not use bulk data collection at all .

Claudio Vitale, 41, from Naples, and Iacopo Nichetto, 34, from Venice, are under police guard in hospital after being arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and attempted murder. The pair, who were on leave at the time, were arrested hours after they allegedly attempted to rob a supermarket in Naples yesterday. Two police officers have been arrested on robbery and attempted murder charges after a shoot-out left one person killed and nine injured after a robbery at a supermarket in Naples yesterday . Italian Carabinieri stand guard by the car, driven by two Carabinieri police officers, which was rear-ended on the highway 268 . The officers reportedly fled the scene in a car but were pursued by the shop's owner Pasquale Prisco, his brother and two employees. Local media reported they managed to prevent the pair's escape by ramming the getaway vehicle on the busy highway 268 - leading to a shoot-out in the streets. The group were said to have beaten one of the robbers, thelocal.it reported - while the other thief allegedly opened fire and shot Mr Prisco three times in the abdomen. He later died of his injuries in hospital and another supermarket worker remains in a serious condition. Witnesses reported shots were fired inside the supermarket, outside and during the subsequent car chase. Both officers have been suspended from duty.

"Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, pictured, called for a ‘grown up conversation’ about the commitment to investigating decades-old issues . Officers may be better employed tackling current threats than historic crimes and failings, Britain’s top policeman suggested last night. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe called for a ‘grown up conversation’ about the commitment to investigating decades-old issues. The Scotland Yard boss said he will ‘never shrink’ from the task of bringing a ‘bad person to justice, whoever they are, without fear or favour’. But he added: ‘We have to be better at weighing up the likelihood of success against the risks that those resources might be able to prevent or mitigate in the present day.’ Sir Bernard was speaking in London as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work investigating failings by institutions to protect children. The four-person panel will have statutory powers to compel witnesses and victims will also be able to appear as witnesses. There are concerns that forces are struggling to balance a tidal wave of historic allegations with the danger of present-day criminals. Hundreds of victims came forward in a phenomenon dubbed the ‘Savile-effect’ after the DJ and entertainer was exposed as a predatory paedophile after his death. In his speech, Sir Bernard also said Britain needs fewer pubs and bars in order to tackle the violence linked to binge-drinking culture. He advocated merging many constabularies to create nine super-forces in a bid to cut costs and bureaucracy. Sir Bernard said police need to be more open about how they manage the risks they face, including the £50 million spent on 42,000 missing children every year. And he said the people should protect themselves from crime in the same way people take steps to ensure they remain in good health. ‘I believe that keeping the public safe should be just as high priority as keeping them healthy, he said. ‘I’d like it to achieve the same high profile that prevention has in health over the last 20 years.’ Investigation: Sir Bernard was speaking as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work.

"Ed Miliband last night admitted his decision to knife brother David in the Labour leadership race led to a worse deterioration in their relationship than he expected. Mr Miliband stood against his brother, the former Foreign Secretary who had been favourite to succeed Gordon Brown in 2010, and clinched an unexpected victory thanks to the backing of trade union leaders. David Miliband refused a job in the shadow Cabinet and subsequently quit as an MP, forging a new life in the US as a charity boss. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband last night admitted his decision to knife brother David in the Labour leadership race led to a worse deterioration in their relationship than he expected. (Above, Ed, as leader of the party, with his brother in 2010) Mr Miliband stood against his brother, who had been favourite to succeed Gordon Brown in 2010, and clinched an unexpected victory thanks to the backing of trade union leaders. Ed insisted their current relationship was a 'massive amount better than it was' but declined to speculate about whether his brother would ever take a job in a future Labour government . Of his decision to run, Ed Miliband told the Guardian: 'I knew it was a big decision at the time, but it was an even bigger decision. 'It had bigger ramifications for my family, and for my relationship with David, than I had anticipated.' Discussing their current relationship, he insisted it was a 'massive, massive amount better than it was', but declined to speculate about whether his brother would ever take a job in a future Labour government. Mr Miliband also discussed his concerns about the pressures of his job on family life. He said of his sons, Daniel and Sam, five and four respectively: 'Daniel did say yesterday, ""You're always on the phone."" That's what I worry about. I don't want to be an absent dad. That's a challenge in this job and it's a challenge if I'm Prime Minister.' David Miliband refused a job in the shadow Cabinet and subsequently quit as an MP, forging a new life in the US as a charity boss . However, Mr Miliband's wife Justine is expected to start to feature in Labour's election campaign from next week. The Labour leader admitted he was angry with himself for forgetting to mention the deficit when delivering his party conference speech last year. 'Well, quite rightly I kicked myself. But I'm pretty resilient,' he said. Mr Miliband risked angering the dwindling band of Blairite Labour MPs by attacking New Labour's record. 'On inequality, I've moved Labour on from where New Labour would have been. I care about the gap between the rich and the poor,' he said. David Cameron will today bang the drum for the economic revival achieved by the Coalition as he says voters face a ‘massive, generation-defining choice’ at the election. He will point out that 1,000 jobs have been created every day since the Government came to power and that Britain grew faster in 2014 than any other major economy.","Ed stood against his brother, the ex-Foreign Secretary who was favourite to succeed Gordon Brown, in 2010 .

"Paul Wilson (pictured), 38, suffered anaphylactic shock after eating a curry and was found dead at the pub where he worked . The owner of a string of award-winning Indian takeaways has been charged with manslaughter after a pub landlord with a severe peanut allergy  died after eating a curry. Paul Wilson, 38, suffered an anaphylactic shock after eating food from the The Indian Garden in Easingwold, North Yorkshire. The takeaway's owner, Mohammed Khalique Zaman, has been charged  of manslaughter by gross negligence - the first case of its kind in Britain. The 52-year-old, who runs the Indian Garden restaurant in Easingwold, North Yorkshire, will appear before Northallerton magistrates tomorrow. Father-of-one Mr Wilson, who had a six-year-old son, bought the curry in January last year and collapsed and died in his bathroom in the Oak Tree pub in Helperby, near Thirsk. His death came months before the introduction of new laws demanding that all food businesses provide allergy information on unpackaged foods like takeaways. All though allergies to foods like nuts are increasing, Mr Wilson's death is one of around ten each year in Britain. His case has led to a major purge by trading standards officers targeting a food fraud in which peanuts are used in place of more costly almonds. Most curry lovers are unable to taste the difference unless they suffer from a nut allergy - in which case the results can be fatal. Mohammed Khalique Zaman, 52, from York, has also been charged with perverting the course justice and an employment offence under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. He has run takeaways and restaurants across  North Yorkshire for decades and his Jaipur Spice chain won best in the count in 2012 and 2013 at the Bangladeshi Catering Association Awards. Mr Wilson, from Sheffield, died in January 2014 at the Oak Tree Inn in the village of Helperby. The Sheffield born bar manager was found unresponsive in the living quarters of the Oak Tree Inn, in the village of Helperby, North Yorkshire, where he was working, the spokesman added. Police originally arrested two men - Zaman and an unknown 38-year-old employee - in connection with the death but the younger man was released without charge. Mohammed Khalique Zaman, 52, who runs the Indian Garden restaurant in Easingwold, North Yorkshire, will appear before Northallerton magistrates tomorrow. Paul Horsman, the manager of The York pub in Easingwold was one of the last people to see Mr Wilson alive. The pair would often stop for a drink at pub on his days off. The night before he died Mr Wilson was waiting for a taxi to take him home with the curry at the pub. Mr Horsman, who has run the pub for 26 years, said: 'It was a shock to find out someone I was talking to 12 hours before had died.' In 2011 another Indian restaurant, the Spice Lounge in Norfolk, had to pay £6,000 in fines and costs after a diner was rushed to hospital after she suffered a serious allergic reaction to milk in her curry - having already warned it made her ill. Last year a landscape gardener with a nut allergy died after eating a curry. Derek Stephenson was eating his chicken tikka while watching the X Factor then he started coughing uncontrollably and his lips turned blue. He told friend Stephanie Hodgson: 'S***, I'm allergic to nuts' before he collapsed and died. Nuts can trigger some of the most severe allergic reactions, although it's not clear why . Nut allergy is the most common type of severe food allergy. It it is an umbrella term for an allergy to both peanuts (which, strictly speaking, are not nuts but legumes, belonging to the same family as peas and beans) and tree nuts, such as walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, pecans, brazils and pistachios. Like many other foods, nuts can act as allergens, but for reasons that aren't clear, they cause some of the most severe reactions. In the UK, about 1 in 100 people have an allergy to peanuts and about 1 in 200 people have an allergy to tree nuts. The number of people with peanut allergy is growing. People who have other allergic conditions in their family - such as hay fever, asthma and eczema - are more likely to suffer nut allergy. Most people with nut allergy react after contact with small amounts (less than one nut) and some people may react to trace amounts, the website patient.co.uk reports. This means some people don't even have to eat an actual nut to have a reaction. A minority of people are so sensitive to nut allergens that a tiny amount on their lips - or even standing next to someone eating peanuts - can trigger a reaction. When someone comes into contact with something they are allergic to (an allergen), a group of cells in the body - mast cells - release a substance called histamine. Histamine causes the tiny blood vessels in the tissues of the body to leak fluid, which in turn causes the tissues to swell. This results in a number of different symptoms. Signs of a mild allergic reaction include: . * Tingling mouth and lips . * Facial swelling and/or a feeling of tightness around the throat . * Feeling sick, stomach pains . * A rash or hives . Signs of a severe reaction include (in addition to the above): . * Wheezing or difficulty breathing due to an asthma-like attack, or throat swelling . * Fast heart rate - or low blood pressure which can cause fainting or collapse . * Redness of the skin, due to dilation of the blood vessels . A severe reaction is known as anaphylaxis.  Without immediate treatment, victims soon become unconscious. A small number die every year due to this type of severe reaction, typically because they do not receive treatment quickly enough. Source: patient.co.uk .

"Samuel Johnson is not a hipster and never will be. Not because the actor thinks the 'metrosexual subculture' is ridiculous or just a passing trend. But because he cannot grow a beard. 'I am definitely not a hipster,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I nearly drowned in beard envy... there was a lot of envy. 'I did try and grow a beard for the show and it was so bad the producers said ""nope get rid of it"".'

'To get back and land Hipsters and Molly was almost too good to be true. 'I’m not sure which job is more difficult understanding hipsters or understanding Molly Meldrum.' He described recent years as a 'wild ride' and said 'by day I was doing Hipsters and by night I was writing the Love Your Sister book and studying Molly'. He revealed his sister Connie, who has battled cancer since she was 11, is doing well, and when asked what was next for the brother-sister duo, he said there were exciting things ahead.

"The small foam pieces used to protect fragile goods in boxes could soon power your phone thanks to a battery breakthrough. Researchers have developed a way of turning the so-called 'packing peanuts' into carbon, which can then be added to the types of lithium batteries used in everyday gadgets. During tests the packing peanut-based batteries could store 15 per cent more power than current technology - and they even outperformed similar batteries made of graphite. Scroll down for video . Researchers have developed a way of turning  so-called 'packing peanuts' (pictured) into carbon, which can then be added to the kinds of lithium batteries in everyday gadgets. During tests the packing peanut-based batteries could store around 15% more power than current technology . This breakthrough was made by Dr Vilas Pol, Dr Vinodkumar Etacheri and their colleagues at Purdue University. They presented their findings at the National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS). The researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600°C (1,100°F) to create blocks of black carbon. These blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries. These sheets had a lithium-ion storage capacity of 420 mAh per gram. By comparison, an iPhone 6 battery has a total storage capacity of 1810mAh and weighs 0.9oz (28 grams), while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mAh/g. This means the packing peanut technology could make batteries smaller and lighter, yet more powerful. Typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200°C (4,100°F), meaning Dr Pol's method uses less energy and is more environmentally friendly. Dr Pol got the idea to turn these peanuts into nanoparticles and microsheets when he was taking delivery of new equipment for his lab. 'I looked at the packing peanuts and thought that while we are exploring ""green"" technologies, we should not be harming the environment by throwing them away,' he said. The researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600°C (1,100°F) to create blocks of black carbon. These blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries. These sheets had a lithium-ion storage capacity of 420 mAh per gram. By comparison, an iPhone 6 battery has a total storage capacity of 1810mAh and weighs 0.9oz (28 grams), while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mAh/g.

The researchers at Purdue University began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600°C (1,100°F) to create blocks of black carbon. These blocks were then flattened into microsheets (pictured) and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries . Drs Pol and Etacheri then tested the microsheets and nanoparticles as anodes in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. The lithium ions move between the electrodes during charging and discharging and the researchers said their anode works so well 'it outperforms commercial [anodes], with a storage capacity higher than graphite, a typical anode material.' And although the higher temperatures used to create other sheets create a more layered arrangement of carbon atoms to maximise  performance, Dr Pol's less-ordered materials are said to have a 15 per cent higher electrical storage capacity. Typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200°C (4,100°F), which creates more structured sheets. By comparison, the 'disordered crystal structure' of Purdue University's sheets (shown) lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit - making them more powerful . Dr Pol hopes his group's new, scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries (pictured) within two years . '[The batteries] have disordered, porous structures,' said Dr Etacheri. 'The disordered crystal structure lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit, and their porous microstructure lets the lithium ions quickly diffuse into the microsheets and creates more surface area for electrochemical interactions.' Dr Pol hopes his group's new, scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries within two years.","The discovery was made by Dr Vilas Pol and at Purdue University .

"The gap between the rich and poor in big cities in the United States is widening, according to a new report. Atlanta is the most unequal city with the wealthy taking home nearly 20 times more than low-income households, data from the Brookings Institution revealed. The analysis compared 2013 census data for the top five per cent of earners with the bottom 20 per cent to work out the difference in wages. Scroll down for video . The gap between the rich and poor in big cities in the United States is still widening. The map above shows the most equal and unequal cities, according to a new report by the Brookings Institution . Nationwide the rich took home around 9.3 times more money - approximately $200,234 in comparison to $21,433. But in big cities it was up to 11.6 times more with top earners pocketing $221,700 and lower income households only taking home $19,143. The data showed the average wage for top earners in Atlanta was $288,159 - nearly $274,000 more than the bottom fifth's earnings. The income gap was also large in San Francisco, Boston and Miami, with San Francisco boasting the highest earnings for the wealthy at $423,171. Rich households in Washington were the only others to top $300,000. The nation's most equal city is Virginia Beach, where the rich only take home around six times more.

Many states - such as Washington, Massachusetts and Florida - have already put increases in place with more promised in the next two years. But the report concluded: 'These findings confirm that income inequality remains a salient issue in many big cities today. 'While the minimum wage is a potentially important means for helping low-earner households living in high-cost places, local policy-makers should not ignore other tools they have at hand - from education to economic development to housing and zoning policies - that are essential for improving social mobility and sustaining income diversity in big cities today.'","Analysis by the Brookings Institution shows Atlanta is most unequal city .

"A study of 2,000 people revealed the average British person hadn’t written any type of letter for at least 18 months and had not sent a postcard in two years . British people are losing their sentimental side with many admitting they have not sent a handwritten thank you note or post card or put together a physical photo album in years. The study of 2,000 people revealed the average person hadn't written any type of letter for at least 18 months or sent a post card within the last two years. Experts found one in five had recently sold a family heirloom because they didn't have the space for it or because it was 'too old fashioned' to place on display. Modern living appears to make us cherish items less, with a third admitting they are ruthless at throwing things out, while nearly half of those polled described their home as minimalist. The study found four in ten admit not being as sentimental as their parents and getting less so the older they get. Results showed the average person hadn't hand-written a letter for 19 months, hadn't sent a postcard in nearly two years or even hand-written a thank you for 20 months. Other sentimental acts are also fading - one in four has never made a CD for someone or made a home-made card, while a fifth never keeps things from their relationship as mementoes. Just a third actually bothers to keep physical photos now and a fifth instantly chucks out all the birthday and Christmas cards they receive. Hanging on to stuff proved a declining trend with people ridding themselves of any heirlooms or old possessions quickly- jewellery, furniture and clothing are the most common things passed down that people get rid of. The study of 2,000 people found four in ten Britons admit to not being as sentimental as their parents . The survey found 77 per cent feel people are obsessed with being online - and it's making us less sentimental . Old crockery, clocks and bone china are also rarely cherished or able to be kept due to a lack of room or not fitting the look of the home. But minimal living can have its drawbacks - 47 per cent of those who had discarded an heirloom later regretted it, because they would not be able to pass it on to their children. 1. Jewellery . 2.

Mark Walters, managing director of Interparcel, said: 'In a fast-moving modern world it's easy to forget to stop and appreciate certain things as fully as the generations before us did. 'Our homes are sleeker, our technology is increasingly compact and as a result the heirlooms or things that may have emotional value can seem out of place or ill-fitting. 'Results showed people are quicker to throw things out than perhaps they used to be and many don't feel as sentimental about things as they did. 'Whether it's sending a thoughtful gift, a handwritten note or a postcard, keeping that personal touch in day to day life is important.'","Study of 2,000 people suggests Britons have lost their sentimental side .

"It is a tender moment frozen in time for at least 100 million years. Scientists have uncovered the earliest fossilised evidence of an insect caring for its young. The fossil shows a female sap-sucking scale insect, preserved in amber, carrying her freshly hatched nymphs and unhatched eggs on her abdomen. The waxy ball like shapes on the abdomen of this 100 million year old insect Wathondra kotejai contain eggs and hatched nymphs and is thought  to be the earliest example of parental care in insects yet discovered . The fossil, discovered in a mine in the Kachin Province of northern Myanmar, pushes back the earliest direct evidence for insects caring for their brood by more than 50 million years. It is thought to be one of the earliest examples of parental care ever discovered and may help to explain how it first began to emerge. Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive – and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them. The discovery was made after tests on the Arabidopsis plant  found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool. Researchers at the University of Missouri exposed a group of Arabidopsis, which is part of the cabbage family, to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms. Plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods, such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells. These defences are expressed in their genes. Based on the gene analysis, the scientists found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism, than if it sensed a butterfly. There were also different genetic responses to each worm, showing that the plant knew what was eating it. Professor Bo Wang, a palaeontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the research, said: 'Brood care could have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects, which occurred during the end of the Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous period during the Mesozoic era. 'Although analysis seemed to suggest that ancient insects evolved brood care, this is the first direct, unequivocal evidence for the fossil record.' The insect Wathondra kotejai is thought to date from the mid-Cretaceous period and became encased in sap from a tree that over time turned into amber. Around its abdomin are around 60 eggs and freshly hatched nymphs, encased within a wax-coated egg sack, according to the research, which is published in the journal eLife. This primitive form of brood care would have protected the young nymphs from wet and dry conditions while allowing them to mature in the relative safety of their mother. Fossilised evidence of animals caring for their young is extremely rare, especially in insects. Wingless females were largely immobile, so were less likely to be accidentally buried. A cockroach from a similar period was reported carrying a mass of eggs, but cockroaches often deposit their eggs rather than brooding them. This drawing of a brooding female Wathondara kotejai shows the ovisac containing the brood and eggs coated in a wax covering as a lumpy mass on the main part of the insects body. Amber makes it almost transparent . Researchers believe Wathondara kotejai (above) may be one of the earliest insects to care for its young . Tiny hatched nymphs can be seen scattered aaround the mother insect's body in the amber in the image above . The only other direct evidence of brood care is from Cenozoic ambers, which are thought to only extend to around 65 million years ago. The latest discovery is thought to be at least 100 million years ago and dates from a time when dinosaurs dominated the Earth. The findings may help to offer an explanation for the early diversification of scale insects - small limpet-like suck saping insects that are common pests on plants today. The emergence of flowing plants and ants are thought to have been crucial for the rapid evolution of many new inspect species but were not present when scale insects began to evolve. Today many insects, such as ants and bees, care for their young, while the behaviour is far less common in mammals where just six per cent of species care for their young. The insect was found encased in amber in a mine in the Kachin Province of northern Myanmar (shown above) Wathondara kotejai is an ancient ancestor this sap-sucking scale insect that are now common garden pests .","Sap-sucking scale insect called Wathondra kotejai was preserved in amber .

"Earlier this week, supermodel-turned-actress Suki Waterhouse revealed the secret to achieving her perfectly-tousled red carpet-ready hair: washing her tresses with Coca-Cola. During an interview with US Weekly, the British-born 23-year-old, who is currently busy promoting her new sci-fi thriller Insurgent, admitted that she rinses her hair with the popular soda because it gives her hair the perfect amount of volume and texture, saying: 'I don't like my hair when it's washed - it's fine and limp - but Coca-Cola makes it tousled, like I've gone through the Amazon or something.' As someone who has always suffered from slightly limp, lifeless hair, I was overjoyed to hear that there might be such an easy - if not slightly bizarre - fix to my haircare woes and I couldn't wait to give it a go. Scroll down for video . Haircare hero: Suki Waterhouse, 23, pictured at last week's Insurgent premiere in New York, revealed earlier this week that she rinses her hair in Coca-Cola to give it added texture and bounce . Having bought two cans of Coca-Cola at a nearby store - unfortunately they were all out of bottles - I made my way home, all the while trying my best to warm up the cans so as not to have to shower myself in freezing cold Coke. As Suki wasn't particularly clear about what method she prefers when it comes to rinsing her hair with fizzy soda, I did some research online to see whether there was a general consensus about the easiest and most effective way to use Coca-Cola as an alternative to shampoo. I admit I was quite surprised to see that Suki's cola theory seems to have a lot of support from various outlets online; along with advice on how to use the beverage in order to clean your windows and remove rust from metal, there were several Coke-based haircare tips. And while some articles suggested using the soda as a pre-shampoo rinse, the majority claimed that using Coca-Cola as your only 'haircare' product would produce the best results, prompting me to abandon my beloved Serge Normant shampoo in favor of my cans of cola. Sadly, my many attempts to warm up the cola cans under the warm water in the shower failed, so when it finally came around to dumping the stuff over my head, it was still fairly frosty; certainly not the most enjoyable pre-bedtime experience. It is highly likely that I'm also far less coordinated and graceful than Suki, who boasts years of red carpet and catwalk experience, but I found the logistics of the whole Coca Cola rinse to be really quite tricky. Pre-cola and post-cola: Having suffered from limp, lifeless hair in the past (L), Charlie decided to give Suki's Coca-Cola rinse a go but found it left her with very greasy roots (R) First of all, the soda - predictably - fizzes everywhere and I was left with several sticky brown splashes of cola in my bath which, although not a complete disaster, was just a bit of a pain. Secondly, the cola didn't go exactly where I wanted to, and I actually ended up with a large amount of the first can's contents in my eye and on my face. Again, not the most pleasant of experiences. Let's just say, it was a good thing I had bought two cans because the first was, in all honesty, a total waste. However, when I finally managed to get the cola in my hair, I can't say it was that unpleasant a sensation; other than the slight chill, it really didn't feel that different to washing my hair normally. It wasn't nearly as sticky as I had imagined it would be, and I really couldn't feel any 'fizziness' on my head. Plus, I thought the scent was really quite enjoyable. When it came to rinsing the cola out with water however, I was incredibly careful to ensure that it was all gone - call my crazy, but the idea of having sugary sweet and sticky hair just wasn't too appealing, and I admit I was quite concerned about being attacked by swarms of flying insects confusing my hair for a sweet snack. After the cola rinse, and the subsequent water rinse, I left my hair alone, wanting to see exactly what the soda would do to it, without any additional styling products. I gave it a once over with the hair dryer and then headed to bed. Who needs shampoo? In place of her normal Serge Normant shampoo, Charlie used two cans of Coke to rinse her hair . When I first woke up, I have to say I was quite impressed with how soft my hair felt. I had been really worried that my tresses would have transformed overnight into cola-encrusted dreadlocks and was thrilled to see that my hair still looked relatively normal. Additionally, there was a bit of extra bounce to it, particularly at the roots. However, after brushing it through properly, my hair looked really rather greasy - yes there was some texture in the roots, and some added volume through the lengths, but my slick-looking style just made it look as though I had failed to wash my hair in days. Granted, it wasn't the worst look in the world, but it certainly didn't come anywhere near to the perfectly-tousled, textured tresses that Suki was showcasing on the red carpet at the recent New York premiere of Insurgent. I think perhaps from now on I'll stick to shampoo - and perhaps invest in a good volumising hairspray.","Suki, 23, revealed earlier this week that she uses the fizzy soda to rinse her hair because is helps to add texture and volume ."
"A single mother of five who forked out for a loan on a $43,000 brand new car from Holden, thinking it would guarantee safety and reliability for her family, has told of her three-year nightmare ordeal with the vehicle. Vicki Dedeigbo’s nine-year-old daughter Treasure suffers from an incredibly rare and fatal genetic disorder called generalised arterial calcification and Ms Dedeigbo needs her car to drive Treasure the 86km from their home on the NSW Central Coast to Westmead Children's hospital in Sydney's west. The 38-year-old, who tragically lost a daughter at just eight days old to the same condition, now spends much of her time travelling to see neurosurgeons, paediatricians and geneticists with Treasure. The care worker also needs a reliable car for her job and to take her other children to school - but her Holden Captiva has consistently let her down, breaking down on freeways in the dark and causing her to miss vital appointments. 'The engine seized on the highway at 100km/h and I was stuck in the first lane with all my kids in the car,' Ms Dedeigbo told Daily Mail Australia. Vicki Dedeigbo's has told of her nightmare ordeal after buying a $43,000 Holden car to transport her sick  daughter Treasure (right) to hospital and four other children to school . This photo was taken when Ms Dedeigbo first bought the car in August 2011. Three of her children including Treasure (right) are seen smiling about the new vehicle . Ms Dedeigbo said on numerous times she has taken the car, or it had expensively towed, to her Central Coast Holden dealership she has ‘endured rudeness and unfair treatment’. ‘I have been left stranded on the freeway, in the dark, unable to remove my car off the road on numerous occasions,’ Ms Dedeigbo said. ‘I have been late to an appointment because my car said it had 55kms of fuel left however I broke down around the corner from my house,’ she added. Ms Dedeigbo showed Daily Mail Australia numerous copies of repair certificates from the garage including details of the replacement of faulty seatbelts that had ‘frayed on the outer edges’. Other problems included electrical faults with sensors causing warning lights to flash and engine seizures that have left her stranded. One time she was forced to sleep in her vehicle overnight. 'My children have missed school because the car wouldn't start,' Ms Dedeigbo said. The car is seen here being towed away after another breakdown . The mother of five showed Daily Mail Australia her numerous repair sheets from after having to get her vehicle fixed repeatedly over the past three years . The car's beam headlamps blew and a knock in the steering was also identified . Treasure (right) is seen here with her newborn brother Miracle (left). Treasure has an incredibly rare genetic disorder called generalised arterial calcification and regularly visits specialists at Sydney's children hospital from her home on the Central Coast . ‘My children have missed school because the car wouldn't start or I had to go 10 days without a replacement car until the dealership could diagnose a problem before they would honour a temporary replacement car,’ Ms Dedeigbo explained. ‘I had a threatened miscarry due to all the stress I endured with the vehicle over my last pregnancy and it is a miracle that my last child survived as I suffer from high risk pregnancies and Holden is aware of all of this. It is not at all what I expected from a $43,000 car,’ she added. The distressed mother has started a Change.org petition, along with a number of other disgruntled customers, in an attempt to get her money back. Ms Dedeigbo is seen here with her five children, aged 15, 12, 9, 6 and one, at Christmas . A Holden spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Our Customer Care team has been talking with Ms Dedeigbo regularly about this matter to help find a solution that meets her needs. ‘Earlier this morning a new replacement vehicle was approved for Ms Dedeigbo and we have attempted to make contact. 'We look forward to discussing this with her and helping her into a brand-new Holden. Holden has also previously offered to cover any out-of-pocket expenses and will honour this commitment. 'Customer service and satisfaction is always a priority and we take instances like this extremely seriously, we always endeavour to find solutions that meet our customer’s needs.’ However, Ms Dedeigbo told Daily Mail Australia: ‘I would really prefer the full cost back because I have paid so much interest on my loan already and I’m scared to get another one.’ Another repair sheet lists how the car 'cuts out just after starting' and 'won't shift down under acceleration' Along with the interest on the loan she has paid, every 30,000kms she has had to replace the tyres on the vehicle. So far she has bought four sets of new tyres. She also believes she is owed a sum of money to cover all the breakdown costs such as towing. Ms Dedeigbo is not the only Holden Captiva customer who wants their money back. Stacie Konkel in Perth, WA has also started a petition on Change.org and says her car has had 'multiple issues since purchasing it new from a Holden dealership'. 'All door handles had to be replaced, new alternator at 60,000km, cooling system leaks, electronic problems, air bag issues and wait for it - CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE at only 84,500km,' she wrote on the campaigning website. Laura Taylor from Cairns, in Far North Queensland, said she also bought the Captiva as a 'reliable and safe car' for her young family. On her petition she writes: 'Day after we picked it up, it went back. Towing mechanism melted to the underneath of the car. Catalytic converter, transmission, casing, massive oil leak, new transmission needed, safety recall on power steering overlooked, windscreen wipers stopped, full engine rebuild at below 85000kms.' She added: 'Car just stopped on a range on a bend, with 2 young children in the car (aged 18 months and 12 weeks), car in the middle of the road.' Meanwhile, Karina Blackman from Sydney, NSW, said on Change.org: 'In the 12 months since I purchased my car (which was only 2 years old and still under a new car warranty), my vehicle has had a new tranmission (we later found out this is the second time the tranmission has been replaced), oil leaks, fuel pressure regulator replaced and has been back at Windsor Holden 5 times for a total of 6 weeks.' And Belinda Smith from Burnie in Tasmania wrote on her petition: 'We purchased our Captiva in August 2011. On the 8th of September 2011 I lost use of my gears when trying to slow down from a 100km zone to a 80 km zone with a cattle truck behind me. I had a near miss with the truck and had to swerve off the road onto gravel.' The women list numerous problems with their Holden Captivas and each of them are petitioning for refunds for what they are all claiming are 'faulty vehicles'.","Vicki Dedeigbo bought her car for $43,000 in August 2011 .

"These incredible pictures show the ancient art of falconry as it is still practiced in the harsh mountainous region that straddles the border between Russia, China and Kazakhstan. The traditional hunting method is a prominent part of the culture in the autonomous Xinjiang Uygur region, where falconers gather every year to compete in a place known as the 'Village of the Falcon'. As a means to preserve the skill for future generations, the local government has also begun issuing monthly salaries of 300 - 500 yuan to falcon masters to encourage them to pass down their skills.

Since November 2010, falconry - which is predominately practiced by the Uygur, Kazak and Kirgiz ethnic groups - has been listed by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity. The training and handling of the large birds of prey follows a strict set of ancient rules that local eagle hunters are attempting to preserve. The tradition of hunting with the huge eagles is said to have been started by the nomadic Khitans from Manchuria in northern China around 940AD. The eagles soar through the air at speeds of up to 200mph as they race to reach their keeper first, during annual festivals. Their hunting prowess is also tested as they chase meat pulled along by the horses. Other activities held during the competition include horse racing, archery and Bushkashi, which is a goatskin tug of war on horseback. It also sees awards handed out for Best Turned Out Eagle And Owner, Best Eagle At Hunting Prey and Best Eagle At Locating Its Owner From A Distance. The hunters wear traditional costumes, complete with fur coats made of marmot, fox or wolf skins which have been caught by their eagles.

She said the experience boosted her mood and gave her the drive to go on and lose two stone. Speaking of the photo shoot, she said: 'It's made me feel ten years younger! 'When I saw the photographs Claire took of me in the first shoot I just couldn't believe it was me, I started crying because I couldn't believe how fantastic she'd made me look. 'It's done wonders for my confidence. All of a sudden, I get compliments about my appearance and people are amazed when they find out I'm 47. 'The first photoshoot was last March and it was absolutely brilliant, I thoroughly enjoyed it. 'I was so nervous initially because I'd seen Claire's work and didn't think it was for me at all but she made me feel a million dollars.

'It's made me feel at least ten years younger and it not only gave me the incentive to lose two stone but to maintain it as well.' Following the first photo shoot, Cheryl lost two stone going from 14st 7lb to to 12st 7lb and has worked with Claire again. She admits the burlesque photoshoots have enhanced her marriage to Simon, 47. She said: 'He loves seeing me dressed like that and he loves to show me off. 'It's done wonders for our relationship. It's really spiced things up and added an extra dimension to what was already a very happy marriage. 'We go out more and we both feel younger.

Simon, a sales manager, said he's delighted his wife was so happy with her present. He said: 'It all started out as a gift for Cheryl's 46th birthday. Much to her surprise, Cheryl absolutely loved it. The photographs were stunning and she got a huge confidence boost from the whole experience. 'She was very proud of herself and saw herself for what she is: a very beautiful woman. 'Before seeing Claire, she'd always been conscious of her figure and covered herself up but now she has the confidence to dress how she wants. 'It's not just her appearance: she's really come out of her shell and seems so much happier. I've always known how wonderful and beautiful she is but now she does too. Cheryl used to weigh 14st 7lb, right, but is now a slimmer 12st 7lb, left . The couple say they feel like newly-weds again as the photoshoot 'breathed new life into our marriage' 'It gave her the impetus to go on and lose weight and Cheryl lost two stone straight after working with Claire. 'She'd always talked about dropping the pounds but never really had the drive to see it through. 'After working with Claire and seeing how fantastic she could look gave her all the motivation she needed. 'For our age group it's really unusual and it's breathed new life into our marriage.

"Labour failed to appreciate the UK jobs market would prove a magnet for Polish plumbers, one of Tony Blair’s most senior advisers admitted yesterday. The admission was one of a series of revelations about how the last Government chronically mishandled Eastern European immigration. One ex-Cabinet minister said he had warned the influx was having a huge impact on hospitals and wages - but was largely ignored by his colleagues. Scroll down for video . Sir Stephen Wall, who was Mr Blair’s most senior EU adviser between 2000 and 2004, said Labour failed to foresee the attraction Britain would pose to Polish workers on low wages in their home country . In advance of Poland and seven other Eastern Bloc nations joining the EU in 2004, ministers relied upon advice suggesting only 13,000 would settle each year. In the end, more than one million travelled – with at least half that number settling in what is one of the biggest waves of immigration in British history. They were attracted by wages which are significantly higher than back home. Sir Stephen Wall, who was Mr Blair’s most senior EU adviser between 2000 and 2004, said: ‘We simply didn’t take account properly of the pull factor of England for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [in the UK] for their skills - you know, the Polish plumber.’ In comments which will pose a huge headache for Ed Miliband, Sir Stephen also admitted the decision to throw open Britain’s borders at a time when other countries were imposing transitional controls was ‘political’. The remarks risk re-igniting the debate about Labour’s record – for which the Labour leader recently apologised. Lord Green of Deddington said the figure of 13,000 Polish workers settling in the UK originally given by Labour was 'completely worthless' (file image) Sir Stephen said: ‘The primary argument was the political one – this was the right thing to do, we attached a lot of importance to them as democratic countries and keeping our position as the number one friend of eastern and central Europeans.’ Last night, Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of the Migration Watch campaign group, told the Mail: ‘It is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between Britain and a huge country like Poland. ‘We said at the time the forecast of 13,000-a-year was almost worthless. In fact, it was completely worthless.’ Yesterday, it also emerged that ex-Labour Cabinet minister John Denham had written to Chancellor Gordon Brown and Home Secretary Charles Clarke to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact. He said the Government failed to recognise what was happening in constituencies like his own in Southampton, where wages were driven down by as much as 50 per cent, A&E departments came under strain and 1,000 migrants attempted to sign up for an English-as-a-second language course in a single day. Mr Denham added: ‘The whole irony of this is that in some respects Tony Blair was obsessed by immigration, particularly about illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system, but on EU migration there was a catastrophic failure of the civil service machine.’ In further bombshell remarks, the respected economist Paul Ormerod, writing in the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, exploded Labour’s economic case for mass migration. He argued that, at best, it had a ‘barely perceptible’ impact on economic growth per head while supressing the wages of the less well-off. Mr Ormerod said: ‘New Labour allowed direct competition to enter the UK labour market on a scale unprecedented in our history…It is the relatively unskilled in the bottom half of the distribution who have lost out. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett (pictured) has defended Labour's record on mass migration, saying he is 'confident' it was the right policy, 'even though very few people now will stand up for it' ‘The liberal elite do not suffer. Indeed, they benefit because many of the services they consume are provided at lower prices than would have been the case without mass immigration.’ His comments were echoed by ex-Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who said: ‘The person that benefits from…growth is often not the one worried that their kid is going to get less attention from the teacher in the class room because there are people speaking Polish.’ But two more Home Secretaries from the New Labour years were unrepentant about the party’s record, despite the fact Ed Miliband has since apologised for how it handled the influx. Charles Clarke, who was sacked over the foreign prisoner scandal in 2006, said: ‘It’s nonsense to suggest it has terrible impact on public services – most of the people coming here were working, didn’t have children, and were not of age to be a big burden on NHS.’ David Blunkett said: ‘I’m confident that it was the right decision, even though very few people now will stand up for it. I just think that allowing people to move [to the UK] but not to work would have been a complete own goal.’","Sir Stephen Wall said Labour failed to realise attraction Britain would pose .

"Danielle Liddle, 22, was beaten with baseball bats and slashed in the face with a butcher's knife while she was giving birth . A pregnant woman was beaten with baseball bats and slashed in the face with a butcher's knife when a masked gang burst into her home while she was giving birth. Danielle Liddle, 22, was about to leave for hospital when five masked men smashed their way into her house in Basildon, Essex, at around 8.30pm using crowbars. She  suffered a 'serious head injury'  and may have a fractured skull  after the gang attacked her with crowbars and a knife  while her two-year-old child was asleep in bed. Her partner Chris Miller, 33, who was upstairs collecting the hospital bag, came running  to protect her and said the young mother is now too traumatised to go back into the house. The mother-of-two was rushed to Basildon Hospital and gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Tuesday despite her injuries. Her partner, who suffered minor injuries in the attack, said: 'This was an extremely traumatic experience for us both. My girlfriend remains in hospital with a serious head injury when she should be celebrating the birth of our child. 'Please help the police to catch these men whose actions have tainted a period of time which should be a happy one for us.' He told how he had gone upstairs to collect essentials for the hospital after his partner's contractions started coming every six minutes. 'The next thing I heard a loud smash - like a fish tank shattering,' he said. 'Before we knew it we had five men in the house screaming 'give us your money'. They cornered my partner then hit her with a crowbar and bats and cut her across the face screaming and demanding more money. I just threw my arms round her to protect her. They carried on beating us. I was just shouting back at them, 'you are wrong man, she is in labour. 'Me and my girlfriend just started screaming and shouting for help.' The men grabbed the couple's iPad, a Sony Experia mobile phone and £60 in cash  and then ran off. The young mother suffered a fractured skull after the masked gang attacked her in her home  in Beambridge (pictured), Essex . The 22-year-old was rushed to Basildon Hospital (pictured) and gave birth to a healthy baby on Tuesday . Police are now hunting the five men, all ages in their twenties with local accents, who broke into the home in Beambridge, Pitsea, on Monday night. Three of the men wore balaclavas and dark clothes, a fourth gang member was white and the fifth was mixed race. Mr Miller said: 'I can't even describe to you how angry I am. My partner is too traumatised to even go back to our home. She is going to need counselling to help her get through this. To do this to a woman who is in labour - it's sick.' Her sister said: 'They attacked her with crowbars, baseball bats and cut her face with a butchers knife. 'She was screaming for them to stop as she was in labour but this did not stop them. Luckily my two-year-old nephew was asleep upstairs and slept through it. 'My sister has had her face stitched but now discovered she may have a fractured skull.' Detective Inspector Joel Henderson, from Basildon CID, said: 'This was a shocking attack on a young woman who was in labour. It is vital we get those people responsible off the streets of Basildon.' Anyone with information can call Basildon CID on 101.

"Pope Francis was mobbed by a group of starstruck nuns during his visit to Naples Cathedral, prompting a cardinal to exclaim: ‘They are going to eat him!’ The cloistered nuns, who usually observe the rules of ‘papal enclosure and rarely leave their nunneries, were let out of their convents for the special occasion. But to the pontiff’s bewilderment, the overly excited women swarmed him during his pastoral visit and needed to be reined in by the Archbishop of Naples. Scroll down for video . Starstruck: Pope Francis can barely contain his bewilderment as he is swarmed by a group of nuns in Naples . Celebrity: The cloistered received special permission to be let out of their convents for the special occasion . Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe urged the ‘sisters’ - who stood to applaud the pontiff as he made his entrance and then inundated him with gifts - to restrain themselves through a microphone, the Telegraph reported. He said: ‘Sisters… Later… well would you look at that.' And to the amusement of those in the building, he joked: ‘And these are the cloistered ones. Just imagine the non-cloistered ones.’ He then added: ‘They are going to eat him! Sisters, sisters!’ During his one-day visit to Naples yesterday, the Argentine pontiff visited the cathedral to visit priests and religious leaders. As he toured some of the city’s poorest areas, where the mafia reign, hundred of thousands gathered for a glimpse. Swarmed: The nuns needed to be reined in by the Archbishop of Naples.

Ritual: Pope Francis kisses the ampulla containing the blood of San Gennaro at the Duomo . But only a few managed to get as much quality time with Pope Francis as the nuns, from seven different closed convents, who had acquired special permission to attend the service. In 2013, the Pope’s presence in the Brazilian town of Aparecida had a similar effect on a group of around 40 nuns. At the time, Vatican spokesman, the Reverend Federico Lombardi, said one nun rushed toward the Pope, embraced him and asked to take a photo together – leading others to follow suit. He added it was ‘one of the most remarkable things’ he had seen during Francis' first inaugral international trip. Mass: Pope Francis greets the crowds as he arrives to lead a service on Piazza del Plebiscito square in Naples yesterday . Opposition: Pope Francis told the crowd that nothing can justify the death penalty and there is no 'right' way to humanely kill another person . The Pope also had lunch with at least 10 gay, transgender and HIV-suffering inmates at a prison in Naples. He shared a meal with about 120 male and female inmates in a city jail, among them several transsexuals and AIDS sufferers chosen to represent those sectors of the prison population, a Church official confirmed. The stop-off at the Giuseppe Salvia Detention Centre in Poggioreale was not originally on his schedule. But the Pope reportedly insisted on the meal which was prepared by the prisoners themselves. The prison visit formed part of a very busy day for Pope Francis in the city 150 miles south of Rome. He began praying at a sanctuary in Pompeii, before holding a string of events which include an outdoor mass and meetings with young people and the sick before heading back to the Vatican this evening.

"A man who led a Kansas commune that collected millions of dollars in life insurance payouts from dead members was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison for the drowning death of one of them 12 years ago. Daniel Perez, 55, stared straight ahead and showed no emotion as he heard his sentence: a life term for murder in Patricia Hughes' 2003 death at the commune's 20-acre compound near Wichita, another life term on a sexual exploitation of a child conviction, and nearly 34 more years behind bars on 26 other counts, including rape. Perez declined to address the court when given the chance. Convicted: Daniel Perez was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder last month in the 2003 drowning death of Patricia Hughes at the suburban Wichita compound where the commune lived . Sedgwick County District Judge Joseph Bribiesca ordered Perez's sentences to be served consecutively, so he wouldn't be eligible for parole until he is 120 years old, according to prosecutors. 'The evidence conclusively shows that Mr. Perez used people as mere objects to fulfill his desire for money, sex and a lavish lifestyle,' Bribiesca said. 'It is just that he serve the maximum sentence.' Prosecutors say Perez sexually abused the young daughters of commune members and devised a scheme to receive life insurance payments after members died. 'It is clear Mr. Perez was the puppet master,' Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett told the court. During the trial, members of the now-defunct commune talked about how they moved from state to state and to Mexico over a 15-year period before they settled at the elaborate compound near Wichita. They testified about being subjected to sexual violence by Perez and about the deaths of six people. Perez, who went by Lou Castro, was charged only with the death of Hughes, who was 26 when she drowned in the commune's pool. Her death was considered an accident until 2011, when a woman who was 12 when Hughes died told authorities that it had been staged to look accidental. The commune had received $1.24 million from Hughes' life insurance policy. Testimony: During the trial, members of the now-defunct commune talked about being subjected to sexual violence by Perez and about the deaths of six people . Proceedings: Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett looks toward Daniel Perez as Perez is sentenced in Sedgwick District Court on Tuesday . A woman, whom The Associated Press isn't identifying because she says she is the victim of sexual assault, pleaded with the court to give Perez the longest possible sentence so as to 'end this nightmare' and keep him from hurting anybody else. She said 'her childhood was over' at the age of 10, when she says Perez first sexually assaulted her. Another woman told the court she was angry because Perez preyed on people like her mother. The father of another victim asked the court to impose the maximum allowable sentence, saying that would be just. Bennett told reporters after the hearing that the sentence Perez received was appropriate. The prosecutor said there were 'so many lives, so many people"" affected by Perez. ""At some point you lose track of how many victims this man actually victimized,' he said. Perez's attorney, Alice Osburn, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. At the hearing, Osburn said her client's position is that the main witnesses against him conspired to commit perjury. She said prosecutors failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and said she plans to appeal.","Daniel Perez, 55, led a Kansas commune that collected millions of dollars in life insurance payouts from dead members .

"An 11-year-old boy has been charged with homicide after a gun he was allegedly playing with went off and killed his 15-year-old friend. The victim, DaVontae Ziegler, was outside on his front porch in Nashville with the 11-year-old and another 14-year-old boy during a school snow day on Friday. Ziegler ran to get help at a neighbor's house after he was shot, but died from his injuries at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. An 11-year-old boy has been charged with homicide after a gun he was allegedly playing with went off and killed his 15-year-old friend DaVonte Ziegler . The 11-year-old told investigators that the gun, which he said he found, fired accidentally while he was playing with it, according to police. Metro police spokesman Don Aaron said witnesses saw the 11-year-old check on his friend after the gun went off, but fled the scene before police arrived. The 11-year-old told police he disposed of the gun. It has not yet been found, according to Aaron. DaVontae's aunt and uncle have been left devastated, both for the loss of the teenager they have raised since he was six weeks old and for the boy who could now face jail time. Glenn Griswould said the 11-year-old often came by the house to play video games with DaVontae. 'They were friends. I just know the little boy didn't do it on purpose,' he told the Tennessean.

'He's going to suffer just knowing that he killed his friend, and that's enough punishment for that child.' Mrs Griswould said she didn't want to feel anger towards the family, but that she 'can't feel sympathy for them right now'. 'They gone took my child,' she told the Tennessean. 'All I know is my child is not coming home. I'm not going to have him wake up on Saturday mornings wanting pancakes.' Mrs Griswould also questioned why the 11-year-old's parents were unaware he had a gun. She told families to watch 'what your children are doing and getting into'. 'So many gangs, so many adults just giving children guns for no apparent reason,' she told WKRN-TV. 'And it's killing our children.' Mrs Griswould said she hopes the child doesn't receive a life sentence in prison. 'He's going to suffer just knowing that he killed his friend, and that's enough punishment for that child,' she said .","Victim DaVontae Ziegler was shot on the front porch of his Nashville home .

"Jailed: Prolific burglar Darren Williams was 'clobbered' with a walking stick as he tried to burgle a pensioner . A prolific burglar who was caught after a have-a-go-hero pensioner 'clobbered' him with his walking stick has been jailed. George Clewlow, 78, leapt into action after Darren Williams broke into his bungalow last July. He used his wooden walking stick to whack Williams, 43, over the head as he tried to clamber through an open living room window at his home in Penkhull, Staffs. Williams fled empty-handed but was caught when police used samples of his DNA left on the window handle and it provided a match for the career criminal. He was jailed for three years after he admitted burglary at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday. The court heard Williams, of Stoke-on-Trent, had 22 convictions for house burglaries dating back nearly 30 years. Judge David Fletcher, told him: 'You have an appalling record - 22 house burglaries, all since 1986. 'You have nothing of a recent vintage, which is mainly because of a lengthy prison sentence.' Robert Holt, defending, said: 'This was an opportunistic offence, it was not a targeted property.' Yesterday Mr Clewlow, a retired bricklayer, said Williams should have received a longer sentence. He said: 'He's not going to stop until someone gives him a really good hiding. 'I had no idea what it was. At first I thought it could be just the wind, so I went to the toilet. 'When I came back I could see someone coming through, so I clobbered him with my stick, and after I had a poke at him he ran off. 'I watched him run all the way down the road - I wasn't sure if I'd be able to recognise him because of the dark, but I remembered he ran like a little monkey. 'After he ran off I made myself a cup of tea to steady myself. Brave: George Clewlow used his wooden walking stick to whack Williams, 43, over the head as he tried to clamber through an open living room window at his home in Penkhull, Staffs. 'I wasn't sure whether I should go next door to tell the neighbours someone tried to break in, but then I remembered someone had put a card through the door with a police number on it, so I called that. 'The more I thought about it the more difficult it was - I keep checking my windows and doors are locked, and every time I get up in the night I look to that window. 'Luckily my daughter lives near me, which helps a lot, but when my allotment was broken into a few weeks later and someone took all my gardening equipment that shook me a bit. 'The police have been great, and our local officer Katy Thorneycroft checks up on me to make sure I'm safe, but he should have got a longer sentence. 'My mum got broken into and she never spoke again, so it can ruin people's lives. 'If it had been two more minutes he would have been in the house and it would have been a much bigger confrontation, and he knows these bungalows are all for elderly people, so he must have planned it.'","George Clewlow, 78, leapt into action as Darren Williams broke into home .

"A female self-made billionaire has vowed to fight civil fraud charges lodged against her by the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims she wrongly claimed more than $200 million in fees suggesting it was a battle between 'good and evil'. Wall Street executive Lynn Tilton, 55, of Patriarch Partnership is accused of hiding poorly performing investments among some of her dealings with distressed companies. The high-profile investor seeks out companies facing financial problems and attempts to turn them into profitable businesses. Lynn Tilton, pictured, has vowed to defend herself against charges that she defrauded her investors . However, the SEC believes that Ms Tilton failed to adequately tell people who invested more than $2.5 billion in some of her companies that they continued to face financial difficulties. The SEC said alleged fraud has continued since 2003. The SEC's decision to prosecute Tilton is seen as an attempt by government regulators to impose standards on Wall Street. President Obama has recently announced tougher restrictions on brokers who advise Americans over their retirement accounts. The SEC claims that Tilton failed her legal duty to clients to warn that some of the companies she had invested their money in were performing worse than expected. In its filing to a New York court the SEC said that Tilton 'intentionally and consistently directed' that the value of the assets remained unchanged even though they were worth less. The court documents said that three of the funds had under performed and Tilton had failed to pass this information on to her clients. The Securities and Exchange Commission claims that Tilton, second right, failed to properly inform her clients that some of the investment products had not been performing as well as they had anticipated . Tilton's company dismissed the allegations claiming that the SEC action was 'ill-founded and at odds with Patriarch's investment strategy, which was consistently disclosed since the inception of the funds. 'We look forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend ourselves against the SEC's allegations.' Tilton told CNBC that despite the SEC's case against her, she will continue to run more than 70 companies in her portfolio. She said: 'I am shocked. I am disappointed, saddened and ... I am certain that the allegations are ill-founded.' She said the case was 'the ultimate battle in good against evil, light against dark.' She added: 'My number one priority is protecting my company and my people so that I can maximize the value of the funds. My people need to know that I am fighting for them. I also want to live in a country where I can fight for truth without assuming that because it's the government that I am guilty without the battle. As someone who has always fought for truth, and protected her integrity and her intent, and have prevailed, I expect to do that.' Tilton claimed that her business model of investing in distressed companies does involve some failures,although she described her backers as 'sophisticated investors'.","Watchdog claims Lynn Tilton failed to keep investors properly informed .

"Allegations of child sexual abuse have arisen at another one of Australia's most prestigious private schools, prompting a new investigation. St Ignatius College Riverview issued letters to its alumni informing them a claim relating to child sexual abuse had been made and informing them the information had been passed on to NSW police for investigation,  the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The letter, penned by Principal Paul Hine, gave no details of the allegations except that it concerned child sexual abuse and that it happened more than 30 years ago. St Ignatius College Riverview issued letters to its alumni informing them of a claim relating to child sexual abuse that dates back 30 years . The allegation was passed to Dr Hine by the professional standards office of the Australian Province of the Society of Jesus. Michelle O’Brien, the director of professional standards for the Jesuits, told The Australian her office had been aware of the claims for more than a year and that they had been passed on to police last May. Mr Hine was briefed on the claim four weeks ago. Due to the sensitive nature of the allegation very little information has be released, however, Dr Hine insisted it was his duty to inform past and present students of the harrowing claim. The principal called on students, past and present, to report any concerns they have relating to child abuse to himself or the Australian Province of the Society of Jesus immediately. In an excerpt of the letter published by the Sydney Morning Herald, Dr Hine wrote: ‘I believe it important to inform you about the situation as I understand it and to offer reassurance that such matters are the object of direct and sustained vigilance at the school.’ Dr Hine has been principal of St Ignatius since 2013 . The principal called on students, past and present, to report any concerns they have relating to child abuse to himself or the Australian Province of the Society of Jesus immediately. ‘The college and the Jesuits wish to express, in the strongest possible terms, their abhorrence of sexual misconduct or any form of abuse involving children,’ the letter read. ‘We wish to respond to past abuse and suffering with a commitment to healing, openness and accountability.’ Dr Pine tried to remind students and parents that Riverview has a ‘proud history’ of caring for its students. ""This situation presents a salient reminder of the need to protect our young people both in policy and in practice."" The prestigious school, located on Sydney’s north shore, has been responsible for the education of several high profile Australians including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Minister for Agriculture Barnaby Joyce and the Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher. Prime Minister Tony Abbott is among several notable figures who attended the prestigious school . The recent claims dredged up old allegations that former teacher and pupil Peter Bohrsmann had sexually abused a student during his time at Riverview. The 57-year-old categorically denied the allegations made to police anonymously before taking his own life two days later on school grounds. Police have made no links between the current allegations and any past complaints.","St Ignatius College, Riverview is embroiled in fresh child sex allegations .

Sporting a curly mop, the 'acne-prone' Ruffalo is distressed with his complexion, and is shown solemnly smearing the Clearasil pads on his face with a deadpan expression.

Naomi would have been about 16 at the time that this advert came out. Cue tons of cheesy grins and wide collar suits from a now 46-year-old Naomi Watts. Check out that perm! Naomi Watts starred in a tampon commercial for Tampax in the 1980s . The clip features tons of Eighties clichés including hair bows and wide-collar suits . Brad Pitt . Before he became a hot commodity in Hollywood and one half of the power couple that is 'Brangelina', Brad Pitt, now 51, was out patrolling the streets looking for Pringle-popping ladies to impress, or so this commercial shows. Brad sports a golden tan and cavorts with his 'jock' friends in a yellow convertible; he would have been about 25 years of age. With no dialogue, Brad can only showcase his acting prowess by munching the crisps in a ecstatic manner. Brad Pitt featured in a cheesy advert for Pringles crisps in 1988. He is one of three topless men in the video . The famous Hollywood actor would have been just 25-years-old at the time and still trying to catch his lucky break . Sarah Michelle Gellar . She may be widely recognised as stake-toting high-kicking Buffy the vampire slayer, but 38-year-old Sarah Michelle Gellar started her career as a child actor, and starred in Burger King's first ever televised advert in 1981. Pictured in sweet lavender dungarees and ribbon-held bunches, four-year-old Gellar sits on a picnic bench in an idyllic town and weighs up Burger King's benefits against McDonald's disadvantages. In a endearing voice she pips: 'I go to Burger King!' Fast-food slayer Sarah Michelle Gellar in a Burger King in 1981 at only four years old . Bryan Cranston . Considering his now-legendary  status following a starring role in Breaking Bad (he counts stars like Rihanna and Keith Richards as fans), Bryan Cranston's Eighties hemorrhoids advert is certainly one of the most embarrassing. Cranston, now 59, walks up to the camera in a retro suit and holds up a tub of hemorrhoid cream, raving about 'hemorrhoidal tissue' and the cream's beneficial qualities. In the early 1980s Bryan Cranston starred in a commercial for a hemorrhoid cream Preparation H  around 25 years or so before Breaking Bad success . Demi Moore . Before 52-year-old Ghost actress Demi Moore had the Hollywood body everyone aspired to achieve, she starred as a less polished youth in sultry Coca Cola adverts. With soft jazz music playing, a shoulder-padded Demi has an almost fatal incident with a Diet Coke can, but which ultimately leads her to meeting a handsome gentleman. Demi would have been about 26 years old at the time. Actress Demi Moore featured in a Diet Coke commercial in 1988 . Ben Affleck . Now a  twice Oscar-winning actor/director, 42-year-old Ben Affleck has certainly come a long way since his fast-food days. The advert shows Affleck sporting a bouncy quiff, bomber jacket and bleached denim, patrolling the streets in a car with a vintage in-built phone. The actor would have only been about 17 at the time. A few cheesy hair-grooming moments and a case of mistaken identity later and he's picking up a Burger King Chef Salad for his female interest. But before long is  called home by his dad for his curfew. Embarassing. In 1989 Ben Affleck was in a Burger King commercial. He would have been about 17 at the time . Bruce Willis . It's hard to imagine 60-year-old Die Hard actor Bruce Willis shimmying down the street in a white baggy suit with three supermodels, but in the late Nineties his advert for Seagram's Wine Coolers tells a different story. The actor would have been around 32 years of age and is pictured playfully skipping and twirling with the ladies. He is eventually seen sporting a sleeveless t-shirt and enthusiastically playing the harmonica. Before his action-packed glory days, Bruce Willis made his name in an advert for Seagram's Wine Coolers in 1987. This was about a year before he appeared in his career-making lead role in Die Hard . Mila Kunis . Four years before Mila Kunis, now 31, got her big break in  sitcom That '70s Show, and several years before she was crowned FHM's Sexiest Woman Alive, she was just another girl who liked to play with dolls - and starred in an advert for Glitter Hair Barbie in 1994. 11-year-old Mila is seen fresh-faced with a plait in her long hair, sporting a pink turtleneck and excitedly gazing at the doll that can have glitter combed into its locks. Mila Who-nis? Mila Kunis used to star in commercials such as this one for Glitter Hair Barbie in 1994, when she was about 11 years old .","Leonardo DiCaprio, Mila Kunis, Ben Affleck and Anne Hathaway all appeared in advertisements as young actors .

"A deputy U.S. marshal was  killed during a shootout at a Louisiana motel by a fugitive wanted on two counts of first-degree murder. Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells, 27, was fatally shot around 11am on Tuesday at Elm Grove Motel in Scotlandville - an area north of Baton Rouge, according to Drew Wade, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service. The fugitive, Jamie D. Croom, 31, from New Roads was shot and taken to a hospital where his condition has not been released. Croom has been on the run since the February 18 shooting outside the Sugar Shack nightclub in Pointe Coupee that left Lechelle Rita Williams, 42, and her 38-year-old brother Sinica Lee Williams dead.

Wells, who was assigned to the Southern District office in Mississippi, was a part of a task force led by federal marshals, who were serving an arrest warrant when the shootout took place (above scenes from the shooting on Elm Grove Garden Road) Croom has been charged in a federal criminal complaint with Wells' murder, but further details were not provided (above law enforcement gather in front of Elm Grove Motel where shootout took place) Wells, who was assigned to the Southern District office in Mississippi, was a part of a task force led by federal marshals, who were serving an arrest warrant when the shootout took place. No other officers were hurt during the shooting, according to WBRZ. 'Deputy marshals risk their lives every day going after the worst of the worst,' Wade said. 'This is a sad day for law enforcement.' Wells was a graduate of East Central High School in Hurley, Mississippi, and also attended Jackson State University. 'He was a tremendous student,' East Central Principal James Hughey told WLOX-TV. 'He was very well liked.' No other officers were hurt during the shooting (above scenes from the Elm Grove Motel) Wells comes from a law enforcement family, according to Mississippi state Rep. Manly Barton of Moss Point. His father, Obie Wells Sr., is a retired Jackson County sheriff's deputy, and his brother, Obie Wells Jr., is an officer with the Jackson Police Department in the state capital. Wells had been serving as Deputy Marshal since 2011, according to The Advocate. Croom has been charged in a federal criminal complaint with Wells' murder, but further details were not provided, said U.S. Attorney Walt Green of Louisiana's Middle District. The fugitive had a lengthy criminal history between 2000-2014 that included attempted aggravated assault with a fire arm in 2001, aggravated second-degree battery in 2005, attempted second-degree murder in 2005 and 2014, according to an earlier report by NBC 33 News. Croom has been on the run since the February 18 shooting outside the Sugar Shack nightclub in Pointe Coupee that left Lechelle Rita Williams (left), 42, and her 38-year-old brother Sinica Lee Williams (right) dead . 'He was a dangerous criminal,' said Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff Beauregard Torres III. 'It was a very high price to pay for this warrant to bring this man into custody. It was a very, very high price.' Investigators have not established a motive in the shootings of the brother and sister. The FBI will lead the investigation into the shooting death of Wells.","Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells, 27, was killed around 11am on Tuesday at Elm Grove Motel in Scotlandville - an area north of Baton Rouge, LA .

"Barack Obama appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday and kept things lighthearted save for a discussion of recent events in Ferguson, Missouri. After poking fun at himself by reading mean tweets people have written about him among other self-deprecating bits, Obama reflected on Wednesday night's shooting of two police officers in racially tense Ferguson, Missouri, just days after he had delivered a speech on racial healing in Selma, Alabama. 'Whoever fired those shots should not detract from the issue - they are criminals, they need to be arrested. And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides - law enforcement, who have a terrifically tough job, and people who understandably don't want to be stopped and harassed just because of their race - that they are able to work together to come up with some good answers.' Barack Obama appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday and kept things lighthearted save for a discussion of recent events in Ferguson, Missouri . The president simultaneously addressed the Justice Department's findings about police behavior in Ferguson that led up to last summer's mass protests. 'What had been happening was questionable and objectionable and should have been protested,' the president said. He went on to refer to findings that the town had intentionally targeted African American citizens for ticketing and arrest largely as a means of making money. 'There was a whole structure, according to the justice department, that indicated racism' he said. The president was careful to hedge his bets between protesters and police, though. 'In the same way you can't generalize about police officers...you can't generalize against protesters,' he said, while maintaining firmly that those who fired at police were criminals and the exception to the rule. First sitting president on the show: The president was in Los Angeles to attend a Democratic fundraiser when he swung by Jimmy Kimmel Live . In Washington, President Barack Obama had already taken to Twitter to relay his prayers to the officers and to denounce violence against police. 'Path to justice is one all of us must travel together,' Obama wrote, signing the tweet with his initials to indicate the president personally composed it . The shootings marked the first time in more than seven months of tension in Ferguson that officers were shot at a protest, and the bloodshed threatened to inflame the already fraught relationship between police and protesters just as the city seeks reforms in the wake of a withering Justice Department report on racial bias in its law-enforcement practices. The attack also seemed to create another layer of race-related mistrust after a week in which an unarmed young black man was killed by a white officer in Madison, Wisconsin, and a University of Oklahoma fraternity chapter was thrown off campus after a video surfaced showing members singing a racist chant. In Washington, President Barack Obama took to Twitter to relay his prayers to the officers and to denounce violence against police. 'Path to justice is one all of us must travel together,' Obama wrote, signing the tweet with his initials to indicate the president personally composed it.

"British style icon Paul Smith has helped to redesign one of this country's most distinctive cars before production is stopped later this year. These pictures show the stunning one-of-a-kind Land Rover Defender produced by Sir Paul, who has been a fan of the 4x4 for years and owns several of them. The bodywork features 27 different coloured panels based on British woodlands and colours used by the British Army, while the interior is covered with bespoke leather and fabrics made by Sir Paul. Striking: Designed Sir Paul Smith custom made this one-of-a-kind Land Rover Defender to celebrate the iconic car ahead of it going out of production at the end of the year . Patchwork: The body panels are painted a total of 27 different colours, and Sir Paul said he took inspiration from the countryside and British Army vehicles for the design . Historic: The modern-day Defender is a descendant of the first ever car made by Land Rover, the Series 1, and has been in production since 1948 . The designer, who was knighted in 2000 and has dressed the likes of Bradley Wiggins and the England football team, said: 'The Defender is a British icon, which is something I’m exceptionally proud of. 'This is a complete one-off; I wanted to give this Defender a feeling of luxury, so I used a mix of leather and fabric for the seats. 'I actually used the fabric that I design for Maharam, the American upholstery company. 'I wanted deep, rich colours, but at the same time, I wanted them to work together yet be surprising. My designs are known for their attention to detail, so I didn't want this Defender to be any different.' Luxurious: Sir Paul chose bespoke leather for the interior, and had the seats made out of fabric he disgnes himself for an American fashion-house . Pedigree: Since 1948 around 15.million Defenders have been produced, and it is thought that as many as two thirds of those are still on the road somewhere in the world . Detailing: The London designer, who was knighted in 2000 and has dressed the likes of Bradley Wiggins and the England football team, said attention to detail was key in making the Defender . Included on the car are two Paul Smith logos. One inside a clock on the dashboard, and another below the Land Rover logo on the back. The modern-day defender is a descendant of Land Rover's first ever off-road vehicle, which was launched back in 1948, making it the world's oldest car still to be in production. Named the Series 1, the original design was sketched in sand on Anglesey beach by Rover's chief engineer Maurice Wilkes. Popular: Sir Paul called the car 'a British icon' and is known to be a fan, having owned several of them . Hand delivered: The Defender is seen parked outside the Paul Smith store in London's upmarket Mayfair . Since then Land Rover has sold 1.5million of the vehicles, and, of those, it is said that two thirds of them remain on the roads somewhere in the world. According to the Birmingham Mail, the Solihull factory that produces the Defender has had to ramp up production by 50 per cent to cope with orders flooding in before it is discontinued in December. Gerry McGovern, design director and chief creative officer of Land Rover, added: 'I felt it would be a fitting tribute to the iconic Defender, that one of Britain's most distinguished designers worked with the Land Rover team to recognise his creative vision.' Send off: Gerry McGovern, design director at Land Rover, said the car was a 'fitting tribute' to the Defender .","Land Rover Defender set to end production in December after 67 years .

"The White House said on Wednesday that it doesn't care that Hillary Clinton deleted emails she says were personal and not in any way related to her work at the State Department. Nor did federal officials review them before Clinton's team trashed them, it said, because they were part of her private communications. 'Frankly the secretary's handling of her own personal email and the maintenance of her personal email inbox is something that I'm not gonna comment on, and I'm not particularly interested in,' the chief spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Josh Earnest, told reporters on Wednesday. He also revealed that President Barack Obama hasn't spoken to Hillary Clinton since it became public that she solely used a private email address while serving as secretary of state, saying it's  been at least a 'couple weeks' since they last talked, as far as he's aware. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama hasn't spoken to Hillary Clinton since it became public that she solely used a private email address while serving as secretary of state, the White House's chief spokesman said Wednesday. It's been at least a 'couple weeks' since they last talked, as far as he's aware . In an endeavor to put an end to the uproar, now in its second week, Clinton held a press conference on Wednesday at the United Nations' headquarters following her remarks to the body about women's rights . That, of course, does not mean that other senior administration officials haven't talked to Clinton or her aides since the controversy began over Clinton's personal email system, which she maintained on a private server located at her home in New York. In an endeavor to put an end to the uproar, now in its second week, Clinton held a press conference on Wednesday at the United Nations' headquarters following her remarks to the body about women's rights. Rather than quench the public's thirst for information, Clinton ginned up questions anew by admitting that she eliminated half of online correspondence from her tenure in the Obama administration - more than 30,000 emails - that she deemed private. Asked about the matter on Wednesday, the president's top spokesman revealed that the executive branch did not sort through Clinton's emails before she tossed them out, so it has no idea if she obeyed federal regulations. 'The federal government did not review Secretary Clinton's personal email. Secretary Clinton's team did that,' Earnest said at his regular meeting with the White House press corps. 'It is not the practice of this administration to review the personal email of federal government employees,' he added. 'I don't know of any previous administration that's done that either.' It was 'the responsibility of her team,' he said, to determine which emails were government property. 'Nobody has marshaled any evidence that I've seen, at least, to indicate that they've fallen short of what they said they did,' he said. And now no one can, another reporter pointed out to the Obama administration official later, because the evidence appears to have been destroyed - a remark that earned giggles and snorting from the rest of the briefing room. Earnest also suggested that the White House was left out of the loop on Clinton's decision to dispose of emails she says were personal in nature. 'I was not aware of the personal email habits of the secretary, who maintained her personal email inbox,' he retorted after ABC News' Jon Karl asked him if the White House knew of her plans. Pressed to give an accounting of the email practice's of someone he does keep tabs on - the president - Earnest declined to go into detail as he has in the past, invoking security precautions. He did make clear that the president has followed the laws that apply to his communications, however. 'The president does take very seriously the requirements that he is under based on the Presidential Records Act,' Earnest act. 'And I can tell you that, that all the emails the president sends are governed by that act and are properly maintained in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.' As far as Clinton's records are concerned, Earnest acknowledged that the matter is not as simple as saying, cased closed, and moving on while putting the onus on the press to do just that. Given that the State Department has not finished reviewing her emails for release to Congress and to the public, it's fair to say 'there's ongoing work on this matter,' he said. As it pertains to Clinton's compliance with the Federal Records Act, though, which requires her to give the State Department copies of all her government emails, he indicated that the White House had come to terms with the situation as it currently stands -  that Clinton's emails are out of the government's reach and only she can choose to release them. Seemingly exasperated with reporters' nearly endless questions about Clinton's emails, Earnest also deflected a question about whether the White House would offer up the the former cabinet official's conduct as an example of 'model' behavior given that she violated State Department and administration guidelines that warn against using personal email for business purposes. 'Those guidelines have been made clear, and they've been further clarified over the last couple years as the president has taken steps to do exactly that,' he said, referring to rules the president put in place after Clinton left his service that are significantly stricter when it comes to email usage. So, she wouldn't be, the reporter said, prodding him. 'I think we've been very clear about what the guidance is. That was true last week, and that is true this week,' the president's spokesman wearily responded.","White House said on Wednesday that it's 'not particularly' concerned that Hillary Clinton deleted emails she says were personal .
President's top spokesman revealed that the executive branch did not sort through Clinton's emails before she tossed them out .
'It is not the practice of this administration to review the personal email of federal government employees,' he said .

"Boris Johnson has urged ministers to slash the stake on betting machines known as the 'crack cocaine of gambling'. The London Mayor has told the Mail he believes fixed odds betting terminals can be dangerously addictive and allow bookmakers to prey on the vulnerable within our society. He is the first high-profile Conservative to call for the maximum stake on these roulette-style games to be slashed to as little as £2. Punters can currently lose £100 per spin. And Mr Johnson revealed he has been pushing ministers to act to tackle the 'scourge' and harm they cause by also preventing them 'clustering' in certain areas. 'Dangerously addictive': Boris Johnson has urged ministers to slash the stake on betting machines known as the 'crack cocaine of gambling' Fixed odds betting terminals, which are available in any High Street betting shop, have been blamed by campaigners, charities and local councils for a worrying rise in problem gambling and anti-social behaviour. Mr Johnson's intervention comes as the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, using data published by bookmakers in their annual reports and via the industry watchdog, says a staggering £1.5billion was lost on these machines in the UK last year – up from £1billion in 2009. 'Fixed odds betting machines are the scourge of our High Streets and a very bad thing for our community,' Mr Johnson said. 'They can be dangerously addictive, their promise of whopping wins only gives false hope, and they prey on the vulnerable within our society. I have urged the Government to proceed with the utmost caution when considering the maximum stakes available on these machines.' Mr Johnson has also privately advocated cutting the stake, in line with other gambling machines in pubs and betting shops. There are more than 33,000 across the UK. Problem gambling: Mr Johnson's (pictured) intervention comes as the Campaign for Fairer Gambling says a staggering £1.5billion was lost on these machines in the UK last year . In a letter to a correspondent who wrote to him about the harm caused by fixed odds betting terminals, seen by the Mail, Mr Johnson replied that he advocated the approach taken by 'local authorities, charities and faith and community groups to limit the stakes on these machines'. They have called for a cut to £2. Councils in England have also demanded greater powers to allow planners to reject applications for new betting shops if there is already a cluster of them. Bookmakers William Hill, Ladbrokes, Gala Coral and Paddy Power recently agreed to restrict advertising of the machines in shop windows and on television before the 9pm watershed.","London Mayor said 'dangerously addictive' machines prey on vulnerable .

A Yemeni man says the child, pictured riding a horse, was killed in the Saudi air stirke in Sana'a on Thursday  The strikes were 'in support of the people of Yemen and their legitimate government,' Saudi Arabia's Washington ambassador Adel al-Jubeir said . An Associated Press reporter on the scene in the Sanaa neighborhood near the international airport saw people searching for loved ones in the debris of flattened homes. Residents said at least three bodies were pulled from the rubble. There were traces of blood between the bricks. Ahmed al-Sumaini said an entire alley close to the airport was wiped out in the strikes overnight. Buildings were razed and cars destroyed during the attacks, which killed at least 18 people when bombs fell on Sana'a . Traces of blood were found between the bricks of houses that once stood in Sana'a. Iran has condemned the attacks, saying they considered the air strike 'a dangerous step' People carry the body of a man they uncovered from under the rubble of a house destroyed by an air strike. At least 17 civilians are understood to have died during the attack . He said people ran out from their homes in the middle of the night. ""This was a surprise. I was asleep and I was jolted out of my bed,"" he said, waving a piece of shrapnel. In addition to the airport, targets included the camp of U.S.-trained Yemeni special forces, which is controlled by generals loyal to Saleh. Yemeni security officials said the targets also included a missile base in Sanaa that was controlled by the Houthis earlier this year. One of the security officials said the strikes also targeted the fuel depot at the base. People search for survivors under the rubble of houses destroyed by an air strike near Sana'a Airport. Saudi Arabia and Gulf allies have launched air strikes on Yemen . Armed members of Houthi militias and people gather in the rubble of houses that were destroyed by a Saudi air strike in Sana'a. The Iran-backed rebels have made rapid gains in recent months . Saudi Arabia announced it was leading a military offensive in Yemen with the support of nine other countries after the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, moved on Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi's last refuge in the southern city of Aden. The Houthis had captured the city's airport and put a $100,000 bounty on Hadi's head. Hadi was forced to flee the country by boar, and local media reports say he has taken refuge in neighbouring state Oman.

Translated from the Arabic, their name means 'Supporters of God' and members belong to the Zaidi branch of Islam, who operate primarily in Yemen. The group is named after Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who was killed by the Yemeni army after launching an insurgency in 2004. After members of Houthis took part in the Yemeni Revolution in 2011, the group won control of key territory across the country and by September 2014 had captured parts of the capital Sana'a. In January they took over the Presidential Palace in Sana'a, before officially taking control of the government in February - dissolving Parliament, deposing President Hadi and announcing its 'Revolutionary Committee' as the new governing authority. Houthis are believed to be backed by Iran, who have now strongly attacked the Saudi Arabia and their allies in the Gulf for launching air strikes on Houthis strongholds. Source: Al Jazeera/Wikipedia . Iran 'condemns the airstrikes against Yemen this morning that left some innocent Yemenis wounded and dead and considers this action a dangerous step,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said in a statement. The country has denied providing money and training to the Shi'ite Houthi militia in Yemen, as alleged by some Western and Yemeni officials. She said military action would complicate and worsen the crisis in Yemen. The departure of President Hadi, a close U.S. ally, and the imminent fall of the southern port of Aden pushed Yemen further toward a violent collapse. It also threatens to turn the impoverished but strategic country into another proxy battle between the Middle East's Sunni powers and Shiite-led Iran. Saudi ambassador to the United States Adel al-Jubeir announced the military operation in a news conference in Washington. He said his government had consulted closely with the U.S. and other allies but that the U.S. military was not involved in the operations. The White House said in a statement late Wednesday that the U.S. was coordinating military and intelligence support with the Saudis but not taking part directly in the strikes. Armed members of Houthi militia gather over the rubble of houses that were allegedly destroyed by a Saudi air strike, in the capital city of Sana'a. The militant organisation had captured the city's airport and put a $100,000 bounty on Hadi's head . Yemenis gather beside vehicles allegedly destroyed by a Saudi Air Strike in Sana'a. The strikes were 'in support of the people of Yemen and their legitimate government', said Saudi's Washington ambassador . Regional players are also involved in the military action, with the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain joining Saudi Arabia in a statement published by the Saudi Press Agency. It said they would answer a request from Hadi 'to protect Yemen and his dear people from the aggression of the Houthi militias which were and are still a tool in the hands of foreign powers that don't stop meddling with the security and stability of brotherly Yemen.' An armed man walks on the rubble of houses destroyed by an air strike near Sana'a. The strikes were launched to counter Iran-allied forces besieging the southern city of Aden . A former Army General, Hadi became the President of Yemin in 2012, having previously acted as Vice President and Acting President under All Abdullah Saleh. Since taking office he took a firm stance against Al Qaida, but was forced into taking a power sharing agreement with the Houthis, after they gained control of the Yemen capital of Sana'a in 2014. When the Houthis took over the presidential palace in January of this year, Hadi and his Prime Minister Khaled Baheh handed in their resignations and were placed in virtual house arrest. On the run: Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was smuggled out the southern port city Aden just hours after the Shiite rebels advanced and has since escaped from Yemen by sea . Once the Houthis grip of Yemen grew stronger, after they formed an interim government, General Secretary of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon urged that Hadi be named as President of Yemen again. After he left Sana'a for his home of Aden, Hadi used a speech to declare himself President, calling the actions of the Houthis 'unconstitutional'. But after the rebels advanced on his last refuge, the former President has been forced to flee the country to escape capture - and sparking air strikes from neighbouring Gulf states as they try to reinstate order on the region. Source: Al Jazeera/Wikipedia . Oman, the sixth member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, didn't sign onto the statement. Egypt also announced political and military support. 'There is coordination ongoing now with Saudi Arabia and the brotherly gulf countries about preparations to participate with an Egyptian air and naval forces and ground troops if necessary,' it said in a statement carried by the state news agency. Pakistan, Jordan, Morocco and Sudan were also joining the operation, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Thursday, while a source also said Jordanian air force fighter jets were participating in the coordinate action. Saudi Ambassador to the United States Adel Al-Jubeir speaking about his country's air strikes on Yemen against the Houthi militia, during a press conference in Washington . Yemeni civilians and security forces desperately search for survivors among the rubble of buildings destroyed by the airstrikes . Dr Natasha Underhill, an expert on terrorism in the Middle East at Nottingham Trent University, warned that Yemen now stands on the brink of civil war. She said 'With the President effectively removed from power and with no clear sign of a return on the horizon, the situation is reaching a boiling point and the power vacuum that has emerged could result in the failure of the state in the coming weeks. 'The fact that Iran is backing the Houthis is key to their success to date. AQAP have staged deadly attacks but more significant has been the emergence of a Yemen affiliate of the Islamic State group. 'Saudi Arabia's intervention through the use of airstrikes has added fuel to the fire and may in fact lead to increased fighting between President Hadi's forces and the Houthis. 'The fear with the Saudi involvement at this point would be that it may be seen as an act of aggression and could thus trigger further outbreaks of violence in the already troubled region.' The embattled president fled the country by sea on Wednesday evening after Houthi rebels advanced on the southern port city where he was taking refuge, captured his defence minister and seized the airport. Reports on Thursday morning suggested that Aden airport had been retaken by forces loyal to Mr Hadi however after heavy fighting. Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was initially smuggled out of Aden just hours after the Shia rebels' own TV station declared the capture of nearby strategic airbase and arrested the country's defence minister. The air base is only 35 miles from Aden, where Hadi had established a temporary capital since fleeing Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa last month. Just hours after Hadi fled, the rebels who offered a $100,000 bounty for his capture carried out a wave of airstrikes targeting the presidential security forces guarding the palace. The advance of the Shiite rebels, empowered by the backing of the ousted Yemeni autocrat Ali Abdullah Saleh and his loyalists, threatens to plunge the Arab world's poorest country into a civil war that could draw in its Gulf neighbors.","Country's military launch offensive after Houthis rebels advanced on Aden .

Despite 'private property' and 'no tresspassing' (sic) being written down the side of the building it is clear that people have continued to enter . One bit of graffiti, written in 2014, even reads: 'Ebola will kill us all.' The eerie set of photographs were taken by photojournalist and former soldier Robert Johnson. The 40-year-old discovered hundreds of medical records, old newspapers and staff time-cards as he explored the building. After taking the photographs he wrote on Twitter: 'It was one surprise after another in Detroit's abandoned United Community Hospital #InsideDetroit.'

"A small island which emerges from the Muodaoxi River in southwest China every spring has become a new tourist hot spot because of its similarity to a turtle, reported People's Daily Online. The scene has been dubbed 'spring turtle rising from water' by local residents. Turtle is an auspicious sign in China representing longevity. The rock's appearance depends on the amount of floodwater heading downstream. The turtle shape only appears when the water level stands between 163 and 168 metres. The island seen from afar. Know as the 'spring turtle rising from water', the rock in Muodaoxi River is a new tourist hot spot in southwest China . Turtle shape become most visible when the Three Gorges Reservior sends water downstream and the water level drops to 163-168 metres . Muodaoxi river is located within the Three Gorges Reservoir Region and the water level is controlled by the Three Gorges Dam. Spring is regarded as the best time to enjoy the scene as the Three Gorges Reservoir supplies water to the areas downstream, which brings down the water level. The natural phenomena is now so well known that once it appears each year word quickly spreads, causing a flood of tourists to take photographs from the nearby mountains and hills. 'It's a popular saying round here for the arrival of spring, we just say the turtle is coming,' said local Meng Liu. Although new to general tourists, the annual spectacle is well-known among locals. Instead of saying spring is coming, they say 'turtle is coming' When the river is at its normal depth at 175 metres, the island only shows a small tip above the water. In comparison, when the water falls to around 145 metres, the rock becomes connected to the mainland. The island is in the middle of Muodaoxi River which runs through Longshi village in Yunyang County in Chongqing city.

Max Dawson, a former Northwestern University professor who taught a class called 'The Tribe Has Spoken: Surviving TV's New Reality' for two years was voted off the hit reality show Survivor after just four episodes . Contestants apparently thought Dawson was 'annoying'. He was seen over-strategizing and spewing knowledge of past seasons throughout his time on the show . But his constant over-strategizing, interpersonal skills and vast knowledge of past seasons seemed to bother his competitors, according to the Chicago Tribune. Before the voting ceremony on Wednesday's episode, contestant Will Sims said that the debate as to who would go home was 'really about who is the most annoying', and Dawson was offed. When host Jeff Probst announced during the ceremony that it was the time to use a hidden immunity idol, Dawson, who received his Bachelor's degree from Brown University in 1999 and went on to get a PhD from Northwestern in 2008, spoke up. 'Hey Jeff, hold up, bro,' He said as reached behind his back, coming up with nothing. 'I just always wanted to say that.' His fellow contestants rolled their eyes at his fan-like comment. Dawson, a member of the White Collar Tribe while on the show, said that he found 'the personal dynamics' to be a difficult aspect of playing the show . This season of Survivor contestants were divided into three teams: the Blue Collar Tribe, White Collar Tribe and No Collar Tribe. Though Dawson was only ever a member of the white tribe, there is cross-tribe mingling on the show. Dawson, who now lives and works in Los Angeles, told the Tribune before the show aired that he 'had no idea how difficult it would be to actually play'. 'And that applied to the the basic survival elements - the food, the water, the shelter, the sun - but it really, more than anything for me, to the personal dynamics,' he said. After the episode aired on Wednesday, Dawson claimed on Twitter that he didn't know that much Survivor trivia, despite teaching a class on the show for two years. 'Full disclosure: I actually don't know that much Survivor trivia. It's just most that players who call themselves fans are actually casuals,' he wrote.

"A suspicious email about the death of a DJ-turned-conman was distributed this week . A suspicious email about the death of a DJ-turned-conman was distributed this week, as it was revealed that he racked up $250,000 in debts after setting up numerous fake businesses across Australia. The letter was sent to media outlets on Tuesday night, including radioinfo, claiming Dene Broadbelt had taken his own life. In 2014 Fairfax Media unveiled that the young fraudster, who goes by various aliases including Dene Broadbent, Dean Mussillon, Nic Lloyd and Clay O'Connor, had a series of ventures including a charity cancer walk. The 21-year-old has reportedly moved back to his NSW South Coast home and told the Bay Post/Moruya Examiner he had no knowledge of the letter. Radioinfo reports the email was sent by 'Jason Blackford', who delivered the news of Mr Broadbelt's supposed death. 'I have to inform everyone of the sad news that Dene Broadbelt died unexpectedly on Saturday night when he took his own life,' the email reads, shared by radioinfo. 'There is to be a memorial service held ASAP (date and time will be announced as soon as possible). We would ask that Dene's final wishes are observed, and there are to be no flowers, donations to World Vision would be welcomed instead.' A contact number was provided for Mr Broadbelt's mother, Suzanne, for those who needed further details about his funeral service. Mr Broadbelt has denied being a conman and further rejected claims that he faked his own death . Last year it was reported by Fairfax Media that Mr Broadbelt had incurred debts of more than $120,000 over an 18-month period from a number of scams. At the time, he said he was filming a Channel Seven charity outback walk for cancer and also claimed to be working as a promoter for a national music festival as well as posing to be a DJ talent agency chief. However Mr Broadbelt has denied being a conman and further rejected claims that he faked his own death. 'I am not dead,' he told the Bay Post/Moruya Examiner on Wednesday. 'I made a mistake when I was younger... I racked up a few debts, it came to $250,000. 'There was no option other to declare myself bankrupt.' He further stated that he was not responsible for writing the letter and says he has failed to contact Jason Blackford - a work experience student he had met while working at a radio station in Dubbo, north-west of Sydney. There had also been claims that Mr Broadbelt had recently tried to establish a real estate agency in Victoria, without a licence, which was also dismissed by the 21-year-old. He further told the Bay Post/Moruya Examiner he had changed his name to 'Harrison O'Connor' after receiving a number of death threats.

"A transgender man has won £1,500 in compensation from a nightclub after he was thrown out of the men's toilets and ordered to use the disabled facilities instead. Kay Browning used to be a woman but is now a man, and was kicked out of the male toilets while out celebrating a friend's birthday at Remedies nightclub in Tiverton, Devon. The 24-year-old left the nightclub shocked and embarrassed, and said he feels he is 'constantly judged' because he is transgender. Kay Browning has been awarded £1,500 in compensation from Remedies bar in Tiverton after the transgender 24-year-old was thrown out of the men's toilets and ordered to use the disabled facilities instead . Shortly after the incident last year he began pursuing legal action and has now reached an out-of-court settlement of £1,500 with the venue - and the agreement that he can use the male toilets any time he pleases. It's offensive on many levels,' he said. 'It ruined my night so I left without saying goodbye to my friends. 'I am constantly judged because I am transgender. Enough is enough. I hope I've made a stand for transculture. 'I would have been much happier if this sort of thing didn't happen in the first place but I'm relieved it's all been settled professionally.' At the time of the incident he said: 'I was so embarrassed. I don't know if another punter had said something, but I was in the toilets and a bouncer asked me to leave and use the disabled one instead. He made me feel like a freak. The 24-year-old said he feels he is constantly judged because he is transgender and was left embarrassed . Mr Browning (left) said he only got the confidence to go through sex change treatment after he was born a girl (right) with the support of his younger sister, Kelly, after he was bullied at school . 'If someone genuinely identifies as a man, people need to treat them like a man. That's just a matter of respect. 'We are the only minority still striving for equality and there are a lot of haters out there.People still make insulting comments and say I'm 'scared to be a girl'. 'That's just ignorant.' Mr Browning has starred in documentaries, been on the Jeremy Kyle show, and has started hosting events to raise awareness of lesbian, gay and transgender issues. Kay Browning has spoken about the problems he encountered in school as a transgender man . He has previously spoken about his struggle with being transgender and revealed he was picked on for wearing boyish baggy clothes, tying his hair back and refusing to wear any make-up. It led to him being labelled a lesbian by classmates, which confused and unsure, the teenager assumed must be true. But at the age of 14 Mr Browning spoke to a teacher and realised he was transgender and began dressing as a male, and shaved his hair. The 24-year-old said last year that he had finally got the confidence to go through with gender reassignment surgery following the support of his younger sister Kelly. He said he would like to 'shake hands' with the owners of Remedies and start again. He added: 'It's in my nature to forgive - they didn't understand me but I want to be the bigger person and I want them to move with the times. 'It's not the easiest place to be transgender, but I have made massive changes. 'I had a letter from a boy who said when he told his dad he was a transsexual he wouldn't speak to him - but after watching me on Jeremy Kyle he changed his mind.' Alec Carter, director of Greendale Leisure Ltd, said: 'Remedies Tiverton is operated by a great team and with the training they have received and listening to our customers they are better place then ever to provide a safe enjoyable venue for all. 'I am pleased that past matters have been resolved and I wish Kay every success and happiness in the future.'","Kay Browning was born a woman but realised he was transgender .

"A man accused of murdering a string of women and dumping their bodies may have killed up to 180 people - escaping detection because the police force turned a blind eye to his crimes because his victims were mainly drug addicts and prostitutes, a documentary claims. Lonnie Franklin Jr - dubbed the Grim Sleeper because he allegedly had a break between committing multiple murders - is due to go on trial later this year accused of sexually assaulting, murdering and then dumping the bodies of 10 women across Los Angeles over two decades. But a new documentary by British filmmaker Nick Broomfield suggests Franklin was able to go on killing for so long, and possibly target dozens more victims, because of a police 'blindness' to his victims - which he likes to a 'genocide happening and nobody was talking about it.' Mr Broomfield claims had the police properly investigated the murders and disappearances of mostly black, female prostitutes and drug addicts lives could have been saved. He said: 'People didn't know someone was hunting for them.' Scroll down for video . Lonnie Franklin Jr, dubbed the Grim Sleeper, may have murdered up to 180 people as police in LA turned a blind eye because his victims were usually black and with drug problems, a documentary has claimed . Franklin, who worked as a bin man, will go on trial in June for the murders of 10 women, dating back to 1985. Bodies of the women were found dumped in alleyways wrapped in carpets or stuffed into rubbish bins. However a police search of his home found pictures and videos of 180 women who could all be possible victims. It is feared some may have been dumped in landfill because of Franklin's job as a bin man. Mr Broomfield said during the time when the crimes were committed, little attention was paid to the disappearance of around 200 women by the police or the media. 'I thought it was just incredible in the middle of LA which is one of the wealthiest cities in the world, within 15 minutes of the Hollywood sign over 200 women had disappeared in a 25 year period,' he said. He told  the Sun: 'It was almost like a genocide happening and nobody was talking about it.' In his documentary Tales of the Grim Sleeper, Mr Broomfield claimed police didn't warn people there was a killer lurking in the neighbourhood or do anything to alert people living in nearby Hollywood because the victims were often seen as more of a 'nuisance.' He said Franklin, a father-of-two, was able to go on killing so long because he targeted vulnerable black women, many of whom had become crack and cocaine addicts in the 1980s. The suspected victims of the Grim Sleeper: Enietra Washington (left) survived an attempted murder and was found in 1988, Alicia Alexander (centre) was found dead in an alley in September 1988, Henrietta Wright (right) died in August 1986 in an alleyway . Valerie McCorvey (left) was found dead in 2003, Lachrica Jefferson (centre) in January 1988 and Bernita Sparks (right) was found dead and dumped in an alleyway in April 1987 . Mary Lowe (left) was found in November 1987 - just a few months before Barbara Ware (right) was found . Princess Berthomieux (left) was discovered in an alley in March 2002, and Debra Jackson (right) in 1995 . Mr Broomfield added: 'They were just seen as disposable people. 'The police had this term, NHI, which meant no human involved, which they used to call in murders of prostitutes by gang members. They didn’t take it seriously, they didn’t seek evidence. They would often not even use the proper name of the prostitute, just call it in as a “Jane Doe.” 'They just didn't take it seriously. Most of the women were prostitutes and drug addicts and I don't think it helped that the people were black.' Mr Broomfield said it could not have been an 'accident' that 200 people disappeared or were murdered in the same small area in a 25 year period.  He said had the murders been taking place in somewhere like the wealthy district of Beverley Hills then the area would have been closed down, police presence increased and press coverage of the incident. A search of Franklin's mint green LA home found up to 180 pictures of women, many of whom are missing . Giving one comparison, he said the disappearance of dozens of women was treated very differently from a case in 1988 where a gang had shot students in Westwood - causing the whole city to be shut down. The documentary maker said he thinks some of the murders could have been avoided had police taken the disappearances and killings more seriously. He added: 'I definitely think women's lives could have been saved. 'If police had told the public in 1987 when they knew there was a serial killer who had already killed five victims, if they had told the community then I think things could have been very different and a lot of lives saved. Franklin was arrested in 2010 after DNA evidence was found which appeared to connect the victims . Stills from the documentary show Franklin after he was arrested in July 2010 for the 10 murders . Mr Broomfield, pictured right interviewing a friend of Franklin's, said the documentary took a year and a half . Pam Brooks was interviewed by Broomfield, giving an insight into life in Los Angeles . 'People didn't know someone was hunting for them.' Mr Broomfield said had people been aware there was a danger they would have been more cautious about accepting lifts from people, because some of the victims were not prostitutes or drug addicts but simply those who were waiting for buses late at night. Mr Broomfield, who spoke to relatives and friends of Franklin to produce the documentary, claims when his son Christopher told him officers were almost 'grateful' that the alleged Grim Sleeper had rid the streets of some of the 'problem' people they had been dealing with on an almost daily basis. He added that in the one-and-a-half years it took to make the documentary, Franklin was described as a 'loving father' and almost a Robin Hood figure, who would fix people's cars and get cheap washing machines if they needed them. Earlier this month a mother-of-two, known only by the name 'Mo', revealed she may have been one of Franklin's intended victims as it emerged that her photo was one of the collection found in his home. Nick Broomfield (left) claims in the documentary that alleged killer Franklin (right) continued with his killing spree for so long because police turned a blind eye to his victims, who were largely black drug addicts . 'Mo' claimed she had been forced to pose for a naked picture for Franklin, her then next door neighbour, after the pair went for a drive in his van in 2006. She claimed that Franklin had showed her other pictures of women, some of which were in strange poses who she thought could have been dead, and then asked her to pose naked. She claims she agreed to the picture after she noticed a gun and knife in his van. The photo appeared in a collection of images found by the police when Franklin was arrested in 2010. Mo told ABC7 she believed she could have been killed by Franklin, now 62. The alleged killer earned the nickname the Grim Sleeper after he allegedly committed murders between 1985 and 1988, taking a 13 year break before he is believed to have resumed in crime spree in 2002. Mo said she was stunned when she saw her photo on a documentary about her former neighbor . Franklin, dubbed the Grim Sleeper, is to go on trial for 10 murders and one attempted murder in June . Police arrested Franklin in July 2010 after his DNA was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes. They had linked the crimes, but did not have a suspect until a crime lab computer traced the sample to one of Franklin's family members. Police were able to get samples by using an officer to pose as a busboy at a pizza restaurant, and extract DNA from dishes and cutlery used by Franklin. + . He will go on trial in June, accused of 10 murders and one attempted murder. Mr Broomfield said Franklin had been popular in the area, according to locals. But they claimed he was often obsessed with crack addicts - becoming popular with women in the 1980s during the crack epidemic which swept Los Angeles. Tales of The Grim Sleeper will air in the UK on Sky Atlantic on Monday 30 at 9pm, and will be shown in the US after that date on HBO.","'Grim Sleeper' Lonnie Franklin Jr will go on trial for murdering 10 women .

"Catherine McClennan, from Ainsdale, Southport, took the Trades Union Congress to court, claiming that she was stripped of her responsibilities following the birth of her third child . A TUC manager has won a payout from union bosses after it 'carved up her role and forced her out of her job' while she was away on maternity leave. Catherine McClennan, from Ainsdale, Southport, claims that she was stripped of her responsibilities at the Trades Union Congress (TUC) following the birth of her third child. The mother-of-three began working for the organisation, which fights for workers' rights, in 2006 as a senior manager in the learning and skills section at its Liverpool office. After finding out she was pregnant with her son, Allister, now three, she went on maternity leave in early 2012. But while she was away she claims many of her responsibilities had been given away to colleagues. By the time she returned to work in January 2013, she said it was as if her whole career had been taken away from her. Ms McClennan says her job was later scrapped and she was pitted against two colleagues for another position. She took redundancy in February last year and now has a new job helping to improve NHS maternity services. She argued this was discrimination and an employment tribunal in Liverpool ruled in her favour this month. Ms McClennan, 43, said: 'The TUC needs to start practising what it preaches. 'The TUC should be an exemplar employer but that couldn't be further from the truth in my case.' The TUC, which represents 54 British trade unions and campaigns for better workplace rights, denied it had discriminated against Ms McClennan. But with backing from trade union Unite, Ms McClennan took the TUC to court for maternity discrimination – leading to a five-day hearing at Liverpool Civil and Family Court this month. The mother-of-three began working for the organisation, which fights for workers' rights, in 2006 as a senior manager in the learning and skills section at its Liverpool office. By the time she returned to work in January 2013 from maternity leave, she said it was as if her whole career had been taken away from her . Ms McClennan took the TUC to court for maternity discrimination – leading to a five-day hearing at Liverpool Civil and Family Court this month . The court upheld her case and ordered the organisation to pay an undisclosed amount of compensation. She said: 'When I returned I was marginalised and sidelined. I had to fight for my responsibilities back. 'Before my maternity leave I was on an upward trajectory but when I came back it was as if my whole career had been taken off me. I continued to complain but absolutely nothing was done about it.' Ms McClennan says her job was later scrapped and she was pitted against two colleagues for another position. She took redundancy in February last year and now has a new job helping to improve NHS maternity services. Ms McClennan says her job at the Liverpool offices (pictured) was later scrapped and she was pitted against two colleagues for another position. She took redundancy in February last year and now has a new job helping to improve NHS maternity services . She said: 'I felt I was forced out. Employers should support women who come back from maternity leave but instead I was sidelined and they tried to cover this up. 'Coming back after having a child is hard enough without being subjected to discrimination. What happened is a great shame and was incredibly stressful. 'I have daughters and nieces so I felt this was a case I had to fight for the sake of future generations.' Ms McClennan's solicitor Steve Pinder, head of employment law at Liverpool-based EAD Solicitors, said: 'This case shows women who take maternity leave are still subject to difficult working conditions and still struggle to get their jobs back. 'When Catherine went back to work there was a complete absence of any plan to get her back into the workplace and she spent over a year trying to get her job back.' A TUC spokesman said: 'We vigorously contested this case but the tribunal has made an award for injury to feelings even though there was no malicious or conscious attempt to discriminate.' The TUC recently published a report called The Pregnancy Test: Ending discrimination at work for new mothers, which advised women how to cope with returning to work from maternity leave. It warned that women may face changes on their return, including having been effectively demoted while they were away, and called for an end to discrimination of working mothers. It said: 'Employers must learn lessons from pregnancy and maternity discrimination cases brought against them. 'At the moment, about half of employers fail to implement any changes following a finding of discrimination. 'Therefore, tribunals must have the power to make recommendations that an employer change their practice to protect other women from similar treatment. 'These recommendations must be enforceable against the employer.'","Catherine McClennan was a senior manager at the union in Liverpool .

"A nine-year-old boy found a message in a bottle while exploring a wooded beach of a small lake island on a family vacation - and then realized it was addressed to his grandfather. Nolan Rogers had been on a fishing trip with his family on Lake Murray in South Carolina. His mother, Viki Garrick noticed her childrens' attention waning and stopped at a small island to explore. That's when Nolan came across a screw-top Dr Pepper bottle with a rolled-up letter inside sitting next to a log. Scroll down for video . Nolan Rogers was exploring a remote island in South Carolina's Lake Murray when he spotted the screw-top glass bottle with a letter inside . When Nolan's mother Viki Garrick read the letter, she immediately recognized her friend Diane Bryant's (left) handwriting. The letter was written to Nolan's grandfather, Mike Rogers (right) Nolan imagined it was a 'note from the pirates or something', and showed his parents who read the note first, according to The Slate. Garrick and her husband could only make out a few words on the yellowed paper towel, but were able to make out, 'I wish I could see you... I love you so much... I love you, Diane'. They couldn't read who the letter was addressed to, but noticed the name started with the letter 'M'. Garrick recognized the signature from an old friend of hers and immediately sent a picture of the letter to her friend Diane Bryant, who responded by saying she knew 'exactly where that came from'. In 1970, when Bryant, who's now 58, was about 13 years old, she was on an overnight church gathering on Lake Murray. The letter, found in the bottle pictured, had faded, but Garrick could read, 'I wish I could see you... I love you so much... I love you, Diane . Bryant (left) hoped that Rogers, righty, would find the letter when he was on vacation with his family later in the summer of 1970. He didn't discover the letter for another 45 years . She was missing her then-boyfriend, Mike Rogers, who wasn't allowed on the trip because he had gotten in some kind of trouble at the time. The couple had dated on and off when they were teenagers. 'He had long hair. And my dad did not like him, so therefore, I liked him,' Bryant told The Slate. 'I was his church girlfriend. I knew he had other girlfriends.' She said that as a 13-year-old, she was 'devastated' that Rogers couldn't come on the trip. So she wrote a love note - as the couple often did - and stuffed it in a bottle before tossing it in a lake, hoping Mike would find it later in the summer when he vacationed with his family,according to ABC. 'With my whole heart, I just knew one day he would find it,' Bryant said. 'I've thought about it through the years, thinking, ""I wonder if anyone ever found that bottle?""' Bryant and Rogers remain friends to this day, though they are no longer romantically involved. They both married different people . And 45 years later, Rogers did find it. Nolan led him, now 58, to the spot where he found the bottle, and his grandfather joked that he finally 'got it'. He had a good laugh and told ABC that it was fun to reminisce about the 'good old times'. 'The more you think about it, the more it blows your mind,' Rogers told The Slate. 'There's got to be some more meaning to this.' Bryant agreed, saying she didn't know what 'the hidden message' was. Though the pair remained friends over the years, they decided they 'would have killed each other a long time ago', Bryant said. She and her husband Ron have been married for nearly 40 years. Ron was on the same church trip as Bryant the day she wrote her love letter to Rogers. Rogers is also married with children and grandchildren.","Nolan Rogers found the letter while fishing with his family on Lake Murray in South Carolina .

"A courageous police dog killed in the Tunisian museum hostage siege was given a guard of honour as its body was carried from the scene. Remarkable footage has emerged showing mass crowds clapping the heroic hound as its bloodied body is wheeled away from the National Bardo museum by special forces.

"A parole board that ruled a cop killer  could walk free has revoked its decision after outcry from the victim's family and prosecutors. Dozens of police officers from around Connecticut lined up outside the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield on Wednesday for a parole board hearing for Gary Castonguay. Castonguay, now 71, is serving 25 years to life in prison for fatally shooting 28-year-old Plainville police Officer Robert Holcomb in the chest while fleeing from a burglary in 1977. He has now been locked up for more than 37 years. In January, parole board members voted to release Castonguay this July - sparking outrage from Holcomb's relatives and prosecutors, who said they had not been told about the meeting. Staying put: Gary Castonguay listens to victim impact statements during a hearing inside MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution on Wednesday, where a parole board rescinded a decision to free him . On Wednesday, another hearing was held at institution where Castonguay is imprisoned. Holcomb's niece Maria Weinberger read a letter from his widow, Nancy Holcomb Searles, who was too distressed to attend. 'Castonguay should remain incarcerated for the remainder of his natural existence,' Searles said in the letter. 'He showed no regard for life, nor any remorse for his crime. Even today, he continues to fabricate the facts of that night in order to suit his needs and somehow excuse his heinous act.' Holcomb's son, Mac Holcomb, also addressed the board and said his sole memory of his father was when he returned home from a night shift and hid a box of doughnuts for his son to find before the family ate them for breakfast, the New Britain Herald reported. 'I loved and admired him the way that a son should toward his father in every way,' he said, adding that Castonguay 'not only took my father's life, but deprived me of growing up knowing my dad'. Facing his father's killer: Mac Holcomb, the son of Officer Robert Holcomb (pictured left) is seen looking at Castonguay as he speaks about his loss. Mac was just three years old when his father was killed . Not happy: Castonsguay reacts after his parole was revoked. A board previously voted to free him in July . A panel of the Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 3-0, without any discussion, to reverse the decision made in January. Asked if he had anything to say at the hearing, Castonguay said: 'I guess not.' The hearing was scheduled after Holcomb's family and prosecutors said they were not aware of the earlier meeting. They also argued that the decision was made with inadequate information about the killer's background, including other violent incidents and threats directed at law enforcement, although officials contend they did have that information. Connecticut prosecutor Brian Preleski had described Castonguay as a domestic terrorist with a history of threatening to kill police. 'He is one of the most dangerous people in prison in Connecticut today and he should never be paroled,' Preleski said before the hearing. Support: Suffield Police Captain Craig Huntley leads a salute directed toward Mac Holcomb outside the correctional center after parole was rescinded to Castonguay on Wednesday . By his side: Members of the Coventry Police Department attend a news conference to show their support to the victim, who had been a police officer for five years when he was shot at close range in 1977 . Force: Members of the Plainville Police Department, of which Holcomb had been a part, also attended . Holcomb had been a Plainville police officer for five years and was married with one son. He was chasing Castonguay following a home burglary when the robber shot him in the shoulder, knocking him over. Castonguay then approached him and shot him three times in the chest at close range, killing him. 'State officials righted a wrong today,' State Senator Henri Martin said after the hearing. 'I commend the people of Plainville and throughout the state for speaking out on behalf of the Holcombs and rallying to support them... 'We must take steps to strengthen the system so that what happened to the Holcombs does not happen to other victims' families in the future. I look forward to leading that effort.'","Gary Castonguay is serving 25 years to life in prison for gunning down Plainville, Connecticut Officer Robert Holcomb during a 1977 burglary .

"A California teenager used a little help from a horse named Romeo when he rode into his high school to ask a girl to the prom. But Miguel Gonzales got a little more than he bargained for when he won the girl - and a two-day suspension. Gonzales, 17, borrowed the horse from a friend's ranch and galloped right on up to Catalina Hernandez's first period class, holding a sign that said 'Will you ride with me to prom?' Miguel Gonzales, 17, got a little help from a horse named Romeo to ask Catalina Hernandez to the prom . The Milpitas High School senior got the idea from the school's Spirit Day theme, which was 'salad dressing day'. He dressed up as a cowboy, boots and all, to represent ranch dressing. Hernandez was dressed in a toga to symbolize Caesar salad. Hernandez and her peers ran out of their classrooms, phones in hand, and she quickly said yes. But the students' principal was hardly excited by the grand gesture. 'I was there for a bit and I knew people would come like security so I tried to leave,' Gonzales told the San Jose Mercury News. The Milpitas High School senior was suspended for his grand gesture, as the school deemed the horse was a 'potential threat' to other students walking in the same path. But Gonzales will still be able to attend the prom . 'But on my way I heard the principal screaming... I kind of knew I was going to get into trouble.' Gonzales said he expected to get detention or Saturday school, but had no idea he could face suspension.

"Neill Buchel was drunkenly murdered by friends after getting him to drunkenly perform humiliating ‘Jackass-style stunts’ - including rubbing chilli into his privates . Two men who murdered a friend after getting him to drunkenly perform humiliating ‘Jackass-style stunts’ - including rubbing chilli into his privates - are facing life behind bars. Neill Buchel, 39, was beaten to death by Elvis Kwiatkowski, 36, and Chas Quye, 36, before his body was hacked into ten pieces and thrown into a lake in Essex. The Old Bailey heard that the South African had willingly taken part in the violent games based on the hit TV series. But the extreme 'pranks' were often filmed by drinking buddies Scott ‘Gary’ Hunt, 42, and Quye, who could be heard laughing hysterically as he set fire to his own pubic hair, ate chillies and was shot at with a BB gun while wearing women’s underwear in clips shown to court. In one clip they sing the Kings of Leon hit Sex on Fire as Mr Buchel rubs a scotch bonnet chilli pepper on his genitals. His remains were discovered in White Hart lakes, in Dagenham, by a young fisherman  on 1 April last year. The court heard that the young man had mistaken Mr Buchel's severed left thigh for a dead fish and had poked the body part with a stick. The rest of his body was recovered more than a fortnight after he had been reported missing by his worried family. Mr Buchel, known as ‘Southy’, moved into a flat with Hunt after splitting up from his wife in December 2013 and the housemates would drink with Quye, who lived in a block of flats next to their building. Their drinking sessions at Quye’s home would involve playing a game they called ‘Jackass-style stunts’, based on the US TV series. Mr Buchel was a willing participant in the stunts, but often bore the brunt of the injuries sustained. Before the clips were played in court, Mr Justice Spencer warned the jury: ‘Steel yourselves for watching something unpleasant, but no more unpleasant than one sees on television in its extreme form these days.’ Mr Buchel's estranged wife Sharon cried as she told the court about an incident on 13 December 2013, just four weeks after her ex-husband had moved in to Hunt’s flat. Mr Buchel was attacked by Hunt and Quye before being hit around the face with dumbbell weights. ‘He looked terrible’, Mrs Buchel said. ‘He looked like somebody from Star Wars. His head was swollen like a watermelon...his eyeballs were bleeding. Mr Buchel, 39, was beaten to death by Elvis Kwiatkowski (left), 36, and Chas Quye, 36, (right) before his body was cut into ten pieces and thrown into a lake in Essex . Buchel (pictured) had been drinking in a park before ending up, extremely drunk, at Quye’s flat, where he became a 'soft target' for the men . ‘He had no eyebrows. His eyelashes had been singed. Some of his goatee was missing, it had been burnt off. ‘He had a sheet wrapped around him, which was covered in blood. ‘He just looked at me. I started crying... I dropped to my knees. I said ""What have they done to you?"" ‘He was trying to talk but some blood was coming from his mouth.’ Mr Buchel was not seen alive after the night of 13 March last year - exactly three months after the incident his wife described. He had been drinking in a park before ending up, extremely drunk, at Quye’s flat, where a number of others were present throughout the evening, including Quye, Hunt, Kwiatkowski and Quinn. ‘Neill Buchel was rendered virtually helpless by drink and was a very soft target for the brutal and cowardly attack at the hands of those who professed to be his friends,’ said prosecutor Sally O’Neill QC. Gary Hunt (left) was cleared of Buchel’s murder, but convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by hiding the body.  Bradley Andison, 47, admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice . One witness described seeing Mr Buchel on his knees in the sitting room, with his head completely covered by material. Quye and Kwiatowski were seen standing over him shouting abuse with Quye wielding a large rubber mallet. Andison was later called to the flat, where by this time Mr Buchel’s lifeless body was in the bathroom, to help them dispose of the body by taking it away in a van. Worried Mrs Buchel contacted police and a murder investigation was launched even before his left thigh turned up in the lake. Alan Quinn, 28, was convicted of perverting the course of justice . Ms O’Neill said: ‘On 1 April 2014 a young fisherman who was walking around the lakes detected something he first thought was a dead fish. ‘It turned out to be a human thigh. The police were informed and the area was searched by police divers and using police dogs. ‘Over the next few days several other body parts were found in the same area - ten body parts. ‘The torso had been wrapped in a duvet and weighed down with stones. ‘Other body parts appeared to have been wrapped in red curtain, which had come loose. ‘They had clearly been in the water for some time, but all of the body was recovered, ten parts in all.’ The body parts were found to have multiple blunt force injuries most likely resulting from kicking or stamping. Quye and Kwiatkowski denied murder, but were found guilty by a jury after more than 30 hours of deliberation. Hunt was cleared of Buchel’s murder, but convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by hiding the body. Alan Quinn, 28, was convicted of perverting the course of justice while Colin Bushaway, 61, was cleared of the charge and an alternative of preventing a lawful burial. Bradley Andison, 47, admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice. The four defendants will be sentenced on 15 April.","Neill Buchel was beaten to death by Elvis Kwiatkowski and Chas Quye .

"Marine biologist Forrest Galante has swam with some of the most fearsome creatures in the sea, including the terrifying hammerhead. But now he has hitched a ride on the whale shark, which can grow to more than 44ft long. However, despite its massive size, the whale shark is a filter feeder, devouring tonnes of plankton as it swims though warm parts of the ocean. Despite the mammoth size of the whale shark, Galante said he had no fears about diving with the creatures, which can live to between 70 and 100 years old in the wild.

"Two underground craters measuring 400km together in size have been discovered in central Australia, sparking the possibility of a previously unknown asteroid impact event 300 million years ago that caused many species to go extinct. The impact zone was found in the Warburton Basin in two parts, each 200km wide, indicating the meteor that created them split into two before smashing into the earth. Even though it was found two kilometres underground, the impact zone is now the largest in the world, by over 100km. Dr Andrew Glikson from ANU indicates that the size of the asteroid means it could have impacted a mass extinction . The precise age of the crater is not yet known exactly, but researchers think it may be around 300 million years. ‘We cannot define this impact zone in anywhere near the degree of detail we can define the ones exposed on the surface,' Lead Researcher Dr Andrew Glikson of the Australian National University told Daily Mail Australia. Researchers strongly believe the meteor could have caused the end of many life species on the planet at the time, including the dinosaurs. 'From the size - yes, it could have impacted a mass extinction,' Dr Glikson said. 'Even though we do not know the exact age of the meteor yet, we do know life was very primitive at that time.' The impact zone extends through the Earth's crust which is around 30km thick in Central Australia. The two adjoining craters were thought to have been caused when a meteor split on its approach to Earth, forming two smaller ones each about 10km across. This impact zone, if confirmed, would be the largest in the world. The second largest is the Vredefort crater in South Australia, spanning 300km. This zone survives on the surface of Earth and therefore is easier to find than those underground. The impact zone was flagged after rock affected by heat and pressure was turned into glass . The impact zone was flagged after rock affected by heat and pressure, consequently being turned into glass was discovered, also known as shock metamorphism. The features of this metamorphism show that material was dramatically thrown out of the area in a span of more than 200km, indicating the possibility of a mass extinction. After using geothermal research to look at the internal heat of the earth and seismic data to see the vibrations of the earth's surface, the team of geophysicists released high velocity shocks two kilometres underground by drilling. The impact zone was found in the Warburton basin in Central Australia and spans 400 kilometres . Scientists have been using information from a major 2010 discovery that showed a large meteorite strike 66 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs. A plume of ash was sent up into the air from the impact and sediment from this collision is found in rocks around the world today. However, none of this sediment has been discovered in 300 million-year-old samples indicating that this site could be older. Further studies of the geochemistry and composition of the impact site are in progress.","Two meteros each 10km across left a 400km impact zone in Australia .

"Fearing a possible repeat of the 2011 riot and an attack on staff from detainees, security teams from the Department of Immigration and Australian Customs swooped on Villawood Detention Centre, with teams of sniffer dogs, uncovering a cache of potential weapons, drugs, syringes and smart phones. Daily Mail Australia has been provided with first look at the items found during the operation, which sources say was sparked by concerns from security teams inside the facility, who'd recently witnessed suspicious activity within the grounds and feared an attack against guards was imminent. Department officials suggest the swoop was 'a routine search' but the raids on Monday uncovered several bags full of contraband from inside the facility, teams tipped off by security personnel which units to search. In one unit complex alone, there were four phones, concealed shears and half a dozen syringes. A joint operation by Customs and Immigration squads has headed off a feared attack from inside the walls of Villawood Detention Centre . The raids uncovered sharp utensils, wrapped up and hidden inside laundry powder tubs as well as more than a dozen mobile phones. These are contraband items found inside one of the unit complexes . Behind the barbed wire fences at Villawood Detention Centre, security officials had recently become concerned by suspicious activities by some detainees . There hasn't been a major disturbance inside the centre for almost four years, when several asylum seekers sparked a full-scale riot and the complex was set alight. More than 500 people are housed inside Villawood at any given time. During the search, officers found garden shears wrapped up and concealed inside laundry powder tubs. Seized items also included drugs and drug paraphernalia, such as pipes and syringes. Officials also uncovered up to a dozen smart phones, which are prohibited and are still investigating how they were smuggled in. Deputy Secretary, Immigration Status Resolution Group, Cindy Briscoe said the Department is determined to stamp out the presence of illegal items inside detention centres. 'The Australian community has an expectation that we continue to maintain the safety and security of our detention centres,' Ms Brisco said. 'This safety extends to detainees, staff and visitors to the centre.' Sniffer dogs teams are taken through a kitchen inside the Villawood Detention Centre searching for hidden weapons and drugs . It's alleged detainees hid the contraband inside chocolate milk tubs and even what was supposed to be deodorant spray cans. Investigators found shears, syringes, phones and drugs . More than 500 people are locked inside Villawood Detention Centre at any given time . 'We have a zero tolerance approach to criminal behaviour or the possession of contraband.' Officials said the operation highlighted the clear benefits of working as one organisation as they moved toward full integration of Immigration and Customs on July 1. 'I commend the Department and the Service for working together in such a well-organised and collegiate way on this search. It highlights the success we can achieve as one organisation,' Ms Briscoe said. 'As well as searches conducted by our officers, we also employed the use of detector dogs to detect and locate prohibited items, which proved a highly effective tool for this environment.' As yet, there is no word as to action to be taken against the perpetrators. The last major security scare at Villawood was in 2011 when five asylum seekers sparked a riot inside the facility, setting it alight. Two people were arrested last year during a protest outside the walls, over the proposed transfer of detainees to WA.","Shears, drugs and smart phones were uncovered during raids .

"Adam Osborne had his licence suspended by the General Medical Council after being accused of having a two-year sexual affair with a highly vulnerable woman . George Osborne’s psychiatrist brother is battling to save his career after it was revealed that he has been suspended as a doctor following serious allegations of misconduct. Adam Osborne, 38, who has a private practice in Central London, last week had his licence suspended by the General Medical Council (GMC) after being accused of having a two-year sexual affair with a highly vulnerable woman patient who has psychiatric issues, is married and has two children. The news comes five years after he was suspended by the GMC for ‘dishonest and misleading’ behaviour in prescribing drugs to his cocaine-addicted prostitute lover. The latest blow means he cannot practise in any capacity as a doctor until an investigation into the new allegations has been concluded. The suspension will prove highly embarrassing for the Chancellor, coming as he prepares for Wednesday’s crucial Budget, the last before May’s General Election. If the investigation results in a Fitness To Practise hearing, which is held in public, Dr Osborne could face further sensitive personal information being revealed. And if the allegations are upheld, he could be struck off. A GMC spokesman said that the interim suspension was not an indication of guilt. In the wake of the hearing, Dr Osborne’s personal website was taken down. His Linkedin page states that he has a special interest in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, depression and anxiety. Dr Osborne currently runs Devonport Psychiatry, which is based in Marylebone, Central London, but is officially registered to his home address in Shepherd’s Bush, West London, which he shares with his wife Rahala Noor, a plastic surgeon. On Friday, blinds were drawn at the £1.5 million terraced house, and although Dr Osborne was seen going in, he refused to answer the door. His Mercedes – with personalised number plates – was parked outside. Dr Osborne is the youngest brother of the Chancellor and one of four sons born to Sir Peter Osborne – who co-founded the wallpaper company Osborne & Little – and artist’s daughter Felicity Loxton-Peacock. Dr Osborne’s medical career has been beset by controversy since he finished his medical course at Manchester University in 2003. Family fun: Adam Osborne next to a long-haired George and brothers Benedict and Theo, with their parents in the early 1990s . His suspension in 2010 stemmed from a series of allegations surrounding his use of prescription drugs, which centred on allegations of a relationship with a prostitute. The GMC said that his ‘relationship’ with the woman had ‘clouded his judgment’ and led him to prescribe powerful anti-psychotic drugs, dishonestly use a false name and fail to inform her GP. Dr Osborne was also disciplined for prescribing contraceptive pills to his then girlfriend, Rahala, a strict Muslim who would become his wife, and an anti-smoking drug to an unnamed family member. The GMC hearing was told that Dr Osborne had been in a relationship with the prostitute, referred to as Miss B, from 2007 to 2008 while he was separated from his girlfriend and he was a trainee psychiatrist in Manchester. The suspension will prove highly embarrassing for the Chancellor, coming as he prepares for Wednesday’s crucial Budget, the last before May’s General Election . Dr Osborne admitted prescribing the drugs to his girlfriend, to a family member, and Quetiapine, Haloperidol and Lorazepam to Miss B. But he denied his conduct was dishonest, misleading or impaired his fitness to practice. Adam Osborne married Bangladeshi-born Noor in an elaborate Muslim ceremony in 2009 only after he had converted to Islam and changed his first name to Mohammed. The pair met as undergraduates at St Andrews University, Fife, before going on to study medicine together at Manchester University. Once qualified, he became a junior doctor at the city’s Wythenshawe Hospital. He was forced to resign following the allegations that he was handing out falsified prescriptions. Dr Osborne declined to comment.","Dr Adam Osborne's licence was suspended by the General Medical Council .

"A schoolgirl has spoken of her 14-hour police cell ordeal after being accused of a bomb hoax that was allegedly made by a teaching assistant. Holly Littlefield says she was called 'Holly Bin Laden' when she returned to school two days after the lengthy questioning by police officers who suspected she had emailed in a bomb hoax. Zoe Gregory, a teaching assistant at Holly's school, has now been suspended amid claims she sent the threatening message to a teacher using Holly's email account. Holly Littlefield (left), 16, spent 14 hours in a police cell after she was accused of sending a bomb hoax to her school - but now teaching assistant Zoe Gregory (right) has been arrested . Holly, 16, said staff at Ormiston Victory Academy, in Norwich, phoned her mother to tell her that staff would be picking her up and taking her to school after an email was sent to a member of staff. Speaking of the moment she was met at the gates by two police officers, the traumatised pupil said: 'All they would tell me was that an email had been sent but they couldn't say any more. I assumed maybe a teacher had been called a name or something. 'When I got there the police asked me if I knew why they were here. I said no but that's when they told me a bomb hoax had been sent. 'They said they needed to take me to the station and that I should be in and out within two hours.' Holly was taken down to the station, where she spent most of the day locked up in the cells - and her mother Lesley, 43, did not know she had been arrested until five hours later. By then officers had a warrant to search her home and had seized Holly's computer and mobile phone. The schoolgirl said: 'I was horrible and I just kept crying. I thought I would be in there for half an hour and then interviewed. 'They had to move me to a different cell because there was a woman who was banging and screaming. Holly was picked up from Ormiston Victory Academy, Norwich, by police officers after the email was sent from her account . 'It was terrifiying. I just wanted to go to sleep but I couldn't. They gave me food but I just felt a bit sick. 'I have never been taken to a police station before and I've never even been in trouble before. 'It felt like I was being treated like a criminal. When they moved me from the cell one of the officers asked me if I regretted what I had done. 'I was close to saying I had done it just so they could let me go.' Holly claims she was in the cells for 12 hours before being made to give DNA, fingerprints and a mugshot before her police interview. She was interrogated for 45 minutes before being released from custody on bail 14 hours after her arrest. Holly says she was called 'Holly Bin Laden' when she returned to school two days after the lengthy questioning by officers . The teenager stayed off school for the next two days but when she returned she said she was bullied by classmates. Holly said: 'When I went back to school I had children running up to me saying ""have you got a bomb"" and others were calling me ""terrorist"" and ""Holly Bin Laden"".' Nearly three weeks after spending the day in the cells she was contacted by officers at Norfolk Police to say there would be no further action against her. Holly's mother Lesley said: 'When I first received the call in the morning she [Holly] looked completely bewildered. 'I know when my children are lying and I could tell she didn't have a clue what was going on. 'They let me speak to her at 3pm when they had finished searching the house and she was just sobbing. 'It was absolutely heart-breaking. When she came back she was still in quite a state. She has had nightmares about all this. 'People were saying to her sister at school that she had been arrested for drug dealing and that she had been arrested for assaulting someone. 'Now we are at the stage where we are having to write a letter to get all her details removed off the police database. Its awful.' The mother-of-two also claimed that the school had contacted her to say Mrs Gregory had resigned. A spokesman for Victory Academy said: 'The safety and well-being of students is always our number one priority. 'When the threat was made we contacted the police and followed their advice to the letter. Since then we have been co-operating fully with their investigations into this matter. 'As soon as the member of staff in question was arrested we suspended them, ahead of a full disciplinary process. 'We have been liaising closely with the families of the children originally involved and we're doing everything we can to support them. 'Whilst we are relieved that the threat was a hoax, we will not tolerate any action which disrupts the education of children at our school.'

"A BRIEF GUIDE TO THE SOUND OF MUSIC . by Paul Simpson . (Robinson £9.99) For years I’d thought it was Vera Lynn’s We’ll Meet Again they planned to broadcast when the atomic bombs fell, but according to Paul Simpson, in this essential guide to the iconic film, when a nuclear strike is imminent, the BBC intends filling the airwaves with songs from The Sound Of Music. Cynical sorts will argue that having to listen to Do-Re-Mi and My Favourite Things will only make them incredibly impatient for oblivion. Nevertheless the remaining powers-that-be sincerely hope to ‘maintain some semblance of normality’ by exposing us to the ever-optimistic Von Trapps. It has always been easy to sneer at ‘three hours of nuns yodelling’, and Christopher Plummer himself dubbed the picture The Sound Of Mucus. But I for one love it, perhaps because 50 years back my grandmother took me to see it six times at the Capitol Cinema in Cardiff. The Sound of Music could have been very different if the Osmonds had claimed a place in the film . I always hid under the seat when the Nazis prowled around the convent, and to this day I haven’t seen the bit where the nuns sabotage the cars. It was a film that appealed to women who had domineering husbands — all those glowering Captain Von Trapp sorts who expected their dinner to be on the table. My grandmother, and millions like her, would love to have been Julie Andrews, cutting up the curtains to make clothes, falling in lakes for fun, rebelliously cycling around the countryside, picnicking and generally being heedless of chores and domestic obligations. In its unlikely and unstrident way, The Sound Of Music was a pioneering feminist rallying cry, and ordinary women, who’d have had no earthly inkling what Germaine Greer was rabbiting on about, embraced it and identified with it. The first surprise in Simpson’s book is that the story begins in England. The Von Trapps were descended from Robert Whitehead, an engineer born in Bolton in 1823. He went abroad to work for a Milanese company and in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he built ‘the first cylindrical marine boiler’ and helped design armour-plated frigates for Kaiser Franz-Josef’s navy. Whitehead’s granddaughter, Agatha, met Captain Georg Von Trapp when he was visiting the factory looking at torpedoes. Julie Andrews (centre) is pictured in 1965 on the set of The Sound of Music with her on-screen step-children . They were married in 1911 and had seven children. Agatha died of scarlet fever in 1922, and Georg moved as a widower to Salzburg. A 21-year-old nun came to help out with the family — Maria Augusta Kutschera. She’d entered the convent, Nonnberg Abbey, to escape abusive uncles and cousins. Exactly as in the film, she was a tomboyish postulant, always having to be rebuked for sliding down banisters, climbing on the roof, jumping over chimneys, and grabbing the other nuns to tickle their ribs. Georg was entranced, and he married his new nanny in 1927. But how much of a mutual love-match was it? Maria ‘suggested to Georg that he go on the honeymoon without her’. At least they could make music. Like Plummer, Georg peeped on a bosun’s whistle to call the children to order, and he accompanied them on a guitar when they had a singing session. By the way, Ronald Reagan sincerely believed that Edelweiss was the official national anthem of Austria. After they’d sung a selection of medieval church music at the Salzburg Festival in 1936, the Von Trapps were invited abroad on tours. They sang before Queen Mary in London and entertained the Pope at the Vatican. It is here that the movie differs from reality. In real life the family left by train for a series of engagements, crossing the Channel and taking a ship from Southampton for New York, arriving in America in October 1938. Though Georg had been reprimanded by the Gestapo for failing to fly the Nazi flag after the Anschluss, there was no actual immediate danger. The five eldest Osmonds (pictured in 1972) are said to have begged to be able to play the Von Trapp children in the famous film . According to Hollywood, however, the Von Trapps crept from the concert hall, hid behind the Nonnberg tombs, and climbed every mountain to freedom carrying heavy instrument cases. In fact, had Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer and the children kept going on the route they’d chosen, they’d have soon arrived on the terrace in Hitler’s Berchtesgaden.That part of Austria borders Bavaria, not Switzerland. And may I also state for the record that there is no such dish as ‘Schnitzel and Noodles’. The closest you’d find is ‘Gulasch mit Nockerln’. The original Maria Von Trapp was diddled by agents and managers, who persuaded her to sell them the global rights to her story in perpetuity for a paltry flat fee of $10,000, so neither she nor the family made a further penny cent from any of the adaptations. Twentieth Century Fox didn’t even invite Maria to the premiere, in case she ‘eclipsed’ Julie Andrews. I was shocked to discover that many major talents had shunned the chance to put the proven hit on the big screen. Neither Gene Kelly nor Billy Wilder would touch it, as ‘no musical with swastikas in it can be a success’. Rex Harrison, Bing Crosby and Yul Brynner turned down the role of Captain Von Trapp, believing the man to be ‘very much a cardboard figure, humourless and one-dimensional’. Audrey Hepburn, Doris Day and Anne Bancroft didn’t fancy donning a wimple. Audrey Hepburn (left) is said to have turned down the role of Maria, while Bing Crosby (right) rejected the part of Captain Von Trapp, believing it to be 'a cardboard figure' Noel Coward rejected the part of Max, the impresario — a shame. He’d have been brilliant. By contrast, the five eldest Osmonds begged to play the Von Trapp children. They were rejected, thank God, though Marie Osmond was to strum a guitar and play Maria on stage in the Seventies. Of those Aryan-looking youngsters who were finally cast, after their 11 weeks on location in Salzburg and the glorious Salzkammergut in 1964, none was to go on to great things. In late middle age by now, they are variously software designers, flower arrangers, nurses or interior decorators. Regarding the authentic Von Trapps, incidentally, they stopped singing professionally in 1956 and settled in Vermont, where they ran a hotel that burned down in 1980. Maria died in 1987, Georg having long predeceased her, in 1947. Life was never as rosy as in the film: one of the children had electroconvulsive shock treatment for depression, another married a Canadian, and others became dairy farmers. To date there have been 116 cast albums from the innumerable stage productions of The Sound of Music. (The Connie Fisher version lasted from 2006 until 2011.) Sing-a-Long parties are wildly popular, with the audience in costume — I’d go myself but in a nun outfit I do keep being mistaken for Pam Ferris as Sister Angelina. Julie Andrews (left) and Christopher Plummer (right) won the two top roles in the famous film, playing Maria and Captain Von Trapp respectively . The Julie Andrews film is the third highest grossing movie in history, behind Gone With The Wind and Star Wars. (Pre-tax profits of $20 million by 1966 saved Fox from the near-bankruptcy it faced after the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton Cleopatra.) DVD and Blu-ray sales remain buoyant, with an ever-burgeoning number of special features and documentaries. The only place where it has never caught on, ironically, is Austria, where Captain Von Trapp is considered a deserter, which he was if you think about it. The Von Trapp villa became Himmler’s headquarters during the war. The film was also heavily edited in France, where it was felt that nuns shouldn’t be seen singing non-religious songs. For the rest of us, it is more than a movie. The Sound of Music is intimately bound up with childhood memories and emotions, in my case going to Cardiff for all those mid-week matinees, escaping the South Wales coal dust for the pristine Austrian panoramas. Indeed, years later I bought a flat near Salzburg. I’ve done my best to live where the hills are alive — though in actuality they are not these days alive with Rodgers & Hammerstein. What you hear are oompah-bands and men in lederhosen slapping their thighs and playing Wagner by blowing down the tube of a milking machine. Once seen, never forgotten. Especially by the cows. By the way, do get the latest incarnation of the DVD, as it includes an all-new documentary: Julie Andrews Returns To Salzburg. You see, she wasn’t able to leave the film behind either.","The Von Trapps were descended from an engineer from Bolton .

"A dreamlike treehouse in Cornwall that was originally built for children has been transformed into a popular miniature hotel fetching £100 per night. Builder and artist Jonathan Melville-Smith created the treehouse in a sturdy ash tree a few years back, first as a basic platform before it became a comfy cabin, but says his children were unimpressed. Visitors from all around the world on the other hand are besotted by the quirky rental's charms, which include stunning water views of Falmouth Bay and the rustling of leaves at night. Tree Sparrow treehouse in Cornwall fetches £100 per night for its comfortable accommodation 10ft from the ground . The window from the mezzanine double bed looks over Cornwall's beautiful Falmouth Bay . Builder and artist Jonathan Melville-Smith created the treehouse in a sturdy ash tree, extending on a basic platform . 'At first it started out for the kids, but they weren't too interested,' Melville-Smith said. 'After building the platform, I didn't do too much more to it for a couple of years. 'We have some gypsy wagons on site that our friends stayed in and we'd started renting them out. 'Once I had enough money, I put a shed in the tree and made it a bit more homely. It's proved really popular - maybe because it's so quirky and different.' Along with Tree Sparrow treehouse, Melville-Smith also rents out two gypsy cabins named Rosie and Elle for £75 per night (less for longer-term stays) through Outlandish Holidays. He also hosts stays in a beautifully appointed tipi (£65 per night) and last year's Shed of the Year finalist Jack Sparrow House, a room with a mezzanine double bed and a sit-in kitchen area (£100 per night). A sturdy ladder leads up to the bed from the deceptively spacious sit-in kitchen area in the treehouse . A second look is required to spot Tree Sparrow, nestled among the leaves of this old Ash tree . Melville-Smith says once he made the treehouse homely it's proven immensely popular, 'maybe because it's so quirky and different' A cursory glance may not even spot the Tree Sparrow Treehouse, the name under which it's listed on outlandishholidays.co.uk, but its size is deceiving. And far from a cold box in a tree it is fully insulated with double-glazed windows, has heating for when the nights get a bit chilly and is accessible via a wooden staircase. Built to blend in with its environment, with green roof and dark wooden walls, the treehouse on Melville-Smith's farm in Helston, Cornwall, also enjoys spectacular sunsets over the orchards of Tregaminion. The building itself, 'a shed' on a platform as its creator describes it, is kitted out with a bunk bed, mini stove and fairy lights all 10ft off the ground. A gas stove plus pots and pans are included in the nightly price for the treehouse, which also has a bed that could be used by kids . The treehouse is fully insulated with double-glazed windows and has heating for when the nights get a bit chilly . Melville-Smith works in the sunshine on the treehouse, the first one of which he made when he was just 10 years old . Its views take in the beautiful Lizard Peninsula and costs £100 per night for a couple, and £10 extra per child. Jonathan, who spent his childhood on a farm in Worcestershire, said he built his first treehouse by aged 10. 'From a young age, I grew up around building work so I was constantly getting involved - probably too much,' he said. 'I'd always dreamed of building a house where everything - inside and out - was built with my own hands. In the end, it turned out to be this treehouse.'","Builder and artist Jonathan Melville-Smith created the Tree Sparrow treehouse on his farm in Cornwall .

"Just as I can't travel to Liverpool without thinking of The Beatles, so I can't travel to Los Angeles without thinking of The Beach Boys. Their songs of beaches, baggies, boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun-kissed paradise, and their voices sounded as bright and as laid-back as California itself. This time I was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band. I started in Hawthorne where the three Wilson brothers - Brian, Carl and Dennis - were raised, and joined up with guitarist Al Jardine and vocalist Mike Love to form a group. The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers but that didn't stop them tapping into the sun, sea and sand culture of the Golden State . The Wilson family home on 119th Street, where the boys taped their first single Surfin' in 1961, was demolished to make way for Interstate 105. The rest of the street remains though, its neat lawns, porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group's clean-cut All-American origins. A redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the Wilson house, with a bas-relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here 'broadcast to the world an image of LA as a place of sun, surf and romance'. Hawthorne is indeed a place of sun (263 days a year) but no surf and little romance. It's a charmless city that expanded on the back of the post-war aviation industry (Los Angeles International is only five miles away). I could see why the teenagers of the 1950s would get 'bugged' driving 'up and down the same old strip'. Hawthorne Boulevard, with its low-rise jewellery shops and furniture stores, is no place for the young. The Pizza Show (13344 Hawthorne) added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling Beach Boys. Now run by the son of the original owner, it retains its kitsch medieval Italian interior, with wrought iron chandeliers, tiled awnings and mock grilled windows. Surfin' safari: The town of Huntington Beach, where the surf is year round, is known as Surf City USA . Foster's Freeze (11969 Hawthorne), another gathering place, is a blue-roofed fast-food outlet that offers FOOD from one service hatch and ICE CREAM from another. When I arrived Louie Louie, a 1963 hit by The Kingsmen, was playing over speakers in the overhang. This was the very 'hamburger stand' where Brian Wilson saw a girl pull up in her father's Thunderbird and had the inspiration for Fun Fun Fun. Hawthorne High School, around the corner on El Segundo Boulevard, is where the Wilson boys and Jardine attended. The Beach Boys came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song Be True to Your School. The nearest surfing beach to Hawthorne is Manhattan, but the best is Huntington Beach, better known as Surf City USA. Here the sand is soft, the surf is year-round, and the broad beaches stretch for more than eight miles. The broad beaches of Huntington stretch for more than eight miles . Other than Dennis Wilson, The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers, but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning oceanside culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it. They mentioned Huntington Beach in Surfin' Safari. The city of Huntington Beach makes much of its surfers. There's a Walk of Fame, a Hall of Fame and a small International Surfing Museum. The sports shops sell everything from boards and wetsuits to sunglasses, caps and jeans. My hotel, the Waterfront Beach Resort had a surfboard in the foyer and doorknob signs that read Wiped Out rather than Do Not Disturb. Huntington Beach is better known as Surf City USA - where the fantastic surf is year-round . It was cold and overcast on my first morning but by 8.30am there were already more than 100 surfer bobbing about in the ocean. From the the pierI could watch them mounting their boards and waiting patiently to ride in on the most powerful of the tall, grey waves. As if on cue, a local surf music tribute band, The Breakaways, dressed in faded blue denims and short-sleeved Hawaiian shirts, began playing at the pier entrance. An even better insight into surf culture and music came a few days later when The Surfaris drummer David Raven took me to an outdoor gig in Irvine, Orange County, where he played with bassist Jay Truax (ex-Nomads), and guitarists Ron Eglit (Dick Dale and his Band) and Paul Johnson (The Bel-Airs). They called themselves The Legends Surf Band. We picked up Johnson from his apartment. He was wearing a baseball cap, blue jeans and sandals and had a black patch over his left eye. On the drive down he told me his story. As a 15-year old schoolboy in 1961 he'd composed a hit tune called Mr Moto for The Bel-Airs. Orange County, just south of LA, has its own strong surf culture such as at Newport Beach . That summer, when playing at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Redondo Beach, a leading surfer came over to him and said: 'Wow, man! Your music sounds just like it feels out on a wave. You should call it surf music.' So he did. When The Beach Boys adopted this sound the hard-core sports crowd initially shunned them. 'As long as they posed as surfers they were resented by those in the true beach culture,' Johnson told me. 'But when they went on to celebrate California youth culture at large by singing about cars and cruising, that broadened their appeal. After that, even surfers appreciated them.' When The Beach Boys started recording their focus shifted from Hawthorne to Hollywood. They signed with Capitol Records, whose 13-storey circular tower at 1750 Vine Street, built in 1956, has become an LA landmark. Legend has it that the architecture was based on the image of a bunch of singles stacked on the spindle of a record player. The night I visited, Arcade Fire were playing a promotional set on a specially built platform outside the tower. The Beach Boys' earliest albums were recorded at Capitol but by the time of Surfer Girl and Little Deuce Coupe, they were also recording around the corner at United and Western (6050 Sunset Boulevard). At the Petersen Automotive Museum there are plenty of cars from the era The Beach Boys celebrated . Now called Ocean Way Studios, this is where they recorded their 2012 comeback album That's Why God Made The Radio. In 1965, Brian Wilson bought the then modern 1448 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills with its great views over the LA basin. It was here that he notoriously built himself a huge sandbox in the living room to stimulate his creative juices. (The video for Sloop John B was filmed in the garden pool.) Two years later he moved to 10452 Bellagio Road in the more upmarket gated community of Bel Air. Several Beach Boys' albums, including Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, 20/20 and Surf's Up, were partially recorded here, while Charles Manson, a fringe figure on the LA music scene in 1969, visited to tape songs that he'd written. In songs such as Little Deuce Coupe, Shut Down, Little Honda, and Fun Fun Fun, The Beach Boys explored the parallel teenage subculture of cruising and hot-rodding. Illegal street racing still takes place but usually in the early hours of the morning, and it's a crime even to be a spectator. In 1967 Brian Wilsonmoved to a more upmarket gated community in the exclusive area of Bel Air . Custom car shows tend to happen out in the desert rather than in the city. But at the Petersen Automotive Museum (6060 Wilshire Boulevard) it's possible to see everything from hot rods and deuce coupes to Thunderbirds and Chevrolets. Spread over two spacious floors, there are plenty of cars from the era The Beach Boys celebrated - a peach-coloured 1957 Lincoln Premiere once owned by Jayne Mansfield, a black 1957 Chrysler, and a wonderful boat-sized 1959 red Cadillac Convertible. The hot rod section has a classic Deuce Coupe customised from a 1932 Ford. Appropriately the museum cafe, Johnny Rockets, is a 50s-style diner with red plastic seating, chrome surfaces and neon signs. On my final day I headed north on the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu. There's probably no road that better embraces the geographical joys of LA - steep hills and canyons to one side, broad beaches and ocean to the other - and no drive is better suited to a Beach Boys' soundtrack. The group even recorded a song about it in 2012. Beyond Malibu lies Paradise Cove. A left-hand turn took me a mile down a hill to a private beach edged with cliffs where the group was photographed for the cover of 1962's Surfin' Safari, and again two years later for All Summer Long. Paradise Cove is not really a top surf destination despite all the surfboard-shaped signs . Paradise Cove is now home to one of the world's most luxurious trailer parks. Film directors, screenwriters, models and Hollywood actors such as Minnie Driver and Matthew McConaughey have swapped bricks and mortar for transportable homes with a view. A surfboard-shaped sign ironically declared No Surfboards. The warning was somewhat redundant as beaches can be private but the sea is free and, anyway, the waves are so mild that no serious surfer would choose it. Maybe that's why The Beach Boys came here - and why they kept their shirts and jeans on during the shoot.

"Boris Johnson has criticised a controversial Government ruling to stop 430,000 civil servants talking to journalists. The Mayor of London raised concerns about a change to the civil service code, quietly introduced last week, which makes it clear that officials can be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude agreed to redraft guidance to ‘strengthen protection’ for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money, and include a commitment to being ‘as open as possible’ with Parliament and the public. The Mayor of London, pictured during a visit to Kew Gardens last week, disagrees with the new rule to stop civil servants speaking to the press . However, that has failed to satisfy critics who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign. Mr Johnson, a former journalist, told the Daily Mail: ‘I believe in maximum possible transparency. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. ‘There’s virtually nothing that you can say or do that isn’t instantly FOI-able. Although it’s painful and difficult for politicians, it’s a bloody good thing. It does lead actually to better government. I’m in favour of people being able to discuss things as freely as they can. ‘When I look back at my time in City Hall, it’s quite incredible how I took over an operation staffed overwhelmingly by people who didn’t share my political views. They have been loyal. Do we get people trying to brief the media? Absolutely not. Mr Johnson said he believed in 'maximum possible transparency' ‘Most civil servants understand that there’s a difference between being useful and helping public debate, and undermining the operation that they are in. I’m in favour of transparency.’ Mr Johnson said he was concerned that there would be a repeat of the post-Leveson ‘chill’ between the media and the police, which he described as ‘crazy’. ‘One of the difficulties that there has been is in the case of relations between police and the media. Relations between police and the media have always been pretty free,’ he said. ‘Publicity is one of the utensils of crime-fighting,’ he said. Mr Johnson raised wider questions about historic police investigations, such as those going on into child abuse allegations dating back decades. ‘One thing I am concerned about is the extent to which police time and resources can be devoted to what you might call policing the past - policing previous police investigations into what may or may not have been criminal offences,’ he said. ‘We have got to be careful. I can see the huge sensitivities, and there may be people out there who feel they have been victims. But we also need to fight everyday crimes of violence and burglary.’ The Cabinet Office insists that the amendment to the civil service code will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media. They insist the new provision simply ‘clarifies’ current practice, and say whistleblowers have legal protections. The change appears have been agreed by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, who has been dubbed Sir Cover Up over the long delays to the Chilcot Report into the Iraq War. However, the impetus is understood to have come from ministers, who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they, not civil servants, are ultimately in charge. A Government source insisted: ‘We would be deeply concerned if there was a chilling effect which limited the ability of Parliament and the Press to expose waste and wrongdoing’.","Mayor disagrees with rule to stop civil servants speaking to the press .

"Police have called for witnesses to help them put someone who allegedly unknowingly filmed women in the shower, on the train and licked the back of neck behind bars. A 38-year-old has been in custody since a court appearance in January, and was charged with 17 counts of filming person's private parts without consent, trespassing, peep and pry and acts of indecency. Ryde Local Area Command Crime Manager Detective Inspector Richard Puffett said police are now trying to identify the victims, and potential witnesses. Police have called for witnesses to help them put someone who allegedly unknowingly filmed women in the shower, on the train and licked the back of neck . 'Some of the images include 'up-skirting'; peep and pry where people have been filmed in their own homes showering; women travelling on trains where another passenger has allegedly licked the back of their heads; and the reactions of women to an act of indecency,' Det Insp Puffett said. It is believed one victim is aged under 16. A property in Sydney's north was raided last December, which resulted in the seizure of a GoPro camera and a number of electronic storage devices. The storage devices show acts of peep and pry, voyeurism and 'up-skirting' conduct, along with acts of indecency, an indecent assault, and aggravated break and enter offences. A 38-year-old has remained in custody since a court appearance in January, and was charged with 17 counts of filming person's private parts without consent, trespassing, peep and pry and acts of indecency . Police believe the footage comes from up to 40 different incidents. 'The images were taken in Carlingford, Epping, Beecroft, Normanhurst and Thornleigh areas between October and December 2014,' Det Insp Puffett said. 'We have released two images of females; we believe they may have witnessed one of these incidents, or could have been a victim. We are hoping they may come forward and speak to police.' The investigation is ongoing, with police calling on witnesses or victims to come forward to help. The person was remanded to reappear in Parramatta Local Court on 12 March 2015.","Women unknowingly filmed in shower, on train and in public by creep .

"She may be known for her gleaming, blonde locks, but Gwyneth Paltrow has made no secret of the fact she can’t style her own hair. Such is her love of a professional look, she invested in a chain of U.S. blow-dry bars last year. The first branch has just opened in London, offering seven Hollywood hairdos inspired by the actress, who is also the creative director — all at just £28 a throw. Scroll down for video . Sleek Volume: Fellow blonde Mandie Gower (pictured) made her way to Blo, in Covent Garden, to try out some of Gwynnie's signature looks . Blo, in Covent Garden, promises to bring Gwyneth’s signature looks to busy British women. The chain also has to satisfy her eco-credentials, so the salon does not use styling products that contain any chemical preservatives — called parabens — or sulphates. As a customer, all you have to do is point at the look you like best on the salon menu before you sit back for 45 minutes and sip a green tea as the stylist gets to work. Fellow blonde Mandie Gower went along to try four of Gwynnie’s most distinctive styles, and see if it really is possible to get Hollywood hair on the cheap. SLEEK VOLUME . Sleek Volume: Gwyneth rocked the 'sleek volume' at the 2005 Oscars (pictured) The style: The salon’s name for this look is the Red Carpet. Gwyneth rocked a similar look at the Oscars in 2005. And even the shampoo the stylist is rubbing into my hair has Hollywood connections. The salon uses a range called Unite by Beverly Hills celebrity hairdresser Andrew Dale and is free from paraben preservatives and sulphates. It turns out this is the first of many products that I need to be red carpet-ready. There’s a conditioner, then a mousse, followed by volumising spray. Then a slick of another Gwynnie favourite — argan oil. Once my pampered hair has been rough-dried, my Blo stylist Sundya divides it into small sections, rolling each one up into pin curls and securing them on my head with a grip. Another blast with the hairdryer and these are gently unrolled. Sundya then backcombs the roots before smoothing and separating the curls and fixing the whole look with a whoosh of hairspray. Verdict: My hair has more energy and bounce than Gwyneth after a pint of organic green juice. And it feels beautifully soft and natural rather than set and brittle. It’s me, but with added va-va voom. Result! 5/5 . TOUSLED TRESSES . The style: This just-got-out-of-bed look, called Pillow Talk, is easy to achieve when you have your own Beverly Hills celebrity stylist on speed dial. But if my pillows could talk, they would swear blind they’d never seen my hair looking like this first thing in the morning. Sundya reveals Gwyneth’s secret — a salt-water spray to give the hair that matt, slept-in look. Tousled Tresses: This just-got-out-of-bed look looks easy to achieve but is actually far from it, Blo stylist Sundya reveals salt-water spray is the secret to creating that slept-in look . Once she’s sprayed this on and blow-dried my hair using a medium round brush, she twizzles small sections into tight twists, and winds them individually around the barrel of a tong, holding them in place with her fingertips for about 15 seconds each. ‘This gives more of a wave than a curl,’ she says. She then gently brushes through the Medusa-like tendrils to create a more relaxed effect, before fixing it with hairspray. Verdict: I don’t look ‘sensual and innocent’, as promised on the salon menu. Even ‘messy beach waves’ doesn’t describe my hair at the end of 45 minutes. Far from looking like the sexy surfer girl I had imagined, I am reminded of a bowl of spiral pasta. 2/5 . AMAZING GRACE . The style: Gwyneth is no stranger to an up-do. Sundya says the key is ‘all about prepping the hair for a sleek finish’, and I soon discover this involves lots of products, from leave-in conditioner to a ‘Lazer Straight Relaxing Fluid’ which smoothes frizz. My hair is blown straight and pulled into a high ponytail. Amazing Grace: Gwyneth showed off a classic updo in 1996 film, Emma (left). Mandie (right) learnt that the key to this delicate look is preparing your hair for a 'sleek finish', which can involve a lot of products . To create the topknot — Gwynnie calls this look the High Society — the ponytail is divided into thick sections and tonged into a chunky curl to help coax a rounded bun shape out of my straight hair. As Sundya works her way round the ponytail, she carefully fans out each section, spreading and pinning it to create the bun. Verdict? Forget Gwyneth Paltrow. When I look in the mirror through the fog of hairspray, I swear I can see Grace Kelly. The menu ‘guarantees this coif will get you what you want’, and it’s true, my bun stays firm and perky all day, even winning a few compliments from strangers. 4/5 . BACKCOMB PONYTAIL . The style: Gwyneth rocked a beehive at a Louis Vuitton event a few years ago. But as I soon discover, this is a seriously high–maintenance look — not for nothing the salon calls it the Hunt Club — that takes a lot of backcombing. Backcomb Ponytail: Another favourite of Gwyneth's (left) is the beehive inspired ponytail. Mandie (right) discovered that this seriously high-maintenance look took a lot of backcombing . The vigorous brushing begins after my hair’s been washed and dried. And I panic at the sight of the matted bird’s nest on the top of my head. But minutes later Sundya has pinned it back and miraculously smoothed away the coarse texture with a brush, while keeping all the volume. The lower lengths (which weren’t backcombed) are swept into a side ponytail and fixed with a minimal band. Sundya then wraps a small section of hair around the band to cover it — the ultimate Gwynnie touch. Verdict: My ponytail looks a bit sparse compared with the enormous pouffe on top of my head. The menu suggests it is ‘a polished look for an impromptu polo match’. Sorry, but there are none of those going on where I live. 3/5 .","Gwyneth Paltrow has made no secret of the fact she can’t style her hair .

"Sunday nights may never be the same again. ITV confirmed yesterday that the sixth series of Downton Abbey will be the very last after ratings for the programme started to dip. At the height of its success, more than 9.51million viewers sat down to watch the period drama, which depicted the lives of those upstairs and downstairs in early 20th century Britain. Scroll down for video . Flagging figures: It has been confirmed that the next series of Downton Abbey will be the last after a drop in viewing figures for recent series of the show . However, by the opening episode of the last season, that figure had dropped to 8.43million. 'Inevitably there comes a time when all shows should end and Downton is no exception,' Executive Producer Gareth Neame said in a statement on Thursday. TV bosses added that they wanted to go out on a high. While the news will come as a massive blow to fans, the hugely successful show has set many of its stars on the path to showbiz success. In celebration of the Crawleys and all those who served them, Femail looks at the brightest new talent to come out of the manor..... LILY JAMES, 24, LADY ROSE MACCLARE . Before being cast in Downton, Lily actually played a starring role in the hit TV series Secret Diary Of A Call Girl alongside Billie Piper. Lily played Polly, one of Belle's fellow call girls. Prior to this, Lily had a role in the TV series Just William as Ethel Brown. Since taking part in the hit series as Lady Rose Macclare, Lily has swapped life on the small screen for life in the movies. The star  is currently promoting her biggest film to date: Cinderella. Lily plays Cinders in the latest Disney adaptation of the fairy tale. It's not all fairytales though. Lily has also taken a role in Pride and Predjudice Zombies, a zombified adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, which is due for release later this year. Belle of the ball: 24-year-old Lily James has seen huge success this year; she is currently promoting the new Cinderella film in which she stars as Cinderella herself . Now cast in a blockbuster: Lily played Lady Rose MacClare in Downton, pictured here in period dress . MICHELLE DOCKERY, 33, LADY MARY CRAWLEY . It was from the stage that Michelle Dockery took the leap onto the set of Downton in 2010 to play Lady Mary, who became one of the most popular characters. From her relationship with Matthew Crawley (played by Dan Stevens) to playing a larger role in the running of Downton, she's had some of the most talked-about story lines. And it didn't go unnoticed; Michelle has been nominated for three Emmys and a Golden Globe award. Like many of the other Downton actresses, when she's not on the set of the show Michelle has also spent time working on films. In 2012, she starred in Anna Karenina as Princess Myagkaya and in 2014 she took a part alongside Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore in the thriller Non-Stop. Michelle, who is a regular at red carpet events, has previously spoken out about how weird it is being recognised by other famous people. She once told the Express: 'Laura Carmichael (who plays Lady Edith) and I were at the Met Ball last year and Beyoncé told us she was a fan of the show. That was an amazing and strange experience. 'It’s overwhelming when people who you’ve watched and admired for years, and who you wouldn’t have ever dreamed of coming into contact with, come up to you to tell you how much they enjoy what you’re doing and how much they love Downton. It’s quite a surreal thing, actually.' Michelle Dockery is a red carpet regular now but has spoken out about how weird it is to be recognised by other famous people...including Beyonce . The character of Lady Mary has had some of the most talked-about story lines, especially when it comes to her love life . In Downton Lady Mary is known for trying out different styles and Michelle Dockery is the same, experimenting with colour while on the red carpet at showbiz events . LAURA CARMICHAEL, 28, LADY EDITH CRAWLEY . For actress Laura Carmichael, the role in Downton as Lady Edith Crawley has been a springboard for success. In the series, Lady Edith is one of the more challenging characters, campaigning for women's rights and even taking a job. Storylines which Laura has been grateful for. She said: ‘I feel very lucky that my story-line is the way it is in this series. There is a lot to do. It is emotional and meaty stuff. It is exciting and nerve racking but it is enjoyable.’ Having graduated from the Bristol Old Vic drama school in 2007, this was Laura's first big role. She then starred alongside, albeit briefly, Benedict Cumberbatch in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. More recently, Laura has also worked on a comedy with Ben Stiller named Burn, Burn, Burn, which is thought to be coming out sometime in the next year. Laura Carmichael plays Lady Edith in the hit series of Downton, the show was her first big break after leaving drama school . JESSICA BROWN FINDLAY, 25, LADY SYBIL BRANSON . Jessica played Lady Sybil Branson and was known as one of the most controversial characters after she fell in love with the family's chauffeur, Branson. However, Jessica's character met an untimely death during series three when she died during childbirth. Since then, the actress has gone on to enjoy a successful movie career starring in The Riot Club and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Although Jessica says that she enjoyed the experience of working on Downton she has previously revealed to the Telegraph that she never regretted her decision to leave the hit show. She said: 'I don’t regret my decision. I kind of had a gut feeling. I had come to the end of my contract and I was so hungry to do other things. 'I had had a few jobs in between the filming of the first and second series and then I had had to turn down a job I got [because I was filming] the third series, so it felt right.' Jessica Brown Findlay left Downton to further her acting career and has since starred in several films . In Downton Jessica played Lady Sybil (left) she has since gone on to star in The Riot Club (right) DAN STEVENS, 32, MATTHEW CRAWLEY . Dan Stevens character Matthew Crawley's romance with Lady Mary was one of the highlights of Downton Abbey. However, it ended prematurely when Matthew was killed off in series three after Dan decided he wanted out of the show. At the time, producers said that they made his final scene - in which he had a car crash - ambiguous as to whether or not he had actually died in case Dan decided to change his mind. Sadly for Downton fans he didn't and Dan went on to have a successful run on Broadway and he has several films coming out in the next couple of years. Dan said of his decision to leave after three years on the show: 'We were always optioned for three years. And when that came up it was a very difficult decision. 'But it felt like a good time to take stock, to take a moment. From a personal point of view, I wanted a chance to do other things. 'It is a very monopolising job. So there is a strange sense of liberation at the same time as great sadness because I am very, very fond of the show and always will be.'

"From the dreaming spires of Oxford to Canterbury's stunning cathedral, England boasts some of the greatest architectural gems and historic attractions in the world. And with spring on its way, it's a great time to take a city break. Oxford University's Radcliffe Camera is one of the many incredible sights to visit in England this spring . OXFORD . Home to the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford has been wowing students for hundreds of years with its honey-hued domes and sky-piercing spires. Its colleges have nurtured some of the nation's greatest minds - from astronomer Edwin Hubble to playwright Oscar Wilde - but you don't have to be student to take a tour. Alternatively, follow in the footsteps of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis and sink a pint at the 17th Century The Eagle and Child. It's where their university group, the 'Inklings', used to meet to discuss literature over a tipple or two. CAMBRIDGE . With its grand buildings, historical shops and bustling market, Cambridge is just as striking as Oxford. The River Cam runs along the backs of the university - the ultimate place for punting. Visit one or two of the colleges - many are architectural marvels with centuries of history and culture to discover. The River Cam runs along the backs of the university at Cambridge - the ultimate place for punting . Trinity College is perhaps the most famous, counting Isaac Newton and Lord Byron among its alumni. Stop for lunch at The Eagle, where molecular biologist Francis Crick announced that he and James Watson had discovered the structure of DNA. LINCOLN . It's 800 years since England's most important document, Magna Carta, was sealed, and if you head to the newly restored Lincoln Castle, you can see one of only four surviving original copies of the charter in a state-of-the-art underground vault. Reopening on April 1, the refurbished castle will also have a new 360-degree walkway along its walls, letting visitors see the historical building from a new angle, and giving unprecedented access to its 18th Century prisons, as featured in television's Downton Abbey. CANTERBURY . Along with a visit to the famous cathedral, a tour of the River Stour is a must when you visit Canterbury . Canterbury was the final destination of Geoffrey Chaucer's not-so-holy pilgrims as they made their way from London to Thomas Becket's shrine in Canterbury Cathedral. The tales were written in the 14th Century, but it's still easy to imagine a fat monk or a drunken miller travelling on horseback through winding cobbled streets to what is now a Unesco World Heritage Site. Along with a visit to the famous cathedral, a tour of the River Stour is a must. From the comfort of the boat, you'll glide past gems that include a 13th Century Franciscan island, the beautiful Westgate Gardens and the King's Bridge, which dates back to 1134. BATH . Ever wondered what the Romans got up to in their lavish leisure centres? During peak summer months, you can ask your private guide to elaborate on an evening tour of one of the best-preserved Roman structures in the world. Visitors to bath can listen to famed travel writer Bill Bryson's fascinating audio commentary . And all year round, you can listen to famed travel writer Bill Bryson's fascinating audio commentary, which offers an insight into Roman life, beliefs and spirituality, as you peer into ancient changing rooms, wander through a temple dedicated to a goddess with healing powers, and admire the torch-lit Great Bath.","Spring is a great time to take a city break in the UK .

"A former NYPD cop and his federal customs officer brother were sentenced to three years in prison for illegally exporting military-grade weapons for more than four years to the Philippines. Rex Maralit, 46, had been with the NYPD for 11 years before he was fired after pleading guilty. Wilfredo Maralit, 49, was a Customs and Border Protection officer for nine years in California. The Maralit brothers often used their law enforcement jobs to help them purchase the weapons, such as by retrieving gun discounts given to police officers. Former NYPD officer Rex Maralit (left), 46, and former federal customs officer Wilfredo Maralit (right), 49, were sentenced to three years in prison for illegally exporting military-grade weapons to the Philippines . They did not have the required license issued by the State Department to sell the guns overseas, according to the New York Times. Instead they shipped the guns to their brother Ariel, who emailed his brothers specific 'buying orders' from customers, according to prosecutors. Rex and Wilfredo Maralit shipped the guns to their brother Ariel, who continues to live in the Philippines and is considered a fugitive . Weapons the brothers shipped included assault rifles, AR-15s and semiautomatic weapons that had the power to penetrate police body armor and 'penetrate exterior walls, disable vehicles and even potentially down aircraft,' according to prosecutors. Rex and Wilfredo Maralit both pleaded guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act. They were told they would receive a lighter sentence if they could convince their brother Ariel to come to the United States and face charges, but the brothers were unsuccessful. Ariel Maralit continues to live in the Philippines and is considered a fugitive, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Judge Allyne R. Ross of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn said she wanted to give the public 'confidence that the rule of law applies with equal force to law enforcement officials and non-law enforcement officials' with the sentences. Rex Maralit said he had originally become involved in the gun trade to make some extra money for his family, and was hoping to make his business legal one day. 'I was blind to allow myself to believe that I was merely avoiding red tape,' he said. Wilfredo Maralit's lawyer Louis M. Freeman said the brothers' motivation was 'totally economic' during the trial last year. Freeman said there was 'no evidence' the brothers were 'interested in providing weapons for political purposes'.","Rex Maralit, 46, and Wilfredo Maralit, 49, often used their law enforcement jobs to help them purchase the weapons .

"A military reservist who returned from service in Afghanistan last year was injured along with his family when a bullet from the war exploded. A 25-year-old soldier in Lindenhurst, north of Chicago, was attempting to light a tracer round in his backyard with a blow torch when the ammunition exploded and alarmed residents on his street. Residents began calling 911 after their homes and windows began shaking from the blast at 9.45pm Saturday night. An Afghanistan reservist's bullet that exploded in a suburban neighborhood north of Chicago was a tracer round, which are often marked by a different colored tip from other ammunition (file photo) The reservist and his 23-year-old sister both received 'quite a few superficial wounds,' Lindenhurst police told the Chicago Tribune. They were released from the hospital Sunday morning and rejoined their parents, who treated their own small injuries. Tracer rounds contain a combustible compound that leaves a visible trail of the projectiles path. They can be taken out of their shells and ignited for use as flares, the likely intended outcome of Saturday's incident. 'What he thought would happen didn't,' Lindenhurst commander George Moravec said of the incident, which created a flash explosion. Moravec added that the reservist, who returned from Afghanistan last fall with the tracer, had a 'respected history in the military'. Houses on the reservist's street (pictured) were shaken and police are assessing to see if there was any damage . Tracer rounds (pictured in Kobane, Syria, 2014) can be used as flares if removed from their shell and ignited . The exploding bullet was not illegal to own as a civilian and foul play is not expected. Police are going back to the residents to assess any damage done to property. Great Lakes Naval Air Station said they will conduct an investigation into the incident. An estimated $2million in damage was caused at an Indianapolis shooting range last year when a bullet believed to be a tracer round caused a fire, according to WTHR. The bullet did not explode, but is thought to have smoldered in shredded rubber tires used as a backstop.","Twenty-five-year-old reservist in Lindenhurst, Illinois tried to ignite bullet .

"It was a cruel move by a Czech website which left a 'shy' Miss Great Britain winner 'gutted' when they blurred out her face for being 'ugly'. But now Shelby Tribble, 21, from Plymouth, has proved her doubters at Extra.cz wrong by starring in a stunning new series of photos. In the shoot, Shelby shows off her good looks and slim figure in a series of poses looking every bit the beauty queen. Scroll down for video . Miss Great Britain Shelby Tribble looked stunning in a new shoot, in December she was criticised by a Czech website which said she was not attractive enough to be in a beauty contest . It was in December that the Czech Republic's top celebrity website claimed British women are not beautiful using Shelby, the winner of Miss Great Britain beauty pageant, as a prime example. The website claimed that she was not good-looking enough to told the title of a beauty queen. In fact, they felt so strongly about Shelby's appearance that they went as far as to pixelate out her face on their site. Extra.cz said at the time that traffic for their articles about the Miss Great Britain beauty contest had gone through the roof after they declared the winner was not good looking. In one of the first reports they included the headline: 'Great Britain has new Miss and she proves the rule that British women are not beautiful.' It included the pixelated photo of Shelby, who has previously won a number of beauty queen titles in the UK. Shelby showed off a variety of poses in her new shoot which came after she faced criticism for her looks . Shelby had her face blurred out by the Czech website extra.cz as they said British women are not good-looking . As well as being crowned Miss Great Britain 2014/15, she has also been crowned Miss South West, Miss Hippodrome 2014, Miss Loaded 2014 and has been a Miss England finalist. But the Czech article concluded that if she was to take part in a Czech beauty pageant, she would not even make the finals. Publishing photos of the other Miss Britain contestants, it said that they contestants were: 'Ordinary, regular, non-interesting blonde beats approximately 40 competitors. If you want to know why look no further than this gallery.' And it pointed out that there was no surprise that famous British women like Emma Watson, Kate Middleton, Kate Moss, Cara Delevigne, Keira Knightley and Kate Winslet had decided to steer clear of the UK event. Shelby was voted Miss Great Britain in both 2014 and 2015 and has won many other awards such as Miss Hipodrome 2014 and Miss Loaded 2014 . Shelby looked back to her confident self as she posed for the new photographs . Shelby Tribble posed in some white underwear with her dip dyed hair styled in a lose curl . It said: 'It seems that the really beautiful British women that the UK produces prefer to invest the time in a career, leaving the beauty contests to the rest.' In the Czech Republic, they said, beauty contests were at whole new level because they actually had women that were worth looking at. They said: 'It's not really a surprise, hear in the Czech Republic it is an interesting event. The show is broadcasted live on national TV and the winner becomes a famous celebrity. 'But look at the British event, no celebrity guests, no four-hour-long show and most importantly, no beautiful girls.' The story, which was a viral hit for the website, was then developed with further stories including one that said: '10 finalists for the English Miss contest that will make your eyes water. Such monsters are hard to find!' In this relaxed look Shelby wore a pink shirt with white jeans with a pair of aviator style sunglasses . The author then admits that they deliberately chose the ugliest but points out that they were nevertheless staggered that they ever made it even to the final. It said they had no dress sense, cheap shoes and relied on revealing intimate body parts rather than real natural beauty in order to win votes. It was a hard hit for Shelby, who is no stranger to facing cruel taunts. She describes herself as 'painfully shy' after being bullied at school and had to overcome low self-esteem in order to triumph as a beauty queen. She said competing in beauty pageants and modelling has helped her turn the tables on her tormentors and gain a sense of self worth. And now these new photos show she is back to her confident best.","Extra.cz blurred out Miss Great Britain winner Shelby Tribble's face .

"He wants to become Chancellor of the Exchequer. But this morning Ed Balls admitted that he relies on his mother-in-law June for help with maths. At the end of an interview on Good Morning Britain, Labour’s shadow chancellor said he was relieved he had not been asked to answer any maths questions live on TV. Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls told Good Morning Britain his mother was the family's maths brain . Last month during an interview on the ITV breakfast show, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was left embarrassed when she refused to answer what 7x8 is. After appearing on the programme this morning to discuss George Osborne’s Budget, Mr Balls told host Susanna Reid: ‘I was pleased you didn’t ask me any maths questions this morning, that was my…’ Asked how he was with fractions, Mr Balls replied: ‘Luckily my mother-in-law is a maths teacher so she is the expert when it comes to maths.’ A shocked Miss Reid interrupted: ‘You cannot tell me that the shadow chancellor relies on this mother in law to do his maths.’ He added: ‘The kids think the mother-in-law is very good at maths teaching. You always rely on your mother in law.’ Good Morning Britain host Susanna Reid asked Mr Balls if he really left all the maths questions to his mother in law. He replied: 'You always rely on your mother-in-law' The morning after the Budget, Mr Balls warned that Mr Osborne's plan for cuts was ‘a pretty scary prospect’ for voters . Mr Balls has three children with his wife, Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. Her mother June, is a maths teacher and her father, Tony, a trade unionist. After working as an adviser to Gordon Brown at the Treasury, Mr Balls was elected as an MP in 2005 and became shadow chancellor in 2011. He previously worked at the Financial Times and taught economics at Harvard University. Last month Mrs Morgan refused to do mental arithmetic during an appearance on Good Morning Britain to discuss plans to improve the performance of schools in England. When asked what the answer to 7x8 is, she said: ‘I'm not going to be answering any maths questions.’ Mr Balls has three children with his wife, Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper . Mr Balls warned that Mr Osborne's plan for cuts was ‘a pretty scary prospect’ for voters. ‘For all his boasts, people are worse-off than they were and the squeeze on living standards has been very severe,’ Mr Balls later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ‘If you look at his plans for the next parliament, as the independent OBR say, the cuts in public spending under the Osborne plan are more severe in the next three years than in the last five. ‘His desire to get to an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts in the next three years to our police, our defence forces than we've seen in the last few years. ‘I don't think those cuts are going to be possible for George Osborne. He's going to end up either cutting our National Health Service or raising VAT. ‘The truth at the election will be, do you want Labour's more balanced, fairer approach to deficit reduction, which focuses on raising wages and being fair, or do you want to go for even deeper spending cuts over the next three years?’","Shadow chancellor  reveals his mother in law is the family maths expert .

"A decorated British Army officer who devoted his retirement to helping troops serving on the frontline shot himself after allegedly feeling ‘harassed’ by a former aide to Margaret Thatcher, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Brigadier David Martin, 57, ended his life after receiving phone calls and a ‘harassing voicemail’ over a £300,000 dispute involving his military charity. Brig Martin was a director and trustee of UK4U Thanks, a charity founded in 2005 which works with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to deliver Christmas food parcels to troops in war zones. Diane Martin - pictured with son Will, centre, and her late husband David - says the Brigadier felt he would be ‘the sacrificial lamb’ in a row between UK4U and a businessman who PR man Hugh Colver was representing . In a letter to friends and family breaking the news, his widow said the brigadier was left agitated after speaking to PR man Hugh Colver earlier this month, saying he felt he would be ‘the sacrificial lamb’ in a row between UK4U and a businessman who Mr Colver was representing. In the letter, which was distributed on social media, devastated Diane Martin, 55, said: ‘David received an email on Sunday evening [March 1] which made him very agitated, and in his letter to me he said that the final straw was a harassing voicemail during the day from the same man. ‘It all concerned the UK4U Christmas box charity for which he was the chairman of trustees. The founding businessman felt that he had never been properly recompensed for his initial (very substantial) outlay – despite formal arbitration and subsequent revisiting of the arbitration by legal teams. ‘A high-powered PR man started to harass David for some sort of out-of-court settlement. Neither the charity nor the MoD could legally ‘pay off’ a claim that was unsubstantiated, so he concluded (again in his letter) that he would be the sacrificial lamb that would have to be found ‘guilty’ in order that the claims could be settled. ‘Everyone knew that he would have done nothing wrong but he felt powerless to challenge the allegations and didn’t have the resilience or energy to go through such a potentially traumatic period.’ Just hours after speaking to Mr Colver, a former director of communications for the Conservative Party, Brig Martin wrote a suicide note and killed himself in the grounds of his Cotswolds family home near Avening in Gloucestershire. 'Brought in to mediate': Hugh Colver said he was 'deeply saddened' by Brig Martin's death . When questioned by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Colver confirmed he had attempted to persuade Brig Martin to negotiate with businessman Stephen Briggs, who in 2005 provided UK4U with hundreds of thousands of pounds of start-up cash. When the charity’s trustees refused to pay back Mr Briggs from UK4U funds, he started legal action. According to the charity’s 2008 annual report, an arbitrator found the businessman was owed funds. The report adds that UK4U accepted the award but that Mr Brigg’s company ‘claimed further amounts’. Mr Colver, from Westbury, Wiltshire, said: ‘As far as I know Brigadier Martin and I did not know each other previously but he was aware of who I was and my background. I was brought in to mediate. ‘Our conversations were very reasonable and I got the impression he felt I was genuinely trying to help. He even thanked me for my efforts. He was surprised that the issues were still around, he thought it was all sorted by the arbitration and I said, well, unfortunately, it remains a dispute. The way the conclusion was arrived at is regarded, by some people, as invalid. The dispute is over several hundred thousand pounds and is very complicated.’ A friend of Brig Martin claimed that Mr Colver adopted an ‘icy tone’ in their conversations, but the PR man insisted: ‘I absolutely refute any suggestion that I was threatening and I was deeply saddened to learn of his death, this is tragic, ghastly.’ When approached by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Briggs said: ‘It is a very difficult situation and we are very saddened by the news. Hugh Colver is our mediator and he knows the true side of the story and I would listen very carefully to him.’ Brig Martin was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) during a glittering military career. His funeral was held yesterday.

"This is the heart-stopping moment a freestyle skier plunged off  the Matterhorn in Switzerland in a competition that rewards bravery. Loic Collomb-Patton, from France, was captured dropping off the huge ledge in an effort to win one of the world's most prestigious skiing events. The Skiers Cup sees Team Europe and Team Americas compete against each other at the end of February - and this year saw Europe win the title. Freestyle skier Loic Collomb-Patton, from France, drops off a huge ledge while competing in the Skiers Cup in Switzerland at the end of February . Skiers hit speeds of more than 60mph in temperatures around minus 15 degrees, meaning one slip could result in devastating consequences. As well hidden crevasses, cliffs more than ten metres high and deep powder, the competitors also had to battle with 40mph winds. In one image Seth Morrison, the 42-year-old captain of the United States team, is captured pulling off a 30ft-long backflip making it the biggest and longest jump of the competition. Intrepid photographer David Carlier captured the athletes on camera by using a helicopter to track the skiers from above. Sverre Liliequist, from Sweden, performs a backflip on the Matterhorn against a clear blue sky. Mr Liliequist competed for Europe, which won the annual cup for the third time . Seth Morrison, captain of Team Americas, is captured upside-down as he attempts a backflip. The 30ft-long jump was the biggest and longest of the competition . With bright yellow poles sticking out either side Logan Pehota, competing for the US, drops over a ledge into deep, powdery snow . Mr Collomb-Patton attempts the same jump but looks a little more unsteady on his feet as snow and ice tumble around him . Despite the athletes taking more than an hour in a chairlift to reach the peak of the mountain, whose summit is 4,478 metres (14,692 ft) high, they reached the bottom  in less than a minute. Mr Carlier said: 'It is very unusual to have such an amazing group of riders ski on the Matterhorn at such a high level and in such great snow conditions. 'Actually, it has never been done before as this is the first time they could ski to the bottom of the Matterhorn, just under the North face. 'It was jaw dropping to witness the size of the jumps and the speed the riders reach in virgin, untracked, deep powder snow.

Competitors make their way towards the peak of the Matterhorn. It takes more than an hour in a chairlift to reach the peak but less than a minute to come down . 'It requires so many skills to perform freestyle tricks in such an uncontrolled environment. 'It takes only one hour from the last lift to reach the start of the contest but then it takes them less than a minute to go down.' Nicolas Hale-Woods, freeride world tour general manager, said: 'The level of skiing is amazing – but what strikes me most is the good spirit between the teams. 'It has been really interesting to witness how the guys helped out each other. That's the spirit that makes this event so special and we will do our part to keep it that way.'

"Last words: Kelly Gissendaner, 46, recorded a last message before her execution was canceled . The only woman on Georgia's death row told her children that 'love beats out hate' just 90 minutes before she was due to be executed on Monday night. Kelly Gissendaner, 46, had been taken to the prison in Jackson where Georgia carries out executions by lethal injection, and expected to die that night - before officials discovered a problem with the drug that was meant to kill her. Executioners for the state found that their dose of pentobarbital, a clear solution solution they were going to use on Gissendaner, was cloudy, sparking fears that it would not work properly. The Georgia Department of Corrections first delayed the execution, scheduled for 7pm, then eventually canceled it at 11pm 'out of an abundance of caution'. But when she recorded her statement, addressed to her children and legal team, she would have had no idea that she was not minutes from death. A recording of the statement, obtained from prison officials by NBC News, revealed that she told her children, whose father she helped murder, to 'keep strong' in the wake of her death. Speaking in a thick Southern accent, she said: 'I just want to tell my kids I love them and I'm proud of them. 'And no matter what happens tonight, love does beat out hate. You keep strong and keep your heads up. I love you.' Scroll down to hear her last words . Victim: Douglas Gissendaner, pictured above, was killed by her lover, Greg Owen, who stabbed him repeatedly. His wife was convicted of his murder for her role in persuading Owen. He is pictured with two of her children, to whom Gissendaner addressed her last words . She also left a message for her legal team, who had made repeated appeals for clemency from state authorities and the Supreme Court - all of which were denied. She said: 'I want to tell my lawyers thank you for all they've done. No matter what happens I know you've done your best and I love you all.' As well as making her last statement, Gissendaner had also been fed the enormous last meal she requested, which included two Burger King cheeseburger meals, cornbread, ice cream, lemonade, popcorn and a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that she had eaten the meal by the time she recorded her statement, and was likely just a few feet away from the death chamber. Gissendaner had come within hours of death before. She was originally due to be executed in late February, but officials called it off because of forecast snow. Prisoners: Gissendaner's lover Greg Owen, left, was the one who stabbed Douglas Gissandaner to death and is serving life in prison. Gissendaner herself did not kill her husband, but persuaded Owen to - for which she was sentenced to die . Doing time: Gissendaner, pictured in 2004, has been on death row for 17 years. Her execution has been postponed twice . She had spent the previous 17 years in prison waiting to die, after being convicted of murdering her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, despite not having physically killed him. She Gissendaner, who was convicted of murder in the wake of the February 1997, which she persuaded her lover, Greg Owen, into carrying out. In her trial, prosecutors told how she repeatedly pushed Owen to kill her husband. He then ambushed him, forced him to drive to a remote area and stabbed him multiple times. Owen and Gissendaner then met up and set fire to the dead man's car. Owen, who eventually confessed and testified against his former girlfriend, is serving a life prison sentence and is eligible for parole in eight years. Gissendanger's execution is one of two postponed by concerns over the drug - though officials have said it would have been strong enough to end her life. In a statement reported by the Gwinnett Daily Post, a spokesman said: 'The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits. Feet from death: Gissendaner was in the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson when she recorded her message . 'Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the execution team performed the necessary checks. 'At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, inmate Gissendaner’s execution has been postponed.' The corrections department has yet to say to which date the execution will be rescheduled. Many have called for Gissendaner to be spared the death penalty and given life in prison instead - including her children. But the parents and sisters of Doug Gissendaner have been unrelenting in their call for her to be executed. In a statement issued the morning after the execution was called off, they said death for her is 'justice'. He said: 'Doug is the true victim of this pre-meditated and heinous crime. 'We, along with our friends and supporters and our faith, will continue fighting for Doug until he gets the justice he deserves no matter how long it takes.'","Kelly Gissendaner made recording 90 minutes before scheduled execution .

"Smoke from burned food in the kitchen can damage the brains of unborn babies, scientists say. Similarly, pollution from coal fires and traffic fumes disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour. Scans of inner-city children from before birth until aged seven to nine revealed those exposed to high levels of air pollution had lower white matter in their left brain, impairing intelligence and causing ADHD and aggression. Scroll down for video . Experts are warning that smoke from burned food in the kitchen can damage the brains of unborn babies . As they grew up it caused problems in concentration, reasoning, judgment, and problem-solving. The US study looked at neurotoxic PAH - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - and its effects on the brains of inner city kids. They are contained in vehicles fumes, coal fires or oil central heating systems, power plants, wildfires and agricultural burning, tobacco smoke and hazardous waste sites . Earlier studies has shown PAH can readily cross the placenta and affects an unborn child's brain and animal studies showed that prenatal exposure impaired the development of behaviour, learning and memory. The study by the Institute for the Developing Mind at Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Columbia University's Centre for Children's Environmental Health tested the effects on brain structure of PAH exposure during the final trimester of pregnancy. It involved taking brain scans of 40 children in New York, followed from before birth until aged seven to nine. Traffic fumes, pollution from coal fires and smoke from burnt food disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour . They were part of a cohort of more than 600 mother-baby pairs from which Columbia researchers had previously reported exposure to airborne PAH during gestation was associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disturbances. These included development delay by the age of three, reduced verbal IQ at five, and symptoms of anxiety and depression by seven. Professor of paediatrics and psychiatry Bradley Peterson said: 'This is the largest MRI study to date of how early life exposure to air pollutants, specifically PAH, affect the developing mind. 'Our findings suggest that PAH are contributors to ADHD and other behavioural problems due to the pollutants' disruptive effects on early brain development.' Results published in JAMA Psychiatry showed reductions in nearly the entire white matter surface of the brain's left hemisphere. Recent research has also found the impact that smoking has on a foetus. Image shows the 4-D ultrasound scan of two foetuses at 32 weeks gestation, one whose mother was a smoker (top) and the other carried by a non-smoker (bottom). The foetus carried by the smoker touches its face and mouth much more, indicating its development is delayed . This loss was associated with slower processing of information during intelligence testing and more severe behavioural problems, including ADHD and aggression. Postnatal PAH exposure - measured at age five - was found to contribute to additional disturbances in development of white matter in the dorsal prefrontal region of the brain, which is associated with concentration, reasoning, judgment, and problem-solving ability. Prof Peterson explained that the morphological features associated with ADHD symptoms in this community sample differed from those previously reported in youth with the disorder, suggesting that exposure to high levels of PAH may produce a specific subtype of ADHD. Although the study involved a small sample of ethnic minority children in poor inner city areas with low educational achievements, a larger study is underway. He added: 'Our findings raise important concerns about the effects of air pollutants on brain development in children, and the consequences of those brain effects on cognition and behaviour. 'If confirmed, our findings have important public health implications, given the ubiquity of PAH in air pollutants in the general population.' New ultrasound images show how babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy touch their mouths and faces much more than babies of non-smoking mothers. Experts said the scans show how smoking during pregnancy can mean the development of the baby's central nervous system is delayed. Now researchers believe they can show the effects of smoking on babies in the womb - and use the images to encourage mothers who are struggling to give up. The baby whose mother was a smoker (top) and the other carried by a non-smoker (bottom) show developmental differences . Dr Nadja Reissland, of Durham University,  said the ultrasound scans show unborn babies of mothers who smoke may have delayed development of their central nervous systems . As part of the study, Dr Nadja Reissland, of Durham University, used 4-D ultrasound scan images to record thousands of tiny movements in the womb. She monitored 20 mothers attending the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, four of whom smoked an average of 14 cigarettes a day. After studying their scans at 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks, she detected that foetuses whose mothers smoked continued to show significantly higher rates of mouth movement and self-touching than those carried by non-smokers. The pilot study, which Dr Reissland hopes to expand with a bigger sample, found babies carried by smoking mothers may have delayed development of the central nervous system. Dr Reissland said: 'A larger study is needed to confirm these results and to investigate specific effects, including the interaction of maternal stress and smoking.' She believed that videos of the difference in pre-birth development could help mothers give up smoking.","Smoke from food, pollution, coal fires and traffic disrupts the development .

"Former PM Gordon Brown warned that leaving the EU would turn Britain into Europe's North Korea . Britain would turn into the European North Korea if it left the EU, Gordon Brown has claimed. In a bizarre warning ahead of a speech to the Commons tomorrow, the former Prime Minister said the UK would be 'left out in the cold with few friends [and] no influence' like the regime in Pyongyang. He rejects claims that Britain could succeed on its own by becoming an open, trading nation like Switzerland or Hong Kong. But the warning that Britain would fall into North Korean isolationism is likely to spark ridicule. A report commissioned by Boris Johnson last year said leaving the EU was 'definitely a viable option' for the UK. Mr Johnson's chief economic adviser Gerard Lyons said the best option was to stay in a reformed European Union – but if that couldn't be achieved exit was better for the economy than the status quo. But in a startling intervention ahead of tomorrow's House of Commons debate on the EU, Mr Brown said: 'We must tell the truth about the 3 million jobs, 25,000 companies, £200billion of annual exports and the £450billion of inward investment linked to Europe.' He said leaving the EU but staying in a free-trade area could leave us 'subject to EU rules, but denied a vote in shaping them'. The former Labour leader, who is stepping down as an MP in May, also dismissed the 'Hong Kong option – leaving Europe to join the world. He said this was 'really the North Korea option – out in the cold with few friends, no influence, little new trade and even less new investment'. In a bizarre warning ahead of a speech to the Commons tomorrow, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the UK would be 'left out in the cold with few friends [and] no influence' like North Korea under Kim Jong-un . Mr Brown, writing in the Guardian, said Britain should not contemplate exit when it was on course to overtake Germany as the EU's largest economy. He said: 'It would be sheer defeatism to cast ourselves, as sceptics do, as helpless victim, impotent bystanders unable to influence events. 'Our destiny is not a bit player on someone else's stage, or a spectator hectoring from the wings, but always setting the agenda, bringing people together, and championing change.' He added: 'Being half-in half-out, a Britain that is semi-detached and disengaged – the Britain of the empty chair even when we are in the room – has made us weaker than ever: irrelevant on Greece, fringe player on climate change, mere spectator in the debate that could have shaped a European pro-growth policy, marginal on Ukraine, with ministers sounding ludicrous as simultaneously they say: 'Russia must be confronted with a more united Europe', and: 'By the way, we are thinking of leaving.'","Former PM rejects claim Britain could succeed on its own outside the EU .

"Antarctica's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters, with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically. This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites. The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years. Scroll down for video . Rates of thickness change (metres/decade) are colour-coded from -25 (thinning) to +10 (thickening). Circles represent percentage of thickness lost (red) or gained (blue) in 18 years. The central circle shows the area not surveyed by the satellites . Satellite data from 1994 to . 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels, . scientists say. The findings, published today in the journal Science, . come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of . global climate change on Earth's vast, remote polar regions. During the study period's first half, to about 2003, the . overall volume decline around Antarctica was small, with West . Antarctica losses almost balanced out by gains in East . Antarctica. After that, western losses accelerated and gains in . the east ended. 'There has been more and more ice being lost from . Antarctica's floating ice shelves,' said glaciologist Helen . Fricker of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the . University of California, San Diego. Ice is added to the ice shelf by glaciers flowing off the continent and by snowfall. Ice is lost when icebergs break off the ice front, and by melting in some regions as warm water flows into the ocean cavity under the ice shelf. Under some ice shelves, cold and fresh meltwater rises to a point where it refreezes onto the ice shelf . The Crosson Ice Shelf in the Amundsen Sea and the Venable . Ice Shelf in the Bellingshausen Sea, both in West Antarctica, . each shrank about 18 percent during the study period. Climate change could make the food we eat taste worse, according to recent research. A major report on the impact of global warming on food has predicted that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase. The researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common, meat like chicken and beef will become stringier and tougher. Carrots are likely to lose their flavour and develop a less pleasant texture. Beetroots and onions will become smaller while milk will contain less protein needed to make cheese. A separate study by marine biologists has also shown that  shellfish will take on a sour flavour as our oceans acidify. They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising. Shrimp raised in water with a lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting, while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. 'If the loss rates that we observed during the past two . decades are sustained, some ice shelves in the Amundsen and . Bellingshausen seas could disappear within this century,' added . Scripps geophysics doctoral candidate Fernando Paolo. The melting of these ice shelves does not directly affect . sea levels because they are already floating. 'This is just like your glass of gin and tonic. When the ice . cubes melt, the level of liquid in the glass does not rise,' Paolo said. But the floating ice shelves provide a restraining force for . land-based ice, and their reduction would increase the flow of . the ice from the land into the ocean, which would increase sea . levels. 'While it is fair to say that we're seeing the ice shelves . responding to climate change, we don't believe there is enough . evidence to directly relate recent ice shelf losses specifically . to changes in global temperature,' Fricker said. Oceanographer and co-author Laurie Padman of Earth & Space . Research in Corvallis, Oregon said for a few Antarctic ice . shelves, ice loss can be related fairly directly to warming air . temperatures. Much of the increased melting elsewhere is . probably due to more warm water getting under the ice shelves . because of increasing winds near Antarctica, Padman added. Fricker said future studies will concentrate on the causes behind changes in ice shelf volume, including the effects of the atmosphere and ocean. 'We're looking into connections between El Niño events in the tropical Pacific and changes in the Antarctic ice sheet,' said Scripps graduate student Fernando Paolo. 'It's very far apart but we know that these teleconnections exist. That may ultimately allow us to improve our models for predicting future ice loss.'

"I spent a good chunk of my 20s in love - with my boyfriend Matt and with New York City, where we lived for five amazing, crazy years. He got a great job over there and I followed, leaving behind family, friends and my job. People thought I was mad to drop everything and run but I never had any doubts. And even if it had all gone wrong, I could always have flown back to life in Britain. Scroll down for video . Tying the knot: Matt and Liz looking nervous before their wedding ceremony at Manhattan’s City Hall- the same place Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw finally married Big . Liz and Matt pose in front of Brooklyn Bridge before their wedding in New York . When I needed to get a visa to stay, we thought about getting married, but then I landed a dream job and sorted out my own paperwork to keep working in the US. We became a tight-knit team of two and whilst other friends diligently alternated between his and hers families for Christmas, we did our own thing, eating turkey sandwiches from a corner deli, or inviting NYC friends for eclectic English/Ukrainian/French/Italian parties. When we got new jobs back in London and returned in the depths of winter it was a damp, dreary December nothing like the magical snowy Christmases we'd been used to. It was difficult adjusting to home when New York felt like our real home. But we cheered up when we got engaged in February and were looking forward to returning to Manhattan for a holiday in June. I don't know whose idea it was to get married in New York, but about a fortnight before our trip we both seemed to have the idea at once. It seemed so obvious because the city was such a huge part of our lives together. Sworn to secrecy! Best friend Robin Hobbs was the only witness to Liz and Matt’s wedding . Selfie time: The bride and groom were casually dressed in matching white and smiled for selfies on the way to their wedding . I looked into it and it was pretty straightforward - apply for licence, wait 24 hours, take one witness, turn up on the day and queue at New York's City Hall with all the other brides and grooms. I knew I had to tell my parents but it wasn't so much a matter of getting permission as casually dropping it into conversation at breakfast. 'We're thinking of getting married in New York,' I said. 'If you really don't want us to, we might not.' Stunned silence, then huge grins. Mum always maintains she knew we'd do it before we really knew ourselves. It was easy to keep quiet - our English friends just thought we were excited about the trip, and we swore our witness Robin to secrecy. He was our best friend, an Englishman in New York who'd recently moved to Boston and understood the pull of the city as much as we did. Wedding feast: Robin enjoys a hot dog in downtown Manhattan right after the wedding. The couple toasted the union with street vendor hot dogs and Champagne in plastic glasses . Arty reception: The newlyweds had cocktails on the roof garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art - where Liz furtively tossed the wedding bouquet over Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculpture . We wanted a get out clause just in case Robin couldn't get time off work or we changed our minds at the last minute - another reason why a secret wedding seemed the right thing to do. I worried English friends and family would be disappointed they couldn't be there for the fun. But we also wanted it to be our wedding, about us as a couple, not about what colour the napkins needed to be, or who to sit where on the table plan, or what type of saucepans to put on a wedding list. The day itself was brilliant. We walked across Brooklyn Bridge towards City Hall - something we'd done so many times before, sightseeing with family, or after drunken nights out in quirky bars or warehouse parties. Tourists cheered us and it felt like the whole city was our friend. City Hall itself was an unforgettable experience - my bouquet was unceremoniously dumped on the security scanner belt and checked for concealed weapons, just like everything else, because the building housed law courts filled with plenty of 'no-goodniks'. There was a lot of hanging around, form-filling, queuing for official stamps and then the ceremony itself - barely five minutes to say 'I do' and for Matt to pretend my engagement ring was a wedding ring. Party time: Liz embraces a guest as the couple celebrate their marriage with friends in the Boxcar Lounge, one of their favourite East Village bars . A married man: Matt pops open a bottle of champagne with friends . The blushing bride: Liz and Matt leaving the Boxcar Lounge on their wedding night . We celebrated with hot dogs from a street vendor and champagne in plastic glasses. Our New York friends were out in force after work - we'd suggested a drinking session and when a few cried off we had to admit we had 'an appointment at City Hall' and they might want to rearrange plans to join us on a pub crawl that kicked off with cocktails on the roof garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Everyone promised to keep Champagne photos off Facebook and any wedding-related chat had to stay in New York because I was terrified the news would get back to England before we did. Thankfully they kept quiet and when we flew back to London we began a mammoth ring-round to tell our nearest and dearest that we'd had a lovely holiday thank you, and oh yes, we decided to get married while we were there. Matt was nervous phoning his mum and dad - we'd tried to call them on the wedding day but they were on holiday in Cornwall and had no mobile reception. To say they were surprised would be an understatement - fortunately they were (and still are) very happy for us. Most of our friends were thrilled. Every phone call followed the same pattern - unexpected announcement followed by exclamations, laughter and promises to email pictures, as if some definite proof were required. Older relatives asked what vows we'd said; I had no idea and had to look them up online. But we kept everyone sweet by promising an epic party on our first anniversary, and true to our word we planned a marquee-full of drinks, dinner and dancing with a healthy mix of English friends and New York guests who'd experienced it all the first time round.

"The deputy U.S. marshal killed in a shootout was expecting his first child - a boy, his wife learned the day after his death. Channing Wells said on Wednesday that the baby will be named Josie Wells Jr., after his father. The last thing she told her husband was that she had an appointment - but not until next week - to learn whether the baby was a boy or a girl. Scroll down for video . Channing Wells (pictured on her wedding day with husband Josie in June 2012) has said her expectant baby will be named Josie Wells Jr, after his deputy U.S. Marshall father who was killed in the line of duty this week . Mrs Wells, an optometrist, said she didn't regret encouraging her husband to serve as a federal marshall and that he had died doing a job that he loved . 'The marshals took me to the hospital in Mississippi this morning so I could learn the baby's gender. ... It's bittersweet,' she said on Wednesday in a phone interview from Baton Rouge. Josie Wells, 27, was killed on the outskirts of that city on Tuesday in a shootout with a man suspected of killing two siblings outside a nightclub. The scene was about 130 miles from his home in the Jackson suburb of Raymond, Mississippi. The suspect, Jamie D. Croom, 31, of New Roads, Louisiana, was hit multiple times in the shootout. He died early Wednesday, East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner William 'Beau' Clark said. Before Croom died, the U.S. Attorney's Office charged him with the young deputy's murder. Channing Wells said the couple had been married nearly three years but had been together since both were 19 and going into their sophomore years at Jackson State University. He took a job at the fast-food restaurant where she worked: 'He stayed for one paycheck, just to get my phone number,' she said. After she finished four more years of school in Chicago to become an optometrist, Josie Wells missed a test of his own to drive her to another state for her board examination, she said. Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells (left), 27, was fatally shot around 11am on Tuesday at Elm Grove Motel in Scotlandville - an area north of Baton Rouge. The fugitive, Jamie D. Croom (right), 31, from New Roads was shot and taken to a hospital where his condition has not been released . Later, she said, she encouraged her husband to look beyond his original ambition to service as a federal marshal. The fugitive, Jamie D. Croom, 31, was shot and taken to a hospital where his condition has not been released. He is facing murder charges . 'His dream was just to become a local police officer,' she said. 'I told him, 'Don't settle for that. Why don't you find the highest level of law enforcement you can do?'' Wells' father, Obie Wells Sr., who turns 57 Thursday, said he, too, had followed a family member into law enforcement. He retired from the sheriff's office in coastal Jackson County as a captain, and all of his sons followed him into the field. He said his surviving sons are a private security officer and police officers. One of his three daughters is studying criminal justice at Jackson State, where Josie Wells earned his bachelor's in the same subject. 'She was planning on doing an internship with Josie,' he said. Obie Wells, a self-described cowboy who keeps horses and used to keep cattle on his 100-acre spread in Wade, north of Pascagoula, said his longtime nickname is 'Josie' after the Clint Eastwood title character in 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.' He gave the name to his second son when his wife, Sherry, refused to let him follow George Foreman's example and name all of his sons Obie, he said. Josie Wells joined the U.S. Marshals Service immediately after getting his degree four years ago, Obie Wells said. Authorities said he was the first deputy marshal killed in the line of duty since 2011. Croom had a long criminal record and faced first-degree murder charges in the deaths of Lechelle Rita Williams, 42, and her brother Sinica Lee Williams, 38, said Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff Beauregard Torres III. 'It was drug-related — just an ongoing feud because of two sides,' Lt. Richard Torres said Wednesday. Channing Wells said that despite her husband's death, she doesn't regret encouraging him to join the U.S. Marshals Service. 'He wouldn't have been happy just being stuck in one position, not knowing there was more — that he could have a higher potential,' she said. And, she said, 'he died doing what he wanted to do and what he loved.'

"Most people have walked to the next street and even to the next town to enjoy some fast food from the takeaway rather than eat the less exciting options in the fridge at home. Now it seems chimpanzees will also go out of their way in order to find their favourite snacks. Researchers at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago have found that chimpanzees are willing to walk longer distances to get their favourite food - grapes - even when they are offered another option closer to hand. Chimpanzees at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago exchanged white PVC pipes (above) for either grapes or carrots . The findings suggest that our often irrational willingness to fulfill our cravings for fast food may have origins far back in our evolutionary past. Dr Lydia Hopper, a research scientist at the Lester Fisher Centre for the Study and Conservation of Apes at Lincoln Park Zoo, said she hoped to explore whether the convenience of the snack on offer may also impact how far chimpanzees are willing to travel. Chimpanzees have special 'words' that they use for different types of food and can even learn the calls used by strangers from foreign groups. Primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in Holland adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in Edinburgh. Their findings are the first evidence that chimpanzees can learn calls referring to specific foods or objects. Many scientists have assumed that one of the defining features of human language is that objects and events can be named with different words or symbols depending on the culture. the researchers, whose findings are published in the journal of Current Biology, watched a group of adult chimpanzees from Beekse Bergen Safari Park in the Netherlands were moved to join a group of chimpanzees in Edinburgh Zoo. By analysing the acoustic structures of the calls they produced for apples, they found that the two groups of animals had different calls for the fruit before they were put together in 2010. While the Dutch chimps used high pitched grunts the Edinburgh chimps used far lower and softer sounds. After a year of integration, the grunt calls for apple were still different, but after three years the calls produced by the Dutch chimpanzees had changed to match those produced by those from Edinburgh. She said: 'The chimpanzees, to a limit, were willing to travel farther to obtain the more-preferred grapes. 'Future studies should test whether chimpanzees would be willing to exert more effort for more-preferred rewards if the type of effort was different - for example, time to process the food or increased competition to negotiate.' Dr Hopper and her colleagues, whose research is published in the journal Peerj, gave a group of six captive-born chimpanzees at Lincoln Park Zoo rewards in exchange for small lengths of PVC pipe that the apes had to collect from a single location. The chimps could exchange these 'tokens' at one of two locations - a close by one that gave them a carrot reward or one further away that gave them a grape. In a previous study Dr Hopper and her team had shown that the chimps preferred grapes to the carrots. Over the course of 15 months the researchers changed the locations of the food to see how the chimps would react. They found that over time the chimps would travel further to collect the grapes in preference over the carrots. Their behaviour could be seen as surprising in the context of wild chimpanzees where animals will often have to take food where they can find it. Dr Hopper said: 'It was quite fascinating to see the developments between each of the three phases of the token exchange study. 'In addition to learning about food preferences and proximity, we also observed innovative, problem-solving behavior among the chimpanzees.' The first chimpanzee to discover the grapes at the far location was a low-status female called Chuckie. Dr Hopper said that it is possible she began foraging in the further location because it was an opportunity to avoid competition from higher-status chimpanzees. The chimpanzees in the study preferred grapes to less exciting carrots, much like this chimp at Taronga Zoo . Chimpanzees, like the one above, are our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom and their behaviour can help to shed light on our evolutionary past, such as how the human diet has changed over time . She added that the findings could also help zoos improve the way they care for chimps. She said: 'In captivity, primates are provisioned with food by human caretakers and so have reduced choice over the options available to them. 'Unlike wild primates that spend a large proportion of their waking hours foraging for food, captive primates are typically fed following a regular schedule. 'This study was not only of academic interest but also created novel foraging enrichment for this group of chimpanzees and encouraged them to explore their environment to find the best possible foods.'","Biologists at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago offered chimps carrots or grapes .

"A New Jersey escort was buried during a graveside funeral Thursday, nearly five years after her disappearance led to the discovery of 10 victims of a suspected serial killer on Long Island. Despite police pronouncements that the deaths of the 10 people — eight women, a man and a child — are unrelated to the Shannan Gilbert case, her mother and the family's attorney repeated their assertions after the funeral that she was the 11th victim in the unsolved mystery. 'Absolutely, there's no question in my mind: I do believe that it is all connected,' Mari Gilbert told reporters just steps from where her daughter's service was held. Mystery: The disappearance of Shannan Gilbert, a sex worker from New Jersey, tipped off a massive, years-long investigation into the deaths of at least 10 others found dumped at Long Island's Gilgo Beach . Sad: Mari Gilbert prays over the coffin of her daughter, Shannan Gilbett on Thursday in Amityville, New York nearly five years after she went missing . The remains of Shannan Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, were located near a beach highway in December 2011, more than 18 months after she was last seen screaming while fleeing a customer's home in the isolated Oak Beach community on the south shore of Long Island. Police said she ran into a nearly inaccessible marshland and likely drowned; the Suffolk County medical examiner has said the cause of death is undetermined. The 10 victims were found at least three miles west of where officials found Gilbert in the marsh near the Great South Bay. Investigators believe a possible serial killer — perhaps more than one — is responsible for those bodies. Police have not commented in recent years on any aspects of the investigation, saying they would issue a statement only when there were noteworthy developments. No suspects have been publicly identified. Finally laid to rest: Gilbert's body remained at the Suffolk County medical examiner's office for more than three years because the family was unable to pay for a funeral, attorney John Ray said. Area funeral directors donated their services, and the Amityville Cemetery donated a burial plot for the woman's interment . Gilbert's body remained at the Suffolk County medical examiner's office for more than three years because the family was unable to pay for a funeral, attorney John Ray said. Area funeral directors donated their services, and the Amityville Cemetery donated a burial plot for the woman's interment. A K-9 officer and his cadaver dog were on a training mission searching for Gilbert when they happened upon what would become 10 sets of human remains strewn along several miles of thicket adjacent to the Ocean Parkway. Police have said all the victims are somehow linked to the sex trade and that the toddler was the child of one of the sex workers. The family's attorney said Thursday that an independent autopsy was recently performed by noted pathologist Dr. Michael Baden. Baden said Thursday his examination would take some time. Ray said he was perplexed over why police have not contacted him to discuss the results of his own investigation into Gilbert's death. Police did not respond to requests for comment Thursday from The Associated Press. 'Honestly, I don't know why they're taking this tack,' Ray said.

Gilbert was a Jersey City, N.J., prostitute whose disappearance in 2010 led to the discovery of 10 sets of human remains along a Long Island, N.Y., beach highway.

"NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams had pitched to NBC and CBS about making him the next late-night show host before he was busted for falsifying stories. Williams, 55, is currently suspended from NBC without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina, among others. But prior to the suspension he had agreed to a five-year anchor deal with Nightly News after being persuaded into it with a gift of veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old desk. Brian Williams agreed to a five-year contract after being persuaded by NBC News President Deborah Turness, who gifted him with veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old writing desk . And few years ago, Williams told NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke that he wanted to take over the Tonight Show from Jay Leno. Burke turned down Williams's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called Rock Center, which Williams hoped could evolve into a variety show. Instead, the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and it was canceled after two seasons, according to New York Magazine. Williams pushed on, however, and went to CBS CEO Les Moonves to suggest succeeding David Letterman. Moonves wasn't interested, sources told New York Magazine. Williams then had to be convinced through lengthy negotiations to become a news anchor by NBC News president Deborah Turness. Though they first clashed - because Williams was used to having the final say over a show's content - the pair eventually warmed to one another. Brian Williams suggested succeeding both Jay Leno (left) and David Letterman (right). CEOs from NBC and CBS turned down his offers . Williams sent Turness a note over the holidays that read, '2015 is going to be our year together', according to New York Magazine. He went on to agree to a new five-year anchor deal, during the same dinner Turness presented him with Murrow's old writing desk. She had found the 1940s desk through a Los Angeles-based antique dealer. And less than two months later, Williams was publicly shamed for a backlog of fictional stories and executives struggled with how to deal with the situation. This comes just after speculations that Katie Couric might be is in talks NBC's incoming chairman Andrew Lack to make a return by replacing Williams on the Nightly News. 'It makes sense (that she could come back) because she is so closely associated with the brand,' a source told the New York Daily News. Lack 'has not made up his mind' as to whether or not Williams will return when his six-month suspension is up, according to New York Magazine's sources. A 'close friend' of Williams said the the magazine, however, that the anchor 'can't wait until he can speak', which he can't do publicly until his suspension ends.","Williams was turned down by both NBC Universal CEO and CBS CEO .

"The brother of MP Simon Danczuk’s wife Karen was re-arrested yesterday after two more women accused him of sexually abusing them. Police confirmed that Michael Burke, 36, was being questioned last night on suspicion of historic sexual offences a month after complaints from Mrs Danczuk led to his first arrest. The divorced father of three, a security guard, was held and taken to a Manchester police station yesterday morning after ‘new information came to light’. Police confirmed that Michael Burke (left), 36, was being questioned last night on suspicion of historic sexual offences a month after complaints from Karen Danczuk (right) led to his first arrest . Mrs Danczuk – who has become well-known for posting revealing pictures of herself on Twitter – claimed she was raped by a family member ‘hundreds of times’ between the ages of six and 12. She did not name her attacker initially, but Mr Burke was later arrested. Last week he denied the claims, saying: ‘The allegations are false. I’m just so shocked and disgusted by it all.’ Her husband Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has been a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes . In February Mrs Danczuk said: ‘I was raped and abused by a paedophile for years and years. And for years afterwards I felt worthless, guilty, as though I had somehow brought this on myself. But I was just a little girl. ‘I was on anti-depressants for years and wanted to kill myself. But my husband Simon encouraged me to have therapy and now – after intensive counselling – I have been able to get some confidence back.’ The 31-year-old says she was on anti-depressants for two decades, self-harming and attempting suicide in 2007. Mrs Danczuk said she starting posting ‘selfies’ because she can now ‘have fun without being ashamed of myself’. Her husband Simon, Labour MP for Rochdale since 2010, has been a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: ‘A man has been rearrested on suspicion of historic sexual offences. ‘This relates to officers speaking to a woman on February 16, 2015, regarding historic sexual abuse and new information coming to light. He remains in police custody for questioning.’ It is not known when the fresh offences are alleged to have taken place. But Greater Manchester Police were already investigating Mr Burke over claims that he sexually abused his sister between 1989 and 1995.

"Today show star Lisa Wilkinson has laughed off the controversy surrounding Natarsha Belling's jacket, saying she has the same item in her wardrobe. The jacket worn by Belling, complete with its phallic-shaped neckline, created an online frenzy after the Network 10 presenter appeared on-air wearing it. Wilkinson, apparently not put-off by the controversy, said she plans to wear her jacket tomorrow and called on other TV hosts to do the same. Scroll down for video . Today show star Lisa Wilkinson has laughed off the controversy surrounding Natarsha Belling's jacket, saying she has the same item in her wardrobe . Wilkinson, apparently not put-off by the controversy, said she plans to wear her jacket tomorrow and called on other TV hosts to do the same . Wilkinson, who is no stranger to experimenting with her on-air wardrobe, said all TV hosts should wear the jacket if they have one . 'The #p***sjacket! REALLY? Calling all TVhosts who have this jacket to wear it on air tomorrow. I will! #geez,' Wilkinson tweeted to her 125,000 followers. The jacket, designed by Australian label Scanlan Theodore, was previously worn by Channel Seven’s Melissa Doyle in a fetching cream shade. And the ‘Crepe Knit Double Peplum Jacket’, costing $550 is still available to buy on Scanlan Theodore’s website, after Doyle wore the design five days ago. However, Nine News Brisbane reporter Eva Milic appears to be the original trendsetter, wearing a maroon jacket with the much talked about neckline, clinched at the waist by a belt, back in May. Belling’s green jacket went viral after she wore it to present Network Ten's Eyewitness News and a photo of the outfit was then liked over 110,000 times on Facebook after the website Unilad posted the caption ‘once you see it, you cannot unsee it’.

Channel Seven’s Melissa Doyle previously wore the Scanlan Theodore jacket in a fetching cream shade . The image has also been shared over 7,000 times as the comments over Belling’s outfit rage on. But phallic looking necklines are nothing new, as a 2010 photo of the ABC's Leigh Sales in a more extreme black number shows, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Sales wore the cut out top while presenting Lateline and an eagle-eyed viewer uploaded a video of the clip to YouTube with the crude caption: 'ABC Lateline newsreader Leigh Sales wears a penis.' The bemusement and fascination with Belling's top appears to stem from the fact when you first look at the photo it’s hard to notice anything – but once the neckline’s shape is pointed out it’s hard to 'unsee' it. Nine News Brisbane reporter Eva Milic appears to be the original trendsetter, wearing a maroon jacket  back in May 2014 .

And Lourens Odendaal realised: ‘Ooo that’s what it was… now I get it.’ Meanwhile, on Reddit, one commentator mused: ‘I thought it was because her microphone looks like the claw of a monster about to burst from her chest.’ American anchor Dion Lim showed her support for Belling with the hashtag #anchorproblems .

"A preliminary report detailing actor Harrison Ford's actions just seconds before he crash-landed his 1940s vintage plane on to a California golf course was today released by federal transport officials. The document, issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, describes how the 72-year-old actor reported an engine failure shortly after taking off from Santa Monica  Airport last Thursday. He then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground. The plane - which came to rest around 800 feet from the approach end of a runway at the airport -sustained 'substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage' in the smash,  the document states.

However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground . Meanwhile, Ford, who played Han Solo in the original Star Wars series, suffered serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. However, he is expected to make a full recovery. The preliminary report explains how the actor was flying his World War II-era training plane under visual flight rules on the day of the crash. This meant he did not need to submit a flight plan. It added that 'visual meteorological conditions prevailed', but that following the aircraft's takeoff from runway 21, 'the pilot advised of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport'. Ford 'initiated a left turn back towards the airport; the airplane subsequently struck the top of a tall tree prior to impacting the ground in an open area of a golf course,' the report states. It concludes: 'The airplane was recovered to a secure location for further examination.' The report was constructed 'using data from various sources' after 'a significant amount of investigative work'. It does not detail why Ford's engine might have failed, causing him to plummet to the ground. A final report is expected to be released when NTSB officials have finished their inquiry into the crash.

Above, his wife, Calista Flockhart, is seen on Tuesday driving home from hospital after spending the entire day with him . Recovery: Ford is being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (pictured) in Los Angeles, California . Last week, dramatic pictures emerged showing Ford being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher, his face covered in blood and his neck strapped into a brace. First responders were also pictured wrapping bandages around his head. 'He was stunned a bit,' spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana, who was playing golf at the course at the time, told ABC News. He added: 'He was moaning and in pain. It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious.' A video also emerged showing horrified golfers gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way as Ford deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground.

Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, remains in hospital recovering from the crash. His wife, Calista Flockhart has stayed close to his side. The 50-year-old actress emerged on Friday night appearing tired and emotionally drained following a bedside vigil that lasted several hours. Flockhart was seen at the wheel of a black Lexus pulling out of the hospital parking garage with an older male companion. The former Ally McBeal star looked like she hadn't slept in a while. Her face was make-up free, while her eyes were dark-circled and bleary from possible crying. Her light brown hair hung limply around her face and her manner of dress appeared simple and casual. Couple: Earlier this week, it was said Flockhart is strongly urging her husband (pictured with her in January) to call it quits on his passion for flying and stay grounded because he might not be so fortunate next time .

'Calista is devastated. Thank goodness Harrison is OK but it could have been much, much worse,' her friend told The Mirror. 'It is a worry for her and his children that he has this dangerous hobby.' They added: 'Whether or not he will pilot a plane again remains to be seen but everyone around him certainly hopes he will take a break – or give it up for ever. It is ­obviously a huge worry.' Flockhart is not the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend. Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher has also urged him to 'take a break' following his plane crash and take it easy, it is said.

Tom Dahl (above), 85, from West Seattle has shared the frightening video taken from his driveway to warn neighbors of the new ways criminals are hacking into cars . The incident, which occurred last month, involved an unidentified 'key fob' to unlock the vehicle, Detective Patrick Michaud from the Seattle Police Department told Daily Mail Online. Detective Michaud said police received reports of the break in on February 14 at 3am, and that the man seen in the video has not been arrested. The man reportedly searched the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment and took a club that was on his steering wheel, as well as a few store rewards cards that were left in the car, Daily Mail Online was told. While he is lucky that the car did not contain anything of value, Mr Dahl said he is concerned with how easy it was for the man to get into his car, according to Fox 13. 'You used to have a wire that you slid down the window, when it was mechanical. But now it's electronic,' said Mr Dahl. The man approaches Mr Dahl's car and pulls the handles realizing the door is locked . He then removes his backpack and flashes a light into the car . The man holds the backpack up the door and within seconds it is unlocked . He gets into the vehicle and searches through the contents of Mr Dahl's glove compartment taking a club on the steering wheel as well as store rewards cards . Another victim of attempted car theft in January, Lars Carlson, said a thief used the same tactic when breaking into his car, according to an earlier report. Mr Carlson had his car broken into two times before he installed a surveillance camera at his home. 'It's running through codes automatically or it's a button they're pushing or something is happening, but whatever it does it seems to trick the car into thinking he's got the legitimate keys,' Mr Carlson said at the time of the incident. While he is lucky that the car did not contain anything of value, Mr Dahl said he is concerned with how easy it was for the man to get into his car (above Mr Dahl's Honda Ridgeline pictured in his driveway) Captain Eric Sano from the police department said that it is apparent as technology adapts, criminals are adapting, so it is important for authorities to be ahead of criminals. Scott Wagner, a special agent from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, said in January that he had knowledge of a special system being used. He said: 'It’s a little black box. They can carry it in a backpack, when you hit your fob to unlock your car they can actually steal the codes to your keypad and then unlock your car later.' Detective Michaud said there has not been a lot of similarly reported cases in the area over the years and that he is unsure of what kind of device is being used in the break ins. Another victim of attempted car theft in January, Lars Carlson (above), said a thief used the same tactic when breaking into his car . Mr Carlson said: 'Whatever it does it seems to trick the car into thinking he's got the legitimate keys' (above a thief breaking into his car earlier this year) 'I've seen it both ways - a device in their hand as well as a device as big as an iron carried in a backpack,' he said. 'As technology moves on, the device gets smaller.' As for how to stay protected as a driver as this mystery device looms, Detective Michaud warns drivers to keep valuables out of the car. He said: 'We ask that people to not keep anything of value in the car. If you are going to leave your registration in the vehicle cross off identifying information, and let the officer know you crossed it off for security concerns.' The investigation into the incident is ongoing.","Tom Dahl, 85, from Seattle has shared frightening video taken from his driveway to warn neighbors of new tactics used to hack into cars .

"Two Michigan police officers have been applauded for their kindness after buying a child car seat for a hard-up couple rather than issuing them a ticket. Officers Jason Pavlige, 32, and James Hodges, 26, of Fruitport Township, Michigan responded to a call made by a McDonald's worker who was concerned that a baby was not properly secured in a car seat when her parents picked up some food from the restaurant. When the officers stopped the couple's car, they found the 10-month-old girl sitting in her mother's lap while her father drove the vehicle. The couple, who have not been identified, explained that they did not have the means to buy a seat. Scroll down for video . Above and beyond: Fruitport Township Officers James Hodges, left, and Jason Pavlige, right, bought a car seat for a couple's daughter rather than issuing them a ticket for failing to have her properly secured . 'They had just recently moved to the area,' Hodges told ABC News. 'We tried to have them contact family but they don't have anyone close. There were no co-workers, no one who could help them out.' Rather than giving the couple a ticket, the officers decided on a different tact. 'We spoke with each other and made the decision to go get them a car seat so we'd know the kid was safe and that this issue wouldn't come up again,' Hodges said. The two men pooled their money and, while Pavlige stayed with the family, Hodges went to a local Walmart to buy a new car seat for the baby. They installed the seat and showed the shocked couple how to use it. Quick-thinking: After learning the family could not afford a car seat for their child, the two officers pooled their money and went to this Walmart to buy a new seat before installing it for the shocked couple . 'They didn't say much but were just very appreciative,' Hodges said. The two officers didn't tell anyone about their good deed, which they carried out in February, but it came to light after a Walmart employee called the police station to let their superiors know. But the men said they were simply doing their jobs. 'We made the decision that was what we needed to do to solve the issue,' Hodges said. 'It's just part of what police officers do on a daily basis.' In a letter to the officers, Public Safety Director Ken Doctor thanked the men for their actions, Mlive reported.

"Promising at the altar to have and to hold your loved one, in sickness and in health, may seem like a straightforward pledge. But for men, some elements of the vow can prove easier to keep than others. A study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill. The researchers said their results indicate that some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse. A study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill and researchers said their results indicate that some men simply cannot cope with a poorly spouse . After tracking 2,700 couples in the US from 1992 to 2010, the American team found that divorce levels were roughly the same between healthy couples and those in which the husband suffered sickness. But when disease hit the wife, the likelihood of divorce rose. Every two years the researchers interviewed the couples and asked whether either of them had been ill since their last session. Over the 18 years, 859 marriages ended in divorce, 32 per cent of the sample group. For 24 per cent of the couples, tragedy struck when one spouse died, and 44 per cent were still going strong by the time the study ended. But among the 965 couples in which the woman got sick, the rate of divorce was 6 per cent higher. Lead author Amelia Karraker, assistant professor in family studies at Iowa State University, said illness can add stress to a marriage because men may not be as attuned to taking on a caregiver role as women. ‘There is a difference between feeling too sick to make dinner and needing someone to actually feed you,’ she said. ‘That’s something that can really change the dynamics within a marriage. If your spouse is too sick to work, we know that financial strain is a major predictor of divorce.’ Dr Karraker said wives may also become dissatisfied with their husbands’ ability to look after them. She added: ‘Life or death experiences may cause people to re-evaluate what is important in their lives. ‘It could be that women are saying, “You’re doing a bad job of caring for me or I wasn’t happy with the relationship to begin with, and I’d rather be alone than in a bad marriage.”’ The research was published in the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour.","The study monitored 2,700 couples in the US from 1992 to 2010 .

"Police in the San Francisco Bay area are searching for a 30-year-old physical therapist who was kidnapped on Monday morning and is now being held for a ransom. According to a press conference on Tuesday given by Vallejo police officers, Denise Huskins was forcibly abducted against her will from her boyfriend's home. Her captor or captors also made off with a white Toyota Camry from the home that is registered to her boyfriend. The car was recovered hours afterwards at an undisclosed location miles away from the scene. The car and the home are both registered to Aaron Quinn who neighbors confirmed lives with Huskins in the two-story yellow home on Kirkland Avenue. The Daily Mail Online could not reach him for comment. Police Lt. Kenny Park said that police were first contacted at 1.55pm - hours after her alleged abduction - by her 30-year-old boyfriend who  was in the house at the time of the assault. Park would not comment on why Quinn appeared to wait so long before contacting them and added that the he is not in custody but that he is helping them 'piece the puzzle together.' Scroll down for video . Appeal: Police in Vallejo have asked the public for any help in locating physical therapist Denise Huskins who they believe has been kidnapped and held for ransom. They have issued the picture of her (left) and her Toyota Camry (right) which was recovered away from her home on Monday evening . Arrival: Denise (on the right) moved to Vallejo in June 2014 and began working at Kaiser Hospital and was previously a physical therapist at Southern California Orthopedic Institute . At the press conference Park did not say how the ransom was communicated nor how much is being demanded. Park also said he did not believe the house had been robbed according to the Sacramento Bee. 'We are concerned for Ms. Huskins' well-being,' said Lt. Kenny Park during the afternoon press conference . 'At this moment, Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom,' 'We have dedicated all our resources, and we are giving it full, undivided attention until we can locate Ms. Huskins and secure her safe return.' Search crews and dogs are combing the marsh lands of nearby Mare Island for Huskins. According to family Huskins works at Kaiser Hospital with her boyfriend and her father said he was stunned by the crime. 'This is overwhelming to me,' said Michael Huskins to CBS. 'I don't understand it. That's the hard part. I just don't understand what's going on.' 'If she sees this, I want her to know, that the family is there, we love her and we're not giving up,' he said. Home: Denise Huskins was taken against her will from her home on Kirkland Avenue (pictured) early on Monday morning . Police described her as 5 feet 7 inches tall, 150 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. Suspicion had earlier fallen on a local peeping Tom who lived in the area recently, who had been spotted crawling on people's roofs. He has apparently moved away according to neighbors who spoke to ABC News. According to her Facebook page, Huskins works at Kaiser Hospital and Vallejo Police Department has called in help from the FBI and the Solano County Offie of Emergency Services. Officers released pictures of Huskins' boyfriend's car and asked for anyone who may have seen the vehicle during Monday afternoon or evening to contact them. Desperate search: Police would not say what the ransom was for Denise (left and second right with her mother) nor how they knew she had been abducted . Indeed, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, police have been unusually tight lipped about the incident. Once they received the report about the abduction, the alert was not sent over police radio but rather sent by phone between dispatchers and officers. This suggests her kidnapper is listening into police radio broadcasts. Huskins previously worked at a Southern California orthopedic institute and arrived in Vallejo in June 2014. Anyone with information on this case is asked to contact the Vallejo Police Department at 707-648-4524.","Denise Huskins was taken from her boyfriend's Vallejo home early on Monday morning .

"Experts have long speculated that prehistoric tools were used to help early hunters kill and butcher animals but evidence to back up these claims has been lacking - until now. Researchers analysing elephant remains in Israel have discovered signs of animal residue on primitive tools called 'handaxes and scrapers' alongside cut marks in the remains themselves. And by replicating the flint tools for a modern butchering experiment they said the 'handaxe was prehistoric man's 'Swiss army knife' - capable of breaking down bone, sinew and hide. Researchers analysing elephant remains (rib pictured) in Israel have discovered signs of animal residue on primitive tools called 'handaxes and scrapers' alongside cut marks in the remains themselves. This analysis is said to be the first time proof of prehistoric butchery has been scientifically verified . The slimmer, more delicate scraper was then used to separate fur and animal fat from muscle tissue. The tools and remains were discovered at a Lower Paleolithic site in Revadim, Israel, by Professor Ran Barkai, Natasha Solodenko and Andrea Zupanchich from Tel Aviv University's Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Cultures. The team used a process called 'use-wear analysis' which involves examining the surfaces and edges of the tools to determine their function. The researchers studied three tools found in the Revadim quarry in Israel - a flake, biface or 'handaxe' and scraper. No use-traces or identifiable residue was found on the flake. The biface and scraper both revealed 'well preserved and clear use-wear traces'. The biface use traces indicate the processing of 'medium-hard material' believed to be evidence of hide scraping. The scraper instead featured traces of 'soft or medium material'. This is believed to be animal tissue. Both tools showed residue of adipocere, or animal fat and on the scraper, both tissues and vegetable residues were found. It also used so-called Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) residue analysis to identify organic residue. FTIR uses infrared to identify bio-signatures of prehistoric compounds. From this, the researchers were able to demonstrate for the first time direct proof of animal exploitation by flint tools. 'There are three parts to this puzzle: the expansion of the human brain, the shift to meat consumption, and the ability to develop sophisticated technology to meet the new biological demands,' Professor Barkai said. 'The invention of stone technology was a major breakthrough in human evolution.' Fracturing rocks in order to butcher and cut animal meat is said to represent a key biological and cultural milestone. 'At the Revadim quarry we found butchered animal remains, including an elephant rib bone which had been neatly cut by a stone tool, alongside flint handaxes and scrapers still retaining animal fat,' continued Professor Barkai. 'It became clear from further analyses that butchering and carcass processing indeed took place at this site.' The tools and remains were discovered at a Lower Paleolithic site in Revadim, Israel (marked). The team used 'use-wear analysis' to examine the surfaces and edges of the tools. It also used so-called Fourier Transform fraRed (FTIR) residue analysis to identify organic residue .

The experts said the 'handaxe' was the equivalent to a prehistoric 'Swiss army knife' (stock image) - capable of breaking down bone, sinew and hide . The paper said the tools would have also been used to process hides. Prehistoric peoples made use of all parts of the animal. In the case of the elephant, for example, they would have needed to use both tools to manage such a challenging task. 'The knowledge of how to make these tools was precious, and must have been passed along from generation to generation, because these tools were reproduced the same way across great territorial expanses and over hundreds of thousands of years,' said Professor Barkai. 'In this thousand-piece puzzle called archaeology, sometimes we find pieces that connect other pieces together. 'This is what we have found with the stone tools and animal bones.' The research, published in Plos One, was done in collaboration with Dr Stella Ninziante Cesaro and Dr Cristina Lemorini of La Sapienza, University of Rome, and Dr Ofer Marder of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

"Michael Douglas has revealed that his teen son Dylan was the victim of anti-Semitism on a family holiday last year. The 70-year-old actor found himself forced to confront his son's abuser after the 14-year-old came to him in tears. In an Op-Ed piece in the Los Angeles Times Douglas explained how he told his child: 'Dylan, you just had your first taste of anti-Semitism.' Scroll down for video . Targeted: Michael Douglas with son Dylan, daughter Carys and wife Catherine Zeta-Jones in December; Dylan was targeted for wearing a Star Of David necklace on a family vacation earlier in the year . Targeted: Douglas wrote that his son Dylan was harassed at a hotel pool by a man who saw him wearing a Star of David necklace. The father and son pictured during a visit to Israel's city of David last year . Michael explained that the teen was visibly upset when he came to his father in the family's hotel room, following a visit to the hotel swimming pool in Southern Europe. Being the father of a teenager, Douglas asked if the boy had provoked the man's anger by misbehaving, only to be met with his son's tears. It was then that The Game star caught sight of his son's Star of David necklace. He wrote: 'I had an awful realization of what might have caused the man's outrage... After calming him down, I went to the pool and asked the attendants to point out the man who had yelled at him. 'We talked. It was not a pleasant discussion. Afterward, I sat down with my son and said: ""Dylan, you just had your first taste of anti-Semitism.""' Defending his faith: Douglas explained that like his childhood, his son Dylan is growing up with a father who is Jewish, but a mother - the actor's wife Catherine Zeta-Jones (L) - who is not . 'Like a disease' The actor compared anti-Semitism to a disease that flares up for reasons such as bad economic times, demographics, and an irrational and misplaced fear of Israel. The Douglas family pictured above at Catherine Zeta-Jones' investiture at Buckingham palace in 2011. From left: Michael Douglas, daughter Carys, son Dylan and Zeta-Jones . His son had already faced his share of hardships, as Michael shared in 2010 that the family - wife Catherine Zeta-Jones and daughter Carys - would be moving from Bermuda to New York so that Dylan could attend a special school to attend to his needs. The Star of David is a symbol of the Jewish faith, made out of two overlapping triangles. The hexagram was never a uniquely Jewish symbol but became a widespread sign of the faith when it was chosen for the flag of the First Zionist Congress in 1897 and later the state of Israel. The Star of David is often worn by Jewish believers in the same way Christians wear necklaces with the cross. Michael was not raised in the Jewish faith for although his father Kirk Douglas is Jewish, his mother Diana is not. However his son's growing interest in Judaism led Michael to explore his father's faith later in life. He told of the first time he had to defend his faith, when a high school friend casually commented: 'all Jews cheat in business.' 'Anti-Semitism, I've seen, is like a disease that goes dormant, flaring up with the next political trigger,' he continued. The Oscar winner cited bad economic times, demographics, and an irrational and misplaced fear of Israel as reasons for a resurgence in anti-Semitism. However, he isn't content to just accept such circumstances, commenting that he hopes his son will never have to teach his children about it the way he just had to. He issued a call to action for people to fight back against such feelings of hate, saying: 'So that is our challenge in 2015, and all of us must take it up.' 'Because if we confront anti-Semitism whenever we see it, if we combat it individually and as a society, and use whatever platform we have to denounce it, we can stop the spread of this madness.'","The actor described anti-Semitic attack against his 15-year-old son in op-ed .

"Sneaky tactics used by airlines, banks and insurance companies to trick millions of customers into buying extra insurance could soon be outlawed. The City watchdog has said it wants to ban companies from ‘opt out’ selling – where customers have to untick a box in the small print if they want to avoid buying an add-on insurance policy. In a damning report, the Financial Conduct Authority said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need. The Financial Conduct Authority said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need . Those that fall into the trap - whether they are buying a concert ticket or paying for car insurance - are more likely to buy inappropriate products, or receive poor value for money. The FCA estimates the scam is costing customers more than £108 million a year in overpayments. The market for such products - including identity theft protection, home insurance and breakdown cover – is worth an estimated £1billion a year to the insurance industry. They are typically sold alongside insurance such as travel, car and home cover. But just under a fifth of customers are not even aware they have them, according to the FCA. The sale of add-on products has already given rise to the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, where millions of customers were sold policies they did not want or need alongside loans or credit cards. High street banks and other lenders have paid out £18billion in compensation so far – making it the most expensive mis-selling scandal in UK history. The sneaky tactics are used by airlines and banks with products - including identity theft protection, home insurance and breakdown cover -  typically sold alongside travel and car insurance and home cover . Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA said: ‘This is about ensuring consumers can make the right decision on what add-on insurance they do or don’t need. Forgetting to untick a box at the end of a purchase is not making an informed choice.’ Similar tactics are used by firms to barrage customers with junk mail and marketing. The ban would apply to add-on sales of all products alongside financial primary policies - meaning the insurance policy or loan that the customer intended to buy in the first place. Paying out: The FCA estimates the scam is costing customers more than £108 million a year in overpayments . Key examples include key cover sold alongside motor insurance, or protection cover when taking out a mortgage or credit card. The City watchdog also wants firms to inform customers about add-on policies earlier in the sales process – rather than just before they make the purchase - so they can make an informed choice and shop around. Existing rules are already meant to protect customers who are buying an add-on financial policy alongside a non financial product such as a plane ticket. The sale of insurance add-ons is hugely lucrative, with insurance companies making bumper profits. According to a separate study by the Competition and Markets Authority just 5pc of premiums collected from customers who take out personal injury insurance alongside motor insurance is paid out in claims. Hugh Savill, director of regulation at industry lobby group the Association of British Insurers said it supported the proposed ban. It said: ‘Although the use of pre-ticked boxes is not widespread, these proposals will encourage all firms to make sure their customers are provided with appropriate information at an early stage.’ The FCA said it will consult with consumer groups and financial companies on the proposed changes until June 25.","FCA says customers  tricked into buying products they do not want or need .

"Milovan Farronato, pictured outside court today, has been cleared of racially aggravated assault . A cross-dressing art curator accused of punching a manager at the Groucho Club and calling her a 'f***ing fat, Polish b****' has been cleared of racially aggravated assault. Milovan Farronato was alleged to have punched Agnieszka Sikorska when she refused him entry to the trendy central London nightclub because he wasn't a member. The 41-year-old Italian art curator denied the charge and was today acquitted at Westminster Crown Court after a one day hearing. Speaking afterwards he said he was 'delighted' the case had been settled. Ms Sikorska claimed she was left with a cut nose after being punched by Mr Farronato, who is the director of the Fiorucci Art Trust, on May 9 last year. The court was told the  41-year-old had tried to gain access to a section of the bar that had been reserved for members only when the incident occurred. He and some friends had earlier attended a party at the Soho nightclub when they tried to enter the restricted bar, the prosecution claimed. Mr Farronato denied her allegations, instead claiming he had been told to leave the exclusive nightclub because he was wearing women's clothes, full make-up and 12inch high heels. He admitted slapping the Polish manager as an act of 'instinctive' self-defence but denied racially abusing her beforehand. He also accepted possibly causing the cut on her nose with the 'thick' he was wearing at the time and said he told the woman she had 'terrible hair'. Passing sentence District Judge Tan Ikram said he could not be sure which party was telling the truth and so found the defendant not guilty. 'The prosecution called only one witness and what they are saying to me is that I can exclude the possibility that she wasn't telling the truth. 'They are saying that this woman had been working there for 10 years and she wouldn’t lie,' he said. 'I cannot do that in this case because I have inconsistent evidence and I think it is significant inconsistent evidence. 'What probably happened I would not like to say. Can I be sure it happened the way the Crown say it happened? The answer is no. 'Because I cannot be sure that you didn't act in self-defence I find you not guilty.' Speaking after the hearing Mr Farronato said he was relieved to have been acquitted. Self-defence: The art curator says he was discriminated against because he was wearing women's clothing . 'I’m delighted, it’s been a very difficult day for me. 'This sort of thing has never happened to me before - thank God it’s over. 'I was confident that what I was saying was real and this was reflected but I couldn't be sure I would be believed.' The Groucho Club - named after Groucho Marx - was founded in the 1980s as an alternative to London's traditional gentlemen's clubs. It is known for the hell-raising behaviour of members including Lily Allen, Tracy Emin, Noel Gallagher, Stephen Fry and Rachel Weisz. Earlier Ms Sikorska wept as she claimed that Farronato punched her 'two or three times' on the nose after calling her a 'f****** Polish fat b****' during the 1am confrontation. She said that the curator and his friends were 'quite loud and noisy and not very nice to staff', so she asked them to leave but they said they had to get a drink of water first. After she again insisted that Farronato leave, she said, 'He grabbed my hair and there were two or three hits. I didn't know what was happening.' Ms Sikorska added: 'The next thing I remember I was behind the bar with two guys who were cleaning my face and putting a napkin with ice on it.' Ms Welsh asked: 'Were you able to see how the defendant hit you? Was it open or closed?' The witness replied: 'I think it was closed.' The court was shown a picture of Ms Sikorska's bloody nose and swollen eye following the attack. 'When I was a kid I lost my eye, so I already have got half of my face looking this way,' she said. 'After being attacked I have more scars and look worse than I already did.' Farronato, who appeared in court wearing red lipstick, eyeliner, a leather jacket decorated with hearts and high heels, said he felt 'discriminated' against because of the way he was dressed. Venue: The fight took place at the Groucho Club in Soho, known for members' hell-raising antics . He denied that he had asked where she was from or called her a 'fat b****', claiming that he slapped her in self-defence after she hit him when he insulted her hair. The defendant told the court: 'I said she had terrible hair since it was covering her face and that it was difficult to speak to her.' Asked what happened next, he said: 'She slapped me immediately just after I said that sentence, on my left cheek. I slapped her back in self-defence. It was an instinctive, defensive reaction just to say, ""Stop please, don't go further.""' Farronato accepted that he was responsible for the cut on the bridge of Ms Sikorska's nose, but claimed it had probably been caused by a large silver ring he was wearing. 'It is very thick - I was not targeting anything, I was just responding instinctively and probably the back of the ring touched her nose and because of that she was injured,' he said. The defendant said that he had had one glass of wine and two vodka tonics before the incident and accepted he was not entirely sober, but he denied that he lost his temper or that he had hit Ms Sikorska with a closed fist. 'I have never lost my temper in my life, I am a university professor and I get on well with people,' he told the court. Asked about his work, Farronato said he curates art exhibitions and lectures on art at a university in Venice.","Milovan Farronato, 41, was accused of racially abusing Agnieszka Sikorska .

Meet Smokey: the three-week-old orphan lamb who has been fostered by a Manhattan restaurant owner, and now spends his days enjoying the sights and sounds of the Big Apple, gaining fans wherever he goes. Sandy Dee Hall, 34, and his girlfriend Maxine Cher, 24, took Smokey into their care after they heard he been abandoned by his mother in the freezing fields of West Winfield's Violet Hill Farm, the same farm - ironically - which supplies Mr Hall's restaurant with pork. City lamb: Smokey (right) is a three-week-old orphaned lamb who is being fostered by New York City restaurant owner Sandy Dee Hall (right), and he's gaining fans everywhere he goes . According to The New York Post, Mr Hall had been inexplicably wanting to foster a baby sheep 'for a while', despite serving lamb shepherd's pie at his eatery, Black Tree. So when Mr Hall was contacted by his farmer about Smokey's plight, he jumped at the chance to bring the lamb home to his Manhattan apartment. 'That night I was supposed to go out, but I was like, ""Nope, I’m staying here. Forever”', he says. Smokey requires bottle feeding three times a day, and sleeps for around 14 hours. Mr Hall and Ms Cher, who also works at Black Tree, have scheduled their shifts so that someone is always home to care for the little lamb.

Smokey is not potty-trained, so the couple have lined their apartment floors with puppy training pads, and when they bathe him, they use Woolite to keep his coat from shrinking. Unsurprisingly, Smokey has attracted a great deal of admiration everywhere he's been taken, which includes a number of trendy New York restaurants.

Sadly for the doting pair, their fluffy little friend will have to leave them once he's weaned from the bottle. 'He’ll grow to be 140 pounds, and his hooves make a lot of noise,' Ms Cher explains. 'In a New York apartment, with neighbors, that just wouldn’t work.' Smokey is destined to return to Violet Hill Farm, but never to anyone's dinner plate. The couple plan to 'adopt' him so he won't be slaughtered. Mr Hall has now removed lamb dishes from his restaurant menu, and Ms Cher has reportedly 'sworn off mutton'.

"Streaming has topped CD sales in revenue for the first time in the United States as music listeners flock to on-demand services and Internet radio, industry figures showed. Data for 2014 showed a major shift to streaming as opposed to physical sales and permanent downloads, with rapid growth both for on-demand services such as Spotify and Rhapsody and Internet radio providers such as Pandora. Streaming revenue totaled $1.87 billion, edging out the $1.85 billion earned by CD sales, according to data of the Recording Industry Association of America. Scroll down for video .

Bjork has also refused to stream her latest album 'Vulnicura,' saying she felt uneasy giving out the emotionally intense work for free. Streaming helped stabilize the bottom line for the long-troubled industry, with overall revenue from recorded music going up two percent to $4.86 billion to mark the fourth year of growth. 'The industry continues to rapidly grow the share of revenues coming outside of traditional unit-based sales,' the association said in a report Wednesday. Whatever the bottom line, the growth of streaming has been controversial with numerous stars complaining that the revenue sent back to artists is paltry. Pop superstar Taylor Swift is the most vocal critic of streaming and last year pulled her catalog off Spotify, which offers free access. Bjork has also refused to stream her latest album 'Vulnicura,' saying she felt uneasy giving out the emotionally intense work for free. Spotify has hit back by describing itself as a rare source of growth in the music industry and has said it has distributed $2 billion back to artists over the past seven years. The US association said that CD sales fell by 12.7 percent last year. But some of the strongest growth in the industry was in vinyl, which has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years among collectors. A timeline of Spotify accomplishments on a wall at the entrance to the company headquarters in Stockholm. The Swedish startup that revolutionised digital music is a major player in the streaming world - which has now overtaken CD sales. Revenue from vinyl albums and EPs jumped by 50 percent, although the total of $315 million was still a fraction of the market for CDs or digital formats. Despite the sharp growth of streaming, permanent digital downloads on services such as iTunes remained the largest overall category for revenue. The United States is the world's largest music market. Format tastes have significant differences around the world, with CDs still dominating Japan but streaming taking off in Scandinavia.","Streaming revenue totaled $1.87 billion, CD sales earned $1.85 billion .

"Poor olive harvests last year may mean a shortage of olive oil. Dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker offers some alternatives: . Poor olive harvests last year may mean a shortage of olive oil - so here are some alternatives . Best to roast veg: Rapeseed . Rapeseed oil has 6 per cent saturated fat compared with olive oil's 14.3 per cent. It also has ten times the amount of omega-3 fatty acids and 50 per cent more vitamin E. EXPERT VERDICT: One of the healthiest oils, with a subtle, grassy taste. One concern with heating oil is how soon it starts to smoke. This is when the fatty acids in it oxidise, creating harmful free radicals. Rapeseed oil has a high smoke point, so use for frying or roasting. Best in risotto: Rice bran . Taken from the bran (the vitamin-rich layer below the fibrous hull of rice) and germ (the oily, nutrient-rich part of a rice grain). High in protective antioxidants such as vitamin E. EXPERT VERDICT: As well as heart healthy vitamin E, this contains ferulic acid, which has powerful anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory effects, helping to protect the immune system and prevent disease. Coconut oil makes great stir-fries . Best in stir-fries: Coconut . Extracted from the white flesh of coconuts, this is almost 50 per cent lauric acid, a 'healthier' saturated fatty acid. Solid at room temperature, so can't be used for salad dressings, but its high smoke point makes it ideal for cooking. EXPERT VERDICT: Though it's 86.5 per cent saturated fat, research suggests the saturated fat in coconut may be used up more quickly by the body and is less likely to be stored as body fat. However, use in moderation. Best on salad: Walnut . With useful amounts of fatty acids, walnut oil may help lower heart disease risk. A distinct walnut flavour and low smoke point, so best for dressings. EXPERT VERDICT: Delicious, but not particularly versatile. Buy small bottles and keep in a cool, dark place as it goes rancid easily. Best for baking: Hemp seed . Richer in the essential fatty acids omega-3, 6 and 9 than other culinary oils, and has half the saturated fat of olive oil. One tablespoon provides 94 per cent of your daily recommended intake of omega-3s. EXPERT VERDICT: Versatile - can be used for stir-frying, dipping and salad dressing. One of the healthiest alternatives to olive oil, though the flavour may not be to everyone's taste. Disguise with dried fruit and spices. Rapeseed oil (l), walnut oil (c) and hemp seed oil (r) are all good for different dishes .","Dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker offers some alternatives to olive oil .

"The Chinese are famed for the ancient art of noodle making. But this giant wok of ‘dragon beard’ noodles, made for 2,000 people at a temple in Henan province in central China, took it to the next level. The temple put on the incredible feast in celebration of ‘Dragon Head Raising Day’, which is marked across the country by various traditions that have been passed on down the years, reported the People's Daily Online. Everybody tuck in: The temple in Henan province offered up 'dragon beard' noodles for 2,000 people . Wait your turn: It is considered good luck to eat food named after body parts of the dragon - including 'dragon beard' noodles, 'dragon's ears' dumplings and 'dragon's scales' pancakes . Don't eat it all at once! The noodles are extraordinarily fine and made by hand, while symbolising longevity . Legend has it that on this day the dragon, an important symbol in Chinese culture, will awaken and bring rain to produce a bumper harvest. It is considered good luck to eat foods that are named after body parts of the dragon, including ‘dragon beard’ noodles, ‘dragon’s ears’ dumplings and ‘dragon’s scales’ pancakes. Earlier this month, chefs at the White Dragon Temple in Fucheng village used four massive woks to cook noodles for visitors that came from miles around to pray for good fortune and prosperity. Amazingly, all the food was gone within an hour. The feast on ‘Dragon Head Raising Day’, celebrated on the second day of the second lunar month, is particularly significant because it is believed to ward off diseases. The ‘dragon beard’ noodles are extraordinarily fine and made by hand. They symbolise longevity, which is why it is unlucky to cut them when you are eating. Just three pounds of wheat flour can be made into 144,000 hair-like noodles, according to experts. When the noodles are made, one rope of dough is stretched up to 12 times to produce thousands of strands. It is reported that some masters of the art are able to make noodles so fine that one strand can be threaded through the eye of a needle. Feast your eyes on this: The White Dragon Temple in Fucheng village used four massive woks to cook . Me first! The feast is seen as particularly significant as it's believed to ward off diseasses . Are there any leftovers? It's hard to believe, but the villagers look like they successfully polished off the giant woks' worth of noodles .","Enormous woks fed 2,000 people on 'Dragon Head Raising Day'

"A couple who were brought together by their mums' cancer diagnosis, have revealed they tied the knot just days before the bride's mother died. Kirsty Summers, 27, met her husband, Darren Summers, 34, through a cancer support forum. As they chatted, they discovered they only lived three miles away from each other in Lincoln and their mothers both suffered from inflammatory breast cancer. Kirsty and her husband Darren were bought together through a cancer support group and have gone on to have two children together Jack, five and Isabelle, two . As mother's day approaches Kirsty Summers has revealed how hard it will be to spend the day without her mother Carol who died just eight days after her wedding . But while Maureen Summers recovered, Carol Mellars was given just months to live, forcing the couple to bring their wedding forward. Despite being confined to a wheelchair and on oxygen, she managed to watch her daughter walk down the aisle and whisper: 'You look like a princess.' She died just eight days later, aged 50. Now Mrs Summers has paid tribute to her mum for finding her 'perfect man'. The baby sign language teacher said: 'She was so happy the day I got married and I'll always have her to thank for finding my perfect man. 'Mum being diagnosed was the worst thing that happened to me but it ended up leading to the best thing that happened to me.' The couple have had two children together since their wedding in 2008, Jack, five, and Isabelle, two. On Sunday, Mrs Summers will remember the tragic circumstances she met her husband in. She said: 'Mother's Day has become easier to cope with now I have the kids and they can make their own little presents. Sarah was pleased her mother Carol, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2007, got to attend her wedding . Kirsty, pictured with Darren, has paid tribute to her mother for helping her find the perfect man . 'That gives things a nicer focus but it's always bittersweet.' Ms Mellars was first diagnosed with grade-three inflammatory breast cancer in 2007. This meant that the cancer had spread from her breast to her lymph nodes. When she was undergoing her first round of gruelling chemotherapy, devastated Mrs Summers joined an online support forum. 'When Darren and I started messaging, the main topic of conversation was always about our mums,' she said. 'But then we got to talking about other things, like hobbies and how much we had in common. 'It just felt like there was a bit of a connection there.' After 10 days of chatting online, the pair arranged to meet at a coffee shop as friends. She said: 'I was looking forward to the prospect of meeting up with somebody and being able to honestly tell them how I was feeling and know that they were going through the exact same thing.' When Mr and Mrs Summers' relationship deepened, they introduced their mothers. Soon Ms Mellars and Maureen Summers, 67, also became great friends. 'I think their relationship was similar to mine and Darren's, they found someone they could talk to who knew exactly how they felt,' Mrs Summers said. Darren's mother Maureen (left) went on to be great friends with Kirsty's mother and the pair were pictured together at their children's wedding . In March 2008, six months after the couple met, Mr Summers, a graphic designer, proposed in front of Lincoln cathedral. The couple had something else to celebrate a month later when both their mothers were given the all clear. Mrs Summers said: 'We all went out for a meal. We had a lot to look forward to, and it was just brilliant.' But five months later, Ms Mellars developed a cough. 'One day Mum was struggling to breathe so she decided to go to hospital,' her daughter recalled. 'She packed herself a little bag, fed the cat and called herself a taxi. 'Most people would have got themselves an ambulance if they could barely breathe - but that was Mum.' Doctors ran a full body scan and blood tests which revealed the tragic truth – her cancer had returned. Darren's mother Maureen holds his and Kirsty's daughter Isabelle in a sweet family snap . Mrs Summers said: 'I got a voicemail from Mum asking me and Darren to come round because she wanted to talk to us. 'I just knew. I remember the car journey there - I've never been so hysterical in all of my life. 'We pulled into Mum's street and we hadn't even stopped driving when I jumped out. I just wanted to get to her as soon as I could. Kirsty continued: 'I banged on the door and when she opened it I fell straight into her arms and was just sobbing my heart out. 'She made us a cup of tea, even though I just wanted to sit down and talk about it - the usual good hostess. I said: 'it's back isn't it?' And she said yes and I started crying.' Ms Mellars told her daughter that the cancer had spread to her liver, lungs, brain, spleen and eye. Doctors had given her just months to live. Although Mr and Mrs Summers had planned to get married in May 2010 – two years away - they vowed to bring the wedding forward so Ms Mellars could be there. 'I arranged a whole wedding in four weeks, so she'd be well enough to enjoy it,' Mrs Summers said. 'I imagined her at the reception dancing and still being in quite good health.' Kirsty says that celebrating mother's day will be made a little bit easier by her two children Jack and Isabelle . Kirsty and Darren on holiday - the pair married in 2008 after meeting on a cancer support forum . But by the time they married in October 2008, Ms Mellars had already deteriorated. Mrs Summers said: 'She was in a wheelchair and on oxygen. She could barely speak anymore but she had a little notepad for writing down what she wanted to say. 'She managed to whisper to me that I looked like a princess. Half way through the meal, Mum got really tired, so her carers took her home. 'I locked myself in a room and cried in hysterics. I knew that was it. It was literally a countdown until she died because we'd done the thing that she was living for.' Tragically, Ms Mellars died eight days after the couple married. It also hit Mr Summers' mother hard after they had forged a close friendship. 'My mum became her best friend and so when we lost mum it was a huge loss for her as well,' Mrs Summers explained. She is now keen to raise awareness of the importance of regular health checks. 'Mum was an extremely healthy person - she didn't smoke, she didn't drink. It just proves that cancer really does pick on anyone,' she said. 'You can't be too careful. 'You have to take every little thing seriously, even if you feel like you're bothering the doctor.' She misses her mum every day, but Mother's Day is particularly difficult. 'It's just an extra reminder than my children are missing their grandma,' she said. 'There are times I could really do with her advice and her reassurance and Mother's Day highlights that she isn't around. 'I know she would have been so caring with them. Mother's Day will be hard but now I have my own children we can make new memories.'","Kirsty and Darren Summers met in a cancer support group .

"Despite more than 600 British jihadists having fled for Syria and Iraq, only 25 terror suspects are currently subject to asset-freezing orders. In total, just £61,000 in 59 bank accounts belonging to suspected terrorists has been blocked by the Treasury, a report has found. The report, by the independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson QC, showed another 28 people have had their bank accounts in the country frozen under European orders. Scroll down for video . Only 25 terror suspects are currently subject to asset-freezing orders, a report by independent reviewer into terror legislation David Anderson QC (pictured), revealed . It showed there were eight new Treasury designations in the year to September 2014 under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010 - a sharp decline from 162 in 2008. Mr Anderson concluded the figures for assets frozen were 'remarkably low. He said they indicate asset-freezing has played only a 'marginal role' in combating 'the most serious terrorist threat of the present time'. Sharmeena Begum was revealed as the 15-year-old British schoolgirl who led three others to join ISIS . 'Travel to and from such conflict zones, together with the preparation of terrorist acts, often requires funding and facilitation,' he said. 'There has been an attempt to use asset-freezing legislation to respond to the threat posed by UK residents who travel to and from Syria and Iraq for the purposes of terrorism. 'But bearing in mind that over 600 Britons have travelled out there, the small number of designations indicates that asset-freezing has played only a marginal role in combating the most serious terrorist threat of the present time.' The report will raise serious concerns as increasingly numbers of young homegrown jihadists continue to abandon their homes in favour of Islamic State. It comes as the identity of a 15-year-old London schoolgirl who led her three best friends to Syria after becoming radicalised was revealed. Sharmeena Begum fled Britain to join Islamic State in December - and was the first of four GCSE pupils at the same school to become jihadi brides. She is believed to be in the IS stronghold of Raqqa with Bethnal Green Academy pupils Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, who travelled to Syria last month. Yesterday, video emerged apparently showing the three runaway British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled into Syria to become brides for Islamic State militants. The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy who was arrested for helping the trio cross the border. The girls are said to have first arrived at Istanbul Ataturk Airport before heading to the southern city of Gaziantep close to the Syrian border. New footage emerged that claims to show three British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled across the border in Syria to become jihadi brides for ISIS militants . The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy working for the Canadian intelligence service who was arrested on Thursday for helping the trio cross the border . Earlier this week, it emerged the girls had paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. Police discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash. But their families, appearing before the House of Commons home affairs committee, insisted that someone else helped them with the cost of the air tickets as the missing jewellery was not worth £1,000. Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza Sultana, said: ‘My sister used to borrow a piece of jewellery off my daughters that was very sentimental to her and that’s what she’s taken. Pictured from left, Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. They are understood to be in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . ‘I feel there is someone out there helping in terms of funding because there’s no way my sister has got the cash to fund herself.’ At least 22 young women, the majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months. Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected. Islamic State seized large swathes of land across Syria and Iraq last June, including territory close to the Turkish border.

"Dale Cregan has been placed in solitary confinement after allegedly sneaking in drugs and a mobile phone to prison . One-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan has been placed in solitary confinement after smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his prison cell, it has been claimed. The 31-year-old, who was jailed for life after shooting police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012, had been running a criminal network from HM Prison Manchester, sources said. Prison staff have come under fire for the reported security breach with critics slamming the alleged oversight as 'really embarrassing'. Cregan is serving a life sentence after shooting dead PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes as well as father and son David and Mark Short in Manchester in 2012. The gangster admitted the attempted murder of three others in a high profile court case the following year. He was told he would never see release after admitting to the killings which prompted public outcry and an outpouring of sympathy for the police. It is the second time he has been caught smuggling drugs into the prison, known as Strangeways, since being put behind bars. But having managed to get hold of a phone to direct illegal activity on the streets, critics are demanding his case be used to set an example. 'If the authorities cannot stop dangerous criminals like this continuing their activities from the inside then the Government will have to step in,' Tory MP Philip Davies told the Sun's Jake Ryan. 'Dale Cregan is not the only prisoner with a phone because security is so lax and we might have to block mobile signals in prisons if it can't be stopped by the authorities.' A prison source added the blunder had been 'really embarrassing' for staff who were now under fire from bosses. 'It's really embarrassing for the prison that one of the country's most dangerous prisoners has got a hold of a phone and drugs again.' The 31-year-old is serving a life sentence at HM Prison Manchester (above) where staff have come under fire for the reported breach . Officers Fiona Bone (left) and Nicola Hughes (right) were killed by Cregan after being lured into a house . Cregan went on the run in 2012 after murdering David Short, 46, and his son Mark, 23, in a bar fight. The killer, who has one eye after losing the other in a separate brawl, lured officers Bone and Hughes into a house in September 2012. In October last year staff at the Category A prison faced questions after the murderer tested positive for cannabis in a random drug test. At the time a spokesman for the prison said: “The availability of illicit drugs in our prisons impacts greatly on prison life and can lead to violence and intimidation of both prisoners and their family.' Earlier this year one of the key witnesses in his case revealed she had fled the country after receiving threats from the gangster's cronies online. The woman, who has not been named, refused to say where she was in the world but that she had been contacted by friends of Cregan threatening her life. She claimed she had been left destitute and without work after testifying for the Crown Prosecution Service. Greater Manchester Police declined to comment on her claims at the time on the grounds the force does not speak to individual cases involving witness protection. Murdered by Cregan: Mark Short (right) and his father David . The key witness who helped put Cregan behind bars for the killings that shocked the nation came under intense threats from gangland thugs before the trial. On the night Mark Short was shot dead, the woman saw one of Cregan's co-accused, Damian Gorman, outside her house with two other people. Giving evidence to the trial via video link, she said she also found clothes dumped in a garden next to her home the next day. She said she faced threats after Short was killed, including one of the 'one-eyed Scotchman' - a reference to Cregan - paying her a visit. The trial heard Gorman had told her: 'You better make sure that you keep your f****** mouth shut or you're dead... You see these people, what they are capable of. You're f****** next. You and your f****** kids.' 'He said, ""Be careful because you don't want the one-eyed Scotchman coming to [your] door""... If I said anything to the police,' she said. She said he pulled his finger under his chin and across his throat and told her: 'You don't want to die and you don't want your kids to die.' 'He was always threatening me. The message he gave me was clear,' she added.","Dale Cregan has been placed in solitary confinement following breach .

"A travel writer and mother who embarked on a mammoth adventure around the world to battle the 'inner emptiness' she felt after giving birth to her son says her exploration gave her the opportunity to connect with something larger than herself, as she wrestled with the question of what it means to be a mom. Leigh Ann Henion, from Boone, North Carolina, visited a variety of far-off and remote locations during a two-year period, which began shortly after her son’s first birthday, returning home in between each trip in order to spend time with her child and her husband. And in her memoir Phenomenal: A Hesitant Adventurer’s Search for Wonder in the Natural World, which was published on Tuesday, the mother-of-one chronicles every aspect of the physical and emotional journey, which, she explains, she began in order to experience the world's natural phenomena as a part of a spiritual quest to find herself after her son Archer, now five, was born. Scroll down for video . Unforgettable: Leigh Ann Henion wrote about witnessing Hawaii’s still-burning volcanoes and Venezuela's intense lightning in her memoir Phenomenal: A Hesitant Adventurer’s Search for Wonder in the Natural World . Loving mother: Leigh Ann, pictured on Driftwood Beach on Jekyll Island in Georgia with her son Archer, did not spend more than two weeks at a time away from her family . 'I went through a great life transition and I didn't know to process certain parts,' the 37-year-old author tells the Daily Mail Online. Leigh Ann, who has witnessed Hawaii’s still-burning volcanoes, Venezuela's intense lightning and Sweden's aurora borealis - among her many adventures - says the birth of her son in 2009 was as 'awe-inducing and fantastical' as the natural wonders she describes in her book. But she notes that no one could have prepared her for how she would feel when she was 'thrown into this very visceral experience' of being a new mom. Leigh Ann struggled with sleep deprivation, as well as her sense of self, during the first year of Archer's life. She was only sleeping for three-hour stretches and she refused to allow anyone outside of her immediate family to watch her son for the first 14 months of his life - and even then she would only leave Archer's side for a few hours at a time. 'You know the saying: ""It takes a village to raise a child?"" I wasn’t letting the village in,' she recalls. Adventure time: The 37-year-old travel writer (R) posed with her sled guide (L) in Sweden for this photo . Natural wonder: During her trip to Sweden, Leigh Ann saw the aurora borealis, or the northern lights . And it wasn't just her physical ailments that sent caused Leigh Ann to question her identity as a mother. 'I had a year where I was convinced that I was never going to leave my house again, [that] I was never going to sleep again [and that] I was never going to write again,' she says. 'I was very confused and I was unsure how my life was going to be.’ Leigh Ann, who first began creating a list of the natural wonders she wanted to experience after watching the fantastical migration of the monarch butterfly in Mexico in 2007, before the birth of her son, says she vowed to visit the places she had dreamed of - even if it took her a decade. 'I had a crazy idea... and when I started to pursue it, things started to happen and doors started opening,' she says. A few months after Archer's first birthday, Leigh Ann embarked on her first trip, when she traveled to Puerto Rico to visit the island's bioluminescent bays, which contain millions of micro-organisms, or dinoflagellates, that glow. Life-changing moment: After seeing the migration of millions of monarch butterflies in Mexico (pictured), Leigh Ann started keeping a list of natural phenomena she wanted to experience . African safari: The author saw a group of zebras during her trek to Tanzania . Leign Ann notes that wasn't in the position financially to embark on these travels and they seemed very much like a 'pipe dream' when she wrote her book proposal. 'When I look back on those years, I cannot believe that I did that,' she says. 'I cannot believe that I juggled it, that I fought so hard for the time to do it.' Leigh Ann, who, in addition to planning her travels, was also teaching creative writing, while raising her son, said her quest had once seemed 'impossible' but soon began to take a life of its own. Her story: Leigh Ann's memoir was published on Tuesday . The writer explains that during her two year journey she never left her son for more than two weeks, and adds that her husband would travel with her when he could. As for any impending danger, Leigh Ann says she was more nervous about traveling around the bustling streets of Caracas, Venezuela, than witnessing the South American country's fearsome lightning storms, because cities make her uncomfortable. 'We all have things that make us nervous,' she says, before adding: 'You are more likely to be killed by a coconut falling from a tree than a shark bite.' Leigh Ann believes that her journey 'would be talked about in different ways' if it were written by a father opposed to a mother – and admits that some people were shocked to learn that her husband was so supportive of her personal journey. 'I remember distinctly in Hawaii I had a woman say to me: ""Can you believe that her husband is letting her do this?""' She adds that, as a travel writer, visiting those far off locations and writing about her experience was also work for her, rather than just a series of carefree jaunts to exotic locations. 'Can you imagine someone going to a business conference and having someone say: ""Oh, I can't believe that your husband let you come here?""' she asks. Leigh Ann recalls other people saying things like, 'Can you believe her son is home with her husband for a whole week?’ despite the fact that few people would likely ever question a child being left with his or her mother. She says people mostly had an issue with her doing something for her emotional and spiritual health, noting that 'it's not something that we value in our culture'. 'It was a story that I needed to live out,' she says.","Leigh Ann Henion chronicled her journey in her new memoir Phenomenal: A Hesitant Adventurer’s Search for Wonder in the Natural World .

"She is approaching her 49th birthday and had previously vowed her 15th baby would be her last. But Britain's most prolific surrogate mother is now hoping to have a 16th – and possibly 17th – child after two embryos were transferred into her womb at the weekend. They belong to a couple who only met Carole Horlock for the first time a few hours beforehand. Carole Horlock, 49, from Colchester, Essex, is Britain's most prolific surrogate mother and is now hoping to have a 16th - and possibly 17th - baby . Miss Horlock with her 13th surrogate baby (left) and with baby number nine in 2004 (right) Baby number one in December 1995 - she became pregnant with her first child for another couple after reading a newspaper article about surrogacy . She said: 'I'm just a womb they've hired to help them achieve their dream of being parents. As far as I'm concerned it's their baby not mine. 'I know in my heart I've made the right decision to approach a mum who is desperate to have a baby of her own, and I'm confident that they'll be good parents.' Miss Horlock, who lives in Colchester, Essex, with her partner of 16 years, Paul, offered her services after being 'dumped' by another couple midway through a cycle of fertility drugs. She approached the new couple on an internet surrogacy forum last Monday and met them on Friday night, before having the IVF treatment on Saturday morning. It will take up to two weeks before doctors know if either of the embryos has successfully embedded and she is pregnant. She said: 'Some people may think that what I'm doing is wrong, as I'd only met the couple in the flesh just 12 hours before having the IVF, but I don't believe it is at all. 'Ideally, I would have spent more time getting to know them. There wouldn't normally be such a rush, but I'd been having this treatment for another couple who pulled out of the surrogacy with no real reason, which has left me devastated. 'I didn't want to lose out on the chance to have another surrogate baby for a couple, as I'm now 48 years old. And it seemed such a wasted opportunity when I could use my womb again to help others.' Miss Horlock also boasted that the IVF clinicians told the couple, who haven't been identified, that their surrogate had 'the best uterus in the world'.

She has two daughters of her own, Steffanie, 24, and Megan, 21, and has given birth to 13 other children as a surrogate mother – including a set of twins and a set of triplets. She last gave birth in April 2013 – to a boy weighing 9lb 14oz. 'At the time I said he was going to be my last, but having babies is addictive,' she said yesterday. 'The thought I could be pregnant again is incredibly exciting – it's the beginning of a journey with the couple which culminates in a magical moment when I give birth.' If one or both of the embryos implant into her womb's lining, the baby – or babies – will be born by caesarean section, as with her last two pregnancies. Miss Horlock, who also owns a £350,000, six-bedroom farmhouse in Bordeaux, said: 'I'll be 49 when I give birth, which is not so strange and well within the realms of getting pregnant naturally, let alone with IVF. 'I love being pregnant, although I hope it is just one this time. With two embryos there is a chance it could be twins. And I really don't want to contemplate triplets or quads at my age – I've done triplets once and that was enough!' She followed the couple's story on the surrogacy forum for several months and said her 'heart went out to them' but that she was unable to help as she was already partnered with another couple. When that fell through, it was 'almost fate' that she could step in – although she did not even know how old the mother-to-be was before agreeing to carry her baby. The women spoke on the phone 'for up to six hours a day' last week before meeting up in Athens – where the fertility clinic is based – on Friday night. 49-year-old Miss Horlock said: 'I love being pregnant, although I hope it's just one this time' Miss Horlock gave births to twins in February 1997 and triplets in March 2008 - she had other babies in March 1998, July 1999, October 2000, January 2002, April 2003, June 2004 and April 2013 . Miss Horlock said the meeting was 'incredibly emotional'. And after a steak dinner, they agreed to go ahead. The embryos – which are biologically the couple's – were put into Miss Horlock's womb on Saturday, and she flew home last night. It is almost exactly 20 years since she became pregnant with her first child for another couple after reading a newspaper article about surrogacy. She went on to have twins in February 1997, triplets in March 2008 and other babies in March 1998, July 1999, October 2000, January 2002, April 2003, June 2004 and April 2013. For each pregnancy, she is paid expenses of between £7,000 and £15,000. If she becomes pregnant this time, she plans to hand the baby straight to the couple after the birth. They will then apply for a parental order – the first stage in them becoming its legal parents. 'I will waive all my legal rights to the child,' said Miss Horlock.","Carole Horlock, 49, is hoping to have a 16th and possibly 17th child .

"Pamela Smart's former teenage lover has been granted parole nearly 25 years after he shot her husband dead at her request. William 'Billy' Flynn, who murdered Gregg Smart in 1990, was granted parole by a three-person board in Concord, New Hampshire on Thursday, his 41st birthday. 'It's your birthday,' said board chairwoman Donna Sytek. 'We're granting you the privilege of parole.' Flynn has been in a Maine prison and participated in the hearing by telephone, telling the board that he'd always be haunted by the killing. 'I will always feel terrible about what happened 25 years ago,' he said. 'Parole will not change that.' Freed: Billy Flynn (pictured in court in 2008) has been granted parole after 25 years behind bars . He will not be freed before his parole eligibility date of June 4 - but when he does leave, he will be reunited with his wife, whom he married from behind bars, and a  stepdaughter. Smart, who is serving a life sentence, was an instructor in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced 15-year-old Flynn, a fellow volunteer. She told him she needed her 24-year-old husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced him. On May 1, 1990, Flynn, then 16, and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart, a sales representative for an insurance company, to his knees in the foyer, while another friend waited outside in a getaway car. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn shot him in the head. Before his parole decision was issued, the victim's brother, Dean Smart, read a letter from his 23-year-old daughter, Ashley. Family: Dean Smart (left), the brother of victim Gregg Smart, speaks during the parole hearing in Concord, New Hampshire on Thursday. He said that he hopes Flynn will now make something better of his life . Decision: A three-person board, pictured, granted the parole on Thursday, Flynn's 41st birthday . 'Mr. Flynn is only in this situation because he decided to play God one night and take an innocent man's life,' her letter said. 'You singlehandedly destroyed a whole family.' But Dean Smart struck a more hopeful note. 'I hope he does something great with his life,' he said. Before the parole was granted, another brother, Rick Smart, had told the Boston Herald that he believed Flynn should be freed because he was a teenager at the time and has served his time. 'Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he shouldn't have been punished,' he said. 'But I want to put this behind me and I'm sure he wants to put it behind him.' Flynn, who earned his GED and electrician's helper license behind bars, said finding a job will be his biggest challenge, noting that employers immediately search his name on the Internet. 'The first they learn about me is the worst thing I've ever done,' he said. Teacher:  Pamela Smart (seen in 1991) was convicted of conspiring with her teen lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24-year-old husband, Gregory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . Student: In this 1991 file photo,  Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Gregory Smart in the head . To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.' Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. He was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus time served before trial. His age and testimony against Smart were taken into account at sentencing. Seven years ago, testifying on his motion for a reduced sentence, a tearful Flynn took full responsibility for his actions and apologized. 'I promise you I will carry this guilt and remorse with me every day for the rest of my life,' he said. Flynn married wife Kelly while behind bars in 2006 and has a stepdaughter. They married after Kelly, a divorcee, started writing to him in prison. By his side: Kelly Flynn, who married Flynn while he was behind bars in 2006, said in 2008 that she would be waiting for him to help him adjust when he came out. She is pictured at a hearing in his case in 2008 . Murdered: Smart's husband, Gregory Smart (seen on their wedding day), was shot in the head in May 1990 . 'The more I got to know Bill, the more I realized that he was not the same person who became involved with Pam Smart at the tender age of 15,' Kelly wrote in 2008 in a previous request for a suspended sentence, according to coverage in Seacoast Online. In the request, she wrote that when Flynn gets out of prison, she would help him adjust. 'I am not naive, but a 39-year-old woman with a teenage daughter, so I know there will be adjustments for all of us, and some of them may be hard,' wrote Kelly, who is now 48. Records show her daughter is now 23. She went on: 'Whether you decide that he gets out now, in a few years, or in many years, my commitment to him will not change. I am in this for life, because without him I would have less in my life and when I think of my future, I cannot see it unless it includes him. He is the heart of me.' Smart, whose trial was the first to be televised nationally from start to finish, was convicted March 22, 1991, of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy and witness tampering. She admitted seducing the boy but said she didn't plan her husband's murder. 'This never would have happened if it wasn't for Pam Smart,' said attorney Paul Maggiotto, who prosecuted Smart. 'It was Smart's manipulation of Flynn that caused this crime to occur.' On the big screen: The case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix . Smart's friend and spokeswoman, Eleanor Pam, told The Associated Press that Smart chafes at her life sentence without the chance at freedom. Smart told her: 'If they look at Flynn, they really should take a look at me.' Pam said that while Smart acknowledges the affair with Flynn led to the series of events leading up to her husband's death, she maintains she didn't plan it. Randall, Flynn's friend, got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. Their case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix.","William 'Billy' Flynn was granted parole by a three-person board in New Hampshire on Thursday - his 41st birthday .

"Disgraced PC Darren Heath, 44, pictured with a woman who has nothing to do with the case, admitted using his position to take advantage of women . A predatory PC admitted abusing his position to have sex with three vulnerable women he met on duty. Darren Heath, who worked as a family liaison officer for Gloucestershire Police, took advantage of his victims over an 11-year period. The 'manipulative and calculating' 44-year-old also harassed a fourth women and repeatedly went to the home she shared with her partner. Heath, who also worked in restorative justice, admitted five counts of misconduct in public office between July 2002 and February 2013 at Bristol Crown Court. He also denied two counts of rape, one of theft and two further charges of misconduct in the public office - accessing the police database and failing to report an alleged rape. The remaining charges will lie on the court file after his not guilty pleas were accepted by the prosecution. Gloucestershire Constabulary's Professional Standards Department began investigating Heath following a single complaint in 2012. But concerned officers decided to look back through their database and identified a number of other potential victims. Senior Investigating Officer with the Anti-Corruption Unit, Detective Inspector Giulia Marogna, said: 'It then quickly became clear there were a number of ladies he may have offended against. 'Darren Heath would use his position as a police officer, whether it was during his time working in restorative justice or as a family liaison officer, to identify women he could offend against. 'These were often victims of crime who were already extremely vulnerable but who he wanted to take advantage of even further. 'Our investigation has been lengthy because we have had to spend time regaining the confidence of women who had been badly let down by someone they should have been able to trust, precisely at a time when they needed him the most. 'Heath was manipulative and calculating while he was offending and that is one of the reasons he was able to carry on doing this over a number of years. Detective Inspector Marogna said the case will now be referred back to the Professional Standards Department to consider the action the force will next take. Heath, 44, will return to Bristol Crown Court, pictured, for sentence next week after admitting charges of misconduct in a public office . She said the most disappointing thing was that Heath showed no remorse and made no comment throughout his interviews. 'Those victims have shown incredible bravery by supporting this prosecution and I want to pay tribute to them for that,' the detective inspector added. 'It doesn't stop here though - I have absolutely no doubt there are more victims out there and I would appeal to them directly to come forward.' She added that it was 'very satisfying' that justice had finally caught up with Heath. Heath, who appeared in court in blue jeans, green jacket and blue v-neck sweater, visibly shook as he stood in the dock for the brief hearing. The defendant, of Taynton, Gloucestershire, was released on bail to return to the court for sentence next week.","PC Darren Heath had sex with three vulnerable women he met on duty .

"Ashya King’s parents are in ‘exile’ in Spain because they fear their children will be taken into care if they return to the UK, his grandmother said last night. To the family’s great joy the five-year-old had been declared cancer-free following pioneering treatment. But, says the boy’s grandmother, the Kings are now ‘desperate’ to return home. Ashya King’s grandmother say his parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 46, are now ‘desperate’ to return to the UK, but remain in Marbella, Spain because they fear their children will being taken into care . Ashya was diagnosed with a brain tumour last year. This was removed and doctors insisted that surgery was followed up by traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. But his parents Brett, 51, and Naghmeh, 46, wanted him to have cutting-edge proton beam therapy instead which is thought to be less harmful. Fearing that Ashya would be taken away from them and given the treatment, the family fled to Spain, where they had a holiday home, prompting an international manhunt. The parents were arrested in Spain and held in prison while Ashya was made a ward of court by Portsmouth council before a national outcry led to their release. Reunited, the family flew to Prague, where the boy had proton beam therapy. Last week, the family was told that he is now cancer-free. Ashya’s grandmother said last night that her son and his wife felt like ‘exiles’ in Spain but were powerless to return home for fear of their children being taken into care. Brett and Naghmeh King were locked up after taking their son out of an NHS hospital and going across Europe to seek pioneering proton therapy in the Czech Republic . ‘They are worried about Ashya and the other children being taken away from them. That’s why they can’t come home. They’re exiles,’ she said. ‘They’re desperate to come back to England but they can’t because Brett can’t get assurances from the council that they won’t take the children away. They are worried about the council, social services – everyone. They are very unhappy in Spain. They want to get on with their lives – they don’t want to live in exile.’ She said that they were living in rented accommodation after selling their flat near Marbella in Spain so they could pay for Ashya’s care. The family still have a house in Southsea, Hampshire, which they can return to if they feel safe enough to. Yesterday, it emerged that Ashya is now cancer-free after the private clinic in Prague where he was treated issued a report, according to the Sun. His father yesterday told the paper that he fears his son would not have survived had he been treated by the health service. ‘It has justified everything we have gone through because things are working out for Ashya,’ he said. ‘If we had left Ashya with the NHS we don’t think he would have survived. We have saved his life.’ The parents, who are Jehovah’s Witnesses, said that Ashya was starting to speak again, playing with his brothers and sister and playing Lego and computer games. He added: ‘We’d like to think we have been vindicated but we will always have the doubters. However we know we did the right thing for Ashya. We acted out of love. We’d do the same again. We were arrested for child cruelty and neglect. But leaving Ashya in the NHS would have been far more cruel.’ In an earlier interview, Ashya’s grandmother said: ‘When they think it’s ok, they will come home. Ashya is having speech therapy and is coming along and doing well. They’re really pleased with him. ‘They all want to come back. The older boys want to come back, Brett and Naghmeh want to come back, but it’s all up in the air at the moment. They’re all hoping it will resolve itself, but Brett has got to be absolutely certain that Ashya will not be taken into care.’ Michael Lawther, Portsmouth City Council’s city solicitor, said: ‘The wardship order has been discharged and the council is no longer involved in court proceedings. Therefore it’s not a council matter whether the King family return to the UK.’ A spokesman said the family may have talked to the council but could not confirm this.","Ashya King's treatment for brain cancer abroad has been a success .

"A woman with multiple sclerosis was forced to get out of her power wheelchair and carried on stage to speak at a disability conference. Speaker Deborah Haygarth was hoisted out of her chair and escorted by two people up the four stairs between the floor and the raised stage. Disability rights advocate Jax-Jacki Brown was at the National Disability Summit at Melbourne's Sheraton Hotel last Thursday and was outraged by the oversight. Speaker Deborah Haygarth, who has multiple sclerosis, was forced to get out of her wheelchair and carried by two people on and off the stage . 'I thought 'They're going to pull out a ramp, they obviously planned for this',' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'No ramp was forthcoming so the next best thing is they are going to move the table and microphone so she can sit with everyone else, but they didn't do that. 'They suggested she move out of her chair and be carried on by two people.' Ms Brown - who is a wheelchair-user herself - said it was degrading to see a person in a wheelchair be treated like that. 'It just removes your agency and your power to move around the world,' she said. 'It makes you dependent on someone to give assistance. To add further insult, chairs were stacked inside the disabled toilets, preventing people from using it . 'It's not the way you want to be able to be seen. It's not an empowering way to enter a stage.' To add further insult, the disabled toilet at the venue had been stacked up with chairs, preventing people in wheelchairs who had to go to the bathroom from using it. Ms Brown said disabled toilets were often seen as secondary storage spaces. 'To use a toilet is quite crucial and a fundamental right that non-disabled people take for granted,' she said. 'It speaks volumes about the space the National Disability Summit was held in. 'I mean we don't even have the right to pee.' Susan Ryan, who is the disability discrimination commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission, said she had written to the organisers of the summit. Disability rights advocate Jax-Jacki Brown was at the National Disability Summit in Melbourne and said it was a degrading sight to see . The Sheraton Hotel in Melbourne has apologised for the incident, saying they 'fell short' of delivering all their duties, and vowed a similar incident would not reoccur. 'On behalf of Sheraton Melbourne Hotel, I would like to apologise for the incident that took place at the National Disability Summit. We fell short of delivering all of the necessary requirements and this is disappointing,' Hal Philp, General Manager at Sheraton Melbourne Hotel said. 'At Sheraton Melbourne Hotel, the comfort and safety of our guests is of paramount importance to us. Whilst these are isolated incidents, it is nonetheless a lesson learnt. 'We will ensure every effort is made to further improve the accessibility in our hotel premises, so that such incidents do not re-occur,' Mr Philip added. But this is not the first controversy the National Disability Summit has attracted. This year, only seven people with a disability were allowed to attend the two-day conference, causing a social media outrage. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the organisers and Sheraton Hotel for comment on the matter.","Speaker Deborah Haygarth was speaking at the National Disability Summit .

"One in five homes has 'earned' more than its owner over the past two years, a study shows. House prices have increased by as much as 40 per cent in some areas in the past two years as the market has recovered, while pay rises have stagnated. Now research shows that in a fifth of local council areas, the average rise in property prices in 2013 and 2014 exceeded the take-home pay of an average employee. Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, found that homes had earned more than the people living in them in 73 out of 384 local authorities. Sixty-eight of these council areas were in London, the South East, and the East of England. There were only five examples of homes 'out-performing' earnings in Wales, the South West and the East Midlands, and none in the North East, the North West, the West Midlands, or Scotland. The most dramatic example was in Hammersmith and Fulham, where house prices rose by £143,232 more than their owners earned over the two-year period. Homes in the London borough went up by £199,930 – or 40 per cent – in 2013 and 2014, easily exceeding average take-home earnings in the area of £56,698 for the two years. This was closely followed by three other London boroughs: Wandsworth, where houses earned £102,760 more than their owners over the two years; Ealing (£90,401); Kensington and Chelsea (£89,642). High rises: Houses like these in Hammersmith and Fulham have seen the biggest rise in value over the last two years (stock image) How they stand: Hammersmith and Fulham top the chart for property price rises in 2013 and 2014 with some homes increasing by nearly £200,000 . Eight London boroughs appeared in the top ten for house price rises outstripping wages. The other two were Elmbridge, in Surrey, and South Buckinghamshire. Council areas in the East of England – in Hertforshire, Cambridgeshire and East Anglia – dominated the top ten outside London and the South East for house price rises outstripping wages. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: 'This is good news for some homeowners. At the same time, it is challenging news for those looking to buy their first home in such areas, with prices being pushed out of range for many young people.' Campbell Robb, of housing charity Shelter, said: 'This will come as no surprise to the millions of young people and families struggling to scrape together enough to afford a home of their own. 'With the Government's own figures showing the cost of a home is now ten times the average wage, it's no wonder that having a place to put down roots is becoming a fantasy for many.'","Property price rises in fifth of council areas exceed average earnings .

"A Colombian artist is suing Dolce & Gabbana after claiming they stole her idea when they created what was billed as the world's swankiest headphones. Colombian artist Adriana Duque, 46, said she was shocked when she spotted pictures of the Dolce & Gabbana headphones being advertised on the side of a taxi. The headphones had caused a sensation when they were unveiled during the fashion house's recent autumn/winter 2015 show during Milan Fashion Week. Scroll down for video . Adriana Duque says her 2011 photographs (one of which is pictured above) featuring jewel-encrusted headphones were the inspiration for Dolce & Gabbana's catwalk pieces . They are being sold for around £4,600, with the company saying they wanted to take music to the next level. The headphones worn by the models are made of leather and are fully covered in the brand’s signature jewellery, embellished with materials like pearls, gold chains, Swarovski crystals and velvet across the earpieces and bridge. The headphones were supposed to be just for the catwalk, but were so popular they are now available after the Dolce & Gabbana collaborated with Tech brand Frends. Frends confirmed that two of the original catwalk versions have officially landed on American online retailer Moda Operandi and are ready to pre-order for expected delivery between July and October. The Dolce & Gabbana headphones featuring gems and jewellery created a stir at the Milan Fashion Week . Since Frends was founded in 2006 by a young group of pro-snowboarders, the brand's minimalist designs have become a favourite in the fashion world. Now by collaborating with the king of bling, the company has taken it's fashion designs to a whole new level. But the artist, from the Colombian capital Bogota, claims that the designs are clearly based on a series of photographs entitled 'Icons' and 'Icons II' that she had taken, where kids and women are pictured wearing headphones made with precious stones. A side view of the Dolce & Gabbana headphones (left) and Adriana Duque's on the right . She said: 'I looked at the designs that were on display on the catwalk and realised they were uncannily similar to my own from the pictures I took in 2011.' According to the artist’s lawyer, in an interview with the newspaper El Tiempo, the work of Duque inspired Dolce & Gabanna, and the firm is  guilty of copyright theft. Duque said: 'It is one thing to be inspired by the work of others, but it is another thing to simply copy someone else's work and then not to admit it because this is plagiarism and cannot be accepted.' Dolce and Gabbana declined to comment about the issue. It is has been a busy week for the fashion brand after one of its designers, Domenico Dolce, attracted worldwide criticism after saying babies born through IVF were 'synthetic'.

"A Florida woman who was looking around the house for her cats found something much larger and more dangerous underneath her bed.

Apart from the gesture, Matthews, of Warmley, South Gloucestershire, spoke only to confirm his identity during the short hearing. Four others have been charged with helping dispose of and hiding Becky's body parts which were found at an address in the Barton Hill area of her home town, Bristol. They are Jaydene Parsons, 23, of Bristol, James Ireland, 23, of Avonmouth, and Karl and Donovan Demetrius, both 29, also from Bristol. Parsons appeared via video-link, while Ireland listened to proceedings from the dock. The Demetrius brothers were not present. Although none of the defendants has entered a plea at this stage, the Recorder of Bristol, Neil Ford, said he wanted to establish a timetable in the event of there being a trial. A court sketch of Matthews, from Warmley, South Gloucestershire, during his first court appearance over the alleged murder . The court was told that a plea hearing will take place on Tuesday August 4. In the event of any not-guilty pleas, a trial will 'provisionally' take place on October 5. All six defendants were remanded in custody. Becky, who was described by her family as 'wonderful', vanished form her home in Crown Hill, Bristol, on February 19. Police launched a huge search for the popular girl, which also prompted a social media campaign using the hashtag #FindBecky. After news of her death emerged, bouquets, teddies and cards were left at her family home in Barton Court, with mourners attending a number of memorial services to pay their respects. Two online fundraising pages have also been set up to help her family pay for her funeral. So far more than £10,000 has been raised.

"The Germans are to throw their money behind Britain’s Olympic athletes and the chase for gold medals in Rio. Aldi, the budget supermarket, is to be the official supermarket of Team GB as they prepare for the Olympic Games in Brazil in 2016. The idea of a German-owned company helping Britain’s athletes achieve their sporting potential may appear incongruous, however the group has enormous financial muscle. Budget German supermarket, Aldi, has been named as the official sponsor of Team GB at the 2016 Olympics . It is understood that Aldi will subsidise the costs of training camps and equipment as well as funding community and youth sports schemes with the British Olympic Association (BOA). Some people may question why British retail giants like Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons were not interested in this sort of partnership. Sainsbury’s has a long association with British athletics and the Paralympics. Aldi’s partnership with Team GB is part of a wider strategy to install the brand as a beacon of healthy, quality, British food. The chain has made a concerted effort to attract families from across the social spectrum, particularly middle and higher income shoppers. Aldi’s partnership with Team GB is part of a wider strategy to promote the brand as a beacon of healthy, quality, British food . As a result, sales are growing at around 19 per cent a year and it now has a market share of five per cent, putting it almost on a par with Waitrose. Olympic legend and gold medallist, Lord Coe, the chairman of the BOA, said: ‘Everyone associated with Team GB is thrilled to have a partner which has so captured the imagination of the British public. ‘They are a great and growing British employer and are championing British produce and suppliers. Their support is a huge boost in our efforts to get the nation inspired in the run up to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.’ Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the British Olympics Association, said he is 'thrilled' with the backing from Aldi . The BOA’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, added: ‘We’re delighted to have Aldi join us on our road to Rio 2016 and their support will play a key role in the team’s success at the Olympic Games. ‘Their drive for excellence matches our own and we’re looking forward to working with them on our community and sporting engagement programmes, as well as supporting the athletes heading out to Brazil next year. Aldi is a growing, impressive brand in the UK and is a great fit with Team GB.’ Aldi’s UK chief executive, Matthew Barnes, said: ‘Our partnership with Team GB is the perfect way to celebrate our landmark 25th anniversary in the UK and we are proud of the investment Aldi has made in Britain over the last 25 years. ‘Our passion to offer our customers access to fresh, affordable and healthy food is unrivalled. Our continued drive to buy locally produced products and commitment to our extensive fresh food range are just some of the reasons why more and more people are choosing to shop with us. ‘We are truly honoured to be supporting the extraordinary Team GB athletes on the road to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.’ The partnership was sealed at an event at the BOA’s London headquarters yesterday, which was attended by Team GB athletes Samantha Murray, from Modern Pentathlon, and BMX cyclist, Liam Phillips. The news of the firm’s focus on health and fitness coincided with news Aldi is to launch a new ‘boutique’ wine range to tap in to the tastes of the higher income shoppers they are now attracting. The wines include a Malbec Cabernet, Tasmanian Chardonnay, Pezenas and a Valle De Leyda Sauvignon, which at £9.99 are more than double the cost of its normal range.","Aldi will subsidise costs of training camps and equipment for Team GB .

"Being overly sensitive to sound could have been the key to the creativity of geniuses like Charles Darwin (pictured), scientists believe . We all find noise annoying – but if it really bothers you it could be because you're a genius. Being overly sensitive to sound could have been the key to the creativity of geniuses like Charles Darwin and Franz Kafka – who both complained of their difficulty of filtering out noise – research has revealed. Psychologists now believe that an inability to shut out irrelevant sensory information could be strongly linked to creativity. French writer Marcel Proust was famous for wearing earplugs and lining his bedroom with cork to block out the outside sound while he worked. And Kafka once said 'I need solitude for my writing; not ""like a hermit"" - that wouldn't be enough - but like a dead man.' Darwin and write Anton Chekhov were also known to have complained about how they found it difficult to filter out noise. Scientists at Northwestern University, Illinois, tested 100 people on their ability to find original solutions to problems and found strong links between an inability to shut out irrelevant audio stimuli, dubbed 'leaky' sensory gating, and creativity. In tests 100 people were provided solutions to scenarios, with the challenge of coming up with as many original answers as possible. This was designed to measure their level of 'real world creative achievement'. The findings, published in the journal Neuropsychologia, suggest those with the affliction might find it easier to think creatively as they can focus on a wide range of things simultaneously. Darya Zabelina, a PhD psychology student at Northwestern University in Illinois said: 'If funnelled in the right direction, these sensitivities can make life more rich and meaningful, giving experiences more subtlety.'","Inability to shut out irrelevant sounds could be linked to creativity .

"Eating an apple a day does not actually keep the doctor away - but it might stop you going to your pharmacist. Researchers looked at data on 8,399 US adults and initially found evidence to support the proverb. They discovered that those who had one small apple a day had a nine per cent lower chance of visiting the doctor several times a year. However when they adjusted their statistics for other factors, their conclusions changed. The University of Michigan researchers adjusted for ways that ‘apple eaters might be very different from everyone else,’ such as how they were less likely to smoke and be more educated. Eating an apple a day does not actually keep the doctor away - but it might stop you going to your pharmacist. Apple eaters were less likely to use prescription medicines, researchers found . Considering those factors, the study found that people who eat an apple a day were just as likely as everyone else to go to doctors. They were also just as likely to stay overnight in a hospital or visit a mental health professional. Apple eaters were, however, less likely to use prescription medication. Of the 8,399 adults who took part in the study 753, or nine per cent, ate an apple a day while 7,646, or 91 per cent, did not. Lead author Matthew Davis, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan's school of nursing, said: ‘Our findings suggest that the promotion of apple consumption may have limited benefit in reducing national health care spending. ‘In the age of evidence-based assertions, however, there may be merit to saying: ‘An apple a day keeps the pharmacist away.'’ Apples have long been known to promote good health and contain vitamin C, which aids the immune system. They also reduce tooth decay by cleaning the teeth and may even protect your brain cells from conditions like Alzheimer’s. The proverb about eating an apple a day can be traced back to Pembrokeshire in the 1860s where it was said by locals. Apple eaters were less likely to use prescription medicines, less likely to smoke and more educated than non-apple eaters, researchers found . The original version is said to be: ‘Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread’. Over the years it became: ‘An apple a day, no doctor to pay’ and: ‘An apple a days sends the doctor away’. The modern use of the phrase was first recorded in 1922. Wendy Brannen, director of public relations for the US Apple Association, said that the research should not put people off eating apples. She said: ‘While we appreciate the University of Michigan (a top apple-growing state, by the way) took the time to put the ""apple a day"" adage to the test, it's foolish to even imply you shouldn't enjoy a daily apple for your health when centuries of advice and stacks of current research would imply otherwise.’","Nurses wanted to know if 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away' was true .

"A Dutch mother has abducted two of her four children and taken them to join militants fighting for the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Syria. The unnamed 32-year-old  Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. The father of the missing children named the pair as Luca, seven, and his sister Aysha, eight, and said they had been taken without his consent. The woman's two other children are believed to have been handed over to a relative before she left to join the terror group. Abducted: The father of the missing children named the pair as 'Luca', seven, (left) and his sister 'Aysha', eight, (right) and said they had been taken without his consent . The missing woman, who has not yet been named, fled the Netherlands with two of her children last October, the Dutch prosecution's office confirmed this morning. Snatched: Eight-year-old Dutch girl 'Aysha' was abducted by her mother and taken to join ISIS . It is the first known instance of children in the Netherlands being abducted and taken to join ISIS. According to the Dutch newspaper De Limburger, the children's father had previously reported his estranged wife to the police because he was concerned she was planning to travel to Syria. Officers are said to have questioned the woman several times but she denied having intentions to join ISIS and investigators could find no evidence of concrete travel plans. Shortly afterwards the woman vanished from Maastricht with two of the children, prompting Dutch officials to launch a major alert, leading to an international arrest warrant being issued. Despite this the woman later took to Facebook to declare that she and her two children had arrived in the terrorists' de facto capital Raqqa, having used fake passports to travel across Europe. After making the announcement of their arrival in Raqqa on Facebook last October, nothing has been heard from the trio since. Dutch officials said they had no way of telling whether the group were still alive, with prosecutor Bart den Hartigh declaring the recovery of the children 'impossible' as the Netherlands has no legal relationship with either the Syrian regime or the terror group that controls the city of Raqqa. No place for children: The unnamed 32-year-old Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa (pictured) The news comes as an 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. It comes the day after it three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned  on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.","Chechen national, 32, took children from home in Maastricht, Netherlands .

"Yingying Dou ran the essay writing site MyMaster . Up to 70 students face expulsion from Australia's leading universities after being found guilty of cheating by paying a company to write their assignments. Two students from the University of Newcastle have already been expelled and more are facing disciplinary action at four other intuitions after being identified as using the MyMaster company which wrote essays for Chinese international students, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Chinese-born Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly ran the website which charged up to $1000 per assignment and was used by hundreds of students across 12 NSW universities. Ms Dou reportedly had 100 employees working from a Chinatown office on George Street in Sydney before the website was shut down. It was claimed that MyMaster had an annual turnover of $160,000 thanks to international students desperate to pass their courses or too lazy to do the work themselves. The University of Newcastle confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that it had conducted internal investigations and in addition to the two expulsions it suspended eight international students and found 21 others guilty of misconduct. The majority of students found guilty were given fail grades for 2014 subjects. Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website MyMaster website which has now been taken down . Two students from the University of Newcastle have been expelled and eight have been suspended . The four other worst-hit universities told the Herald they were still conducting investigations with accused students – including three at the University of Sydney, 11 at University of Technology Sydney, 19 at University of NSW, and 43 at Macquarie University. The maximum penalty for academic misconduct is expulsion at all institutions except UNSW, where it is suspension. UTS Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Shirley Alexander told the ABC: 'I'm not as surprised as you might think. In higher-education we've had to up the ante in how students are changing the methods of cheating for some time.' She said that the news that flyers advertising the MyMaster essay writing service were posted in UTS toilets was not alarming. 'We find those kinds of things all the time, that's not something that is new,' she said. 'When we find them we do take the number and call them and point out how illegal it is but they do appear all the time that's not something new,' she explained. Students (a stock photo is shown) reportedly paid up to $1000 for their essays to be written for them . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a flyer posted at the University of Technology Sydney said: 'Are you racking your brains on your school work? Do you worry about spending $3000 retaking tuition on the failing subject? Leave your worries to MyMaster and make your study easier!' Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website. The company's Facebook page has also been removed but a holding page shows 605 previously people 'liked' it. She reportedly also runs Yingcredible Tutoring, a page which she has endorsed from her own personal Facebook account. 'We provide commerce subjects tutoring service to university students to help them pass the course,' a description on the page reads. Daily Mail Australia contacted Ms Dou for comment but did not responded. Most university websites display clear advice about plagiarism. The University of Sydney says that while nobody commences their studies with the intent to plagiarise 'many people do, for a variety of reasons'. 'Some students plagiarise because they don't fully understand what plagiarism is, why it is wrong and how it can be avoided. Others plagiarise, because of time or other pressures,' a warning on their website reads. Up to 70 students face expulsion from Australia's leading universities after being found guilty of cheating by paying the company to write their assignments . When handing in work students must satisfy the notion that it is 'all your own work'. Students who have used the MyMaster website could be found guilty of 'dishonest plagiarism', which is when they 'knowingly presenting another person's work as one's own work without appropriate acknowledgement of the source'. And 'engage another person to produce or conduct research for the work, including for payment or other consideration'. A spokesperson for the University of Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'The University of Sydney is unequivocally opposed to academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and fraudulent authorship, and takes seriously any allegations of academic misconduct. Breaches of academic honesty are not tolerated at the University of Sydney.' 'Failure to adhere to the University's high standards of academic merit, intellectual rigour, and ethical behaviour constitutes a breach of the University's Code of Conduct for Students and Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism in Coursework Policy. If proven, academic dishonesty may constitute misconduct, resulting in serious penalties that may include failure or exclusion. 'The University thoroughly investigates all cases of alleged academic dishonesty and provides education and support to assist students to observe the rules of honest scholarship,' they added.","Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly ran the website called MyMaster .

Paul Butler's attempt to become a two-weight world champion ended in failure . Butler was stopped in the eighth round by a brutal uppercut from Zolani Tete . Tete dominated the early rounds and while Butler responded with a strong left-hook in round five, his opponent restored control in the sixth and seventh before landing the decisive blow. 'I knew Paul was a good fighter, but I knew I could knock him out,' Tete told BoxNation. 'Paul is shorter than me. I'm looking forward to defending my title again.' Butler was considered the pre-fight favourite but the 26-year-old conceded he had lost to the better fighter on the night. Tete dominated the early rounds at Liverpool's Echo Arena on Friday . Tete landed the decisive blow in the eighth round to claim the title . 'He was very good and very awkward, a better man on the night,' Butler said. 'I normally have people come towards me.

"Apology: Police officer David Duckenfield today said sorry for failing to admit that he ordered the gates at Hillsborough to be opened . The police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today apologised for lying to officials about ordering the gates to the stadium to be opened, leading to a deadly crush which killed 96 Liverpool fans. As the disaster unfolded, David Duckenfield told officials from the Football Association that 'some fans have got in through a gate' - which he admitted today was a 'terrible lie'. The former officer said that he 'apologised unreservedly' for failing to confess that he had personally ordered police to open the gates in order to relieve overcrowding at the turnstiles of the Sheffield stadium. After the gates were opened fans rushed into the terraces, causing dozens of people to be crushed under the weight of bodies. Mr Duckenfield was the officer overseeing the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Notthingham Forest on April 15, 1989, even though he had been promoted just two weeks previously and had never been in charge of policing a football match before. Yesterday he told the inquest into the fans' deaths that he was 'not the best man for the job' given his inexperience, and today he gave evidence about his decision to open Gate C eight minutes before kick-off. After the gate opened an estimated 2,000 fans poured in, heading straight for a tunnel leading directly to the already-packed central pens three and four, behind the goal. Mr Duckenfield, 70, today recounted a conversation he had with FA officials Graham Kelly and Glen Kirton minutes after the match was abandoned amidst the chaos. He denied the suggestion that he had said the gates were 'stormed', and claimed he told the men 'something like, ""Some fans have got in through a gate.""' He continued: 'I was pointing out that fans had gained unauthorised access to the ground. What I didn't say to Mr Kelly, I didn't say, ""I have authorised the opening of the gates,"" I didn't tell him that.' Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquest, asked: 'Do you consider now that you told them a lie?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'Yes, ma'am. I certainly now appreciate it was wrong and completely open to misinterpretation.' He added: 'I was probably deeply ashamed, embarrassed, greatly distressed and I probably didn't want to admit to myself or anyone else, what the situation is. 'What I would like to say the Liverpool families is this, I regret that omission and I shall regret it to my dying day. 'I said something rather hurriedly, without considering the position, without thinking of the consequences and the trauma, the heartache and distress that the inference would have caused to those people who were already in a deep state of shock, who were distressed. 'I apologise unreservedly to the families and I hope they believe it is a very, very sincere apology.' Evidence: Mr Duckenfield pictured in the dock, where he talked about his actions on April 15, 1989 . Relatives: Campaigners Margaret Aspinall, left, and Jenni Hicks, right, pictured outside the inquest . Asked if he was trying to hide the truth because he was responsible for the tragic events, Mr Duckenfield said: 'I think in a crisis, and probably in this shock and in stress, I said something I deeply regret. 'I'm a very honest person. I don't tell lies. I don't mislead. I set very, very high standards, not only in myself, but my colleagues in the service and my family. 'No one, but no one can understand my behaviour that day - least of all me. That was a terrible lie, in that everybody knew the truth.' Earlier Mr Duckenfield said he now realised 'in hindsight' the 'most likely' route fans would take once Gate C was open was to go down the tunnel facing them and in to the central pens. Miss Lambert said: 'You say in hindsight you recognise that's where a number of fans might have gone. Do you think as a match commander the consequences of the decision you made, and in particular thought as to where the fans might go, is something you should have considered?' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I think it is fair to say that is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life, that I did not foresee where fans would go when they came in through the gates.' The commanding officer, who was stationed in the police control box with a bank of CCTV monitors, said he was 'shocked' at the request to open the gates from Superintendent Roger Marshall after police became 'overwhelmed' by the number of fans gathered at the turnstiles. Crush: 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground's perimeter fence . Mr Duckenfield said: 'I don't mind telling you I was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking, ""Where are these people going to go if I open the gates?""' He said another message then came through on the police radio from Mr Marshall saying: 'If we don't open the gates someone's going to get killed.' The witness continued: 'That really was a shocking, terrifying moment to feel you had got to that situation.' Another officer in the police box, Bernard Murray, then said to him: 'Are you going to open the gates?' the jury heard. Mr Duckenfield said: 'I remember saying to him quite clearly, Mr Murray, if people are going to die I have no option but to open the gates. Open the gates.' He said he was left 'no option' and thought fans would feel 'relief and comfort' in being released from the crush of the turnstiles on to the concourse. Mr Duckenfield added: 'I think it's fair to say I was overcome by the enormity of the situation and the decision I had to make. 'And as a result of that I was so overcome, probably with the emotion of us having got into that situation, that my mind, for a moment, went blank.' Mr Duckenfield said there was 'every possibility' that he panicked, and accepted that it was a mistake not to have taken steps to close the tunnel leading to the central pens. Chaos: Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster after climbing over perimeter fences . The gate remained open for five minutes, allowing fans to flow into the ground, but the officer said today that he did not think about where those supporters would go. He admitted: 'It certainly was a mistake and an oversight. Under the circumstances, with my limited ability, I accept it was a mistake - a mistake I shouldn't have made, a mistake I regret bitterly. 'It was a grave mistake and I apologise profusely.' At 2.59pm, when the match kicked off, Mr Duckenfield said he looked towards the Leppings Lane terrace and had seen 'nothing untoward'. Miss Lambert suggested that it might have been 'obvious' that fans were climbing out of the pens because of the number of people entering through Gate C. 'It was not obvious to me,' Mr Duckenfield said. 'I thought there may have been some crowd disorder or some problem and I was awaiting information. I didn't know what to think. I was looking and waiting for information.' Asked when he had realised that something was badly wrong, the officer said: 'I have a recollection that a young man came from the perimeter track behind the goal and either collapsed or fell down. 'He was hobbling, I remember seeing him hobbling, and there was a sudden realisation that this was not a pitch invasion, this was a serious situation.' The hearing continues tomorrow, when Mr Duckenfield will be questioned by a lawyer representing victims' families.

"From March 2018 every new car sold in the European Union will legally have to be equipped with eCall technology. This will consist of a 'black box' that detects a crash and automatically calls the emergency services for help.

This will consist of a 'black box' that detects a crash and automatically calls the emergency services for help. Car manufacturers, including BMW, already include the technology in their latest models (i3 pictured) The European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee voted in favour of the draft EU rules on Tuesday. And the rules are expected to become law after a full European Parliament in April. The plans were first proposed last May, and in June 2014 the EU passed guidelines that required all members to have the technology ready to handle eCalls set up by October 2017. At the time of the original proposals the Government said the gadget will add at least £100 to the cost of vehicles. The technology contains a mobile phone-like SIM card designed to transmit the vehicle’s location to emergency services in the event of a crash. It is fitted inside a 'black box' built into the vehicle. An SOS button near the dashboard, linked to a SIM card, allows drivers to call 999 quickly. And if airbags are deployed it automatically sends a text message to emergency services with the car’s location - as well as its unique vehicle ID number.

It urged ‘stricter safeguards’ against ‘unlawful’ use of personal data. Brussels insists eCall will save 2,500 lives a year by speeding up emergency services response times. Some car manufacturers, including BMW and Volvo, already include eCall devices in their latest models.  But voluntary take-up has been low across the industry, which led to the new rules.","Under EU plans, cars sold from March 2018 will have a 'black box' device .

"We've all been the victim of a delayed or cancelled flight, or had to desperately track down lost luggage, and it appears the stars as well are no strangers to airport woes. Actor John Barrowman had a miserable flying experience when dealing with Canadian airline, WestJet, yesterday and took to twitter to publicly vent his frustration. If the vague message, 'how did you screw things up sooo badly?' was not clear enough, Barrowman included a unhappy thumbs-down selfie to express his displeasure to his 351,000 fans. The actor took to twitter to publicly express his frustration at the Canadian low-cost airline . The low-cost carrier tweeted back enquiring about the problem, but Barrowman vaguely replied that the issue was too long to explain over Twitter and he did not get the service he paid for. WestJet Airlines replied asking for his number so someone could ring him to resolve the issue. The Dr Who and Torchwood star said he was about to board the flight and he would be in touch after filming the next day. Barrowman, 48, is currently filming for US TV series Arrow, a modern retelling of the DC Comic character Green Arrow, where he plays crazed killer, Malcolm Merlyn. A WestJet representative got in touch with Barrowman via twitter to resolve the matter but was told he would be in contact the next day . Mysterious! Barrowman did not say what had occurred but said he would explain in more detail away from the public eye over the phone . The star could not resist a cheeky hashtag plug for his current US TV series role along with his complaint . Several people tweeted in defence of WestJet, including one woman who said that she is a frequent flyer and the airline has been close to perfection. Barrowman replied saying he was 'not hating' and the matter was 'about principle and money'. Despite slamming the airline he stated he would use them again.

"The White House confirmed on Monday that President Barack Obama knew about Hillary Clinton's private email address because he emailed her at it during her tenure of secretary of state. When Obama said in an interview that aired Sunday that he found out Clinton used a private email account to conduct official business at 'the same time as everybody else learned it through news reports,' what he meant was that was the first he'd heard of her exclusive use of use of personal email and of her private server, his spokesman clarified this afternoon. 'The president, as I think many people expected, did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. 'I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other.' Scroll down for video . 'Same time as everybody else': President Obama told CBDS News he learned Hilary Clinton had used a private email account for  state business during her tenure as Secretary of State when news reports surfaced . In an interview with CBS News during his trip to Selma, Alabama, Obama had defended former Secretary of State Clinton and applauded her decision to release the emails. 'I'm glad that Hillary's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed,' Obama said. 'I think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need,' 'The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the Blackberry I carry around, all those records are available and archived,' Obama said. Clinton, seen as the front-runner for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2016, said on Wednesday she wanted the State Department to publish her emails so that the public could read them. Pressed by reporters to acknowledge that the president had in fact emailed his secretary of state during her four-year tenure,his spokesman said Monday, 'The point that the president was making is not that he didn’t know Secretary Clinton’s email address, he did.' 'But he was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act,' Earnest explained. Earnest said he did not know when the White House's Office of Legal Council first knew of Clinton's private email and server system. 'It is the responsibility of individual agencies to establish an email system and to make sure those emails as created are properly recorded and maintained,' he again told reporters during the briefing, standing by his statements from last week. He also stuck by the White House's stance that there's no 'reason to doubt' that Clinton's team has not done 'exactly what they said they would do' and give the State Department a copy of all of her work-related emails. 'But ultimately that is the responsibility of Secretary Clinton and her team,' he said. Responding to a question about a House committee's investigation into the 2012 assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and committee chair Trey Gowdy's suspicions that Hillary may be withholding pertinent emails, Earnest challenged the reporter or Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, to produce evidence of foul play. And if Gowdy 'has specific questions about specific emails that should be produced in response to a legitimate congressional inquiry, then he should raise that directly with State Department officials, Earnest said. Asked by the same reporter, Bloomberg's Justin Sink, if the White House feels it now needs to step in because the State Department 'doesn't seem to be doing its job,' Earnest said that was 'one step too far.' The State Department has cooperated at 'great length' with the eight committees have investigated the Benghazi terrorist attack, he contended. Moments later, he again went after Gowdy, saying, he 'would hazard a guess that if the White House were intimately involved in that kind of effort to review email and make determinations about what should be provided to Congress, that he'd be complaining about that on national television as well.' The growing controversy over Clinton's use of personal email for work while she was U.S. secretary of state threatens to cloud the expected launch of her campaign. A senior State Department official told Reuters last Thursday that a review of her emails would not happen quickly. 'The review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set,' the official said. The State Department has said there was no prohibition during Clinton's tenure on using personal email for official business as long as it was preserved. A total of 55,000 pages of documents covering the time Clinton was in office has been turned over, according to the State Department. But Clinton and her aides controlled that process, and the emails were not archived on government servers. Transparency: The president applauded the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nominee for saying she would release the emails following criticism .","Obama said in an interview that he learned Clinton used a private email account to conduct official business at 'the same time as everybody else'

The team consists of nine photographers and three tech specialists, who began their mission in 2006. AirPano took to the skies after creating a bucket list of the 100 Best Places on the Planet. They planned to work their way through the list and now have a portfolio of 230 locations shot from above. Project coordinator Sergey Semenov revealed the team initially worked with spherical panoramas on land, which then led to them using planes and helicopters. Now they rely on drones to capture their beautiful panoramic shots. Their work includes the most famous urban skylines such as New York, Paris and Barcelona, as well as featuring natural landscapes like waterfalls and volcanos. They next hope to add Portugal, Indonesia, Japan and the United Kingdom to their extensive list.

"The federal government is hoping to use reformed  jihadists who have returned from the Middle East to combat the flow of extremist propaganda circulating online, a new report suggests. The method of countering online propaganda from extremist groups like the Islamic State has been used in Britain, where renowned former militants attempt to deter prospective jihadists from going abroad. The news of the government enlisting reformed jihadis  comes after Attorney-General George Brandis last month announced an $18 million campaign to battle extremist  propaganda, reports The Age. Attorney-General George Brandis last month announced an $18 million campaign to battle extremist propaganda online . The operation, which will be launched in July, will employ a team of  technology experts to assess the impact of extremist propaganda online. The government also plans to seek the help of platforms such as Google, Twitter and Facebook, to counter extremist messages. The urgency of the cause was brought to national attention this week, when it was reported that 18-year-old Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi-who was radicalised and lured to the Middle East online- was apparently killed while carrying out a suicide car bombing in Iraq. Bilardi, who left materials for improvised explosives at his family home, was identified by Fairfax Media this week as the Islamic State recruit declared the 'white jihadi' in a viral image of him in front of an Islamic State flag. A viral image of Melbourne teenager Jake Bilardi (centre), who was believed to have been killed this week while carrying out a suicide car bombing in Iraq . The apparent death of Bilardi-who was  radicalised online-brings the urgency of Jihadist propaganda to a national podium . The use of former jihadists as poster boys is precarious for the Australian government, as they need to ensure the subjects have not committed any crimes or been prosecuted in the past. It is illegal to fight with a listed terrorist organisation, to fight against government forces in a foreign country and to travel to parts of Iraq and Syria without a lawful reason. Furthermore, the government would need to keep their support for the individual clandestine, since a government allegiance would thwart the individual's credibility in the eyes of the would-be jihadis. The use of reformed jihadis to deter radicalisation is precarious, since the government cannot endorse criminals, and fighting for a terrorist organisation is against the law . Muhammad Manwar Ali, a reformed jihadist who now works with the British government to dissuade young men from partaking in Middle Eastern conflicts . One example of a reformed jihadist being used for this cause is Muhammad Manwar Ali, who works with the British government to foil the spread of radicalisation, reports New York Times. Mr Ali, who has appeared on prominent media platforms such as ITV to speak out against young men travelling to partake in Middle Eastern conflicts, fought as a jihadi himself in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Now he runs an educational centre in Ipswitch, eastern Britain, where he tries to deter young men from the teachings of radical Sheiks and enlighten them to the complexities of the war in the middle east. Abdullah-X, a cartoon made by another former jihadist to deter young men from radicalisation . Another British reformed extremist who chooses to remain anonymous has even created a cartoon character for the cause named Abdullah-X. The character appears in a number of comics and a YouTube channel, which has received hundreds of thousands of views since being uploaded last year. In an exclusive interview with Sky News, the cartoonist wrote 'I have the knowledge, the background and the experience to understand that narratives such as the one driven by extremist groups have beaten mainstream society in access to the internet."" While the federal government is believed to be seeking a suitable candidate to voice their message, they have yet to come across one that fits the criteria.","Using former jihadis to counter radicalisation is a method used in Britain .

"A garage owner who helped to smuggle £37 million worth of heroin into the country in a specially adapted X-type Jaguar has been jailed. A quarter of a ton of the drug had been hidden in a series of secret compartments inside the battered old car - which had no ignition or electrics and couldn't be driven - as it arrived at the port of Felixstowe on a container ship from Pakistan. Attique Sami, 44, was the third member of a drug smuggling crime gang to be jailed over the plot when he received a sentence of 19 years yesterday. A garage owner who helped to smuggle £37 million worth of heroin into the country in a specially adapted X-type Jaguar has been jailed . Scans revealed that a quarter of a ton of the drug had been hidden in a series of secret compartments inside the battered old car - which had no ignition or electrics and couldn't be driven - as it arrived at the port of Felixstowe on a container ship from Pakistan . Heroin was concealed in the bumpers, wheel arches, dashboard, central console, spare wheel compartment, engine and rear seating of the vehicle. Paperwork with the vehicle made out it had been shipped to the UK to be repaired. But investigators were able to find the drugs after the Jaguar was scanned with X-ray equipment, and its secret cargo was revealed. Attique Sami, 44, was the third member of a drug smuggling crime gang to be jailed over the plot when he received a sentence of 19 years yesterday . Sami of Ilford was found guilty of conspiring to import and supply heroin following a trial at Luton Crown Court. His conviction follows the sentencing of two other men, Noman Qureshi, 32, from Bradford, and Israr Khan, 35, from Luton, in October last year. They were sentenced to 21 and 18 years respectively. The smugglers did not realise they were already under surveillance by a crack team from the National crime Agency soon after the container ship arrived at the port in Suffolk in December 2013 . On the evening of Friday 6 December 2013, Qureshi drove from his home in Bradford, picked up Khan in Luton, and drove to a hotel in Ilford. Sami arrived in his Porsche 911 to meet with them to discuss where to unload the heroin from the car. The Jaguar, which had been shipped to the UK from Pakistan, was driven on the back of a low-loader to an address in Dagenham during the early hours of 7 December . Qureshi and Khan met it, but shortly after left the scene. They were arrested later that morning in Luton. The Jaguar was seized and examined by specialist Border Force search officers. They recovered 316 separate packages of heroin totalling 230 kilos. If cut and sold the drugs would have had a likely potential street value of £37.2 million. Sami was arrested in February 2014. NCA investigators linked him to a phone that had regularly been used to contact Qureshi prior to the heroin importation. The Class A drug was packed into the boot (pictured), dashboard, central console and spare wheel compartment. Even the car's engine had been removed to make room for the lucrative haul . Black packages of heroin appear to be concealed inside the back seats, removed by police . Paperwork with the vehicle made out it had been shipped to the UK to be repaired. But investigators were able to find the drugs after the Jaguar was scanned with X-ray equipment, and its secret cargo was revealed . Jailed: Noman Qureshi of Bradford, West Yorkshire (right), was jailed for 21 years and Israr Khan of Luton, Bedfordshire (left) was given an 18-year sentence. Police said they were part of an international crime group . National Crime Agency Branch Commander David Norris said: 'Sami played a crucial part in this conspiracy - his role would have been to recover the drugs concealed within the car. 'This group had international contacts and planned to import hundreds of kilos of high-purity heroin to the UK in what was a quite remarkable smuggling attempt. 'The car in which the drugs were hidden had virtually every spare bit of space filled with heroin. 'But they were unaware their moves were being monitored by NCA investigators, who prevented them from putting these harmful drugs on the streets.'","Attique Sami was third member of drug smuggling crime gang to be jailed .

"An American woman charged with premeditated murder in the death of her socialite mother on Indonesia's Bali island told a court on Wednesday that her boyfriend killed her mother in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby. Heather Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are being tried separately by Denpasar District Court. The pair from Chicago, Illinos, are charged with murdering Sheila von Wiese-Mack last August at the St. Regis hotel on Bali and face possible death by firing squad if found guilty. Von Wiese-Mack's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack, 19, told an Indonesian court on Wednesday that her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, killed Shelia von Wiese-Mack in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby . In her first questioning in court on Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument. Von Wiese-Mack objected to their relationship. 'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Mack said. 'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.' Mack said when she left the bathroom, she found Schaefer on the bed trying to give her artificial respiration. 'Tommy said my mother was not breathing,' she said. Mack said she also tried to revive her but it didn't work. She said they panicked and thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the U.S. Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. 'We panicked and didn't know what to do,' she said. Mack answered 'no' when the judge asked whether she wished her mother dead. Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer, accused of murdering Sheila von Wiese-Mack, were pictured in handcuffs as they arrived for their latest court appearance in Bali on Wednesday . Heavily pregnant Mack (right), 19, and Tommy Schaefer (second from left), 21, sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of von Wiese-Mack . Mack and Schaefer arrived in court, handcuffed together and wearing matching orange waistcoats. The pair sat in court in front of evidence believed to be a suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of Mack's 62-year-old mother. According to the indictment, Schaefer battered von Wiese-Mack with a fruit bowl handle in her room following an argument over the hotel bill. It says Mack helped stuff her mother's body into the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it. The indictment says they then placed the suitcase in the trunk of a taxi and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did. Hotel security guards are said to have seen blood spots on the grey suitcase and the taxi driver went to the police, who then made the gruesome discovery. The pair were wearing matching orange waistcoats as they arrived for their latest court appearance on Wednesday . Sheila Von Wiese-Mack's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel . The first witness to testify at Schaefer's trial, a bellboy named Arifin, said he saw the couple taking a suitcase on a baggage cart toward the lobby on August 12. He said during proceedings in February that he asked them about the hotel bill, which according to a receptionist hadn't been paid, but Mack refused to respond. 'They asked me to call a taxi, but they refused when I offered to help put the bag into the taxi,' he said. 'They argued that the contents were fragile, and refused to be assisted.' Arifin, who uses a single name, said he heard about the murder later from police. The second witness was I Putu Adi Marta, a technician who examined the hotel's security videos on August 12. 'I was asked to check because a couple, a man and a woman, were said to have escaped without paying the hotel bill,' he said. Marta said the video recordings showed that Schaefer and Mack used the emergency stairs several times to go between the third and sixth floors. Mack and her mother were staying in a room on the third floor, while Schaefer was staying on the sixth floor. 'The man walked up and down from the third to the sixth floor, changed his shirt once and brought a white cloth,' he said. 'They also were shown bringing a large package from the third to the sixth floor.' The pair (pictured together in a cell), from Chicago, Illinois, are being tried separately by the Denpasar District Court . A police officer also testified that he was among five police who arrested the couple on August 13 at the Bali Wisata Hotel in the Kuta area, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the St. Regis hotel. 'First they refused to be taken without being accompanied by lawyers from their government,' I Made Ariyana said. He said they also refused to talk or be photographed at the Kuta police station. Schaefer did not object to any of the testimony. Prosecutors said before visiting Bali, Mack had suggested that Schaefer hire someone for $50,000 to kill her mother, who objected to their relationship. Mack and her mother had arrived first in Bali and were staying in a room on the third floor of the hotel, while Schaefer arrived later and was staying on the sixth floor.

"Yesterday, the Mail published a poignant photograph of actress Angelina Jolie's family, showing how cancer has claimed the lives of many of her relatives, including her mother, aunt and grandmother. Her mother, the actress Marcheline Bertrand, died of ovarian cancer at the age of 56 in 2007. Her grandmother Lois Bertrand died of cancer aged 45 and her aunt Debbie - her mother's sister - lost her battle with the disease at 61. This strong family history comes from a mutation of the BRCA1 gene, which dramatically raises the risk of ovarian and breast cancer. Scroll down for video . Angelina revealed she's had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, after a preventative double mastectomy . To prevent herself following in the footsteps of her female relatives, Angelina last week revealed she's had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (she had a 50 per cent risk of developing ovarian cancer). This comes two years after a preventative double mastectomy because of her raised risk of breast cancer. But while many people know that a greater risk of developing these cancers can be inherited, what is less well known is that it's not just down the female line; the risk can be passed on from your father's side of the family, too. Catherine Murley, a 44-year-old commercial manager from Rugby, inherited a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer from her father as result of a faulty BRCA1 gene. 'I never knew you could inherit a breast and ovarian cancer gene from a male relative,' she says. She only became aware of the faulty BRCA1 gene in her family tree last June, after suddenly hearing from her father Mike, 68, a retired teacher, after years of little contact. 'I received a text from my dad saying: ""Can we talk?"" ' she says. Her parents divorced when she was four and her mother brought her up with her sister Sinead, 40, and brother Andrew, 39. 'When I phoned my dad that evening, he explained that my cousin - his sister's daughter - had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and the family had found out she had the inherited faulty BRCA1 gene,' she says. Catherine Murley inherited the ovarian cancer gene from her father . 'My aunt - her mother - had died of ovarian cancer when she was in her 40s. After my cousin was diagnosed at the age of 40, the rest of that side of my dad's family went for genetic testing. 'That's when my dad was found to be positive for the faulty gene.' Catherine's father was told this meant he had a raised risk of prostate cancer and male breast cancer, and a slightly higher chance of pancreatic cancer. He was concerned that the faulty gene could have been passed to his children. 'I was aware of the BRCA1 connection because I had a close friend with it who died from breast cancer,' says Catherine. 'But I assumed it was something related to women and didn't know it could be passed by men, too.' It's a common misconception, says Dr Adam Rosenthal, a gynaecological oncologist at University College London Hospital. 'Unfortunately, many women and some doctors disregard the paternal side of the family. They don't recognise the importance of a pattern of cancers on their father's side, so denying themselves the opportunity for gene testing to clarify their level of risk.' We all inherit two copies of every gene - one from our mother and one from our father. So if either parent has a mutant copy, a child has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it. Assuming it's just the mother's line that you need to worry about is an understandable mistake, says Dr Rosenthal, as these genes tend to cause female cancers. 'However, they are not passed down on the female sex chromosome, like some inherited diseases. Men carry them just as easily as women,' he says. 'But women are more vulnerable to the effects.' While a faulty BRCA gene raises a man's risk of prostate cancer to 10 to 25 per cent, they raise a woman's risk of ovarian cancer to 15 to 45 per cent, and the risk of breast cancer to 45 to 90 per cent. 'No one knows why the risk is higher in women, but it may relate to female hormones acting with the faulty gene to promote cancer,' says Dr Rosenthal, who is also consultant gynaecologist at Weymouth Street Hospital, London. He says it's crucial people are aware of any history of cancer in their family. 'Men need to be careful not to disregard their mother's side of the family in the same way women should not ignore their father's side,' he says. 'If you're in any doubt about the implications of a pattern of cancers in your family, discuss it with your GP. They can refer you for genetic testing.' After hearing the news from her father, Catherine contacted her brother and sister, warning them they needed to be checked. Her GP put her on a waiting list to have genetic testing. Her father had waited almost ten months to be tested, but Catherine didn't want to wait this long. 'I was 43, which felt quite old to find out you have faulty BRCA1,' she says. 'The thought of it kept me awake at night. My fear was that I might already have cancer - I knew ovarian cancer was notoriously hard to diagnose.' It led to the commercial manager having ovaries and fallopian tubes removed and having a mastectomy . Symptoms include persistent pelvic and stomach pain, bloating and nausea after eating, as well as feeling full quicker. Catherine paid £700 to have a test at a private screening clinic, which involved giving a blood sample. There are hundreds of different mutations of the BRCA1 gene, but as she knew which mutation she might have - as it would be the same one as her father - the laboratory was able to speed up its analysis. Three weeks later, Catherine went back with her husband Martyn to be told her test results. 'I had a bad feeling from the outset,' says Catherine. 'But when the gene counsellor said I had the defective gene, I began to cry. I knew from that moment that my life was on a different path. I texted my dad and family straight away with my news.' Catherine was told she was at equal risk of ovarian and breast cancer. But for reasons experts do not fully understand, in her family the mutant gene more commonly manifested itself as ovarian cancer in the female line and prostate cancer in men. Women with a faulty BRCA1 gene can have annual mammograms to screen for breast cancer or have a preventative mastectomy. There is no reliable way to screen for ovarian cancer. Catherine quickly decided what she wanted to do. 'My close friend who had the faulty BRCA gene relied solely on annual breast screening. She didn't make it. I wanted to take away any risk of getting either cancer through surgery while I still could.' In September, she underwent keyhole surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes - the operation was performed by Dr Rosenthal. Examination of the fallopian tubes revealed pre-cancerous cells. 'I felt it confirmed that I had made the right decision in pushing to have surgery as soon as possible,' says Catherine. 'No one could have said when the cells would have turned into something more serious.' Two months later, she underwent a double mastectomy, with surgeons using tissue from her stomach to form new breasts. The breast tissue was found to be clear of cancerous cells. A report published a few months ago in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found more widespread genetic testing for cancer-causing mutations would save lives and reduce the amount spent on treating cancers. The Eve Appeal, the UK charity dedicated to gynaecological cancer research, is calling for all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer to be tested for faulty BRCA genes. Chief executive Athena Lamnisos says it would increase experts' understanding of these cancers and allow women to warn their family members, too. Though her brother is still waiting for genetic testing, Catherine's sister heard shortly before Christmas that she, too, has the defective gene. She will undergo the same surgery as Catherine. 'I have thanked my cousin for alerting us,' says Catherine. 'I've been able to take action to protect myself from cancer.' eveappeal.org.uk .","Catherine Murley, 44, from Rugby, inherited BRCA1 gene from her dad .

"An MI5 agent was allegedly recruited by a terrorist mastermind in Syria and sent back to Britain in a plot to launch a devastating attack against his handlers. The agent was recruited by MI5 as an undercover informant within the radical Islamic community and he then travelled to Syria where he became part of a jihadist group. But he apparently double-crossed his British handlers and returned to London with plans to launch an 'insider attack' in the capital. The Mail on Sunday has been aware of the alleged plot for more than a year but agreed to previous requests from the security services not to publish the story for 'national security' reasons. Parts of the plot were reported in a story in The Mail on Sunday last year, in which we revealed that the jihadist, who has a British passport, had plans to attack Central London and that David Cameron had been briefed about the details. This newspaper is aware of the man's identity and further details of the investigation but are not printing them for legal reasons. A long undercover operation was run by MI5 to try to identify linked individuals who might be travelling back from Syria to launch similar attacks but this investigation has now concluded, meaning we can now report the fact that he was a potential 'double agent'. The revelations come as the terror threat in the UK continues to be 'severe' but as MI5 faces difficult questions about its tactic of recruiting agents who are known Islamic extremists. Supporters of Mohammed Emwazi, the Islamic State executioner known as Jihadi John, have claimed that MI5 harassed him and similar allegations have been made by the family of Michael Adebolajo, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. The security services refuse to answer such questions because they stick by a strict policy to 'neither confirm nor deny' whether individuals have been approached or recruited – a policy they stick to even after suspects have been accused of serious crimes. However, The Mail on Sunday can disclose that the man worked for MI5 for a period before he decided to travel abroad in 2012. MI5 faces difficult questions about its tactic of recruiting agents who are known terrorists, while supporters of Mohammed Emwazi (pictured) have claimed that MI5 harassed him . Investigators believe he met a terrorist mastermind with designs on attacking the West who encouraged him to plan an attack. Back in Britain, information suggested he began plotting to attack the MI5 handlers who had recruited him and set about trying to buy automatic weapons in this country or abroad. The alleged 'double agent' was apparently planning to use the firearms to stage a murderous attack on the public in an echo of the Kenyan shopping mall massacre last year, sources said. He remained in contact with his jihadi controller, a terrorist mastermind who is thought to have established links to Britain. The agent also joined up with another extremist and they approached two other men for help in obtaining the equipment, but these other men did not agree to help them. MI5 were sufficiently concerned by an intercepted communication they received that they launched an emergency operation to apprehend the man. Scotland Yard's firearms unit was sent to Central London when investigations suggested he was close to launching his attack. The man was detained for questioning and remains in custody. However, no firearms were discovered linking him to a plot and it appears the security services' fears of an imminent attack were unfounded. There has been growing concern from within the security services that there could be 'blow-back' from the conflict in Syria, where hundreds of young Britons have joined the fighting. Eleven months after the agent was allegedly planning his attack, police and MI5 rounded up another cell linked to IS also allegedly planning a gun attack in Central London. Five men are currently awaiting trial. Some details of how MI5 go about recruitment have been released in recent months as part of an investigation by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. They often approach individuals they are investigating in order to try to recruit them as agents, known as Covert Human Intelligence Sources. They then assess them on their suitability, their access to intelligence, personal qualities and their motivation for working with MI5. Recruiting a target is seen as a 'positive outcome' as it means they have reduced the risk, gained increased 'visibility' of their activity and have a new source of intelligence.","An MI5 agent was allegedly recruited by a terrorist mastermind in Syria .

"A NSW Police dog named Marco made headlines this week for saving the life of a missing man, after finding him stuck in a river and clinging to a tree in an area that had already been searched. Now another police dog has conducting another incredible rescued in in strikingly similar circumstances, after NSW Police dog Ulrich saved an elderly man who disappeared from hospital . On Monday, an 86-year-old man went missing from Maitland Hospital and a desperate three-day long search ensued. The man has been identified as Herbert 'Nobby' Bartlett and he had been in hospital recovering from a stroke he suffered six weeks ago, according to The Daily Telegraph. After four days missing he was found a mere eight minute walk from the hospital on Bonar Street, thanks to a dog who assumed his duties on Thursday morning and led police straight to the site. Police dog Ulrich found a lost man, 86-year-old Herbert Bartlett who was lost for four days in tall grass . Central Hunter Local Area Command had searched a number of towns using a great number of resources, including police officers, the SES and the Dog Unit. One of these dogs became an unassuming hero - a two-year-old German Shepherd named Ulrich. For almost four days Mr Bartlett was lost and disorientated laying helplessly in tall grass next to a lake. Police had already searched the area and surrounds numerous times but did not locate the lost man. However on Thursday morning, Ulrich was called in to investigate and reportedly led police straight to Mr Bartlett, locating the lost man by 11am. Fortunately, Mr Bartlett's condition reportedly had not deteriorate significantly despite his ordeal, according to The Daily Telegraph. The remarkable rescue came just days after an almost identical black German Shepherd saved an elderly man in similar circumstances . Police dog Marco found a dementia patient in an area that had also been scoured by police on the Central Coast - just an hour away from Ulrich's rescue in Maitland. Police were called to an aged care home at Mardi, on the NSW Central Coast, on Saturday night after a 65-year-old dementia patient was reported missing. The man had failed to return to the Wyong Aged Care Facility after going outside earlier in the day. A NSW Police dog named Marco has saved the life of a 65-year-old dementia patient on the central coast . Officers called at about 9pm searched nearby streets, a train station and the banks of the Wyong River with no success, prompting police to call in the Dog Unit to assist . Officers called at about 9pm searched nearby streets, a train station and the banks of the Wyong River with no success, prompting police to call in the Dog Unit to assist. One police dog - Marco – who was searching near the river repeatedly led his attached officer Senior Constable Patrick Summers to a specific spot on the river's steep embankment that had previously been searched with no luck. Snr Const Summers searched through the area's thick foliage and found the man stuck in the water and hidden behind a branch he was clinging onto just before 1am on Sunday. 'Even when I was right on him, I had my torch on him, I still couldn't make him out until I began shouting his name and there was a bit of movement and I thought ""wow"",' he told the Daily Telegraph. Marco – who was searching near the river - repeatedly led his attached officer Senior Constable Patrick Summers to a specific spot on the river's steep embankment that had previously been searched with no luck . 'Marco was persistent in leading me there.' Police said the man was in too much shock to call out, and would not have been able to hold on overnight putting him at risk of hypothermia or drowning. The man was rescued and treated for minor injuries by paramedics on the scene.

"There are only two places on earth where  tectonic plates are visible above sea level: Kenya's Rift Valley, and in the south west of Iceland. On Mount Hengill, an active lava field, just outside Þingvellir National Park, the striking ION hotel stands on a craggy outcrop close to where the North American and Eurasian plates meet, drifting further and further apart, each year. Boiling water bubbles just 25ft underground here, so when it was built on the site of a geothermal power plant, its creators had to use building materials seven times stronger than standard materials used in Reykjavík. The striking ION Hotel is situated on Mount Hengill,  an active volcano whose last eruption was around 2,000 years ago . The 45-room hotel is an extension and renovation of the old workers' quarters of the Nesjavellir geothermal power station,  bought  in 2011, with the intention of being the only hotel in this isolated - and beautiful - part of the country. ION makes use of Iceland's unique geography in two ways: the biothermal energy is harnessed in a spectacular outdoor natural hot spring; and a glass building - the Northern Lights Bar - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays. Owner Sigurlaug Sverrisdóttir, who was born and raised in the region, knows all too about extreme weather, and said the Northern Lights never get old. She says: 'This respect for Mother Nature is in our blood; our parents and grandparents certainly knew not to mess with her. One month before I was born, in January 1973, there was an eruption on the Westman Island, a small island south of Iceland. A glass extension to the building - the Northern Lights Bar - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays . ION is surrounded by natural hot springs, which provide geothermal hot water and energy to the hotel's own natural outdoor pool . Rooms at the ION hotel start at  £184 (bed and breakfast) Go Green offer tours green and sustainable tours of Iceland . For flights, see icelandair.co.uk . 'Overnight almost the entire island was covered in lava. The rescue to move the islanders to the mainland was successful mainly due to the fact that all of the fishing boats were in harbour as these as were too rough for the locals to fish. 'The first boat left with habitants to reach the mainland only 30 minutes after the volcano erupted. Even though I was born here, I’m still fascinated about the lava, moss landscape around ION. 'I still feel amazed when I see the Northern Lights dancing in the sky on one of my late returns from work. Even though you have experienced it several times before it is different when you are outside of the city, it's much more intense. The Northern Lights bar  has floor-to-ceiling glass windows on three sides, making it the perfect vantage point for watching aurora borealis . Inside,  there's a modern, natural  aesthetic created by Icelandic wool throws, Icelandic art, and flower vases, hand-blown by local artists . 'I also thrive from the energy; I find immense power in the Icelandic nature. Hence the reason we chose ION for the hotel's name.' Everything about the hotel screams Iceland. Inside, lava, reclaimed wood and Icelandic wool are used to furnish rooms, bathroom products are made from Icelandic herbs and everything from the bed linen to the restaurant is organic and fair trade, in line with the island's strong emphasis on preserving its natural beauty. To experience the tectonic plates up close, the hotel offers snorkelling and diving trips to Silfra, the world's most easily accessible tectonic fissure, where visibility exceeds 330ft. It is here that you can touch the continents of America and Europe at the same time. Among the moss and lava: The ION hotel is designed to make use of and complement its rugged and beautiful surroundings . The restaurant - aiming to be Iceland's first with a Michelin star - serves up such delicacies such as reindeer, onions, spruce and bone marrow, smoked bone marrow ice cream, sea buckthorn and malt molasses and Icelandic langoustine, locally caught Arctic char and skyr (homemade yoghurt). Venturing into the wilderness, guests are offered a range of activities from horse riding in mountains around Öflus, fly fishing on Lake Þingvellir, Sólheimajökull glacier tours, rafting and hot spring hikes. As well as excursions to the Golden Circle -  south Iceland's most famous sightseeing route, which includes the waterfall Gullfoss and the geothermally active valley of Haukadalur, containing the  Strokkur geyser  - which erupts every five to 10 minutes, guaranteeing an 'ooh' or an 'ahh' from an ever captive audience.

"They are exclusive areas where the average house will cost you more than £1million. But this year the Golden Postcode Club has expanded with four extra districts added to its select list. East Sheen in south-west London and Chiswick in west London both managed to nudge their way in with hundreds of properties breaking the £1million barrier. Scroll down for video . Four extra districts have been added to the Golden Postcode Club this year. One of them is Cobham, in Surrey, where Hatchford Hall (above) is . They join Guildford and Cobham, in Surrey, which were both added to the select band for the first time this year. The club makes up just 0.8 per cent of the UK's 2,760 postcodes. The highest average house price was in W8 in Kensington, London, where buyers were set back around £2.65m, The Sunday Times reported. The data was collected by property website Zoopla, which compared average house prices in districts across the UK. Nearly all of the postcodes are in London. Kensington Palace Gardens (above) has typically been the most expensive street in Britain with an average house price of £36million in 2013 . It also showed that the number of areas where houses were worth more than £500,000 increased by nearly 25 per cent. While most of the postcodes were in or near London some - including Solihull in Birmingham, Bryher in the Isles of Scilly and Watlington in Oxfordshire - were hundreds of miles away. Twelve extra postcodes were also added to the list where the houses cost more than £750,000 on average. UK house prices rose by an average of £16,000 - or 8.5 per cent - in 2014, according to Halifax. Chiswick in west London is also one of the newcomers to the club. It is where the Thames Zachary House (above) went on sale for just over £6.25million in 2012 . Most of the golden postcodes include houses that have vast extra rooms, including this conservatory at the Thames Zachary House . A total of 18,000 properties in Britain changed hands for more than £1m last year. Edinburgh was the only region in Scotland where any properties above that threshold were sold. Prices in some areas of London surged by almost 25 per cent, Halifax suggested. The highest average house price was in W8 in Kensington, London, where buyers were set back around £2.65m .

"Maintaining defence spending at the minimum demanded by Nato is now only a 'target', top Tory cabinet minister Philip Hammond suggested this morning. The Foreign Secretary refused 10 times to guarantee that the Tories would protect the military from further cuts after the election. Mr Hammond said the final decision on whether or not to ring-fence military spending would not be made until after the election. Scroll down for video . The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond refused 10 times to guarantee that the Tories would protect the military from further cuts after the election . The government has guaranteed defence spending will stay above 2 per cent of Britain's national income until 2016 – but not beyond. The failure to protect military spending – while guaranteeing cash for foreign aid – has sparked fury on the Tory backbenches. Up to 30 Conservative MPs are thought to be backing a bid by John Baron, MP for Basildon and Billericay, to force a protest vote against defence cuts in the Commons this week. MPs claim that if the Chancellor George Osborne gets his way Britain's military spending will fall below 2 per cent of GDP – despite the Prime Minister using a Nato summit in Wales to publicly shame other countries into hitting that target. Mr Cameron fears it will damage relations with US President Barack Obama, who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other Nato nations by cutting spending. Military top brass fear the Treasury will raid another £1billion a year from MoD coffers to try to balance the nation's books. Mr Hammond said the Government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at 'the beginning of the next parliament' Military spending will stay above 2 per cent of GDP until 2015/16. David Cameron has pledge an annual 1 per cent real terms increase in spending on defence equipment after the election. The Prime Minister has also pledged not to cut the size of the army below the level it is now. He also remains committed to growing the Army Reserves to 35,000. But defence spending in the UK is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020 . Defence spending in the UK is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020, even without further cuts. Mr Hammond, speaking this morning on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, was asked if Britain could afford to cut defence spending with the growing threat posed by Vladimir Putin and ISIS in the Middle East. It came after he admitted Britain's relations with Russia could be 'prickly' for many years - and described the country as an 'adversary'. He said it was clear Britain was 'not going to fight the Russians in Ukraine', but insisted there was a 'hard red line' protecting Nato's Baltic members from Russian incursions. Mr Hammond added: 'We're the second largest defence spender in NATO, we've got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces.' 'We led the charge encouraging our NATO partners to make this commitment. Many of them are far, far away from two per cent.' But he said the Government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at 'the beginning of the next parliament'. He said: 'There are two things I can't do today. I can't tell you what will be in the Conservative manifesto but you'll find out soon enough, and I can't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election. 'But David Cameron led the charge on the NATO two per cent commitment at the summit in Wales last year. 'He is passionate about our armed forces, he has always been absolutely clear that he is not prepared to preside over any further cuts in our regular armed forces. So he knows where he wants to go. 'But we've got very difficult decisions to make in delivering our long-term economic plan to get Britain out of deficit and staring to pay down instead. 'We've got to make those difficult balanced decisions, but we will protect the integrity and the strength of our armed forces.' Andrew Marr tried 10 times to get the Foreign Secretary to guarantee military spending . Andrew Marr: ‘We have Russian submarines testing our waters and Russian jets buzzing our airspace, and at the same time we are not committing ourselves to maintaining the NATO minimum defence spending. Where do you stand on that?’ Philip Hammond: ‘Well, clearly I was defence secretary for nearly three years, I’m a passionate supporter of the armed forces and of maintaining Britain’s military strength. And we are spending two per cent of our GDP.’ Marr: ‘You’re not committing the party to doing that at the next election.’ Hammond: ‘Well, we’re the second largest defence spender in NATO, we’ve got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces. ‘We’re building the two largest aircraft carriers the Royal Navy has ever had. We’re equipping them with the world’s most advanced fighter aircraft, we’re launching a submarine.’ Marr: ‘But you don’t commit to two per cent going ahead.’ Hammond: ‘Well, we led the charge at the NATO summit.’ Marr: ‘We’re going to look damn silly if we don’t do it ourselves.’ Hammond: ‘We led the charge encouraging our NATO partners to make this commitment. Many of them are far, far away from two per cent.’ Marr: ‘So we want it too then don’t we?’ Hammond: ‘We will have a strategic defence and security review at the beginning of the next parliament and a spending review and we will set out our future plans then. But we are committed to the two per cent target.’ Marr: ‘Through the course of the next parliament?’ Hammond: ‘We will set out the defence spending.’ Marr: ‘I’m sorry, but a lot of people want to know whether the country can trust the Conservatives over defence and the two per cent target is crucial to this. ‘There’s an argument going on about it, we all understand that, inside the Cabinet. As Foreign Secretary surely you can commit yourself personally to the two per cent. Hammond: ‘There are two things I can’t do today. I can’t tell you what will be in the Conservative manifesto but you’ll find out soon enough, and I can’t prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election.’ Marr: ‘Can you at least therefore…’ Hammond: ‘David Cameron led the charge on the NATO two per cent commitment at the summit in Wales last year.’ Marr: ‘And therefore you could at least commit yourself to agreeing with David Davis that he would look pretty damn silly if he didn’t then commit himself to two per cent for this country?’ Hammond: ‘Look, I worked closely with the prime minister on this subject when I was defence secretary for three years. He is passionate about our armed forces, he has always been absolutely clear that he is not prepared to preside over any further cuts in our regular armed forces. So he knows where he wants to go. ‘But we’ve got very difficult decisions to make in delivering our long-term economic plan to get Britain out of deficit and staring to pay down instead. We’ve got to make those difficult balanced decisions, but we will protect the integrity and the strength of our armed forces.’ Marr: ‘So no cuts to the British army – no further cuts to the British army.

'The assistance was provided and the accused was arrested from the Nagpada area and has been taken away by the Bengal team,' he told The Indian Express. CCTV was released three days after the attack showing some of the suspects leaving the staff room at the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal. A reward of 100,000 rupees (£1,075) was on offer for any leads, police said. They detained five men for questioning but did not make any arrests. It is not known if Salim was caught on camera, Indian TV reported. Guarded: The 30-year-old was made to sit inside a police vehicle, which was waiting outside a court in Ranaghat . Careful: The guards clutched Salim's arms and made sure he had handcuffs on as they led him past the press . Arnab Ghosh, a police superintendent, said the men, aged between 20 and 30, scaled the boundary wall around 11.40pm on Friday 13 March. They entered the school and disconnected the telephone lines, he added. The robbers then tied up and gagged a security guard before entering the nuns' room, where they found the women sleeping. When the victim, who is the oldest nun at the school, tried to stop them taking another woman into a separate room they raped her. Caught: Three men were pictured on the Convent of Jesus and Mary School's CCTV but it is not known if Salim was one of them . Suspects: The CCTV footage was released three days after the attack showing the suspects leaving the school's staff room around midnight. Five other men were detained for questioning . The men escaped with some cash, a mobile phone, a laptop and a camera. They also ransacked the school's chapel and took holy items. CCTV showed books and papers strewn across the floor as the men left the staff room. Mr Ghosh added: 'At least two of them were armed and the rest were carrying burglary tools. In the chapel, a holy scripture was found torn and a bust of Jesus was broken.' The nun was taken to hospital in Ranaghat around 7am on Saturday 14. Demonstrations: Prayers were said at churches across India. Hundreds of people staged a demonstration in Ranaghat, where the nun is being treated in hospital, two days after the attack to demand justice . Sorrow: Nuns gathered in front of the convent after the attack. Archbishop Thomas D'Souza said the sisters prayed for the victim during Sunday Mass . Outrage: The robbers  tied up and gagged a security guard before entering the nuns' room. Furious residents and students took to the streets after the attack to demand justice . Atindranath Mondal, hospital superintendent, told The Times of India: 'Immediately a team of doctors attended to her and a senior gynaecologist operated on her.' She is now thought to be recovering well. After the attack furious residents took to the streets, demanding action and blocking off the main highway. Hundreds of students from the school carried banners with the slogan 'we want justice'. Prayers: Crowds of students from the Christian missionary school lit dozens of candles at a peaceful protest . Scene of the crime: Police stood guard outside the convent school at Ranaghat,  north of Calcutta, while others searched for evidence . Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Chief Minister, tweeted her condemnation of what she called a 'horrific attack' promising 'swift, strong action'. Archbishop Thomas D'Souza said: 'They not only committed a heinous crime, but they also vandalized the chapel. 'This is the first time such an attack has happened in India.'","Mohammad Salim Shaikh was detained in Mumbai yesterday evening .

"Television companies must try and stop children from embarrassing themselves on air, amid fears that their parents may not always have their best interests at heart. Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, called for the crackdown after a flood of viewer complaints about the way children are treated on shows like Benefit Street or Jeremy Kyle, where they are openly mocked or shown in severe distress. In one instance, a 17-year-old guest on Jeremy Kyle was accused of having slept with 33 men, and told that her mother would disown her for stealing. Scroll down for video . In one instance a 17-year-old guest on Jeremy Kyle was accused of having slept with 33 men, and told that her mother would disown her for stealing . In another, children were ‘vilified’ on Benefits Street, the Channel 4 series which follows a street-full of families which live off state welfare. Viewers complained that the individuals sacrificed their ‘dignity’ for entertainment, even though their own parents did not complain about the treatment. In a new set of guidelines, which raise worrying questions about the lengths people will go to for fame, Ofcom has now told television producers to be wary about parents’ motives for allowing their children on air. Broadcasters should ‘form their own judgements’ about how much children should be allowed to do or say on camera, and not ‘rely solely on the assurances of parents or guardians, particularly where vested interests may be involved,’ it said. The warning comes amid growing concerns that parents allow their children to embarrass themselves on television in exchange for a fee, or because they are offered all-expenses paid hospitality, including restaurant meals and overnight stays in hotels. Other parents allow their offspring on air in the hope that they will become celebrities, a source said. Broadcasters should continue featuring children in their programmes, but they must take care that they are emotionally and mentally mature enough to cope with the public exposure, Ofcom said. ‘Children form strong views and feelings from a very early age and these deserve to be seen and heard in programmes. However, the ability of participants to weigh up the potential consequences of participation can vary widely. In another instance, children were ‘vilified’ on Benefits Street, the Channel 4 series which follows a street-full of families which live off state welfare. Pictured is James Turner Street where the show was set . ‘Children and young people differ in their vulnerabilities and resilience; their age, gender, physical and mental capacity, their maturity, their cultural, ethnic and religious background and their previous life experiences can all affect how they might respond to specific circumstances and nature of performance.’ Ofcom warned television companies to watch children’s body language, and made it explicit that they have a choice to opt out of appearing on television, in order to ensure that they are not being pushed into it by adults. And even if broadcasters do think they can deal with the public profile, children must be taught how to deal with potential bullying, including on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. There has been a huge increase in online bullying since Ofcom last updated its guidelines for protecting minors, six years ago, but the rise of this so-called ‘trolling’ now needs to be factored in at ‘an early stage’ of production, the regulator said. ‘Broadcasters should consider the impact of social media and the risk of bullying, including online bullying, on the child participant, and take appropriate steps to advise the young person and their parents [or] carers’. The crackdown follows a string of controversies about the way children are treated on air. In late 2013, ITV was found guilty of breaching broadcasting rules for airing an episode of Jeremy Kyle, where a guest called her 17-year-old sister a ‘silly anorexic slapper’, and alleged that she had slept with 33 men. The teenager was visibly distressed as she was attacked on air. She was also accused of stealing her mother’s camera, and told that she would never see her mother again if she failed a lie detector test protesting her innocence.","Ofcom calls for action after children openly mocked or shown in distress .

"A school has disciplined 11 pupils after it deemed their shiny black leather Kickers against its uniform policy. Within minutes of arriving at Outwood Academy in Acklam, Middlesborough, on Friday, several pupils had been sent back home for wearing 'incorrect' footwear. The secondary school, which has 860 pupils, states that only plain black shoes are allowed and trainers, boots, pumps or canvas shoes are banned. Almost a dozen pupils were sent home from Outwood Academy in Acklam, Middlesborough, for wearing 'incorrect' footwear to school after a crackdown on uniform policy . Parents have blasted the school after most of the students were wearing plain black laced Kicker shoes . It decided to revisit its policy as part of a drive to improve standards at the previously failing school and a letter was sent out reminding parents what it considered to be 'correct' footwear, last week. But parents have blasted the academy, saying their children's shoes were plain black and from the range marketed for school wear. The letter, issued on Wednesday, read: 'Students should be wearing black shoes that can be polished. Any other colours of shoes, trainers or boots of any description are not permitted.' Maddie Hayes, 14, was among a number of students excluded on Friday, despite having worn the same brand of plain black shoe for the last three years. Her mother, Jackie Hayes, 37, who also has a nine-year-old daughter, said: 'I received a call from Maddie's school to say she was being excluded for the day for not wearing the right shoes. Jackie Hayes, left, with her daughter Maddie, 14, right, who was sent home from school on Friday . 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing because she has only ever worn plain black Kickers shoes which are sold as a popular school shoe. Miss Hayes, a travel agent from Coulby Newham, said her daughter was one of more than 20 pupils either sent home or put in isolation for wearing the wrong school attire. 'When I got to the school Maddie said she was at first given a detention and was given a pair of shoes by the school to put on. But when she refused she was told she was excluded. 'Attendance at the school is already a major issue yet they are sending kids home. Fair enough if the shoes were brightly coloured or had high heels, but Maddie's are plain, basic, black shoes.' But executive principal, Rob Tarn, said some of the shoes were boots, which is against the school's rules. He said: 'Nothing has changed here, we have always been clear regarding our requirements with uniform and our Acklam academy has high expectations of student behaviour. 'This includes our clear guidance on footwear which has been shared with parents on a number of occasions. 'Students whose footwear does not meet the requirements are asked if they wish to borrow a pair of shoes bought by the academy until they can purchase a more appropriate pair for themselves, a request which we deem to be reasonable. 'Part of the reason that examination results are rising so rapidly is that staff can focus on conversations about learning rather than have repeated conversations about compliance with uniform which is tremendously distracting. 'I would ask that parents give us their full support in our attempts to deliver an outstanding education for their children.' A spokesperson for Outwood Grange Academies Trust which oversees the school, said: 'The trust has established a clear uniform policy which has been shared extensively with students and their families at the academy. 'The trust purchased uniform for all students when it opened in 2013 and has an ongoing commitment to purchase uniform for all students joining in Year 7. The secondary school's rules states that only plain black shoes are allowed and trainers, boots, pumps or canvas shoes are banned . Several pupils were sent home after refusing to wear another pair of shoes provided for them by the school and other were put in isolation or given a detention . 'The trust provides all items of uniform including sports kit and socks, the only item of uniform not provided by the trust is shoes. 'The current issue has arisen as a result of only 11 students who are refusing to wear footwear in line with the academy's uniform policy. 'The uniform policy clearly states that students must wear shoes that are plain black (this means students cannot wear boots or shoes with logos). 'The academy has offered to provide alternative footwear for the small number of students concerned and this offer has been declined. 'The trust can confirm that it does not exclude students for wearing incorrect uniform, however, if a student refuses to follow a reasonable request to change their footwear, then this would lead to a fixed term exclusion.' Olivia Adams said a teacher cut off the tags to her Kickers shoes while she was still wearing them . Kickers shoes have been at the centre of a uniform row in the past. In November 2013 a teacher at North School in Ashford, Kent, allegedly cut labels off a schoolgirl's shoes. Olivia Adams, 13, was told the green and red tags broke an 'all-black' uniform rule and her teacher apparently cut them off while she they were still on her feet. Her mother Claire Pamment immediately complained to head teacher Lesley Ellis - who apologised and offered her £55 to buy a new pair. But Ms Pammett took the row to police, insisting the staff member committed criminal damage and assault. The school failed to comment at the time, but police said it was investigating a complaint of criminal damage. In another bizarre incident, teachers at BBG Academy in Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire, became so fed up with students wearing 'inappropriate footwear' that it took them on a forced shopping trip to a shoe store. Pupils were taken to a branch of Wynsors World of Shoes on separate occasions over two weeks in December last year after being deemed to be wearing inappropriate shoes. Teachers paid £18 for each pair, which about 40 parents were then expected to pay at a later stage. Meanwhile, dozens of children were kept in a school hall and missed their lessons for their first day back at a city comprehensive - because they turned up wearing the 'wrong' shoes. Courtenay Cummings, 13, was among 30 pupils to be kept out of lessons for the day after she turned up to school in her usual black canvas footwear in September last year. Cantonian High School in Fairwater, Cardiff, insists that letters were sent out in July explaining trainers and 'daps' - rubber-soled canvas shoes - were not acceptable. In November last year, Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, sent home 152 pupils in one day after they failed to meet new strict uniform policy. Nearly 10 per cent of pupils failed to meet standards on the first day the rules were introduced and the next day 63 pupils were sent home - taking the total number to 215 in two days. The BBG Academy (pictured) in Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire, ferried up to 75 students who were breaching uniform rules to Wynsor's World of Shoes . Several students reported being turned away at the gates for minor infringements such as wearing a winter coat and not displaying their school ID on a lanyard. A majority of student were sent home for wearing the wrong footwear, Hanson Academy business manager Sarah Roberts said. Mason Beaumont, 14, was turned away for wearing black leather Magnum made footwear because staff branded them trainers. Headteacher Elizabeth Churton, who has been at the school for two years, said the rules were not new and staff were simply 'reinforcing the rules that are in place.' The Coseley School in Bilston, West Midlands, also sent home around 100 students after arriving at school for the first day of term because their footwear was not 'black leather'. Emma Guthrie, who bought a £20 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good. 'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing? 'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.' In 2011 Cardinal Newham Catholic School in Keresley, Coventry, banned 17 pupils from an important mathematics GCSE exam for wearing the wrong shoes. Students, aged between 15 and 16, were given their marching orders 20 minutes before they were due to start the test after refusing to change their footwear or take the exam in their socks. Patrick Doherty, 15, was due to sit the exam again after he failed it last summer having taken it a year early. He refused to take his shoes off because of fears his feet would smell and now faces a year at home before he can re-sit the exam again.","Pupils sent home within minutes of arriving at Outwood Academy last week .

"Supermodel Heidi Klum has taken to Twitter to vent her anger after three models were snapped outside Buckingham Palace wearing items from her new lingerie range. With decades of experience as one of the world's top supermodels, Heidi is well versed at showcasing designers wares. But the 41-year-old German beauty took exception to the palace being used as a backdrop in a photoshoot for items from her lingerie range. Scroll down for video . Grand designs: Heidi Klum was spotted promoting her new lingerie line, Heidi Klum Intimates, at London's Selfridges on Saturday . Fantastic voyage: The German beauty stepped out of a black cab, which promoted her line . The supermodel issued a Tweet questioning the decision to take photographs of models wearing items from her lingerie range outside Buckingham Palace . The models, wearing pastel coloured lacy underwear and suspenders, were seen striking a variety of poses on a cold March morning at the weekend. Writing on her Twitter account next to an image of the photograph,  Heidi said: 'Nearly fell off my chair when I saw this. Who did this??? Not me!!! #NotCool' Her Tweet has earned more than 11,000 'likes' from her legion of followers and been shared by fellow Twitter users 88 times. The mother-of-four is the star of her own underwear campaign and has been snapped showing off her ageless physique in the skimpy designs.

She said on GMA about her new venture: '[Bendon] asked me to take over the reins and continue to design for them. Now it’s called the Heidi Klum Intimates line and I’m so excited because I’ve been doing lingerie and wearing lingerie for many, many years. 'So basically I kept most of the styles that women have loved for the last 25 years that Elle created, and now I give them different laces, different colours, and then I added on a few new styles that weren’t existing – racer backs or beautiful strapless bras. 'So I kind of added on and put my own twist to it, and it’s so much fun. It’s a great opportunity for me and I was very thankful for that.' Hell for leather: Heidi teamed her racy top with a pair of skin-tight black leather trousers and suede heels .

"NHS doctor: Mirza Tariq Ali's terror group was linked to the Pakistan Taliban massacre of 132 children . An NHS doctor who fled the country to become a senior Taliban leader has been killed during an operation involving Pakistan security forces, it was claimed last night. Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 39, who worked in hospitals in London and Cambridge, was involved in extremist groups in the UK when he was charged with a violent disorder at protest in London. But before his court appearance, he skipped bail to fight for the Taliban in Pakistan where he fronted extremist propaganda including a chilling recruitment video. Last year, his terror group was linked to the Pakistan Taliban massacre of 132 children in Peshawar. While in the UK, Ali was a close associate of extremist cleric Anjem Choudary as well as a number of UK jihadists who have gone to fight for Islamic State in Syria. Last night Choudary described Ali as a 'martyr' after he was reported killed by the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, which has carried out a number of counter-terrorism operations in the region. In an obituary written by Choudary, he recalls an occasion when Ali operated on him in the back of a London café. Choudary also says he helped Ali to make a film of his experiences in Pakistan and the UK which Ali later used as part of a jihadist recruitment video while he was with the Taliban in Pakistan. Today, British jihadist Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, who skipped bail last year to join the Islamic State in Syria, posted pictures on Twitter with the captions: 'Dr Tariq singing nasheeds [chants] in my house back in #UK, beautiful voice for nasheeds. May Allah accept him.' Ehsanullah Ehsan, spokesman for the Taliban group which Ali had joined, vowed to avenge his death which he attributed to ISI and its Western allies. During his time in Pakistan, Ali also edited an online English-language jihadist magazine, called 'Ihya-e-Khilafat' (Revival of the Islamic Caliphate) aimed at recruiting Muslim youths from the west. The extremist magazine which he helps to edit publishes contact details for potential jihadi youths and advises them not to use home computers which might be tracked by intelligence agencies. While in the UK, Dr Ali (right) was a close associate of extremist cleric Anjem Choudary (left) as well as a number of UK jihadists who have gone to fight for Islamic State in Syria . Tributes: Today, British jihadist Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, who skipped bail last year to join the Islamic State in Syria, posted pictures on Twitter . The surgeon was convicted in the first-ever successful prosecution for Islamic sectarian violence in Britain after he was seen hitting a bystander over the head with a pole at a Central London rally in 2013. But he skipped bail and was found guilty in his absence at the Old Bailey and sentenced to 15 months. He has since been struck off by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after a hearing in Manchester. It was previously reported that he was fighting as a jihadist in Syria. But instead he travelled to Pakistan where he became a commander for a Taliban splinter-group under a new name - Dr Abu Obaidah Al-Islamabadi. Massacre: The attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in December killed 142 and the Taliban admitted responsibility for the atrocity . Depraved Taliban gunmen stormed the school in the north west Pakistani city with assault rifles and grenades, before their 'handlers' ordered them to detonate their suicide vests . Depraved: The majority of the victims, which included children as young as five, were shot at point blank range in the head or neck . Wearing a black turban, he was seen in a video clip saying: 'Allah blessed me with the passion of Jihad. 'I left Britain with an intention to go to Iraq and join Islamic State, but I was arrested on the way and sent to prison in Croatia.' In Choudary's obituary he said: 'Once we were acquainted I soon realised that Tariq Ali was no ordinary Muslim but rather in many respects an extremely exceptional one.' Killed: Last night Ali was described as a 'martyr' after he was reported killed by the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, which has carried out a number of counter-terrorism operations in the region . Of his work as a doctor Choudary adds: 'Tariq's skill as an NHS surgeon working at the Royal Free Hospital amongst others was also something which he used for the benefit of others outside of his work time. 'In once instance, instead of having me wait to be seen at the hospital to remove an infection in one of my fingers, Tariq brought his medical tools with local anaesthetic and operated at the back of a cafe local to me. 'I wasn't the only one to benefit from having such a skilled Surgeon as a friend.'","Dr Mirza Tariq Ali killed in an operation involving Pakistan security forces .

"He's one of the forgotten members of the Bali Nine drug smuggling gang but now Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken  for the first time about his life in prison, his torment at facing the prospect of dying behind bars and his terror over the impending executions of fellow traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali and into Australia. He was jailed for life - later upgraded to a death sentence before being reduced back to life, meaning he will spend the rest of his days as an inmate. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken for the first time about his life in prison . And he has of course been watching the fate of the condemned Bali Nine ringleaders very closely as he prepares to launch another appeal, knowing full well he risks having the death sentence reimposed by a panel of judges. 'Sitting in my jail cell and watching the way the Indonesian government’s handling their execution, I’m terrified,' Nguyen told The Saturday Telegraph, referring to Chan and Sukumaran. 'I’m terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next.' He also has to deal with the guilt of putting his family through such an emotional ordeal - and the fact they have spent all their savings paying his legal costs. The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005, as the Indonesian Supreme Court increased his sentence to the death penalty in 2006 and then reduced it back to life in prison in 2008. The hardline stance of Indonesian President Joko Widodo has frightened Nguyen to the point where he believes he would not receive a fair trial should he appeal, but is still determined to not give up hope. The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali . The Indonesian Supreme Court increased Nguyen's sentence to the death penalty in 2006 . The Bali Nine consists of nine Australians who were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 for a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of the country and into Australia . Despite international pressure and official protests from the governments of Brazil, Holland, France, the Philippines and Nigeria, Mr Joko has remained unwavering on the executions. 'No one prefers death. Death is an easy way out. I deserve the suffering I’m going through. But an appeal means hope. Without that hope there isn’t any future,' Nguyen said. His sentiment has been echoed by supporters of Chan and Sukumaran as they wait for the outcome of their last-ditch appeal. The appeals were adjourned until next week, and Australian authorities have continued to negotiate with the Indonesian government for clemency and life imprisonment for the pair. High profile Indonesian authorities have reportedly urged President Joko to reconsider the executions, amid concerns that if the executions go ahead the nation's reputation will be tarnished. 'Cracks are showing. They know that after these executions, there are many more to come,' one source, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fairfax. Nguyen said that the hope of future appeals is what pushes him through each day, though he understands the gravity of his actions. The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005 (here with fellow Bali Nine members) 'I’m terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next,' Nguyen said of Chan and Sukumaran . Nguyen has  been watching the fate of the condemned Bali Nine ringleaders very closely as he prepares to launch another appeal . H said one of his biggest regrets is the shame he has brought to his family and the heartbreak his situation has put them through. Nguyen has been trying to repair his relationship with them since being convicted almost 10 years ago, and said he is haunted by the memory of his mother coming to visit him for the first time in prison. His parents were given asylum in Australia after fleeing Vietnam and taking refuge in the Philippines, where Nguyen was born. Describing his parents as hardworking and courageous, Nguyen said that he threw away what they fought so hard for and that he will never be able to make it up to them. His parents, who now run a bakery in Brisbane, have also used their life savings to fund his appeals, going into debt in a desperate bid to reduce his sentence. He has launched a fundraising page to ease the financial stress from his parents' shoulders, which he is hoping to put towards his next appeal. Nguyen is currently being held in a jail in Malang, where he shares a cell with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens (above) Nguyen has been in close contact with his friend Scott Rush (above), whom he enlisted as part of the plot . Rush was found with 1.3 kilograms of heroin strapped to his body when he was just 19 . Nguyen is currently being held in a jail in Malang, where he shares a cell with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens, and has been in close contact with his friend Scott Rush, whom he enlisted as part of the smuggling plot.

"A police chief in suburban Atlanta resigned Wednesday before a grand jury decides whether to charge him with a misdemeanor crime for accidentally shooting his sleeping wife after drinking alcohol and taking sleep medication, officials said. Police Chief William McCollom called 911 early New Year's Day to report accidentally shooting his ex-wife, Margaret, as the couple slept in their bed. A prosecutor plans to seek a misdemeanor charge — but not a felony — against McCollom. Resignation: Police Chief William McCollom resigned from his position in the Peachtree City Police Wednesday . The couple divorced in 1999 and later reunited. 'I have had had two families in Peachtree City - my police family and my personal family,' McCollom said in a statement published on the city's website. 'In light of the recent tragedy in my personal family, I need to continue to focus my time and efforts there.' Griffin Judicial Circuit District Attorney Scott Ballard has said the shooting left Margaret McCollom paralyzed below the waist. He said last week that Margaret is being treated for the paralysis at a spinal cord rehabilitation center. The chief told investigators he drank alcohol and took medication to help him sleep. McCollom had a loaded handgun under the sheets. 'The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, and I put it to a side and it went off,' McCollom told a dispatcher, according to a recording of the call. Paralyzed: The Jan. 1 shooting left McCollom's wife, Margaret, paralyzed from the waist down . Search: The city will begin searching for a new Chief of Police immediately and Captain Stan Pye will fill the position in the interim, as he has been serving as Acting Chief of Police since January 1 . An investigation into the incident found that barking dogs woke McCollom from his sleep in the middle of the night, CNN reports. McCollom got up, grabbed his Glock 9mm gun -- his service gun -- and checked the house. When McCollom returned to bed he placed the gun under the sheets. A forensic analysis confirmed that the gun had been fired from under the sheets and a wound on MCollom's right hand confirmed that his palm blocked a spent shell from leaving the gun, according to CNN. Ballard said investigators found no evidence that McCollom intended to harm Margaret. However, the prosecutor said the shooting could have been avoided. He plans to ask a grand jury to charge McCollom with reckless conduct 'since the chief took a loaded gun to bed with him after ingesting alcohol and sleep medication.' Reckless Conduct: A prosecutor plans to ask a grand jury to charge McCollom with reckless conduct 'since the chief took a loaded gun to bed with him after ingesting alcohol and sleep medication' McCollom and his attorney did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The city will begin searching for a new Chief of Police immediately, FOX reports. Captain Stan Pye will fill the position in the interim, as he has been serving as Acting Chief of Police since January 1. Prior to moving to Peachtree City, McCollom served as police chief in Tequesta, Florida, and as assistant chief in Delray Beach, Florida. He started his law enforcement career in Wyoming. Court records show McCollom has divorced four times, including once from Margaret McCollom. None of his divorce filings or police personnel files describe any instances of violence or recklessness.","Police Chief William McCollom resigned from his position in the Peachtree City Police Wednesday .

"Passengers aboard the stricken Delta flight which skidded off the runway at New York City's La Guardia airport thought they were going to die, survivors revealed today. Speaking of their terror as Flight 1086 from Atlanta almost slammed into Flushing Bay as heavy snow battered the airport, the passengers said they considered themselves very fortunate. Husband and wife, Sam Stern and Roxanne Joffe were sat in the exit row of the jet and as it became clear the landing was going very wrong, feared the worst. Scroll Down for Video . Lucky: Sam Stern and his wife Roxanne Joffe feared for their lives during the plane crash at New York City's La Guardia airport on Thursday . Fleeing: Sam Stern and Roxanne Joffe managed to turn around and take this picture in the aftermath of the plane crash at La Guardia . 'It was snowing and the plane hit the ground. It seemed as if the brakes took for a second and then the plane started accelerating and it was obvious it wasn't going to stop. I thought I was going to die,' said Joffe to WTSP. 'When it finally came to a stop, there was deadly, deadly silence.' As the plane skidded, Joffe said she thought they were going to go straight into the water, like US Airways Flight 1549 - the famous 'Miracle on the Hudson'. Of the 127 passengers and five crew aboard, only two were injured. Joffe's husband, Sam Stern, also thought the crash was the end. 'I was in the exit row,' said Stern, 64, of Sarasota, Florida, to the New York Post. 'I had to pull the window in. They always ask you, ‘Are you prepared, willing and able to assist in the event of an evacuation?. 'But you never expect it’ll happen to you.' While the terrifying landing was unfolding, Stern's wildest fears were racing. 'In my mind, I was thinking, ‘Holy cow, are we going to flip over? Spin out?' said Stern. 'They managed to keep the nose forward. Finally, we hit this fence. The left side of the plane was looking over the water. 'The guy sitting right opposite me, he thought we were going in the water. He said he was thinking about the plane crash in the Hudson.' LaGuardia was shut down soon after the incident as the plane was leaking 300 gallons of fuel at a rate of a gallon a minute, with all incoming flights being diverted and outgoing flights being grounded. The fuel leak was quickly contained. Scene: A Delta flight slid off the runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Thursday morning .

Once the plane hit the runway it did not respond to the tower, and as soon as the air traffic controllers realized what happened they immediately announced the airport was closed. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported that two planes that landed just before the Delta flight reported good breaking on the runway, and that the plane skid roughly 5,000 feet down the runway. 'I think the pilot did everything he could to slow the aircraft down,' said Port Authority head Patrick J. Foye during a news conference. I'm not even sure what went through my mind because you're not even sure what's happening,' said passenger Mark Clafter. 'And then it wasn't until the plane came to a stop that all of the sudden you think, 'Holy cow! We just skidded off the runway.""' He added that through it all,, 'no one was screaming, no one was freaking out, and when we came to a dead stop people were actually really calm.' He said that when they stopped all power went out and the pilot had no way of speaking to the passengers, but even then no one panicked.

"Hollywood actor Gregory Walcott, the star of Plan 9 From Outer Space which was described as the 'worst movie ever made' - has died aged 87. Walcott worked with some of the giants of the acting world including Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg in a career which spanned four decades. But the celebrated actor, who died on Friday of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles, never felt he could shake the tag of appearing in Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space. Scroll down for video . Hollywood actor Gregory Walcott, who was the star of the film panned as the worst movie ever - Plan 9 from Outer Space (pictured) - has died aged 87 . During an interview in 1998 with Filmfax magazine, he said the director had 'etched his name forever in the annals of film history.' 'I will go to my grave not remembered for those meaty roles I did for the likes of John Ford or Steven Spielberg, but as the leading man in a film that many movie historians regard as the worst of all time. It's enough to drive a puritan to drink!' Walcott said the director had 'etched his name forever in the annals of film history.' The science fiction cult classic was panned by critics when it came out in 1959 and was widely regarded as one of the worst films ever made. Writer and director Wood cut unused footage of Bela Lugosi after the horror legend died. He then used his wife's chiropractor as a stand in for other scenes using a cape to hide his face- despite his being nearly bald and significantly taller than the deceased actor. The low-budget film also featured poor special effects such as flying saucers dangling from visible strings, ropey sets and laughable dialogue. Walcott had refused the role of alien-fighting pilot Jeff Trent at first, describing the script as 'gibberish.' But he was later persuaded that his name could add a little credibility to the film and agreed to star- without his agent's knowledge. It was a decision that came back to haunt him as he was consigned to the annals of film history for that very role. Walcott had refused had refused the role of alien-fighting pilot Jeff Trent in the low-budget film which also featured poor special effects such as flying saucers dangling from visible strings, ropey sets and laughable dialogue . Walcott later went on to win critical acclaim in The Outsider, playing a drill instructor across from Tony Curtis's Ira Hayes, the Native American Second World War hero. It's star may have believed it was the worst film ever made, but Plan 9 From Outer Space only rated as number 16 in Empire's 50 worst films of all time. 1) Batman and Robin (1997) 2)  Battlefield Earth (2000) 3) The Love Guru (2008) 4) Raise the Titanic (1980) 5) Epic movie (2007) 6) Heaven's gate (1980) 7) Sex Lives of the Potato Men (2004) 8) The Happening (2008 ) 9) Highlander 2: The Quickening (1991) 10) The Room (2003) He also starred in several Clint Eastwood films including Joe Kidd and Every Which Way But Loose and appeared in Steven Speilberg's directorial debut The Sugarland Express in 1974. And Plan 9 From Outer Space was linked closely with the actor's final film in Tim Burton's 1994 biopic of its director Ed Wood where Walcott appeared in a cameo part. He told the LA Times in 2000: 'I didn't want to be remembered for (Plan 9). But it's better to be remembered for something than for nothing, don't you think?' The actor is survived by his son Todd Mattox and his daughters Jina and Pam, as well as several grandchildren. Mr Mattox, a puppeteer on the Men in Black films, paid tribute to his father on his Facebook page where he posted: 'We said goodbye to my dad today. He spent his life making people feel good.

"Westminster’s Public Administration Committee said the country’s top mandarin, Sir Jeremy Heywood (pictured), had been ‘wrong in law’ during a row over two of Theresa May’s Special Advisers . Sir Jeremy Heywood was given a humiliating rebuke by MPs yesterday for clearing taxpayer-funded advisers to take part in political campaigning. Westminster’s Public Administration Committee said the country’s top mandarin had been ‘wrong in law’ during a row over two of Theresa May’s Special Advisers. It is another blow to the reputation of the Cabinet Secretary – who is known as Sir Cover Up for trying to block the publication of letters related to the Iraq War. Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson, two of the Home Secretary’s closest aides, refused an order from Tory HQ to take part in telephone canvassing during last year’s Rochester by-election. The pair said it was a breach of the special adviser's code, which says that - as public servants - they should not conduct canvassing in by-election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so. Number Ten and Tory HQ disagreed – suspending both men from the list of candidates at the forthcoming General Election as a punishment. To justify the decision, Number Ten relied upon advice from Sir Jeremy, who wields enormous power inside Government. He controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in ‘backroom support’ activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category. But that interpretation has now been flatly rejected by the public administration committee. The committee said: ‘Any direction to a Special Adviser to conduct telephone canvassing was misguided, and that advice that such a direction or such canvassing was permitted under their Code and contract of employment was wrong in law. ‘We recommend that Special Advisers should never again be confronted with directions or informal pressure that puts them in breach of the Code and of their contracts of employment.’ The Speaker’s Counsel, Michael Carpenter, told MPs he had been ‘unpersuaded’ by Sir Jeremy’s arguments. Mr Carpenter said that, far from being a backroom activity, telephone canvassing involved taking part in a political debate with members of the public. Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson are now expected to apply to be re-instated to the candidates list after the election. Sources said they appeared to have a ‘slam dunk case’ to get their suspension lifted. Labour deputy chairman Jon Ashworth said: ‘The Parliamentary Authorities have delivered a damning assessment of the Number 10 operation, and we now need to know which Ministers were complicit in issuing this ‘misguided’ advice. Sir Jeremy controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in ‘backroom support’ activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category. Pictured: Theresa May . ‘Given the proximity of the election campaign, we need a formal government response today which outlines how Number 10 will ensure no rules will be broken over the role played by Special Advisers.’ At the time, the decision to remove the advisers from the candidates list was widely seen as the latest episode in a long-running feud between Downing Street and the Home Office. Tensions have repeatedly flared amid fevered speculation over Mrs May’s own leadership ambitions. Polls have shown she is the activists’ favourite to succeed the Prime Minister. Another of the Home Secretary’s advisers, Fiona Cunningham, was forced to quit last summer after clashing with Michael Gove over extremism in schools. Last week, Sir Jeremy came under fire over new rules which ban the country’s 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists without ministerial approval. He approved the order at the request of Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude. Yesterday, the Mail told how the move was opposed by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who said: ‘Sunlight is the best disinfectant.’","Sir Jeremy Heywood given humiliating rebuke by MPs in row over advisers .

"Updated: But the new edition of Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage fiercely opposes some of the foibles of the English language today . Don't say 'like', avoid the word 'awesome' and never drop your aitches - the latest edition of the ultimate guide to the English language has been revised for the 21st century. The new edition of Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage has just been released, and has been revised to take on the language battles of the current generation. Compiler Jeremy Butterfield has inserted some strident views into the dictionary - saying that people who use the word 'like' deserve to face physical violence. He also risks charges of snobbery, by writing that anyone who says 'haitch' instead of 'aitch' appears 'unspeakably uncouth' to older generations. But the new Fowler's does make some concessions to the modern world - traditionalists may be angry to discover that the book accepts the use of the world 'literally' to mean 'metaphorically'. Fowler's dictionary was first published in 1926, written by lexicologist H.W. Fowler, and it rose to fame as the definitive guide to what is and isn't acceptable in the English language. However, in the intervening decades the book has fallen out of fashion, as modern trends have reacted against notions of 'correct' and 'incorrect' language use. Mr Butterfield's new edition, published by Oxford University Press last week, attempts to re-establish the reputation of Fowler's guide. Among the words which he says should be banned are 'challenging', 'awesome' and 'issue', because they have all become clichés, according to The Times. He also outlaws the use of the word 'achingly' when attached to 'trendy' or 'hip', saying it should be reserved for situations where someone is actually in pain. Similarly, he insists that the word 'nubile' should mean 'marriageable', not 'sexually attractive' as it is often used nowadays. But he reserves his most furious broadsides for the word 'like', used by younger generations to pepper their sentences regardless of whether it serves any linguistic purpose. Author: The first edition of the work was published by lexicographer H.W. Fowler, pictured left, and the latest edition has been revised by Jeremy Butterfield, right . Mr Butterfield - who admits to sometimes being a 'grumpy old man' - writes: 'Overuse will cause listeners outside the speaker's immediate social circle, wider social group or age cohort to ignore the content of the message, to assume that the speaker is little short of brain-dead, or, in extreme cases, to wish they had a discreet firearm to hand.' In an even more contentious passage, the author suggests that people who drop their aitches or pronounce the letter as 'haitch' are marking themselves out as socially inferior to others. He points out that Lord Carey did not pronounce aitches when he was young, but changed his speech as he grew older, eventually reaching the top of the Establishment as Archbishop of Canterbury. 'There would be no doubt that George Carey would not have risen to that position if he had continued to do so,' Mr Butterfield writes. The dictionary is available from the OUP as a hardback or - in a sign of the times - as an e-book for Kindle and other devices.","Jeremy Butterfield has written the new edition of Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage .

"A predator armed with six long claws  prowled the seas more than 500 million years ago and was among the ancestors of modern insects, spiders and lobsters, scientists have found. The lobster-like Yawunik kootenayi had four eyes and long whip-like antennae that extended from the tips of its claws. Four of the claws also bore opposing rows of teeth that helped the creature catch its prey in the prehistoric seas of the Cambrian period. Scroll down for video . Yawunik kootenayi, shown in the reconstruction above, lived in the ocean 508 million years ago. The lobster-like creature had four eyes and long whip-like antennae that extended from the tips of its claws . A fossil of the strange looking creature was discovered in Marble Canyon at the north end of Kootenay National Park in the Canadian Rockies. Palaeontologists say the species was probably one of the first predatory arthropods to roam the planet - a group that later evolved into spiders, lobsters and insects. A crocodile-like amphibian that was the size of a small car dominated prehistoric lakes more than 200 million years ago, a new study has found. Palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the 'super salamander' while excavating on the site of an ancient lake in southern Portugal. The predator, which grew to be around two metres (6.5 ft) in length and lived in lakes and rivers during the Late Triassic Period, has been named Metoposaurus algarvensis. With a mouth filled with sharp needle-like teeth it is thought to have preyed upon fish but could also have snapped up any small early dinosaurs that got to close to the water. The predatory creature, which like all arthropods had an external skeleton or exoskeleton, is thought to have lived 508 million years ago. Cedric Aria, a evolutionary biologist at the University of Toronto who was part of the team that discovered the species, said: 'This creature is expanding our perspective on the anatomy and predatory habits of the first arthropods, the group to which spiders and lobsters belong. 'It has the signature features of an arthropod with its external skeleton, segmented body and jointed appendages, but lacks certain advanced traits present in groups that survived until the present day. 'We say that it belongs to the 'stem' of arthropods.' The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Palaeontology, describe how Yawunik has many primitive features that resemble those that later evolved in insects and crustaceans. It has long frontal appendages that resemble the antennae of modern beetles or shrimp, but in Yawunik these were actually each comprised of three long claws. The fossil of Yawunik (above) was discovered in Marble Canyon at the north end of Kootenay National Park in the Canadian Rockies. It was examined using scanning electron microscope to help reveal its tiny details . The image above shows the fossil of Yawunik kootenayi in slate just after it had been excavated by scientists. On the end of each claw were long flagella that the scientists believe helped the creature sense the environment around it .Two of the claws on each appendage were also studded with opposing rows of teeth . On the end of each claw were long flagella that the scientists believe helped the creature sense the environment around it. Two of the claws on each appendage were also studded with opposing rows of teeth that helped it grip its prey. When attacking its prey, Yawunik probably spread its claws out in front of it and then retracted them under its body when swimming, say the researchers. The fossil was discovered in Marble Canyon in north end of Kootenay National Park in the Canadian Rockies . Mr Aria said: 'Unlike insects or crustaceans, Yawunik did not possess additional appendages in the head that were specifically modified to process food. 'Evolution resulted here in a combination of adaptations onto the frontal-most appendage of this creature, maybe because such modifications were easier to acquire. 'We know that the larvae of certain crustaceans can use their antennae to both swim and gather food. Yawunik was named in tribute to the Ktunaxa People who have long inhabited the Kootenay area around Marble Canyon. Yawunik was a fierce mythological marine creature according to Ktunaxa legends. It caused such mayhem that other animals launched an epic hunt to kill it. 'But a large active predator such as a mantis shrimp has its sensory and grasping functions split up between appendages. 'Yawunik and its relatives tell us about the condition existing before such a division of tasks among parts of the organism took place.' Although only a few inches long, Yawunick was probably one of the key predators in the seas at the time when the water was dominated by trilobites and before the first fish had begun to emerge. Yawunik was named in tribute to the Ktunaxa People who have long inhabited the Kootenay area around Marble Canyon. Yawunik was a fierce mythological marine creature according to Ktunaxa legends. It caused such mayhem that other animals launched an epic hunt to kill it. The researchers used scanning electron microscope technology to make maps of the fossil and reconstruct how it would have looked. The new species Yawunik is thought to have folded its long front claws under its body when it was swimming. Yawunik was named in tribute to the Ktunaxa People who have long inhabited the Kootenay area around Marble Canyon. It was a fierce mythological marine creature according to Ktunaxa legends . Professor Jean-Bernard Caron, who led the study at the University of Toronto, said: 'Yawunik is the most abundant of the large new species of the Marble Canyon site, and so, as a predator, it held a key position in the food network and had an important impact on this past ecosystem.' Donald Sam, director of traditional knowledge and language at the Ktunaxa Nation Council, said: 'Yawunik is a central figure in the Ktunaxa creation story, and, as such, is a vital part of Ktunaxa oral history. 'I am ecstatic that the research team recognizes how important our history is in our territory, and chose to honour the Ktunaxa through this amazing discovery.'","Yawunik kootenayi was found in Marble Canyon in the Canadian Rockies .

"A steady stream of smoke and ash leaking from the Villarrica volcano has residents of a nearby town wondering if - or when - disaster might strike. Chilean officials raised threat levels to orange on Wednesday due to increasing signs of activity in the 2840-meter tall volcano, leaving area residents fearful of an eruption. 'No one can sleep peacefully because the other day the eruption surprised us at 3 in the morning,' said Francisco Valenzuela, a tour guide in the nearby resort town of Pucon. Looming danger: A steady stream of smoke and ash being released from the Villarrica volcano has residents wondering if - or when - disaster might strike . 'The tourists are also a little uncertain,' Valenzuela said. 'Could something happen today? Could something happen tomorrow?' The BBC reports that local authorities canceled classes for the more than 5,500 students in the area. Many of the residents in towns and communities surrounding the volcano had to be evacuated earlier in the month, when lava and smoke erupted from the peak in the early hours of the morning. 'It was spewing lava and ash hundreds of meters into the air,' 29-year-old Australian tourist Travis Armstrong said. 'Lightning was striking down at the volcano from the ash cloud that formed from the eruption.' Adding to the threat of ash and lava, the peak is covered by a glacier cap and snow, causing some officials to worry the eruption could cause mudslides or force rivers to flood and jump their banks. Threat: Chilean officials raised threat levels to orange on Wednesday due to increasing signs of activity in the 2840-meter tall volcano, leaving area residents fearful of an eruption . The peak, located about 500 miles south of Santiago, is a popular hiking destination for tourists who could until recently peer into the crater and wonder about the volcano's destructive capacity . Smoke and lava: An eruption earlier this month triggered an evacuation, and residents worry it could happen again . Starry night: The calm sky provided a contrasting backdrop to the volcano, which officials worry could melt glacial waters and accumulated snow . Warning signs: Authorities raised threat levels last Wednesday when ash started pouring out of Villarrica again, after an earlier eruption was believed to have subsided . 'This is not a fireworks show,' according to Rodrigo Alvarez, director of the National Service of Geology and Mining, who directed everyone - but especially tourists - not to stray near the volcano. The peak, located about 500 miles south of Santiago, is a popular hiking destination for tourists. With the last large eruption occurring in 1984, tourists could until recently peer into the crater and wonder about the volcano's destructive capacity. Chile's president, Michelle Bachelet, visited Pucon after the first eruption to check on safety preparations and declare a state of emergency for area farmers in order to provide aid. 'You never know when an eruption will take place but what we do know is that the activity is lower, that's visible,' Bachelet said earlier in the month. The residents who have returned home remain wary of the volcano, but many believe they can spot a warning sign in time to evacuate again safely. 'We are here everyday following it in the morning and afternoon to see if there's some change,' said Pablo Mendez. 'Something that would give us some minutes to evacuate.' Warning signs: Authorities raised threat levels last Wednesday when ash started pouring out of Villarrica again, after an earlier eruption was believed to have subsided . Present danger: Residents left their houses after the Villarica volcano erupted, thousands were evacuated .

"A Boston police officer who was shot in the face by a man during a traffic stop in an incident that set off a twilight gunfight in the city is expected to recover, Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters on Saturday. Officer John Moynihan, 34, was attacked when he pulled over suspected gang members in Boston, Massachusetts, on Friday evening. The suspect, identified as 41-year-old Angelo West, was shot dead by other officers at the scene in Boston on Friday evening after he opened fire. A female bystander was shot in the arm. West allegedly shot Moynihan 'point blank' and emptied his revolver in the unprovoked attack, police said, according to the Boston Globe. 'He's a fighter, he's going to pull through,' Evans said of Moynihan. Scroll down for video . Officer John Moynihan, 34, is expected to recover after being shot in the face in an 'unprovoked attack' during a vehicle stop . Suspect Angelo West, pictured here after a prior arrest, was shot dead at the scene after he allegedly shot a police officer point blank during a vehicle stop . Officer John Moynihan was shot in the face during a traffic stop that ended when other officers fatally shot his attacker . Moynihan is in critical condition in a coma after being shot 'point blank' by an attacker during a vehicle stop but he is expected to recover . Boston Police Commissioner William Evans spoke on Saturday during a press conference. He said West emptied his revolver of bullets . None of the officers had drawn their guns when West opened fire, Suffolk DA Dan Conley said at a press conference. Local prosecutors will investigate the shooting to ensure that Moynihan followed departmental procedures throughout the incident, said Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Connolly. 'It's going to be completely transparent,' Connolly said of the review, which he added would be shared with West's family and lawyers once it is complete. Over the past year the United States has seen waves of sometimes violent protests after unarmed black men were killed by white police officers, including in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York. Evans alluded to those concerns, but stressed that West set off Friday's gunfight. 'It was a really violent confrontation that was clearly unprovoked by our officers,' Evans told reporters at Boston Police headquarters. Now in a critical condition in Boston Medical Center, Officer Moynihan is a highly decorated military veteran awarded a medal for bravery by President Obama for his involvement in a shoot-out with the Boston Bombing suspects. He was shot just below his right eye and placed in an induced coma fighting for his life at a hospital, police Commissioner William Evans said. Police tape roped off a car involved in the shooting at the corner of Ruthven Street and Humbolt Avenue in Roxbury, Massachusetts, on Friday . Officers conferred in Roxbury after Humboldt Avenue was shut down following a shooting on Friday evening . Crime scene tape blocked off two or three blocks in every direction, and police vehicles were scattered throughout after Friday's shooting . He is on the police Youth Violence Task Force, Evans said. Other officers returned fire and killed the suspect at the scene, Evans said. A woman at the scene suffered a flesh wound to her right arm and was in good spirits, and three other officers were taken to a hospital with stress-related problems, he said. 'The officer here is in tough shape, but we're all pulling for him, and hopefully he'll pull through,' Evans said. 'His family's with him, the clergy has been here and ... let's pray for him.' The scene of the shooting where three people were shot, one fatally, is near a neighborhood commercial area with a small strip of shops . A helicopter flew over the scene after police shut down Humboldt Avenue following a shooting on Friday evening . Commissioner William Evans said Saturday morning that 34-year-old Officer John Moynihan was struck just below his right eye and the bullet remains lodged below his right ear . Investigators work near the scene of the shooting on Friday. The police officer who was shot is still fighting for his life . Evans said Moynihan was undergoing tests there is being monitored for bleeding in his brain. 'We are hoping and praying there's not further damage,' he said. Evans said the police officers were watching the vehicle before pulling it over. He did not say why the officers stopped the vehicle. One of three people in the car got out, opened fire on the officers and was killed, he said. Police were interviewing the other two people in the car, and it was too early to say whether criminal charges would be filed against them, he said.

The suspect, Angelo West, was shot dead by other officers at the scene in Boston, Massachusetts, on Friday evening after he opened fire. A female bystander was shot in the arm . Such shootings are rare in Boston, but firearms are a major concern in the city, the commissioner said. 'We've got way too many guns out there, way too many young kids running around with the guns,' he said, 'and unfortunately this is what happens.' Mayor Marty Walsh said his thoughts and prayers were with the injured officer, his family and the police department. 'These acts of violence have no place in our neighborhoods,' Walsh said. 'Our community is stronger than ever, and tonight we are thankful for all of those who put their lives on the on the line every day to protect our city.'

"These gay penguins have been together for a year, but are still as loved-up as ever. Peso and Squaddle, two-year-old Humboldt penguins living at Folly Farm Adventure Park and Zoo in Pembrokeshire, coupled up a year ago after shunning females looking to mate. While their fellow penguins prepare for breeding season, the pair only have eyes for each other as they get ready to celebrate their first anniversary this month. Happy anniversary! Peso (right) and Squaddle (left) got together after shunning females looking to mate . Two's company! Zoo staff had given the couple a false egg during breeding season, but they threw it away . Staff at Folly Farm say the young lovers have no interest in procreating. They had been given a false egg, so that they wouldn't feel left out during breeding season - but they threw it out of their love nest. Penguin keeper Catrin Thomas said: 'We're approaching breeding season and at around two years old, penguins become sexually mature, so we thought this year they may show some interest but they haven't as yet. 'All the other penguins are busy making nests at the top of the penguin beach, scrambling around hurriedly and gathering twigs, but Peso and Squaddle stay by the pool preening each other.' Penguin posers: The Humboldts, who live at Folly Farm, Pembrokeshire, are celebrating their first anniversary . They only have eyes for each other! The pair have no interest in procreating and threw the egg of their nest . She added: 'Peso and Squaddle don't seem to be interested in anything else but each other, and certainly not procreating. 'They're just enjoying each other's company.' Tim Morphew, Folly Farm's zoo manager, said: 'We wanted to mark the occasion and the year anniversary of Peso and Squaddle getting together. 'Everybody who comes to Folly Farm says theirs is a really sweet love story and we wanted to celebrate the fact they were still going strong a year on.' Humboltd penguins, who are monogamous and mate for life, can take a partner aged between two and eight-years-old. Penguins have been observed engaging in homosexual behaviour from as early as 1911. George Murray Levick documented the sexual behaviour of Adélie penguins in Antarctica, but his notes were considered too indecent to publish at the time. They were rediscovered and published in the journal Polar Record a century later in 2012. More recently, a pair of chinstrap penguins called Roy and Silo became a famous 'gay penguin' couple after the New York Times published an article about them in 2004. The penguins, who live in New York's Central Park Zoo, were noticed performing mating rituals in 1998, by staff - although they were never seen to perform sex acts. They were then given an egg to hatch and raise as their own - a practice copied by zoos across the world. Their chick, named Tango, grew up to form a same sex relationship with another female penguin. Their story was the basis for a controversial children's book in 2005 called 'And Tango Makes Three'. But the couple later split, and Silo paired with a female penguin. Last year, a pair of Humboldt penguins, called Jumbs and Kermit, from Wingham Wildlife Park in Kent, adopted the chick of a female called Isobel who had to abandon her egg to find food. Staff at Wingham Wildlife Park said they were the two ‘best penguin parents’ the zoo has ever had. But a French study in 2010 said penguins only have gay 'flings' because they are lonely, but ultimately end up in a heterosexual couple.","Peso and Squaddle coupled up after shunning females looking to mate .

"Just a week before the  grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown, its request to make a public statement about the case was rejected by a judge. The twelve Ferguson grand jurors were denied the opportunity to speak by St. Louis County Circuit Court Judge Carolyn Whittington, according to court documents filed on Friday. The documents surfaced during the ongoing lawsuit involving a member of the grand jury, who filed a memorandum earlier this month fighting to speak publicly about the controversial case. The unnamed juror, referenced as Grand Juror Doe, has claimed attorney Robert McCulloch, who prosecuted the case, lied to the public. Scroll down for video . A week before the verdict was announced in the case of the shooting death of Michael Brown, Judge Carolyn Whittington (left) wrote a letter to attorney Robert McCulloch (right), denying the grand jury's request to make a public statement . The grand jury sat for three months hearing evidence and a verdict was released on November 24, 2014. In a letter from Judge Whittington to McCulloch on November 17, she explains initially she said yes to the request, but then did legal research and decided the final response was no, according to Yahoo News. It is unknown what the jurors were going to say in their statement, and documents from Friday do not detail when they initially made the request. In the letter she wrote: 'The Supreme Court has stated that the power of a grand jury to investigate and inquire is limited to finding or returning indictments. 'A grand jury has no power to report short of an indictment unless it is on the condition of public buildings.' The grand jury sat for three months hearing evidence and a verdict was released on November 24, 2014 not indicting Darren Wilson (above) for the shooting death of Michael Brown . In a memorandum filed last month by the juror, he claims McCulloch presented evidence over the course of the trial that suggested Brown (above) was the aggressor and Wilson did nothing wrong . Judge Whittington continued: 'The Supreme Court has spoken on the issue of the power of the grand jury. 'I do not believe there is authority for the Grand Jury to make a statement and request that you inform the Grand Jury that it must be guided by the ruling of the Supreme Court.' In the documents filed on Friday, McCulloch states his argument in support of reasons for the dismissal of the case involving the grand juror. He wrote that despite having been duly sworn and sworn to secrecy twice, the juror now 'claims it is intolerable that he should be held to his oath or made to abide by his charge'. Under Missouri law, it is a misdemeanor for a juror to disclose information regarding the case. McCulloch said the juror 'has no right under the First Amendment to violate his oath or disregard Missouri law', or 'sidestep the court', and that the case should be dismissed. The individual filed suit in January accusing McCulloch of lying during the November 24 press conference when he said 'all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges'. A 21-page memorandum was filed on March 6 detailing that he is seeking an injunction to prevent criminal charges for violating grand jury secrecy laws. McCulloch filed court documents on Friday to support his reasons for the dismissal of the case involving the grand juror . This is just one of the reasons why the juror is asking to be able to speak out about the case. In Missouri, only nine of the twelve jurors are need to make the decision on whether or not to indict an individual. 'This case is about Doe's First Amendment rights,' said the lawyer for the unnamed juror. 'The claim that a citizen with information on a matter of public concern should be permitted to challenge the government's narrative without going to jail is a cognizable First Amendment claim.' The lawyer also noted; 'McCulloch speaks freely and purportedly openly about the very content about which Doe wishes to speak, just from a different viewpoint.' The juror is also claiming in these papers that McCulloch presented evidence over the course of the trial that suggested Brown was the aggressor and Wilson did nothing wrong and was simply acting in self-defense. 'McCulloch has given his view of the grand jurors' thoughts. The twelve who know the answer are silenced by the challenged laws,' said the juror's attorney.","The 12 jurors were denied the request on November 17 by Judge Carolyn Whittington ahead of verdict announcement on November 24 .

"It can take months of planning and its fair share of disagreements on the way to plan the perfect road trip. But now one American scientist believes he has planned the perfect European road trip that means we can all put away those atlases and close down Google maps. Michigan data scientist, Randy Olsen, has come up with route using an algorithm that calculates shortest distance, excluding any journeys over water. Scroll down for video . The journey takes in 45 stop-offs in total, taking in countries such as the UK, Portugal, Bulgaria, Estonia and Finland. Covering 16,287 miles and 14 days of driving, Mr Olsen advises putting three months aside to explore the cities. Rather than looking at every possible solution, Olsen used something known as a 'genetic algorithms' which starts with just a few random solutions. It then manipulates these solutions, while trying something slightly different each time, until it finds one that it can't improve on. Innsbruck, Austria . Munich, Germany . Pag, Croatia .

Using similar methodology, Olsen then took on the challenge of planning the best U.S. road trip - ensuring the car would never leave home soil on its route. His only limitation was to make one stop in all 48 contiguous US states, along with Washington D.C. and two stops in California. There is a scheduled stop-off at the world famous prehistoric monument of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, UK . Each stop would be at a national natural landmark, national historic site, national park or national monument. And the car could never leave US soil. To create the map, Mr Olsen first found the shortest distance by road between each of the 50 landmarks provided. The tricky part was putting the landmarks in order to eliminate as much driving back on himself as possible. You will get the chance to stretch your legs and take in some cycling exercise with a stop-off in Amsterdam .","Randy Olsen has come up with route using an algorithm that calculates shortest distance for a special road trip .
Journey takes in 45 stop-offs in total, taking in countries such as the UK, Portugal, Bulgaria, Estonia and Finland .
Scientist had earlier devised the ultimate U.S. road trip, and famous for the 'Where's Waldo' algorithm ."
"Tax hikes in the last five years have raised an extra £16.4billion a year, equivalent of around £255 for every person in the UK. A new study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that by 2015-16, will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only £48billion. The figures come ahead of George Osborne's final Budget before the election, with Labour warning they lay bare the full extent of the government's failure to fix the economy. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured today, is expected to use his Budget on Wednesday to announce a nother increase in the personal tax allowance . Tax rises introduced since 2010 include a £14 billion hike in VAT and a £5.2 billion increase in National Insurance contributions. At the same time the tax reductions of 48 billion include £8 billion from raising the personal threshold for income tax, £5.9 billion in cuts to corporation tax and £3.9 billion from real-terms reductions in fuel duties. However, the IFS said the changes were a 'missed opportunity to improve the tax system', because they had been introduced in a piecemeal way with little attempt to address 'fundamental structural deficiencies'. Several of the changes have exacerbated 'unwelcome distortions' in the system, said the IFS. It was difficult to find a 'good economic reason' for lifting ever-more lower-paid workers out of income tax while leaving National Insurance thresholds largely untouched, and it was an 'absurdity' that the two taxes had not been integrated. Mr Osborne is expected to use Wednesday's Budget to announce another big rise in the personal tax allowance. Deputy PM Nick Clegg said: ‘The main thing the government can do is just take less of your money away from you. ‘I very much want to give the biggest possible Workers’ Bonus to millions of people on middle and low incomes.' The  study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that by 2015-16, will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only £48billion . The IFS highlighted the 'problematic' failure to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation, and warned of a 'rapid' increase in workers paying higher rates of income tax as the economy improves. Unless the phenomenon known as 'fiscal drag' is dealt with, the number of families losing some or all of their child benefit will double within a decade, the report predicted. The report also warned that council tax had been allowed to get 'ever more out of date', with bands in England and Scotland based on property prices in 1991. And it said that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had 'seen a stream of ad hoc, often temporary, announcements overtaking each other without a clear statement of principles or long-run intentions'. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the Tory idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else hasn’t worked . Authors Stuart Adam and Barra Roantree said: 'There is a better way to make tax policy. The corporate tax road map was a good start, setting out a direction of travel and providing an element of predictability. The next government would be well advised to apply this approach to more elements of the tax system, and indeed to the tax system as a whole. 'That would help taxpayers to plan, provide a benchmark for assessing the policies actually implemented, and facilitate debate on whether the strategy laid out is the right one. Taking the time to articulate a strategy might even lead to the adoption of better tax policy.' Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the Standard: 'The old Tory idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else hasn’t worked. And once again, a Tory Chancellor is giving with one hand but taking away much more with the other. 'No pre-election tax cut can mask the £1,127 a year which the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says families have lost because of tax and benefit changes since 2010 — from higher VAT to cuts to tax credits.'","By 2015-16 coalition will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion .
At the same time tax cuts will have saved the country only £48billion .

"Burger King has cut soft drinks from its children’s menu amid pressure to promote a healthier image. The fast food chain's kids' meal combinations now include an option of 100 per cent apple juice, fat-free milk or one per cent fat chocolate milk. The beverages roughly contain the same amount of calories and sugar as a classic Coca Cola, but experts highlight they have a better nutritional profile. Indeed, the milk is described an 'excellent source of calcium and a good source of potassium' while the apple juice apparently contains 'one-and-a-half servings of fruit'. A spokesperson for Burger King told Daily Mail Online that the decision to drop soda for young consumers came after a review of 'established scientific and government [nutritional] standards'. Wash it down with milk: Burger King has cut soft drinks from its children’s menu amid pressure to promote a healthier diet . McDonald's and Wendy's are other eateries to implement similar changes in recent months. While fizzy drinks are still on offer at Burger King's Canadian and U.S. restaurants, these beverages will have to be purchased separately to kids' meals. The four main course options on offer to children include a  hamburger, cheeseburger, chicken nuggets or oatmeal. Satisfries French Fries or apple slices are offered as side items. Burger King adds that all of these offerings are 'fully compliant with the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative pledge'. Healthier horizons: The fast food chain's kids meal combinations now include an option of 100 per cent apple juice, fat-free milk or one per cent fat chocolate milk . For an extra cost: While fizzy drinks are still on offer at Burger King's Canadian and U.S. restaurants, these beverages will have to be ordered separately to kids' meals . The oath states that meal combinations aimed at youngsters must not contain more than 600 calories or 740 milligrams of sodium among other things. When it comes to the new 'child-friendly' beverages at Burger King, the 100 per cent apple juice contains 80 calories; the fat-free milk comes in at 90, while the  one per cent fat chocolate milk has a slightly higher content at 180. The same pour size (8fl oz) of full-fat Coca Cola totals 70 calories. Many healthy eating advocates have applauded Burger King's move and called on other restaurants to follow suit. Margo Wootan, a director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, notes that sugary soft drinks are a top source of calories in children's diets and a major contributor to obesity. She told CBS News that steering children away from soda early on will get them on track toward healthier eating in the future. 'Fewer kids [will be] conditioned to think that soda should be a part of every eating out occasion,' she added.","A spokesperson for the company told Daily Mail Online that the decision to drop soda for young consumers came after a review of 'established scientific and government [nutritional] standards'
