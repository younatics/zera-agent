"(CNN)Manchester United and skipper Wayne Rooney significantly boosted its own chances and delivered a probable knockout blow to Tottenham Hotspur's hopes of Champions League qualification with 3-0 home win Sunday. First half goals from Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Rooney effectively ended the EPL match as a contest, with the win leaving United in fourth spot, but only two points adrift of second-placed Manchester City.  Tottenham is seventh, six points adrift of the top four. Rooney's third after another piece of disastrous defending from the visitors led to an impromptu and topical goal celebration, which was certainly the main talking point. A national newspaper had posted a video on on social media Sunday which appeared to show Rooney being felled by fellow EPL footballer and former United teammate Phil Bardsley as both donned boxing gloves for a ""friendly"" fight in his kitchen. After he had converted following a mistake by Nabil Bentaleb, Rooney threw a few mock punches then keeled over backwards on to the Old Trafford turf. Tottenham's players and fans were probably the only people not to see the funny side, but the joke was on them, having gone into the match seeking a third straight away win at United and five games unbeaten against the Red Devils. From United first significant attack on nine minutes, an unmarked Fellaini was found by Carrick and the Belgian international beat Hugo Lloris with a low shot. Fellaini caused chaos in the Tottenham defense for the second with Carrick left free to head home from distance. Rooney's emphatic strike after Bentaleb gifted him possession, proved the icing on the cake. The victory eases the pressure on manager Louis Van Gaal and his expensively assembled side after some lackluster recent performances and last Monday's disappointing FA Cup exit to Arsenal. It meant Tottenham, off the back of two straight wins and with Harry Kane in top form, was favored going into the crucial match, but the young striker barely had a glimpse of goal, until having his side's first shot on target after fully 88 minutes as United dominated. Earlier, Chelsea extended its lead at the top of the EPL to six points but was held 1-1 at home to Southampton in another less than convincing performance from Jose Mourinho's team. Off the back of a disappointing Champions League exit to Paris Saint Germain, Chelsea again struggled to find its best form at Stamford Bridge despite going in front from Diego Costa's 18th league goal. Dusan Tasic equalized from the spot for the Saints after Nemanja Matic  was adjudged to have fouled Sadio Mane, with Chelsea protests waved away. Chelsea found Fraser Forster hard to beat and the visiting goalkeeper made fine saves from Oscar, Eden Hazard and Juan Cuadrado to deny the leaders three points. However, it has a commanding lead plus a game in hand over chasing Manchester City, which lost 1-0 to Burnley Saturday, in a severe blow to hopes of retaining the title. In Sunday's other EPL clash, Everton eased its relegation fears with a 3-0 win over Newcastle, who had Fabricio Coloccini sent off for a foul on Aaron Lennon, who is on loan at Goodison from Tottenham. In La Liga, Gareth Bale snapped a recent lean spell of scoring form with both goals as Real Madrid beat Levante 2-0 in the Bernabeu. The record signing struck first in the 17th minute when Cristiano Ronaldo's acrobatic effort was cleared off the line and the Welshman scored the rebound. The same combination was at work for the second in the 40th minute with Ronaldo's strike helped into the visiting net by Bale. Ronaldo might have added to the tally and missed several opportunities but Real was never threatened by Levante and eased to the three points. It leaves them a point adrift of Barcelona ahead of next weekend's El Clasico, which could go a long way to determining the title race.","Manchester United thrashes Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 .

"(CNN)Thousands of Singaporeans gathered in pouring rain Sunday to bid farewell to Lee Kuan Yew, the Southeast Asian city-state's founding prime minister who charted its spectacular economic rise. Draped in the national flag, Lee's coffin was taken on a solemn procession through the sodden streets of the tropical city, where crowds of mourners defied the downpour to pay their last respects. The funeral service was attended by dozens of foreign dignitaries, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""The light that has guided us all these years has been extinguished. We have lost our founding father Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, who lived and breathed Singapore all his life,"" Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is one of Lee's sons, said in a eulogy. Lee died early Monday morning at age 91, prompting an outpouring of grief and tributes from around the world. He had been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia on February 5. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded Singapore, a former British colony, in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia. He served as its prime minister for more than three decades, shaping the once poor trading post into a wealthy financial center. He continued to play an important role in government until his final years. After Lee's death, hundreds of thousands of people joined huge lines to pay respects to the former leader as his body lay in state at Singapore's Parliament House for several days last week. The procession Sunday weaved past a number of notable Singapore landmarks on the way to the University Cultural Centre, where the state funeral service took place. ""Together, we came not only to mourn. Together, we celebrate Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's long and full life, and what he has achieved with us, his people,"" his son said in his eulogy. Lee was also honored by a 21-gun salute and a minute of silence, as well as displays by the Singapore Air Force and the Singapore Navy. The funeral service was to be followed by a private cremation. Other international figures attending the funeral included Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Leader of the U.K. House of Commons William Hague and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Although Lee is admired for the economic success he helped Singapore achieve, he also drew criticism for curbing media freedoms and the treatment of political opponents. ""While remembering his deeds that helped build Singapore up to what it is today, the government should also mark the passing of Lee Kuan Yew, by making a break from the politics of yesteryear that were too often marked by restrictions on basic civil and political rights,"" Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said in a statement Sunday.","""The light that has guided us all these years has been extinguished,"" Lee's son says .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Rebels seized an international airport in Yemen Sunday as a U.N. envoy warned that the country was at ""the edge of civil war."" Houthi militants took over the airport in Taiz as they swept through the city and surrounding province, two officials with the Taiz provincial government said. One civilian was killed and 82 others wounded when the rebels fired at local residents protesting their presence, the officials said. The rebels have also seized security and intelligence buildings in Taiz and set up checkpoints in the area, the officials said. Taiz, about 390 kilometers (240 miles) south of Sanaa, is Yemen's cultural capital. The rebels -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- surrounded the presidential palace in January. Yemen's President and his Cabinet resigned days later. Ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi says his resignation wasn't valid and maintains that he remains the country's leader. In a statement Sunday, the United Nations Security Council backed Hadi, calling for all sides to end armed hostilities and work out differences at the negotiating table. ""Peaceful dialogue is the only way forward,"" said Jamal Benomar, the U.N.'s special adviser on Yemen. But he gave a dire assessment of the current situation, saying the country is in a ""rapid downward spiral"" and at ""the edge of civil war."" This isn't the first time the U.N. Security Council has weighed in on the mounting tensions. Last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest. But so far, it seems calls for calm from around the world have done little to quell the violence. Last week, a Yemeni jet commanded by the Houthi fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. That same day, Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes, Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour said. There are growing concerns that terror groups such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS could take advantage of the chaos to mount attacks and spread their reach. Bombings at two mosques in Sanaa last week killed at least 137 people and wounded hundreds more. ISIS claimed responsibility in a statement posted on a site that has published previous statements from the group. On Saturday the State Department said the U.S. military had pulled its remaining personnel out of Yemen due to the deteriorating security situation. Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta and CNN's Richard Roth reported from the United Nations.

"(CNN)The white-haired woman's face beams as the camera gets closer to her face. She's sitting on a couch, with a University of Oklahoma shirt draped behind her and a rap song playing in the background. Suddenly, the words spew from her pink-painted lips: ""Ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni*****!"" The release of the Vine video, featuring the house mother of the campus' Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, couldn't come at a worse time -- just days after video surfaced of frat members singing a racist song. But Beauton Gilbow, the fraternity's house mother, insists she's not racist. And two black alumni of the fraternity house agree with the woman they call ""Mom B."" ""I have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news,"" Gilbow said in a statement. ""I am heartbroken by the portrayal that I am in some way racist. I have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life. The song in the background was the sound of ""All Gold Everything"" from Trinidad James -- a black, Atlanta-based rapper. ""I was singing along to a Trinidad song, but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week."" William Bruce James II, the most recent black member at the fraternity chapter, said no one should use the n-word in any context -- even if it's just a song. ""That word needs to die,"" James told CNN Tonight. ""With that being said, I don't believe that Mom B. has hatred in her heart. I was there with her for four years. She took great care of me ...  she cared about me, she cares about my family. She had pictures of me, my wife, my children on the entryway table in that house. Mom B means a lot to me."" James said he has reached to Mom B. after the Oklahoma Daily newspaper posted the clip, which was shot in 2013. ""I essentially said, 'Hey, don't ever use that word again, even in a song. But from me, you're forgiven.' "" Black OU SAE alumnus: 'They are not my brothers' Jonathon Davis, the first African-American member of the campus' SAE chapter, also defended ""Mom B."" ""I wouldn't even hesitate for a split second to say that Mom B. is undoubtedly not a racist,"" Davis said. ""I see her as being caught up in the moment. She does like to mix it up socially, and she likes to have fun with the guys and their dates they bring over to the house. And I see this as maybe her getting caught away with the moment."" OU's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter unraveled this week after video showed frat brothers singing about excluding black students and alluding to lynching. ""There will never be a ni**** SAE,"" some chanted. ""You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me. There will never be a ni**** SAE."" Two students expelled over racist chant . After the fraternity chapter was suspended -- but before her own video was publicized -- Gilbow told CNN affiliate KOCO-TV that she was blindsided by the controversy. ""I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me,"" she said. ""This has been my life for 15 years. And it's tough."" In the end, the SAE chapter was forced to close.

"(CNN)Marine biologists at the South Carolina Aquarium are treating a rare, 475-pound leatherback sea turtle that washed up Saturday on a nearby beach. The episode marks the first rescue of a leatherback sea turtle in South Carolina and is believed to be only the fifth live rescue of this species in the United States, according to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The endangered turtle was found stranded on the Yawkey-South Island Preserve, a wildlife refuge near Georgetown, South Carolina. Rescuers named it Yawkey. Because the turtle is believed to be a juvenile -- rescuers say it's probably less than 10 years old -- and has not reached sexual maturity, biologists can't yet determine its sex. Rescuers found no external signs of trauma to the reptile, although it was hypoglycemic. Staffers with the aquarium's sea turtle rescue program gave it antibiotics, vitamins and some time to recover at their facilities. The treatments appear to be helping. Aquarium officials said the turtle was more energetic Tuesday than when it was first admitted. Even so, leatherback turtles historically don't do well in captivity. For that reason, aquarium staffers are working with the state's Department of Natural Resources to determine the best place and time to release the turtle back into the ocean -- most likely within the next few days. Leatherbacks are the largest turtles on Earth and can grow up to 2,000 pounds. They are found throughout the world's oceans and have been spotted as far north as Norway and as far south as South America.","Staffers at the South Carolina Aquarium are treating a rare, 475-pound leatherback sea turtle .

"(CNN)ISIS apparently claimed responsibility Thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country's capital, a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the Arab Spring and stirred questions about militants in the country. In an audio statement posted online Thursday, ISIS identified two men -- Abu Zakariya al-Tunisi and Abu Anas al-Tunisi -- it said used ""automatic weapons and hand grenades"" to kill and injure what it called ""crusaders and apostates"" in the Bardo Museum in Tunis. Tunisian Health Minister Said Aidi said 23 people are believed to have been killed, including at least one who died at a hospital overnight. And that bloodshed, the ISIS message warned, is ""just the start."" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. A U.S. official told CNN there is no reason to doubt the claim's authenticity. That said, American officials are checking the platform that the statement went out on, including the extent to which it's tied to the group calling itself the Islamic State. The current U.S. thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local ""franchise"" adherents to ISIS, rather than centrally directed by the Islamist extremist group's leadership, which is now thought to be in Syria. The two attackers were carrying explosives, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said in an interview Thursday with the French broadcaster TF1. He credited Tunisian security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because ""terrible explosives were found on these (attackers) and they didn't have time to use them."" Tunisia has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the Arab Spring. But the North African nation is not without its issues, including an uneven economy and the distinction of having more citizens -- up to 3,000 Tunisians -- thought to have gone to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. Authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with Wednesday's attack, including four directly linked to the bloodshed, according to a statement from Essebsi. Earlier Thursday, Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid identified two suspects, Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou, in an interview with French radio station RTL. It's not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces, or if it's possible they're the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in ISIS' audio statement. Labidi was ""known to the security services, he was flagged and monitored,"" Essid said. But he added the man wasn't known or being followed for anything special. The siege took place just days after a Tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was coming soon, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorist propaganda. In his message, the jihadist claimed to belong to Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia, a group that in December pledged allegiance to ISIS, even though that vow hadn't seemed to have fully registered with the Islamist extremist group. His post comes after an ISIS fighter in the extremist group's stronghold of Raqqa in Syria recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in Tunisia had not pledged fealty. ""This raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS' debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian jihadis for maximum impact,"" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. The attack may have been in and about Tunisia, but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners. They came from various backgrounds, from a Spanish couple to a Colombian mother and son. In addition to those pairs, the dead included three Italians, three Japanese, two French, two Poles, a Belgian, a Russian and a Briton, according to cruise ship companies and their respective governments. Three Tunisians, one of them a security officer and another a job applicant, also were killed, according to Aidi. Twelve of those killed had been aboard the MSC Splendida, a cruise ship with more than 3,700 passengers and nearly 1,300 crew that docked in Tunis hours before the bloodshed, its parent company said in a statement. Five more victims came from a similar vessel, the Costa Fascinosa, which was at port in the Tunisian capital at the same time, according to Costa Cruises. Another 36 people remain hospitalized, while eight others were treated and released. The Bardo had been a logical stop for these tourists, housed next to Tunisia's Parliament in a 19th century palace and cast as a ""jewel of Tunisian heritage,"" with its exhibits showcasing the country's art, culture and history. Its prominent place in Tunisia's economy -- which banks heavily on tourism, with millions visiting the country each year -- also made it a logical target for terrorists. ""They hit the heart of our livelihood,"" said Mohammed Ali Troudi, a taxi driver in Tunis. It's too early to tell how tourists will react to the attack. Both the MSC Splendida and the Costa Fascinosa have since left Tunis, even as the search continues for some of their missing passengers -- at least four from the Splendida and two from the Fascinosa, according to their respective companies. The question is whether more passenger-packed cruise ships, as well as commercial airliners filled with tourists, will come to Tunisia in the future. Travelers warned of risks as Tunisia reels from attack . The economy and terrorism are linked in Tunisia, in the sense that high youth unemployment and sparse opportunities are thought to have contributed to the large numbers becoming jihadists -- whether abroad or at home. Attacking what Tunisian lawmaker Sabrine Ghoubantini called ""a symbol of sovereignty in Tunisia"" likely won't help. ""It's really sad,"" Ghoubantini told CNN from Tunis, ""and I hope that it won't really affect our economy."" The government has been battling a jihadist presence in the Chaambi Mountains. And in February, the country's Interior Ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi. Mehrezia Labidi, another parliamentarian, says it's imperative that the message gets across to would-be jihadists that ""life in democracy is better than"" what terrorist recruiters are telling them. ""We have really to work on the culture, the level of ideas,"" she said. Meanwhile, she and others stressed that the vast majority of Tunisians -- including secular-minded citizens and moderate Islamists -- need to come together for their country and against these extremist views and tactics. ""They are trying to terrify us. But the whole Tunisian people is unified -- all the parties, all the civil society organizations, all the countries are unified,"" Ghoubantini said. ""... I'm sure that we will fight terrorism and that we will really eradicate it from our country.""

"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)Nuclear talks intensified Sunday between world powers and Iran, but key sticking points remained unresolved as the countries tried to reach a deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program ahead of a Tuesday deadline. As the negotiations entered their fourth day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the agreement coming together is worse than Israel's deepest fears. The talks had hit a snag on Saturday, with diplomats describing Iran as refusing to budge, but as the French, German and Chinese foreign ministers arrived, the mood seemed more optimistic. The British and Russian foreign ministers were expected late Sunday. U.S. officials and Western diplomats described the negotiations as tough and intense, which was expected as the talks reached the endgame. They said the contours of a deal are becoming clearer, but they were unsure it could be reached. Two core issues are still unresolved: 1) Limits on Iranian research and development on advanced nuclear technology in the end years of the deal; and 2) The pace of lifting United Nations sanctions. The U.S. officials stressed all of the elements were interrelated and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to, comparing the final deal to a puzzle. But they indicated most of the other elements were solvable if those two major hurdles could be overcome. The speed of which U.N. sanctions could be lifted remains in dispute. Iran wants them lifted immediately after the deal goes into effect. While diplomats say Iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade, oil and banking, sanctions adopted by the United Nations are more complicated. Many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran's nuclear program does not have a military dimension. On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif made clear the issue of sanctions remains a stumbling block, saying he believes the world powers ""have realized that sanctions, pressure and an agreement will not go together. It's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating."" U.S. officials said that all sides, including Iran, agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as Iran confirms its compliance to the deal. But they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula. Iran also wants the ability to continue to research and develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect. Those machines can enrich uranium much faster than its current machines. U.S. and European officials worry that could enable Iran to quickly produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon. Diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15 year deal would have the most stringent restrictions, with others being relaxed over the next five. ""We will see if they are ready to swallow what we proposed,"" a Western diplomat said. ""We are not asking them to do nothing, but they want to do more than we want them to do"" referring to how much research the Iranians want to be able to still undertake. But the diplomat added, ""after 15 years, they can do what they want."" A senior Iranian diplomat told CNN on Sunday: ""It's not fair to characterize the state of affairs as Iranian resistance on those issues. It can also be characterized as the other side's intransigence in the talks."" Diplomats said Iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium, a process that can lead to weapons-grade material.  The figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started on Thursday, but substantially more than the several hundred the United States had originally wanted.  Iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges, but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile. U.S. officials maintain the number is abstract, because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges Iran can operate, which they believe will extend the time Iran would need to have enough fissile material produce a nuclear weapon -- known as the ""break-out time""  -- to at least a year. On Monday, a senior State Department official said negotiators had not yet decided anything about the disposal of fissile material. There had been word previously that Iran might export it to Russia, but an Iranian negotiator, Abbas Araqchi, told journalists Sunday that Iran had not agreed to it. ""The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program, and we do not intend to them abroad. ... There is no question of sending the stocks abroad,"" he said. Netanyahu voiced alarm at the emerging deal. After meeting with visiting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, Netanyahu said, ""this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse."" ""In parallel to the gathering for this dangerous agreement, the proxies of Iran in the Middle East are carrying out a wide occupation of Yemen,"" he said. ""The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to mankind and needs to be stopped."" The parties are seeking agreement on the basic parameters of a deal before March 31. A comprehensive deal including technical annexes is supposed to be concluded by June 30. Tuesday is seen as a critical milestone to the U.S. negotiators, who are trying to thwart a threat from Congress to impose additional sanctions without the  framework. That could prompt Iran to withdraw from the talks and scuttle the chances of a deal altogether. But even if a pact is reached, it is unclear what form it would take. U.S. officials say they will need to publicize something that quantifies Iran's commitments before submitting it to Congress. But U.S. and Western diplomats say that Iran is looking simply for an ""understanding"" of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached. CNN's Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","One key sticking point: What would be the limits on Iranian nuclear research?

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Good artists borrow. Great artists steal. On Tuesday, a California federal jury delivered its own message to artists everywhere that inspiration can rise to copyright infringement. The verdict was reached after eight days of trial testimony examining whether Robin Thicke's and Pharrell Williams' ""Blurred Lines,"" one of the most successful songs of the young century, was improperly drawn from a soulful hallmark from the prior one — Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit ""Got to Give It Up."" Ultimately, a jury comprised of five women and three men heard dueling opinions regarding ""Blurred Lines"" and decided to order Thicke and Williams to pay $4 million in copyright damages plus profits attributable to infringement, which for Thicke was determined to be $1.8 million and for Williams was determined to be $1.6 million. Both escaped statutory damages as the infringement was found not to be willful. Read more: Robin Thicke sues to protect 'Blurred Lines' from Marvin Gaye's family (exclusive) The hardly predictable outcome over a song that made more than $16 million in profits will resonate in the music industry where copyright lawsuits are commonplace, but few such suits ever make it to trial. Most never get past the summary judgment phase because judges carefully draw the line on any lawsuits alleging misappropriation of non-protectable ideas. The highest profile disputes like the one between Tom Petty and Sam Smith over ""Stay With Me"" usually settle. Not only did the ""Blurred Lines"" case go the distance, both sides brought esteemed entertainment litigators to convince the jury. Howard King, representing Thicke, Williams and rapper T.I (a.k.a. Clifford Harris Jr.), spoke how artists need wide berth in their creative pursuits. During opening arguments, he told the jury, ""We're going to show you what you already know: that no one owns a genre or a style or a groove. To be inspired by Marvin Gaye is an honorable thing."" Over the next week-and-a-half, King would execute a two-pronged strategy: First, he emphasized that Frankie and Nona Gaye only owned compositional elements in the ""Got to Give It Up"" sheet music, leaving out more recognizable elements of the recording like the percussion and singing. Second, he had witnesses testifying both to the differences of ""Blurred Lines"" and ""Got To Give It Up"" as well as the similarities in other famous songs. The case has been tough on Thicke thanks to depositions revealing he lied in media interviews and was drunk and high on Vicodin. But the singer attempted to do himself a favor by showcasing that songs can be stitched together with ease and that perceptions about similarity can be deceiving. On the witness stand, he sang a medley of U2's ""With Or Without You,"" The Beatles' ""Let It Be,"" Alphaville's ""Forever Young,"" Bob Marley's ""No Woman No Cry"" and Michael Jackson's ""Man In the Mirror."" Read more: Robin Thicke admits drug abuse, lying to media in wild ""Blurred Lines"" deposition (exclusive) Williams also testified about his song creation process, admitting to jurors that ""Blurred Lines"" channels ""that '70s feeling"" and that he looked up to Gaye, but that to feel, isn't copyright infringement. ""The last thing you want to do as a creator is take something of someone else's when you love him,"" said Williams, expressing a point-of-view that's in contrast to the maxim that good artists borrow and great artists steal. Richard Busch, attorney for the Gayes, appeared to know he'd need to overcome the celebrity charisma of his counterparts. ""They will smile at you and they will be charming,"" he said in opening arguments. ""Keep one thing in mind: They are professional performers."" Read more: 'Blurred Lines' trial--Robin Thicke performs piano medley in court . The Gaye family was handicapped by U.S. District Judge John Kronstadt's decision to preclude use at trial of the original sound recording of ""Got to Give It Up"" because Gaye's copyrights on the song were limited to the sheet music compositions. Before the trial began, Busch wondered whether his side would get a fair trial, and while the judge eventually allowed a stripped-down version of Gaye's song to be played for the jury's ears, the attorney was disturbed by comments made by the Thicke side that he argued had ""poisoned"" the trial. The judge dismissed those concerns. Any lingering unhappiness over the judge's decision leading to the jury's verdict will likely be taken on appeal. To demonstrate copyright infringement, Busch instead leaned on the musicologists, who testified of similarities in signature phrase, hook, keyboard-bass interplay, lyrics and theme of the songs. Although ""Blurred Lines"" was the headliner, the Gaye family also attempted to prove that Thicke's ""Love After War"" was an infringement of Gaye's ""After the Dance"" too. Then, there was the rare peek at ""Blurred Lines"" financial success as the Gaye family made their case for damages. Busch had accounting experts speak about all the money made — including $5.6 million in profits to Thicke, $5.2 million to Williams and $700K to T.I. and the rest of the $16.7 million in overall profits to record companies Interscope, UMG Distribution and Star Trak. The Gayes also wanted some of the $11 million in touring income attributable to ""Blurred Lines"" success as well as money for overhead costs and statutory damages for willful infringement. All told, the Gaye family was seeking more than $25 million — a mammoth demand that would shatter the song plagiarism high-water mark of $5.4 million that a California court ordered Michael Bolton and Sony to pay two decades ago for infringing The Isley Brothers' ""Love is a Wonderful Thing."" In closing arguments, Busch raised the issue of Thicke's credibility, telling jurors, """"What it boils down to is 'Yes, we copied. Yes, we took it. Yes, we lied about it. Yes, we changed our story every time'... It boils down to this: Who do you believe?... Are you going to believe Robin Thicke, who told us all he's not an honest person?"" King offered a rebuttal. ""Why would Mr. Williams need to copy anyone to create a hit?"" he asked the jury. ""Why would Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams endure a proceeding like this, where their personal financial details are revealed to the world?"" In what might now be the landmark legal controversy over songcraft, the jury decided to find that Thicke and Williams infringed both songs. The two were only punished $9,375 for ""Love After War,"" but it will be the multimillion dollar verdict regarding ""Blurred Lines"" that will sound out for ages. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.

Mass urbanization is proving to be ""the single most important transformation"" the world is seeing in the 21st century, according to Jamal Saghir, director of sustainable development at the World Bank, and it shows no signs of letting up. By 2050, the U.N. predicts 66% of us will call a city our home. It is generally accepted that cities are the engines of economic growth, and nowhere are these engines firing harder, or populations growing faster, than in the developing world. With burgeoning higher education systems and enviably young workforces, African cities in particular are booming. Commended for their diversity, adaptability and enterprise, investors are taking note. Global auditing firm PwC has now quantified and ranked Africa's urban hubs in a new report listing the continent's top ""Cities of Opportunity."" With the caveat that only one city per country could be assessed, PwC set out ranking locations in terms of infrastructure, human capital, economics and society and demographics. North African cities dominated the top five, with Cairo claiming pole position, followed by Tunis, Johannesburg, Casablanca and Algiers. Analysts cited the age of North African cities as a determining factor, with strong infrastructure across the board, incubating an environment for human capital to thrive. However, sub-Saharan cities registered among the highest in terms of society and demographics, excelling in diversity and population growth, both useful when looking towards future investment. Indeed, the report also offered an alternative ranking, gauging the strongest trajectories in terms of investment. GDP growth, ease of doing business, attracting FDI, middle class and overall population growth all took precedent. Under these criteria, Cairo could only achieve a mid-table ranking and was the only city in the top 10 north of the Sahara. Dar es Salaam, Lusaka, Nairobi, Lagos and Accra made up the top five, suggesting a new generation of African powerhouse economies is waiting in the wings. That being said, one city's development does not preclude another's. What is certain is that the battle for economic dominance is on. Read this: Africa's 10 most prosperous countries .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)It's a unique world where friendships are forged, deals struck and more than the occasional argument breaks out. Welcome to Nigeria's free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day. They are called ""free"" because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading. Discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as Nigeria goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president. Newspaper vendor John Mgbachi, a former shoemaker from Eastern Nigeria, who has a stand in Tinubu Square on Lagos Island said that far from being bad for business, he welcomes the free readers. ""They are passionate about the news and and their presence is an advert for me,"" he said. Mgbachi told CNN that he often sees a big rise in numbers around football tournaments, mostly the Premier League, and also during the election campaign period. To avoid losing out on sales too much, Mgbachi has developed an interesting business model: ""I decided not to make (reading) completely free. For some of the dailies, its 20 naira,(10 cents) 30 naira (15 cents) for the sports papers and 50 naira (30 cents) for the magazines. ""It's not really a static price, it depends on the bargaining power of the person,"" he added. Some even take out a monthly subscription to read the newspapers. The free readers come from all walks of life and CNN spoke to analysts, an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited. They talked about the excitement of discussing the current affairs with others while reading the daily newspaper. One told us he had made two very good friends and even landed a job offer. Mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet. He added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many Nigerians cannot afford to buy newspapers. Most of Nigeria's $70 billion oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a politically connected elite while many of its citizens struggle to make ends meet.","Men gather around newspaper vendors to read headlines, debate issues of the day .

"(CNN)India's highest court has reversed a controversial law that gave the authorities sweeping powers to arrest and potentially jail people for comments posted on social networks and other Internet platforms. The Supreme Court ruled that Section 66A of the 2008 Information Technology Act was ""unconstitutional"" and ""hit at the root of liberty and freedom of expression, the two cardinal pillars of democracy."" Under Section 66A, alleged offenders could face up to three years in jail for posting material that is ""grossly offensive,"" has ""menacing character,"" -- or perhaps even more ambiguously -- causes ""annoyance or inconvenience."" The court said this wording was ""vague"" and could be ""misconstrued,"" according to Ranjeeta Rohatgi, an advocate who was present at the hearing in Delhi Tuesday. India's cyber laws have ignited a furious debate about curbs on freedom of speech in recent years.  In 2012, a university professor was arrested for circulating a cartoon that poked fun at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The cartoon, which was a parody of a scene in a popular Indian movie, went viral on social media. He was charged with a range of offenses including defamation, insulting a woman and sending offensive messages from a computer. Mahapatra called the charges a misuse of the law ""in the name of surveillance, to curb democratic rights, freedom of speech and human rights of common people."" A year earlier, Delhi went one step further with its digital crackdown when the so-called ""intermediary guidelines"" implicated web platforms themselves. The rules now require Internet companies to take down any content seen as ""disparaging,"" ""blasphemous,"" or ""defamatory"" within 36 hours of a user submitting a formal request for removal. In Mumbai, India's financial center, police spokesman Dhananjay Kulkarni told CNN in February that some 650 posts and pages were blocked last year under these regulations. Google says in the last half of 2013 it removed 540 items from its pages in compliance with orders issued by Indian courts, government agencies, and law enforcement. It's a similar story with Facebook. The social networking site took down nearly 5,000 pieces of content reported by the Indian government in the first half of 2014. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh and Kunal Sehgal in Delhi, as well as Mackenzie Sigalos in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","Supreme Court rules Section 66A of the 2008 Information Technology Act was ""unconstitutional""

"Los Angeles (CNN)Three area residents were arrested and charged Wednesday for allegedly operating four Southern California schools for Korean and Chinese students who never attended classes and lived in other states on student visas in a ""pay-to-stay"" scheme. The three educators collected as much as $6 million in annual tuition from an enrollment of about 1,500 foreign students who were largely from South Korea and China, said federal prosecutors. The arrests came after a federal grand jury indicted the three defendants Tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud, money laundering and other immigration offenses. An allegation in the indictment would also require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraudulent scheme, authorities said. Hee Sun Shim, 51, of Beverly Hills, is the owner and manager and of the postsecondary schools and is charged with 13 counts of use or possession of an immigration document procured by fraud, authorities said. The two other defendants are each charged with one count of that same offense: They are Hyung Chan Moon, also known as Steve Moon, 39, of Los Angeles who assisted in the operation and management of the schools; and Eun Young Choi, also known as Jamie Choi, 32, of Los Angeles, a former employee who also assisted in the operation and management of the school. Shim, who also went by Leonard Shim and Leo Shim, is also charged with three counts of encouraging illegal residence, as well as two counts of money laundering, prosecutors said. The three defendants and their attorneys couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. ""Immigration fraud schemes potentially compromise national security and cheat foreign nationals who play by the rules,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Yonekura said in a statement. ""In this case, officials at several schools allegedly abused their responsibility to ensure that only legitimate foreign students were allowed to the stay in the country. This type of fraud against the United States will be thoroughly examined to bring those responsible to justice and to protect the integrity of our immigration system,"" the federal prosecutor said. Three of the schools are in Los Angeles' Koreatown neighborhood: Prodee University/Neo-America Language School; Walter Jay M.D. Institute, an Educational Center (WJMD); and the American College of Forensic Studies (ACFS), authorities said. The fourth school is currently operating in Alhambra, California: Likie Fashion and Technology College, authorities said. ""What we've broken up is a pay-to-stay scheme,"" said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""That's a scheme where institutions purport to be schools, but are really not doing any education whatsoever,"" he said. ""Any scheme where someone gains access to the U.S. through fraud is also a national security vulnerability,"" Arnold said. ""Although we don't have any information that any of these people wish to do harm to the U.S., the point is anyone could take advantage of a vulnerability like this. Which is why it is so important that we identify these vulnerabilities and shut them down."" Prodee University/Neo-America Language School was located on the fifth floor of a Los Angeles office tower near the Koreatown neighborhood, but Homeland Security Investigations agents said they found the school ""abandoned"" during their raid on Wednesday. The agents allowed CNN to attend the raid. The school featured classrooms, administrative offices and a small library, but no one occupied the spaces. In fact, the abandoned school brought to mind a movie set, filled with props and decorations, but no actors. In one small room, a CD player serenaded empty desks with classical music. The tiny library featured USC and UCLA pennants. The television wasn't even plugged in.  One federal agent said many of the students listed on the school rolls were older, in their 30s, 40s and 50s. Prodee's 2011-2012 catalog describes the facility as an English as second language school and states ""It is our mission that all students be able to flourish in their ability to use and understand English in all facets of life by providing a top quality ESL educational environment,"" according to a copy of the document on the website of the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. ""Our enthusiastic and qualified instructors concern themselves with teaching a rigorous, but innovative curriculum of interactive and beneficial courses and materials leading to higher TOEFL scores and admission to U.S. colleges and universities,"" the catalog says. Another document with the state bureau indicates Prodee had a 73% graduation rate in 2011 and a 60% rate in 2010. But the indictment alleges that students actually lived Nevada, Texas, Washington state and Arizona. The schools were authorized by the federal government to issue a document that certified a foreign student had been accepted to a school and would be attending classes full time in the United States, authorities said. The document, called a Form I-20, made a student eligible for a F-1 student visa. In exchange for that form, students paid $1,800 tuition to enroll in one of the schools for six months, authorities said. During their investigation, authorities interviewed 35 students, mainly from South Korea, and found none resided in Los Angeles, officials said. An unannounced federal inspection of Prodee's main site in 2011 found only one English class with three students, though the school listed an enrollment of 900 students for its two sites, prosecutors said. On the same day, federal authorities also visited the American College of Forensic Studies found only one religion with one student, though the school claimed an enrollment of more than 300 foreign students, prosecutors said. Some students transferred to one of the four schools after attending other U.S. schools also participating in the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program, prosecutors said. The conspiracy count carries a maximum prison sentence of five years. The immigration fraud charges each carry up to 10 years in prison, and the money laundering charges carry a potential penalty of 20 years, authorities said. Wednesday's arrests follow last week's federal raids of more than three dozen ""maternity hotels"" in Southern California where foreign women give birth, allegedly for the sole purpose of having a U.S.-citizen baby, authorities said. The ""maternity tourism"" sites included apartment complexes in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth, federal officials said. Those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from China, who paid $15,000 to $50,000 for lodging, transportation and food, according to a statement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Those fees don't necessarily include medical care, authorities said. Specifically, authorities in the maternity tourism raids obtained search warrants for 37 location and conducted searches at more than 50 locations, including sites that consented to a federal search, said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.","CNN attends federal raid, finds school abandoned, resembling movie set .

"(CNN)As relatives and friends mourn the loss of their loved ones aboard Germanwings Flight 9525, the world community is stunned by the sequence of events that led to co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely crashing the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. I happen to have several personal connections to this tragedy: a recent graduate of Drexel University -- where I teach -- and her mother were on the ill-fated flight, I lived in Germany for 18 years and I am a psychologist who has researched the psychology of terrorism and developed psychiatric tests that are used to determine pilot flight fitness. While the engineering of the Airbus aircraft is fascinating and the world of air traffic control absorbing, what is even more complex and challenging to understand is the human mind of the co-pilot investigators say is responsible for the crash -- the machine that flies the machine. When complex engineering systems interact with human factors, it is most often the human that causes the anomaly. Humans are far less reliable than machines. The average aviator has superior intellectual and cognitive abilities, and is psychologically stable and reliable. While it is not surprising that when it comes to aviation accidents, the first line of inquiry is into what went wrong with the plane. However, very often, as apparently is the case here, something went wrong with the human flying the plane. Pilots are typically tested for emotional stability and screened for the presence of mental illness when they are selected. The U.S. Navy has strict testing programs related to fitness for duty protocols for their pilots during the length of their careers. But we have learned that the German company Lufthansa and its budget airline affiliate Germanwings do not use psychological testing once the pilots have made it through the selection process. Psychological assessment and screening is not held in as high esteem in Germany as it is in the United States. Perhaps it should be. A fitness-for-duty evaluation asks this important question: Can the pilot safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health and cognitive standpoint? The deliberate destruction of Flight 9525 by a single person, most likely related to some grievance or other unknown intrinsic motivation that he took to the grave, can also be considered an act of terrorism. The action constitutes the unlawful use of violence against the passengers on the flight to further some yet unknown objective. Research on the perpetrators of terrorism has revealed that a single person is capable of executing odd, unexplainable violent actions. Their behaviors may be related to a political or social framework, or it may be associated with something deeply personal. Examples include Richard Reid, the failed shoe bomber; Eric Rudolph, the Olympic bomber; or Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber. In 2009, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army officer and psychiatrist, went on a shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas, killing 13 and wounding 32. And in 2012, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, a 38-year-old father of two, opened fire and killed 16 innocent Afghan civilians. When examining Germanwings Flight 9525 from the ""cockpit of the human mind,"" one must ask this question: How can we ever predict or prevent tragedies like these when we can never truly know what lurks in the mind of another human being? As a psychologist, I would, of course, advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots, as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this. Just as aircraft are inspected and maintained, it is important to regularly evaluate one of the more fragile components of modern aviation -- the pilots operating the plane. But, just as the overwhelming majority of automobile accidents are caused by driver error, with a human mind at the helm of an aircraft, there will always be an element of unpredictability present. And, unless we had a ""flight recorder"" for the human brain, we will never really know what took place inside the mind of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. One thing is for sure: the tragic events of Flight 9525 will surely renew conversation about what happened to Flight MH370 -- the biggest aviation mystery since Amelia Earhart vanished in 1937 -- and the role that human factors may have played in its disappearance.","Eric Zillmer: It's hard to predict or prevent tragedies like the Germanwings crash .

"(CNN)A nuclear deal with international powers on Iran's nuclear program is within reach and achievable, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told reporters Saturday. Rouhani said negotiators from both sides have found new common ground in recent days, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The President believes that ""clinching a general deal is easy,"" according to the IRNA story, but hammering out agreements on certain details ""will be a very tough and complicated job."" Iran has been largely isolated for years for its nuclear program, one that its leaders say the country wants for peaceful purposes. Others, like the United States, have challenged that assertion and instituted strict sanctions, fearing that Tehran actually plans to develop nuclear weapons. After years of basic stalemates, Iranian officials and representatives of the P5+1 have managed to reach short-term agreements as they try to strike a larger deal. The sides have been working toward that end in Lausanne, Switzerland, hoping to get a framework pact in place ahead of a March 31 deadline. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, joined these talks Monday. All sides took a break Friday, but are expected to return to the negotiating table soon. Kerry, addressing reporters Saturday in Lausanne before leaving for London, said ""substantial progress"" had been made toward reaching a deal but that ""important gaps remain."" He insisted that the international powers involved in the talks, the P5+1 -- consisting of Germany and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain -- were united in their determination to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is purely peaceful. The stakes are high and the issues complicated, Kerry said. ""Let me once again be clear: We don't want just any deal,"" he said. ""If we had, we could have announced something a long time ago."" There has been ""genuine progress"" over the past 16 months since a joint plan was agreed and in his conversations with Zarif of the past few days, Kerry said. The international powers won't rush the process, he said, but the negotiations are at a decisive point. ""We recognize that fundamental decisions have to be made now and they don't get any easier as time goes by,"" he said. ""It is time to make hard decisions. We want the right deal that would make the world, including the United States and our closest partners and allies, safer and more secure, and that is our test."" U.S. President Barack Obama has made clear that he wants to achieve a ""comprehensive and durable agreement"" that is based on intensive verification of its implementation rather than trust, Kerry added. ""We have not yet reached the finish line but, make no mistake, we have the opportunity to get this right,"" he said. While in London, Kerry met with his counterparts from the UK, Germany and France, as well as the European Union foreign policy chief, to discuss their coordinated approach. British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond spoke for the group, echoing Kerry but saying while ""substantial progress has been made in some areas,"" there were other areas that lacked agreement. ""The time has come now for Iran in particular to make some very tough decisions if we are going to see progress made,"" Hammond said. Kerry also spoke Friday by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The Iranian President's guarded optimism Saturday -- which also happens to be Nowruz, a holiday marking the start of spring and beginning of a new year in the Persian calendar -- jibes with the progress cited recently by the Iranians' counterparts in the talks. Western officials said Friday that the ongoing negotiations have led to compromises on some crucial issues that have long divided the West and Iran. Specifically, the parties are coalescing around an idea that Iran could keep 6,000 centrifuges in any deal, down from the 6,500 that had been under discussion, two Western diplomats told CNN. The pace of relief from sanctions is a sticking point for Iran, according to a Western official. Iranian negotiators want them lifted immediately, while U.S. and European negotiators prefer they be phased out over several years, contingent on Iran meeting its end of the bargain. The debate has generated heated disagreements not only in Switzerland, but also in Washington, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Congress on March 3 at the invitation of Republican leaders to warn about any nuclear deal with Iran. The speech was made without the approval of U.S. President Barack Obama. The next week, an open letter signed by 47 Republican senators, addressing Iran's leadership, noted that any agreement made with the U.S. administration that is not approved by the Senate could be nullified by Obama's successor. Late Thursday, Obama reached out ""directly to the people and leaders of Iran,"" in a video message recorded ostensibly for Nowruz, to urge them to back a deal curtailing Tehran's nuclear program. ""This year we have the best opportunity in decades to pursue a different future between our countries,"" Obama said. ""... Together we have to speak up for the future we seek ... I believe our countries should be able to resolve this issue peacefully with diplomacy."" But Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his own Nowruz address on Saturday, noted the political divisions within the United States over the nuclear talks, Iran's state-run Press TV reported. He suggested the U.S. President's Nowruz message ""included dishonest assertions and his claim of friendship for Iranian people was not sincere,"" he is quoted as saying. Khamenei also said Obama had claimed falsely that some people in Iran did not back a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear issue. What they are in fact resisting is the bullying approach of the United States, he said, according to Press TV. The Ayatollah also insisted that the removal of sanctions should be part of the negotiations, not a step that only followed the implementation of a deal. ""Iran will never accept this,"" he said. ""This is the Americans' ploy. Removal of sanctions should be part of any agreement.""

"Chao Hu, Anhui, China (CNN)Six-year-old Lu Yiming is a handful. One minute, he's on the concrete roof of his two-story house, the next he's fiddling with fireworks. Now, he's skating down an alley. ""Come back here!"" yells his grandmother. ""I have such a headache raising this child,"" 72-year-old old Tang Xinying confides. Lu's mother abandoned him after he was born and his father works as a carpenter in Shandong province hundreds of miles further north. He comes back perhaps once a year. In China, Lu is what's called a ""left-behind child."" Conservatively, there are at least 61 million such children in China -- that's a staggering one in five. They struggle at school, have higher rates of mental health issues, and suffer from more behavioral problems than their contemporaries. ""I tell him 'your father is working and your mother doesn't want you,'"" says an exasperated Tang. In Chao Hu, a village in the inland province of Anhui, a dead-end track passes by half-finished housing projects and abandoned fields. A yellow haze hangs in the air leaving a metallic taste in the mouth. China's industrial pollution made it out here, but the jobs haven't. Everyone of working age in Chao Hu has gone to the cities to find work, leaving the old and very young behind. Lu holds my hand as we walk through the tiny village. A group of old women sit on three-legged wooden stools listening to Chinese opera on a small radio. Another walks by knitting. Some old men make bootleg liquor in an oil drum. ""We don't have fields that we can farm, if you don't go out to work, then how do you earn an income?"" says Tang. ""Their parents have to work outside of town and they cannot bring their children with them."" The All China Women's Federation, a state- backed organization, paints a bleak picture for left behind children. A steady stream of state media reports highlights the abuse suffered by left behind children. And crimes are often blamed on them. ""It has a huge impact on society and the generation of people who grow up without parents,"" says Ines Kaempfer, of the Center for Child-Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility. ""There is a generation of Chinese society that lacks security and trust. It could have a potentially disastrous effect."" Unintended consequences of mass urbanization and migration are not unique to China. But draconian rules have made the problem worse. China's much-hated hukou system registers families as either rural or urban. Most migrants can't change their household registration when they move. They struggle to access healthcare and other social services in urban areas. Their children can't go to public schools -- even if they are born in the cities. Critics say the hukou system has created a vast underclass of cheap labor to help drive China's manufacturing revolution. Recognizing some of its failures, the Chinese Communist Party has proposed reforms of the hukou system including doing away with temporary residence permits. The topic is under discussion this week at the annual meeting of China's National People's Congress, the country's rubber-stamp parliament. ""Though it is better than before, the hukou system is a huge problem,"" says Professor Fan Bin, of the Huadong Technology Institute. ""Migrants can't afford to keep their children in big cities, the rent is high and the wages are low, and they can't pay the tuition for private schools."" In Chao Hu village, Tang is cooking a meal of rice and spinach for her grandson. She swirls peanut oil on her simple stove top. ""I can't teach my grandson well. This boy should be educated by his father and mother,"" she says, ""I cannot catch him when he runs away from me. I cannot discipline him when he misbehaves."" Tang is convinced she can't give her grandson the support he needs. ""We don't have a choice, even if the situation isn't good. If I don't take care of him who will,"" she says.

"(CNN)The first official visit of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to Washington comes as excitement mounts over the possibility that direct peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban are imminent. The visit, which began Sunday, offers the opportunity for discussion and progress on a number of fronts, the coming face-to-face talks with the Taliban almost certainly among them. But while the start of such talks would certainly be a positive development, it would hardly be a sign that peace is about to descend upon a land ravaged by decades of war. The reality is that an agreement with the Taliban that is good for the Afghan government is probably impossible right now. Negotiations to end the Taliban insurgency face a series of significant challenges, and an imperfect deal could harm Afghanistan's nascent unity government, encourage the formation of splinter groups of hardened fighters, boost existing terrorist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS and plunge the country into an era of renewed violence and instability. That said, the United States should remain broadly supportive of these talks by promoting conditions that could make the possibility of success more likely down the road -- history has shown that successful negotiations most often occur when each party has some vulnerability to the other. Militarily, the Taliban is not the Afghan government's equal, but that does not mean the insurgents lack a strong negotiating position. For a start, the international presence in Afghanistan is declining, freeing the Taliban to operate more openly in the rural corners of the country. Meanwhile, Afghan security forces are being killed at rates that are probably not sustainable and civilian casualties are at an all-time high. Most troublingly, the new national unity government has yet to clearly demonstrate its ability to govern. All this means that until the new government shows that the diverse interests within it can coexist, and it articulates a cohesive strategy to counter the Taliban, the insurgents can make a strong case for postponing peace in the hopes of a better situation in the future. A second key to negotiating a path toward peace in Afghanistan is devising a strategy to contain splinter groups. Often in the course of negotiations, those unsatisfied with the peace process flock to new organizations to continue the fight. These can include so-called ""bitter enders,"" hardened fighters who want no part of peace. The emergence of splinter groups is an expected part of any peace negotiation process, but it must be minimized for an agreement to take hold. In the case of Afghanistan, there is no shortage of groups willing to absorb fighters, from outlaw bandit groups to al Qaeda. Recently, as Ghani has highlighted, there have even been stories of fighters declaring allegiance to terrorist group ISIS. It goes without saying that the spread of ISIS's particularly violent form of extremism within Afghanistan would make an already complex and precarious security situation all the more so. Finally, negotiations must happen at a time when a peace agreement can reasonably be enforced -- it is one thing to craft a compromise and quite another to carry it out. Too often in peace negotiations, an agreement is viewed as a finish line, but any deal can easily be derailed by unpopular political accommodations, economic incentives and rebel fighters who refuse to drop their arms. To take hold, peace agreements require a legitimate and effective government capable of communicating new realities to the public and executing policies that are often untried and complex. At the moment, the Afghan government is struggling to carry out existing policies, while juggling the country's many divergent interests. While a peace agreement would certainly boost the legitimacy of a national unity government, a stillborn accord would only lead to disillusionment and doubt. Ultimately, the chances that talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban will succeed are remote at best. Yet the United States should do everything it can to help create the underlying conditions to support productive negotiations -- if not now, at some point in the future. What can the U.S. do? Two things: . First, the Obama administration could agree to the Afghan government's request to slow American troop withdrawals. This would allow the United States to assist the Afghan government to stabilize the country and contain any splintering anti-government factions. Second, the U.S. could remain actively engaged in promoting the success of the Afghan national unity government. This means not merely maintaining existing development and economic efforts, but finding opportunities to assist the new government to boost its legitimacy. For example, the United States could support emerging efforts to build a meaningful relationship between Afghanistan and its neighbor Pakistan, which would increase public confidence in the government's ability to protect its people. It also could lend a hand advising political leaders, including the many first-time cabinet officials, on governance and public service. Sowing the seeds of future success in bringing peace to Afghanistan requires no new U.S. boots on the ground or extravagant financial commitments. Rather, it takes a willingness to continue to engage with Afghanistan's dynamic set of political challenges in small, but meaningful ways.","Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is visiting the United States .

"(CNN)Iraqi forces say they've captured key areas in their offensive to take back Tikrit, which has been under ISIS control since June. The security forces, backed by Shia militias, raised the Iraqi flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city Monday night, a security official with the forces in Tikrit told CNN. The gains, according to the official, came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city's streets. At least 26 militants were killed in the operation, the official said. Earlier Monday, Iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on Iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern Tikrit. The renewed push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes aimed at ISIS targets around the city. The goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for Iraqi forces to go in. Now security forces and fighters from Hashd Al-Shaabi, a predominantly Shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit back from ISIS, say they're gaining ground. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, conquered the city in June as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate. And each time, so far, they've failed. The latest push began after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on March 1 ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and  located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. ISIS responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city, hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure, said Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for al-Abadi. This movement led Iraq's military to pause its operation, out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy Iraqi military and some civilian casualties. The situation spurred the Iraqi Prime Minister to request help from the U.S.-led coalition, which conducted airstrikes around Tikrit last week. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Catherine E. Shoichet,  Ashley Fantz, Ben Wedeman and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","A push to retake Tikrit stalled as ISIS repositioned its forces around the city .

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton is back in the middle of an unfolding controversy. The revelation that as secretary of state she maintained a private email account, and that she had a private computer server in her New York home, sent shock waves through the world of politics last week. Questions arose about whether Clinton conducted her official business on private email, possibly violating regulations that were written to ensure that the activities of government officials remain accessible to the public. Republicans jumped on the story. ""It makes you wonder,"" said Reince Preibus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. ""Did she use the private emails so she could conduct diplomacy and fund-raising at the same time?"" Even many Democrats are worried about the implications of this recent story. Their front-runner, their ""inevitable"" nominee for 2016, now seems vulnerable. Many in Washington are anticipating that the scandal is only getting started. This is not the first time that Hillary Clinton has found herself in this situation. She has spent much of her political career battling scandals. When her husband, Bill Clinton, was president of the United States, she was one of the first targets of the earliest investigations into the administration -- ""Travel-gate,"" ""File-gate"" and the Whitewater affair. She stood by her husband's side later in his presidency when House Republicans moved to impeach him for having lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. Although Clinton enjoyed a bit of a break when serving in the Senate, the controversies resumed once she became secretary of state under President Obama. During her tenure, Republicans became consumed with multiple investigations into her role in the tragic Benghazi attacks. Although the investigations failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing, the issue became a rallying point for conservative activists and fund-raisers. Some Republicans now claim that the emails will provide the data that they have been looking for to prove what they were saying. But those observers who are predicting her demise  should remember that Hillary Clinton has proven to be remarkably resilient over the years. Each time she or her family has been hit with a scandal, she has survived. She has proven to be an extraordinarily tough fighter who turns these challenges into opportunities to become stronger. As Kate McKinnon, playing Hillary Clinton on ""Saturday Night Live"" said, ""Nice try. ... This is NOT how Hillary Clinton goes down."" Based on her history, what can we expect from the Clinton scandal playbook? Attack the accuser and the investigative process: Nobody has done this better than Hillary Clinton. When her husband first confronted charges about his affair, Clinton famously went on television and spoke about a ""right-wing conspiracy"" that she claimed was driving the scandal. Although the revelation that the affair did occur brought her family great embarrassment, her charge became part of a larger counterattack from the administration that proved to be extremely effective. The Clintons zeroed in on the hyperpartisanship of some members of the GOP, such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich, claiming that the Republicans in Congress were on a mission to pull off a political coup. She employed a similar strategy with the Benghazi investigations, arguing that the inquiry was more a political tool used to rally the base than a serious investigation. We are likely to hear similar arguments now, particularly since the email controversy has opened up right as the campaign season is taking off. As more Republicans can't resist jumping on the issue, Clinton will push back, focusing public attention less on the issue than on the idea that this is part of a political narrative to bring her down. Stick it out: One thing that Hillary Clinton and her husband understand well is that the news media love a good scandal feeding frenzy, but that soon enough reporters move on. The American public, which is now used to fast-paced and constantly changing news stories, will follow the coverage as it shifts to a new story even after weeks, or months, of attention on one single issue. Remember the Ebola crisis? Not many people do, though for a time it was all anyone was talking about. As Brendan Nyhan wrote in The New York Times: ""If there's one thing we've learned from past presidential campaigns, it's that most supposed game-changers like this quickly fade from the memory of the political class, having never been noticed by most Americans in the first place."" When dealing with scandal, Hillary Clinton and her husband have avoided taking any rash action, ignoring whispers about resignation or discussions about major apologies. Instead they strike back against their opponents and wait out the news cycle until the frenzy dies down. People should not expect Clinton to do anything drastic in the near future. Her first move, via Twitter, was to announce in straightforward fashion that she has asked the State Department to review and release some of the email as soon as possible. While some Democrats are champing at the bit to use this opportunity to push other members of their party (Elizabeth Warren!) into the political fray, Clinton is not going to give them any space to do this. She will wait until reporters and Congress move in a different direction. Rally the party base: If there is one thing that the Clintons understand, it is that their party is desperate for a good fight. After years of dealing with congressional Republicans and the hardball tactics of conservative activists, the Clintons appreciate that members of their party are searching for leaders who will take on their opponents. Democrats are tired of elected officials who roll over too easily when attacked by Republicans. This has been one of the major complaints from Democrats about Obama. Even when many Democrats were furious with the White House following the Monica Lewinsky revelation, the Clintons appealed to partisan instincts and rallied the troops to fight for them as a way to push back against the GOP. By 1998, they had transformed the issue from being about Clinton and perjury to a struggle to protect the Democratic Party. Clinton will do this again. Democrats are feeling particularly vulnerable ever since former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush entered the race, bringing star power to a GOP campaign that seemed filled with lightweights and flawed candidates. Given that Democrats feel the stakes are enormously high to keep control of the White House so that the next president can protect Obama's programs from Republican attack, Clinton will appeal to that instinct to carry her through. Will it work? That remains to be seen. It will depend on the scale and scope of the upcoming revelations and what her opponents decide to do with the material. But the Clinton playbook is pretty clear and road-tested. If Clinton's critics and opponents expect her to just roll over, they really haven't been studying their history.","Zelizer: The former secretary of state has decades of experience in managing controversy .

"(CNN)Swedish prosecutors have asked Julian Assange's legal representatives whether the WikiLeaks founder would consent to be interviewed in London and have his DNA taken via a swab. Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Swedish prosecutors have previously balked at coming to Britain to question Assange. However, a number of the crimes Julian Assange is suspected of will be subject to a statute of limitation in August 2015, according to a statement from Marianne Ny, the director of public prosecutions. ""If Assange gives his consent, the prosecutor will promptly submit a request for legal assistance to the British authorities to further continue the investigation,"" the statement said. A request will also be made to the Ecuadorian authorities for permission to ""perform investigative measures"" at its London embassy, the statement said. Ecuador granted Assange political asylum in 2012. Assange's defense lawyer, Per E. Samuelsson, said he called Assange on Friday morning with the news from the prosecution authority -- and that in principle they viewed the request positively. ""I think I woke him up, but he knew I was calling with news about the case since I called so early,"" Samuelsson said. ""He was, of course, very happy that something is finally happening but he is irritated that it has taken such a long time."" This is a step that Assange and his team have been requesting for four years, Samuelsson said. Ny explained the logic behind the Swedish authorities' change of approach in her statement. ""My view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the Ecuadorian embassy in London would lower the quality of the interview, and that he would need to be present in Sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future,"" Ny said. ""This assessment remains unchanged. Now that time is of the essence, I have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward, particularly as there are no other measures on offer without Assange being present in Sweden."" The Australian national has not been charged and denies the claims. He's said he fears Sweden would extradite him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks. Samuelsson said Assange's legal team would travel over to London as soon as possible to discuss Ny's request and that it expects to respond next week. ""The problem is that there are two more countries involved in this request so it might take some time to make all this happen,"" Samuelsson said. Samuelsson also said Friday's development was not a great surprise since Sweden's Supreme Court had last week asked the prosecutor general for an opinion on the case. ""We think that the prosecutor general, who has taken over the case, probably told Prosecutor Ny to interview Assange in London,"" he said. Assange has previously said the arrest warrant should be thrown out because, in part, Swedish authorities declined to interview him at the Ecuadorian Embassy, thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he said should have concluded long ago. London's Metropolitan Police said last month that the cost of the operation to guard the embassy to prevent Assange fleeing had spiraled to more than 10 million pounds ($15.3 million.) overall . CNN's Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report .","Lawyer for Assange says they view the request positively but will have to discuss response .

"(CNN)New Zealand are on course for a first ever World Cup title after a thrilling semifinal victory over South Africa, secured off the penultimate ball of the match. Chasing an adjusted target of 298 in just 43 overs after a rain interrupted the match at Eden Park, Grant Elliott hit a six right at the death to confirm victory and send the Auckland crowd into raptures. It is the first time New Zealand has ever reached a World Cup final, and it will play either Australia or India on Sunday. Te pair face each other in Sydney on Thursday. Not the first time in the sport, rain played a part. South Africa were motoring with the bat before a two-hour delay for poor weather. Though its total was escalated by the Duckworth/Lewis method -- used to calculate a revised target in the event of a rain delay -- New Zealand held firm thanks to Elliott. His 84 not out underpinned its innings and it was fitting that he delivered the final blow, smashing Dale Steyn for six off the second last ball to spark jubilant scenes at Eden Park. ""I don't think this win is for myself or the team, but everyone here,"" Elliott said at the post-match presentation. ""The supporters have been amazing. ""I think we timed the pace of the innings to perfection. I wasn't as calm as I looked. When you have 45,000 fans screaming at you every ball... ""It has been an absolute pleasure playing in front of this crowd. We have had a good run. It is the first final we have been in as New Zealand. ""We are a very level team, we will approach it as any other game. Nothing going in my mind when I hit the six. I don't even know where the ball went."" South Africa, who themselves have never reached the final, have been accused of choking in past installments of the one-day competition. But that indictment cannot be leveled at it after one of the most dramatic matches in World Cup history. It had recovered from 114-3 in the 27th over to 216-3 after 38 overs thanks to some fierce hitting from captain AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis, before the rain came. With the game stopped for two hours, it finally reached 281 off its reduced 43 overs, du Plessis top scoring with 82. New Zealand's target was upgraded via Duckworth/Lewis, a calculation that takes into account how many overs were left and how many wickets had been lost, to 298. Kiwi skipper Brendan McCullum got it off to a fast start with a 22-ball half-century but after he was dismissed it wobbled, and needed 139 from 22 overs. But Elliott was the steadying hand, judging his innings perfectly. And though he was dropped in the penultimate over, he struck the telling blow off Steyn to seal victory and inflict a fourth semifinal defeat on South Africa. ""It was a great advertisement for cricket,"" McCullum said at the post-match presentation. ""Everybody involved will remember this for the rest of their lives. ""What a great innings from Grant. He came out of wilderness not long ago. The greatest time of our lives. We have enjoyed the experience. ""I hope the crowds are all dreaming the way we are. Gee it would be nice to win it. We don't mind whom we face in the final. ""They are both quality sides, but we know if we play the way we want to we are a good chance."" Should Australia beat India at the Sydney Cricket Ground, then the joint hosts of the World Cup will meet in the final in Melbourne. ""It was an amazing game of cricket,"" AB de Villiers said. ""Probably the most electric crowd I have ever heard in my life. I guess the best team has come out on top. We gave it our best. No regrets. ""We left it all out there. It is hurting. It is going to take a while to recover. The bigger picture is for the people back home. We play for them. I hope they can still be proud of us.""","New Zealand edge a thriller against South African to reach cricket World Cup final .

"Beijing (CNN)Five years ago, Beijinger Robert Zhao went on a trip to Tibet. What he encountered left him confused but intrigued. A science graduate from China's elite Tsinghua University, he had been taught to mistrust superstition and religion, but in the culture and devotion of the Buddhists he met he found something worth knowing. Now 25, he is considering giving up his job and becoming a monk. ""It means I will have to give up everything of the ordinary world,"" he told CNN. While Buddhism has a long history in China, entering via missionaries from India during the Han dynasty, it was repressed during the Maoist era -- many monasteries and temples were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and monks actively punished for believing in ""superstition."" But now, a growing number of Chinese are rediscovering the country's dormant Buddhist traditions. Some, like Zhao, are looking for a spiritual anchor in a competitive,  fast-changing society. Others take comfort in meditation and enjoy volunteering. However, it's not always easy to combine Buddhist beliefs with the demands of modern life. Zhao works as an assistant to the boss of an environmental company. His religion means it's difficult to entertain clients and partners -- a key part of the role. ""Not drinking, smoking or eating meat affects my socializing. So the company has to send someone else to go with me, which creates extra expenses,"" he says. Zhao has not told his family about his desire to become a monk yet, fearing that they might oppose it. Fenggang Yang, the director of the Center on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University, Indiana, says it's difficult to explain exactly why so many young people are turning to Buddhism. Some discover it at university, where Buddhist groups are active and famous monks and lamas give lectures.  Others have devout parents and grandparents. He also says that the Chinese Communist Party policy has ""moved toward treating Buddhism more favorably than other religions."" Christianity has also been growing in popularity in recent decades but church leaders say there has been a crackdown on Christians,  with authorities demolishing churches and removing crosses from skylines. In particular, it's the Tibetan strain of Buddhism, rather than the Chan (also called Zen) tradition once popular in China, that is attracting new converts, particularly students, young professionals and businesspeople, he says. ""It appears that both the chanting and the physical, spiritual practices of Tibetan Buddhism are appealing to some people,"" Yang added. To what extent these new converts are committed to Buddhism as a religion, with its strictures and rituals, is an open question. A former leader of a university Buddhism group, who didn't want to give his name, told CNN he thought its members were more interested in the religion as a lifestyle choice. Activities that his group organized focusing on relaxation and stress relief were always more popular than reading groups and lectures that examined Buddhist scriptures, he added. Yang at Purdue University says that for most people in China, Buddhism is treated more as culture than a religion. They may visit temples or read Buddhist books, but  few people treat it as a religion that requires serious commitment. ""Indeed, people who identify as Buddhists do a lot of non-Buddhist spiritual things, such as believing in feng shui, consulting fortune-tellers, practicing qi gong and sampling books and practices of other religions,"" he says. On a recent weekend, more than four hundred people attended the annual gathering of Beijing Ren Ai Foundation, a Buddhist charitable organization, at Longquan Monastery on the mountainous outskirts of the capital. Zhong Ying, the group's 32-year-old deputy secretary general, said the group's most active volunteers were between 20 and 35 years old. In the past five years their numbers had doubled to 200. For attendee Geng Hui'er, a 26-year-old who works and lives in Beijing, Buddhism was something she rediscovered after returning from studying abroad in England. Growing up, her family had raised her Buddhist although she says she never really ""felt it."" She now regularly attends meditation activities in monasteries or study groups organized by volunteers. Geng says Buddhism has given her a fresh outlook on life and past difficulties. It's also helped her establish a network of people she can talk to and socialize with. ""We sit together, sharing things that have happened in our lives and how we dealt with them, which is more helpful than reading books"", she says. For Zhao, the aspiring monk, Buddhism has been a balm while dealing with poor health, as well as work and relationship problems. ""My life has been tough for years. (Buddhism) keeps me away from the negative thoughts, like a reminder that's always there, which has helped me a lot.""

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Islamic militants with the extremist group Al-Shabaab mounted a bloody attack Thursday on government administration offices in Baidoa, Somalia. Initial reports to police indicate that nine people, including four attackers, were killed after gunmen in military uniforms attacked the house of the former Somali parliament speaker and current president of the newly established southwest regional administration, said Col. Mahad Abdi, a Somali police officer. The attack began when a car bomb detonated at the gate of the state palace in Baidoa city, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of the capital, Mogadishu. Heavy gunfire broke out between Somali troops backed by Ethiopian forces inside the house of the regional president, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. Explosions and gunfire were still going on over an hour after the initial assault, Abdi said. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. A broadcast by the group's official radio station, Andulus, said that Al-Shabaab gunmen had entered the regional president's house and killed seven Ethiopian soldiers. The African Union's special representative for Somalia, Ambassador Maman S. Sidikou, condemned the attack, saying it had targeted troops who have worked to restore peace to Baidoa. ""I am deeply saddened by news of the attack in Baidoa this morning,"" he said in a statement released by AMISOM, the African Union mission to Somalia. Sidikou said he had also received reports of an attempted attack at a Mogadishu hotel Wednesday night. ""These are desperate attempts by Al-Shabaab to seek relevance, following the massive defeats they continue to suffer from the Somali National Army working together with AMISOM troops,"" he said. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, even calling, in a video released last month, for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.

"(CNN)The Iran nuclear negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, reportedly have made substantive progress, inching closer toward a provisional agreement between the P5+1 and Iran. While the talks continued to unfold this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu restated his concern about an agreement with Iran, vowing ""to continue to act against any threat."" If an agreement is reached, the international spotlight will turn to Israel, in anticipation of its possible reaction. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe ""Bogy"" Yaalon stated that a deal is ""a tragedy for the whole world.""  The question is, however, what can Israel really do once a deal is signed? In recent days, notable conservatives in the United States have attacked President Barack Obama's handling of the negotiations with Iran, arguing that a bad deal will force Israel's hand, leaving it with no choice but to attack Iranian targets. But is this a realistic conclusion? Israel's stated ""all options are on the table"" policy toward Iran has been in place for years and is based on the assumption that if a diplomatic solution to the nuclear problem cannot be reached or is not to its liking, Israel can decide to opt for a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Thirty-four years after the successful Israeli bombing of the Osirak nuclear facility in Iraq, military experts have little doubt that the Israeli Air Force today is capable of reaching Iranian airspace and bombing targets above and below ground. Therefore, the question is not one of military capability but more about  domestic political and geopolitical strategy. With an Iran deal in place, the Israeli leadership may face stern objections from the heads of the Israeli defense establishment, which will make it difficult but not impossible to take such a decision. Nevertheless, if it remains keen on pursuing a military option, the Israeli leadership will have to consider the following set of consequences that will likely result from such a decision: . •A successful military strike on Iranian installations may degrade Iran's nuclear program, setting it back several years, but it would not completely eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities.   Iran would likely be able to resume activity in new facilities soon after such an attack, with more international legitimacy to embark on a military nuclear program, in the face of future military challenges to its sovereignty and stability. A deal between the P5+1 (the United States, China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and Germany) and Iran is expected to include a 10-year (or more) ""sunset provision"" that is much longer than the period it will take Iran to get its program back on track in case of an Israeli attack. •A military attack against Iran after a deal is signed would put Israel on a collision course with the P5+ 1, who were negotiating the contours of a deal with Iran, as well as with other members of the international community. Bilateral ties and cooperation with member states of the P5+1 may suffer, as well as intelligence sharing between the relevant intelligence agencies. In addition, countries are likely to seek ways to ""punish"" Israel for its actions, in the form of a U.N. General Assembly or Security Council resolution condemning Israeli behavior, calling for operative measures against the Jewish state. •An Israeli attack would likely lead to the collapse of the international sanctions regime on Iran, which Israel has worked  to consolidate and which has been a very effective mechanism in pressuring Iran. •The understanding between Israel and moderate Arab regimes on the need to prevent a nuclear Iran would not be likely to dissipate in the aftermath of an attack, but Israeli-Arab coordination and cooperation on this issue is bound to suffer. •Finally, an Israeli attack would spark a direct Iranian military reaction against Israel, as well as an indirect reaction against Israel in the region by Iran's proxies Hezbollah (from Southern Lebanon and war-torn Syria) and Hamas (from Gaza and perhaps the West Bank) and against Israeli targets abroad. In the aftermath of a deal with Iran, Israel's response is expected to be harsh.  It will include strong public criticism of the deal, a vow to continue the fight against the agreement in the U.S. Congress and other relevant venues, a call for the international community to continue  the sanctions regime, and a pursuit of coordinated public messaging with moderate Arab regimes on this issue. These Israeli public diplomacy measures will be complemented by continued intelligence monitoring of Iran's activities in the nuclear sphere as well as its involvement in regional conflicts. Opting for a military strike against Iran, however, must take into consideration the consequences of such a decision. In light of all that is at stake, it does not seem like a plausible option at present.","Dan Arbell: Israel's leaders can criticize a potential deal with Iran on its nuclear program .

Famed for being long-lasting, Kenya's roses, carnations and summer flowers are also popular in Russia and the U.S. where last week several growers showcased their blooms at the World Floral Expo in Los Angeles. The event is one of the industry's largest and gathers over 80 exhibitors from across the world, with several Ethiopian growers also representing the African continent alongside Kenya. The country's flower power is attributed to its sunny climate, which enables high-quality blossoms to be grown year-round without the need for expensive-to-run greenhouses. Kenya also has excellent transport links to Europe, and from there, the rest of the world through Nairobi airport, which has a terminal dedicated specially to the transport of flowers and vegetables. This means that delicate floral cargo which is perishable in nature can be shifted from growers to consumers swiftly. More than 500,000 people in the country depend on the trade according to the Kenya Flower Council, with roughly half of the country's 127 flower farms concentrated around Lake Naivasha, around 90 kilometers northwest of Nairobi. ""Naivasha is a big center because it's a freshwater lake and it is not very far from Nairobi, which makes transport easy,"" says John Kihia, technical director of Floralife Africa, a company which provides hydration, transport and storage for the cut-flower industry. ""People have been growing flowers there for a long time so there is a skilled labor force in place,"" he adds. Activists have expressed concerns over the environmental impact that the booming trade could inflict on the lake, but local farmers have been working with the WWF in order to make sure that water levels are not affected: ""It's about putting together a strong business case about why it's good for growers to save water and ways to manage that,"" says Drew McVey, WWF technical adviser who calls the collaboration ""a story of success."" Naivasha Lake's location 1,884 meters above sea level is particularly fertile ground for medium-sized roses which are often found in the floral sections of EU supermarkets, whereas farms in higher altitudes yield bigger blooms popular in Russia: ""It's a consumer preference. In Moscow people will buy a single rose, so if it's bigger it naturally looks more spectacular, whereas in the UK they buy bunches more often,"" says Kihia. Big business . Horticulture has been one of the top foreign exchange earners for Kenya, and the flower industry alone raked in around $600m last year, exporting 124,858 tonnes valued at around $507m in 2013. Nearly two thirds of exports are destined for Holland, where they are resold to florists through auctions which present a safe avenue into the market for less seasoned growers: ""If you sell through an auction and you have a good quality product, people will be competing for your flowers which will give you a better price,"" Kihia says. While Europe remains the biggest destination for Kenyan flowers due to its relative geographic proximity and good transport links, this has left producers vulnerable to turmoil on the continent, such as the recent recession. ""It has had an impact on the sector and we have experienced a slowdown in demand, which slows down business,"" says Jane Ngige, CEO of the Kenyan Flower Council. Kenyan exports also suffered when in October of last year the EU imposed import taxes on cut flowers from the country, but the levy was lifted on Christmas Day allowing Kenyan producers to storm Valentine's Day sales. Jane Ngige says that the industry is now exploring other markets such as Australia, Canada and Japan, and adds that direct flights from Nairobi airport play a crucial role in helping the Kenyan flower business take off globally: ""A direct flight to the destination is key owing to the fact that this is fresh produce and it needs to get to the end user quickly in order to guarantee quality. It also makes it less expensive,"" she says. Kenyan growers are now lending their floral expertise to neighboring Rwanda by partnering with the country's government to create a 35 hectare flower park 60 kilometers from Rwanda's capital Kigali. It's hoped that the park will eventually produce three million stems per year and kick-start Rwanda's floriculture sector, which could pump more than $200 million into the country's economy by 2017.

"(CNN)Vatican City is accustomed to welcoming millions of visitors to its grounds each year, but Thursday a very special tour group got a look inside. Approximately 150 homeless people were divided into three groups and ushered through the Petriano entrance next to St. Peter's Square, according to Vatican paper L'Osservatore Romano. ""The poor, who usually see only the steps outside the colonnade of St. Peter's Square, will also have a chance to enjoy the Vatican's artistic patrimony,"" the paper wrote. The Office of Papal Charities arranged the special visit, which included a visit to the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel. Other stops included the Domus Sanctae Marthae, behind St. Peter's Basilica, through the piazzale della Zecca, the main path of the Gardens and the Cancello di Gregogio.

"London (CNN)Previously secret correspondence between Britain's Prince Charles and government officials is to be made public after a Supreme Court ruling Thursday. The Guardian newspaper had been fighting for the communications to be released since 2005. Charles is next in line to the British throne and as King would constitutionally be required to maintain strict political neutrality. Some commentators say letters to officials suggest he could be a ""meddling king,"" attempting to influence politicians. After the judgment was released Thursday, Guardian Editor-in-Chief Alan Rusbridger said the paper was ""delighted"" about the Supreme Court's decision after what he said was a ""brilliant 10-year campaign by Guardian reporter Rob Evans."" ""The government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to cover up these letters, admitting their publication would 'seriously damage' perceptions of the Prince's political neutrality. Now they must publish them so that the public can make their own judgment,"" Rusbridger said. Max Foster, CNN's royal correspondent, says the letters are part of a broader discussion about the role of the heir to the throne. ""These were private letters, never meant for public consumption, which is why the Prince's office has resisted their release,"" he said. ""But they play into a much bigger debate about the role of monarchy. Should Charles be getting involved in politics at all when, as head of state, he'll be expected to be politically neutral? He's not in that position yet so feels he has some leeway."" Prime Minister David Cameron said the judgment was ""disappointing"" and the government would now look at how to release the letters. ""This is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially. I think most people would agree this is fair enough,"" he said. Cameron suggested the legislation might need revision in light of the decision: ""Our FOI (freedom of information) laws specifically include the option of a governmental veto, which we exercised in this case for a reason. If the legislation does not make Parliament's intentions for the veto clear enough, then we will need to make it clearer."" The Prince's official residence, Clarence House, issued a brief statement about the decision. ""This is a matter for the government. Clarence House is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld."" The anti-monarchy group Republic welcomed the news but warned that 2010 changes to the Freedom of Information Act to remove the public interest clause put future releases at risk. ""The government must now act to end royal secrecy. Any risk to the monarchy must pale against a risk to democracy from having an activist prince acting in secret,"" CEO Graham Smith said. ""We can't have a situation where we don't know what influence Charles is having on government policy."" In a statement issued on the eve of the decision, Smith branded the monarchy one of Britain's ""most secretive institutions."" ""Charles clearly has his own political agenda, yet his name won't be on the ballot in May. So we all need to know what influence he is trying to exert and what impact he is having on policy."" Evans, the Guardian reporter, had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between Charles and various government departments under the UK's Freedom of Information Act and environmental regulations. After the departments and the information commissioner denied his requests, Evans appealed to the Information Tribunal, which referred the matter to the Upper Tribunal. The Guardian reported in 2009 that Charles had written to Treasury, Foreign Office and Education Department ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials. ""The disclosures will fuel growing concern that the prince is continuing to interfere in political matters when many believe he should remain neutral if he wishes to become king,"" the paper said. The Upper Tribunal ruled in 2012 that many of the letters, ""advocacy correspondence,"" should be disclosed, but its decision was vetoed by Britain's attorney general, who issued a certificate overriding it. Explaining his decision, the attorney general said that in that his view, the correspondence was ""undertaken as part of The Prince of Wales' preparation for becoming King"" and contained nothing that outweighed ""strong public interest against disclosure."" The Guardian challenged the veto in court, but three high court judges dismissed it, so Evans appealed to the Supreme Court, which on Thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate.","Letters from Prince Charles to officials must be released after a Supreme Court judgment .

"(CNN)""The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man."" I still remember the first time I read the passage from ""The Jungle Book,"" heart racing beneath my pajamas covered with The Six Million Dollar Man. ""The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs, rockets and torches. Then everybody in the jungle suffers,"" Rudyard Kipling wrote. I probably understood that tiger attacks were fairly rare in Milwaukee, but to my 11-year-old brain, Kipling was dropping wisdom that just might keep me alive on the next expedition into the weedy lot behind Piggly Wiggly. ""The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him."" Reading that passage 35 years later, while rolling through the very forest that inspired the classic, the irony in that line finally clicks. When we hear the woof of a frightened deer and my guide kills the engine, my grown-up heart pounds once again. It is a sign that there may be big cats nearby. ""I wonder who will be the last person to see a tiger in the wild? And are they alive today?"" These are the questions that launched this stop on ""The Wonder List,"" and they led us to a much bigger question about life in the 21st century: Is the planet still big enough for man and man-eater? India is about one-third the size of the continental United States, with four times as many people. That kind of human pressure has changed Kipling's ""Law of the Jungle"" in dramatic ways. According to the animal conservation group Born Free, there are more tigers in cages in Texas than in the forests of India. So I set out to understand how and why. Having covered the poaching of African animals to feed the huge market for Asian medicine, I assumed the demand for tiger-skin rugs in Dubai or tiger-bone wine in Beijing would be the biggest threat to this endangered cat. Can tigers claw their way back from the brink? But it turns out that tiger-human conflict is a much bigger problem. Almost half a billion rural Indians have no plumbing and answer nature's call by squatting in the forest. Most tiger attacks happen when these people are mistaken for prey, and most tiger kills come in the angry hours that follow, as friends and neighbors of the victim seek revenge. And so, a new specialty in conservation is the art of tiger conflict mediation. It is not easy to convince a frightened farmer that the cat that ate his cow is more valuable alive than caged or dead. But these efforts, along with a more pointed anti-poaching campaign, seem to be paying off. The latest tiger census counted 2,226 big cats in India, a 30% increase over the previous count in 2011. If the estimates hold, this would make India the only country in the world with a growing tiger population. But the human population is growing much faster. Maintaining a healthy population of apex predators is just one new challenge on a planet that will welcome a couple billion more people in just the next generation. You'll be surprised by the others as we seek India's magnificent treasures -- both natural and man-made -- on the next episode of ""The Wonder List.""","There are more tigers in cages in Texas than in the wild in India, a conservation group says .

"(CNN)When Indiana Gov. Michael Pence signed his state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), he apparently did not anticipate the resulting uproar.  Many of Indiana's businesses fear that the law could be used to allow store owners to deny service to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. The NCAA has expressed concern about the Final Four, which Indianapolis is hosting this weekend, and other companies have threatened to move their businesses outside of the state. But, when pushed on the issue, Pence insisted that the law is ""not about discrimination"" but instead is ""about protecting the religious liberty of every Hoosier of every faith.""  When asked whether he would allow an amendment to clarify that the law will not preclude anti-discrimination protections, the governor doubled-down, noting that ""we're not going to change this law."" But members of the Indiana legislature beg to differ with the governor, pledging to ""fix"" Indiana's RFRA. And now, the Governor has changed his tune, also calling for a fix to the bill. Can there really be an easy ""fix,"" short of repealing the Act? The answer is, of course, it depends. Under RFRAs like Indiana's, people are not free to disobey any law in tension with their religious convictions.  Instead, RFRAs create a standard to balance a person's religious interests against the governmental policy at stake.  Under Indiana's RFRA, the government must show that its policy interest advances a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means to address the problem at issue. The question would then become whether anti-discrimination laws advance a compelling interest in the least restrictive means.  The answer to that question is easy: yes.  The adoption of such laws have long been viewed as advancing compelling state interests, and the only way to eliminate discrimination is to ban it, so they are the least restrictive means. At present in Indiana, there is no state-level law that protects LGBT persons from discrimination by private parties.  In certain cities and other, local jurisdictions, however, there are ordinances prohibiting such discrimination. Indiana would have two ways to ""fix"" the RFRA problem. The first would be to adopt state-wide nondiscrimination laws that protect LGBT persons.  Such an act would confirm that, as a matter of state policy, protecting the LGBT community is viewed as a compelling state interest.  This would bring Indiana into alignment with Illinois, which has a RFRA, but which also has a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute, ameliorating any concerns about the RFRA being used in discriminatory fashion. Given the wishy-washy answer that Gov. Pence provided when asked whether he thought discrimination against LGBT persons was appropriate, the likelihood of Indiana adopting a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute seems remote at best, eliminating this fix as an option. Another possibility would be to amend the statute to confirm that any federal, state, or local nondiscrimination laws constitute a compelling state interest for the purposes of the RFRA.  Importantly, federal law does not protect LGBT persons from discrimination by private actors, and neither does Indiana state law. But this language would expressly carve out local ordinances from the scope of the RFRA, such as the nondiscrimination ordinance in Indianapolis. In essence, this would preserve much of the law as it existed before the RFRA: absent local nondiscrimination laws, persons are free in Indiana to discriminate against LGBT persons on any basis. This amendment, however, would make clear that the state-level RFRA cannot be used to trump local city ordinances that protect the LGBT community. What are the odds of this second fix? Well, that precise amendment was proposed -- and adopted -- in the Georgia legislature as it considered a RFRA comparable to Indiana's.  The result: the bill's sponsors tabled it, noting that the exception for local nondiscrimination laws would ""gut"" the bill. That reaction shines a light on the true motivations for these RFRAs.  If these acts aren't about discrimination, then why would ensuring nondiscrimination protections ""gut"" the bill? It's because these bills truly are about permitting discrimination against the LGBT community.  All of the hand-waving by Gov. Pence and others cannot distract from the truth: RFRAs are the first responses to LGBT advances.","Tim Holbrook: Indiana's law allows discrimination against the LGBT community .

"(CNN)Jordan Spieth has Rory McIlroy and the world No.1 spot firmly in his sights after winning the Valspar Championship on Sunday. Spieth won a three-way play-off with a 28-foot birdie on the third extra hole to become only the fourth player since 1940 to win twice on the PGA Tour before turning 22. It is a feat that not even McIlroy mastered with Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Robert Gamez the only players to have achieved that particular accolade in the past 75 years. But it is the Northern Irishman that is within Spieth's focus heading towards Augusta. ""I like studying the game, being a historian of the game,"" Spieth told the PGA Tour website. ""It's really cool to have my name go alongside those. ""But right now currently what I'm really focused on is Rory McIlroy and the No.1 in the world. That's who everyone is trying to chase. ""That's our ultimate goal to eventually be the best in the world and this is a great, great stepping stone. But going into the four majors of the year, to have closed one out in this kind of fashion is going to give me a lot of confidence."" Spieth has long been heralded as the next big thing in golf -- shining in the amateur ranks with two U.S. junior titles and leading last year's Masters after the third round before eventually finishing tied for second, three shots behind Bubba Watson. On Sunday, he held his nerve at the Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, Florida, to hold on for the victory. He first rescued par on the 16th with a 60-foot bunker shot and needed a 32-foot putt to ensure his place in the playoff, which he duly holed. It was a putt of similar length that ensured a second Tour win to add to his John Deere Classic success in July 2013, which he also won courtesy of a playoff making him the youngest PGA Tour winner for 82 years at the time.","Jordan Spieth only the fourth player since 1940 to seal two PGA Tour wins under age of 22 .

"(CNN)Britain's Lewis Hamilton made the perfect start to his world title defense by winning the opening race of the F1 season in Australia Sunday to lead a Mercedes one-two in Melbourne. Polesitter Hamilton controlled the race on the Albert Park street circuit to win from teammate Nico Rosberg of Germany. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel took the final podium position for his new team Ferrari, holding off Felipe Massa in the Willams. It was the 34th career victory for two-time world champion Hamilton and underlined the continued dominance of Mercedes as he and Rosberg pulled well clear of their nearest challengers. Hamilton, who was forced to retire early in last year's Australian Grand Prix, was taking the checkered flag in Melbourne for the first time since 2008, when he claimed his first world title for McLaren. It had all gone completely to plan until coming face to face on the victory podium with movie legend Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was conducting the post-race interviews. ""Hey man, WOW,"" said a surprised Hamilton. ""It is an incredibly feeling to continue winning but also great to be up here with you."" Then taking his courage in his hands, Hamilton cheekily told 'The Terminator' ""I thought you were taller!"" After getting the thoughts of Rosberg and Vettel, who said it was a ""very big honor"" to gain his first points for Ferrari, Schwarzenegger turned his attention back to Hamilton. The pair signed off by saying together: ""I'll be back,"" the catchphrase from Schwarzenegger's iconic 1984 film. With Hamilton winning his seventh race from eight starts, his F1 rivals would probably rather he stayed away and Rosberg admitted ""he was driving to his max"" but could not match the pace of his teammate. Only 11 cars finished the race from a depleted grid of 15 cars, with Valtteri Bottas unable to start for Williams due to a back injury. Pastor Maldonado crashed out on the first lap as the safety car was deployed, while his teammate Romain Grosjean retired early in the 58-lap race to complete a miserable afternoon for Lotus. Britain's Jenson Button in an uncompetitive McLaren was the only driver to finish without a point in 11th place. His regular teammate Fernando Alonso sat out the race after his nasty crash in pre-season testing in Barcelona, while stand-in Kevin Magnussen retired after the warm-up lap. Kimi Raikkonen looked set to underline Ferrari's improvement when running in fifth place, but had to retire the car, with TV replays indicating his left rear tire was not fitted properly after a pit stop. It left the way clear for rookie Felipe Nasr of Brazil to claim an unexpected fifth place for Sauber, which went through the 2014 season without claiming a single point, and also took eighth spot with Marcus Ericsson. Home hopes rested with Daniel Ricciardo, third in last year's title race, but he looked off the pace in the Red Bull in sixth place. Force India pair Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez finished seventh and 10th, with Carlos Sainz Jr. impressing on his F1 debut for Toro Rosso in ninth. Dutch teenager Max Verstappen made F1 history by becoming the youngest driver to compete in an F1 race at 17 years and 166 days, but his hopes were dashed when forced to retire in his Toro Rosso on the 34th lap.","Lewis Hamilton wins opening race of 2015 F1 season in Australia .

"(CNN)Michael Douglas' son Dylan had a run-in with anti-Semitism -- and the actor wants to do something about it. In an opinion column for the Los Angeles Times, the producer and ""Wall Street"" Oscar winner described an incident last summer in an unidentified country in ""southern Europe."" The older of his two children with actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, 14-year-old Dylan, came to his father in tears. ""A man at the pool had started hurling insults at him,"" Douglas writes. It wasn't because of anything Dylan did, he continued: ""Suddenly I had an awful realization of what might have caused the man's outrage: Dylan was wearing a Star of David."" Douglas went to talk to the man -- ""it was not a pleasant discussion,"" he writes -- and the incident has stayed in his mind. The 70-year-old actor, who was raised by a Jewish father, Kirk Douglas, and a non-Jewish mother, said he didn't identify as Jewish while growing up but noticed anti-Semitic remarks others made. ""With little knowledge of what it meant to be a Jew, I found myself passionately defending the Jewish people. Now, half a century later, I have to defend my son,"" he writes. ""Anti-Semitism, I've seen, is like a disease that goes dormant, flaring up with the next political trigger."" Douglas, who is also a United Nations messenger of peace, observes that anti-Semitism has been on the rise due to a number of factors, including income inequality, religious extremism and hatred of Israel. ""Some find Jews to be a convenient scapegoat rather than looking at the real source of their problems,"" he says. He praises leaders such as Pope Francis, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York for their efforts at reconciliation and community-building. But it isn't enough, he adds. ""All of us"" must fight anti-Semitism, he says. ""If we confront anti-Semitism whenever we see it, if we combat it individually and as a society, and use whatever platform we have to denounce it, we can stop the spread of this madness,"" he writes. ""My son is strong. He is fortunate to live in a country where anti-Semitism is rare. But now he too has learned of the dangers that he as a Jew must face. It's a lesson that I wish I didn't have to teach him, a lesson I hope he will never have to teach his children.""

"London (CNN)It might sound like a really old wives' tale, but a thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon potion for eye infections may hold the key to wiping out the modern-day superbug MRSA, according to new research. The 10th-century ""eyesalve"" remedy was discovered at the British Library in a leather-bound volume of Bald's Leechbook, widely considered to be one of the earliest known medical textbooks. Christina Lee, an expert on Anglo-Saxon society from the School of English at the University of Nottingham, translated the ancient manuscript despite some ambiguities in the text. ""We chose this recipe in Bald's Leechbook because it contains ingredients such as garlic that are currently investigated by other researchers on their potential antibiotic effectiveness,"" Lee said in a video posted on the university's website. ""And so we looked at a recipe that is fairly straightforward. It's also a recipe where we are told it's the 'best of leechdoms' -- how could you not test that? So we were curious."" Lee enlisted the help of the university's microbiologists to see if the remedy actually worked. The recipe calls for two species of Allium (garlic and onion or leek), wine and oxgall (bile from a cow's stomach) to be brewed in a brass vessel. ""We recreated the recipe as faithfully as we could. The Bald gives very precise instructions for the ratio of different ingredients and for the way they should be combined before use, so we tried to follow that as closely as possible,"" said microbiologist Freya Harrison, who led the work in the lab at the School of Life Sciences. The book included an instruction for the recipe to be left to stand for nine days before being strained through a cloth. Efforts to replicate the recipe exactly included finding wine from a vineyard known to have existed in the ninth century, according to Steve Diggle, an associate professor of sociomicrobiology, who also worked on the project. The researchers then tested their recipe on cultures of MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments. The scientists weren't holding out much hope that it would work -- but they were astonished by the lab results. ""What we found was very interesting -- we found that Bald's eyesalve is incredibly potent as an anti-Staphylococcal antibiotic in this context,"" Harrison said. ""We were going from a mature, established population of a few billion cells, all stuck together in this highly protected biofilm coat, to really just a few thousand cells left alive. This is a massive, massive killing ability."" Diggle said the team also asked collaborators in the U.S. to test the recipe using an ""in vivo"" wound model -- meaning it's in a live organism -- ""and basically the big surprise was that it seems to be more effective than conventional antibiotic treatment."" The scientists were worried they wouldn't be able to repeat the feat. But three more batches, made from scratch each time, have yielded the same results, Harrison said, and the salve appears to retain its potency for a long time after being stored in bottles in the refrigerator. The team says it now has good, replicated data showing that the medicine kills up to 90% of MRSA bacteria in ""in vivo"" wound biopsies from mice. Harrison says the researchers are still not completely sure how it works, but they have a few ideas -- namely, that there might be several active components in the mixture that work to attack the bacterial cells on different fronts, making it very hard for them to resist; or that by combining the ingredients and leaving them to steep in alcohol, a new, more potent bacteria-fighting molecule is created in the process. ""I still can't quite believe how well this 1,000-year-old antibiotic actually seems to be working,"" Harrison said. ""When we got the first results we were just utterly dumbfounded. We did not see this coming at all."" She added: ""Obviously you can never say with utter certainty that because it works in the lab it's going to work as an antibiotic, but the potential of this to take on to the next stage and say, 'yeah, really does it work as an antibiotic' is just beyond my wildest dreams, to be honest."" Lee, who translated the text from Old English, believes the discovery could change people's views of the medieval period as the ""Dark Ages."" ""The Middle Ages are often seen as the 'Dark Ages' -- we use the term 'medieval' these days ... as pejorative -- and I just wanted to do something that explains to me how people in the Middle Ages looked at science,"" she said.","Researchers say a medieval remedy made of garlic, onion, wine, bile may be able to defeat MRSA superbug .

"Jerusalem (CNN)Within 48 hours of his election night victory, Benjamin Netanyahu rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no Palestinian state if he were Prime Minister, but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations: the United States and the Palestinians. In an interview with NBC, Netanyahu said, ""I haven't changed my policy, I never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality, Abu Mazen (nickhame of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas) the Palestinian leader refuses to recognize the Jewish state, and he's made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of Israel. And every territory vacated these days in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace. I don't want a one-state solution, I want a sustainable two-state solution."" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat says he believes the pre-election statement that Netanyahu will not allow a two-state solution. He says the Palestinians will keep pursuing statehood through the international arena instead of through negotiations. ""I've negotiated with them for 20 years, and I complained to the international community that there is a big difference between someone being a tough negotiator which is legitimate and someone being a non-negotiator,"" Erekat said. ""All Netanyahu needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust, not only of me but of the international community, he needs to stand tall and tell the Israeli people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we're going to have to recognize the state of Palestine."" Erekat says the Palestinians may try again for recognition once more at the United Nations, a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full UN member state in December. A new United Nations Security Council consisting of different member states may be more favorable to a second Palestinian bid. So where does that leave the United States? The White House said it would ""reassess"" the relationship between the United States and Israel. The broad relationship includes security cooperation, financial assistance, and strong diplomatic ties. Both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the Israeli elections. But the United States has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to block resolutions unfavorable to Israel. Some of that protection could be at stake here as the White House urges both sides back to negotiations. The last peace talks, moderated by Secretary of State John Kerry, broke down in April 2014 after nine months of negotiations. As the talks deteriorated before the scheduled deadline, Israel withdrew from the negotiations when Fatah announced a reconciliation with Hamas, a militant Islamic group, and an intention to form a unity government. In a phone call with Netanyahu, President Barack Obama congratulated Netanyahu and stressed the importance of a two-state solution. But with so much skepticism on both sides, a lasting peace remains a distant goal.","The White House says it would ""reassess"" the relationship between the United States and Israel .

"(CNN)It was nothing if not predictable. Take combustible issues like religion and sexuality, stir in a new law and talk of a boycott, then -- boom! -- the debate on social media explodes. And so it has proved with Indiana's new ""religious freedom"" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. ""Libs SHUTUP,"" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's ""Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)"" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. ""My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,"" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. ""We stand against discrimination."" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL. The word Freedom should only be used when it's inclusive and fair for all. Supporters of the law, however, made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott. ""Before you go and get too self-righteous w/ your #BoycottIndiana,"" a user called Caleb Parke tweeted, ""@GovPenceIN is protecting #religiousfreedom for EVERYONE! #EqualRights.""","Social media supporters of Indiana's ""religious freedom"" bill say it protects their right to hold their own beliefs.

"(CNN)From an iconic marble statue of a heavily pregnant disabled artist to the more recent giant blue cockerel, London's Fourth Plinth art project has always provided a controversial modern twist to the traditional landmarks around London's Trafalgar Square. The latest offering, ""Gift Horse,"" which took up residence in the Square's northwest corner Thursday, looks set to continue the tradition with a work that explores the link between power, money and history, according to organizers. Unveiled by London's Mayor Boris Johnson, the sculpture created by German-born conceptual artist Hans Haacke portrays a skeletal riderless horse with an ribbon-shaped electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from London's Stock Exchange. ""'Gift Horse' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and I hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth,"" Johnson said. The 13-feet high bronze skeleton is a ""wry comment,"" organizers say, on the equestrian statue of King William IV originally planned, but never realized for the plinth more than 150 years ago. Further nods to the past and the sculpture's location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving ""The Anatomy of a Horse"" by English artist George Stubbs, whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square's north side. One of London's most famous landmarks, Trafalgar Square is popular with tourists. Named after a famed 1805 British naval victory against the French, its centerpiece is a column commemorating Lord Horatio Nelson, who died during the conflict. In a career spanning half-a-century, Haacke has frequently explored the interconnectedness of art, power and money through installations, paintings, photography and written text. Many of Haacke's most famous works have explored systems, be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work ""Condensation Cube"" -- or the social and political as seen in ""MoMA Poll"" (1970), ""A Breed Apart"" (1978) and more recently his ""Der Bevölkerung"" (The People) installed in Germany's Reichstag building in Berlin in 2000. ""It's a very prominent spot,"" said the 78-year-old, reflecting on the ""Gift Horse's"" positioning in Trafalgar Square,  ""It's very beautiful. Everybody sees it."" ""There are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea,"" added Haacke. Around Trafalgar Square there was mixed reaction to the sculpture. ""It definitely doesn't look like a horse's head, does it? Looks more dinosaur-ish to me,"" said a slightly baffled female day-tripper from Wales, while another tourist seemed equally confused. ""My first impression was that it looked like an alien, because you see it and then you think, huh? What is it?"" said Toni, visiting from Switzerland. Local reaction was more positive though. ""I just think it's very witty,"" said Londoner Tony Francis. ""I can see the (George) Stubbs influence. And I love the Stock Exchange (ribbon) scrolling round and the way they merge into each other."" ""Gift Horse"" is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the ""Hahn/Cock,"" created by German artist Katharina Fritsch which was in residence from July 2013 to February this year.","A new sculpture for Trafalgar Square's Fourth Plinth unveiled Thursday .

"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)Talks to reach a deal on a framework agreement on Iran's nuclear program will be extended an extra day, U.S. officials said Tuesday. ""‎We've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until Wednesday. There are several difficult issues still remaining,""‎ State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the talks in Lausanne would continue another day as ""long as the conversations continue to be productive."" Diplomats and negotiators worked late as an initial deadline approached, but more time appeared necessary to reach a framework deal. How long talks will continue was unclear. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius informed the Iranians that he will return to Paris at dawn Wednesday in an apparent effort to force the Iranians' hand, Western diplomatic sources told CNN. Hamid Ba'idinejad from Iran's Foreign Ministry said earlier Tuesday there are no ""artificial"" deadlines and a deal will be reached, when each issue has been resolved. Diplomats told CNN that there has been progress, but gaps remain. For Iran, that means there's a light at the end of the tunnel for crippling sanctions. For the West, it means real hope that it's possible to loosen up on Tehran while still being confident that it won't develop nuclear weapons. The international sanctions relief issue has been resolved, according to Ba'idinejad. ""We have had long discussions on this, but there are issues that are related to sanctions that are still under consideration,""  Ba'idinejad said. He added that is not the only issue that needs to be worked out. The thing is, nuclear physics is complicated. So are the international dynamics anytime you're talking about Iran and the West, with mutual distrust and contempt a shared sentiment for years. That's why it's taken so long to even get to this point, and why what's happening in Lausanne matters. Before you can iron out nitty-gritty technical details in a permanent, comprehensive pact  -- which carries the more important deadline of June 30 -- you have to agree on what you're going to talk about. What happens if Wednesday passes and there's no framework agreement? In the short term, it appears, not much. Iran's power rises, with or without deal . The real deadline isn't for three months, after all. As for the March 31 date, there's nothing to stop the parties from continuing to talk -- though an Iranian official told state-run Press TV that no one had raised the idea of an extension as of late Monday. ""All emphasize that the chance should not be missed, and they are all doing their best,"" Ba'idinejad said. So far, there's been a lot of meetings, with occasional smiles for cameras followed by foreign ministers talking behind closed doors. After working through the previous night, representatives from the key players -- most of them foreign ministers -- met all day Tuesday to try to resolve differences in what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described as ""the final stage"" of ""these marathon-like negotiations."" The parties are either on the verge of a milestone agreement or still separated on some crucial points, depending on who you listen to. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is among the optimists. Russia has been closer than most to Iran even as it's gone along with sanctions. ""Prospects for this round of talks are not bad, I would even say good,"" Lavrov said before heading to Switzerland for the final round of negotiations, according to state-run Sputnik news agency. ""The chances are high."" But in comments Monday to CNN, a more cautious Kerry conceded there was ""a little more light there today, but there are still some tricky issues."" ""There still remain some difficult issues,"" the top U.S. diplomat said. ""We are working very hard to work those through ... with a view to get something done."" 21 questions on Iranian nuclear talks . Iran has been under intense international pressure and has faced crippling sanctions over its nuclear program for years. The sides began moving away from stalemate with Iranians' 2013 election of President Hassan Rouhani, who has insisted that Iran wants a peaceful nuclear energy program but not weapons. Viewed as a moderate -- especially compared with other powerful figures in Iran, including the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- Rouhani campaigned on a platform that he'd work to help Iran's economy by reducing its rifts with the outside world. His government has had some success easing those tensions, spearheading interim agreements that have loosened some sanctions. But a comprehensive and final deal has remained elusive. There's been discussion on what to do with Iran's existing fissile material -- which is important because, as long as it's still around, that will make it easier to produce a nuclear weapon more quickly. Still, U.S. officials suggested Monday the debate over this has been overblown, with Harf calling it one outstanding issue though ""it hasn't, quite honestly, been one of the toughest ones."" More important are three points that have dominated the talks in Lausanne: . • How quickly or slowly Iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15-year agreement. • How quickly the crushing U.N. sanctions will go away. • Whether sanctions will snap back into place if Iran violates the deal. Iran wants them gone for good. Lavrov claims that the U.N. Security Council will lift the sanctions right away, but other international negotiators want to merely suspend them, so they can be reapplied as leverage if Iran does not keep its end of the bargain. Agreement on those points is crucial, a Western diplomat said. ""There cannot be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions,"" the diplomat said. Another point of contention: what to do with the nuclear substances Iran already has. Diplomats had told journalists about a plan for Iran to ship its fissile material to Russia. The idea is that if Tehran doesn't have a nuclear stockpile at its fingertips, it will have a longer ""breakout time"" to make a nuclear weapon should negotiations fall apart. Iran isn't ready to do that, one of its negotiators said Sunday. ""The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program,"" Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said, ""and we do not intend to send them abroad."" But on Monday, U.S. officials said the rumblings in the media about the stockpile issue were overblown. Negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material, and Iran has made the comments many times before, a senior State Department official said, citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports. With or without a deal, a lot can change in the next three months. For one, the devil is in the details -- any one of which could throw everyone back to square one. Then there's the possibility that a deal ironed out in Switzerland is rejected by any of the key players. That's been raised as a possibility in the United States, even though a Washington Post-ABC News Poll conducted in the past few days found that 59% of respondents support a deal in Iran that would restrict its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Earlier this month, 47 Republican senators wrote directly to the Iranian government, reminding it that any deal it reaches with U.S. President Barack Obama might be moot once his term ends in less than two years. One person leading the charge against a possible deal, even though he'll have no direct part in shaping it, is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Reiterating points he made earlier this month to the U.S. Congress, Netanyahu said Tuesday ""the greatest threat to our security and safety and our future is Iranians' attempt to become nuclear."" ""And the agreement that is being formed in Lausanne,"" the Israeli leader said, ""is paving the road to that result."" CNN's Elise Labott reported from Lausanne, and Steve Almasy and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. Jethro Mullen wrote and reported from Hong Kong.

"(CNN)The BBC's director-general, Tony Hall, has allegedly received death threats days after ""Top Gear"" host Jeremy Clarkson was dropped. ""Police in Westminster are investigating an allegation of threats to kill,"" the Metropolitan Police confirmed to CNN in a statement. The allegation was reported to the police on Wednesday. ""The threat was made by email,"" the police added. ""The content of the message suggests (it was sent) from outside the UK."" The alleged threats come shortly after Hall took the decision to dismiss popular presenter Clarkson from ""Top Gear,"" one of the most-watched television shows in the world. ""Top Gear"" was suspended March 10 after an apparent altercation between the motor show host and producer Oisin Tymon on March 4. At the time, the BBC issued a statement saying that there had been a ""fracas"" between the host and a BBC producer. More than 1 million fans of Clarkson and ""Top Gear"" signed a petition to reinstate the host. The document was delivered to the BBC's headquarters by a fan dressed as the ""Stig"" -- the incognito racing car test-driver who appeared regularly on the show -- driving an armored tank. On Wednesday, the British broadcaster announced that it would not be renewing Clarkson's contract as host of ""Top Gear"" after he allegedly busted his producer's lip and hurled verbal abuse at him. Hall issued a statement online following the decision. ""It is with great regret that I have told Jeremy Clarkson today that the BBC will not be renewing his contract,"" he announced. ""It is not a decision I have taken lightly. I have done so only after a very careful consideration of the facts and after personally meeting both Jeremy and Oisin Tymon."" Placing emphasis on Clarkson's legacy, Hall added that the BBC will be looking into a new host for ""Top Gear"" in 2016. ""This will be a big challenge and there is no point in pretending otherwise,"" he said. Inquiries are ongoing to establish where the threat came from, the police said.

"(CNN)I was deeply moved watching Julianne Moore win the Oscar for ""Still Alice,"" a movie I was proud and privileged to be an executive producer on. Julianne gives a harrowing performance as a brilliant 50-year-old college professor who loses her brain and herself to early-onset Alzheimer's disease. This is a huge moment for Julianne -- and a huge moment for all of us who have been trying to focus public attention on this staggering disease. Witnessing Alzheimer's progress on the big screen is as terrifying as it is in real life. I know, because I'm a child of Alzheimer's. The mind of my father, Sargent Shriver, had always been a finely tuned instrument that left people in awe and inspired. But my family and I watched Alzheimer's erase that brain -- slowly, inexorably, completely. It was terrifying, too, because back then, the disease was surrounded by shame and silence. Alzheimer's still carries a stigma of the unknown -- even though today more than 5 million Americans have it. That's right. Every 67 seconds, another one of us develops Alzheimer's. Women in their 60s are about twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's as breast cancer. With 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day, there will be 13.5 million of us with Alzheimer's by 2050. And many people don't understand that Alzheimer's isn't a natural part of aging. Alzheimer's is a disease that kills. The truth is, we're right in the middle of an epidemic, but we as a nation are in denial. An Oscar for ""Still Alice"" is shining the brightest light yet on Alzheimer's, but light isn't enough anymore. Attention isn't enough. It's time to get serious. Alzheimer's is exerting a powerful impact on American families -- on our health, our finances, and our futures. And women are disproportionately affected. Why women? Back in 2010, when we published ""The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Takes on Alzheimer's,"" we reported that women were more than half the individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's and nearly two-thirds of the unpaid caregivers of those who had it. Now those numbers are far worse. Today nearly two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's are women -- that's more than 3.2 million women. And more than 60% of caregivers for people with Alzheimer's and dementia are women, with many having to reduce their own workload or even drop out of the workforce altogether to care for loved ones. Opinion: Why 'Still Alice' is about you . Women are the epicenter of this crisis, which is why I believe they also have to be the solution. So, in partnership with the Alzheimer's Association and so many inspiring women already working on the front lines to fight this disease, we have launched the Wipe Out Alzheimer's Challenge, a multipronged campaign powered by women's brains. Our mission is to enlist women of all ages to get educated, engaged and empowered to instigate change.   Women around the country will go out and raise the alarm, raise awareness, raise the stakes and raise millions of dollars to fund serious research into women's brains. And there's so much research to do and so many questions to answer. Why is the incidence of Alzheimer's higher for women? Nobody knows. And why is it that women in their 60s are so much more likely to get Alzheimer's than breast cancer? Nobody knows. What's the exact role of estrogen? We don't know. Is there an Alzheimer's connection with depression or with diabetes? What about genetics? What can be done during the 20 or so years when the disease develops, before a woman even becomes symptomatic? What's the impact of diet, stress level, exercise, sleep and cardiovascular condition? It's time to find out. We have to fund this research, because for some reason it's not a priority for the government. In 2015, Washington will spend an estimated $6 billion on cancer research and $3 billion on HIV/AIDS research, but only $586 million on Alzheimer's. Yet, as the Alzheimer's Association tells us, ""the costs to all payers for the care of people living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias will total an estimated $226 billion, with Medicare and Medicaid paying 68 percent of the costs."" I don't get it, but I'm not going to wait anymore. So Wipe Out Alzheimer's is stepping in. We're asking women to put together their own ""brain trusts"" in their communities -- groups that will go out and do some muscular fund-raising. But equally important, these brain trusts will gather to discuss and disseminate information about what the disease is and isn't. What are the warning signs we should look for in ourselves and our parents? What's the difference between normal forgetfulness, dementia and Alzheimer's disease? Can brain games or meditation slow cognitive decline? Do dietary supplements help? Local brain trust groups will also learn about the devastatingly high cost of Alzheimer's -- how neither Medicare nor the Affordable Care Act covers long-term care, and the cost of a semiprivate nursing home room averages more than $80,000 a year. They'll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have Alzheimer's. They will be politically engaged and encourage political candidates who support increased funding for Alzheimer's research. They'll push their own doctors to get better-educated about cognitive health. It's time for the narrative around Alzheimer's to change. I remember when an HIV/AIDS diagnosis was a death sentence. I remember when cancer was a dirty word, and the prognosis was always grim. But AIDS and cancer activists are helping to take these diseases from terrifying to treatable, from hopeless to hopeful. We want to do the same with Alzheimer's. We want to understand it, prevent it, treat it and beat it.  Wipe Out Alzheimer's is creating a global community of women activists, agitators and agents of change to do just that. We used to think that the mysterious condition called Alzheimer's disease happened only to folks in their 80s and 90s. ""Still Alice"" shows us that's just not true. The race for the Oscar may be over, but the race to wipe out Alzheimer's is on.","Maria Shriver's father was stricken by Alzheimer's, a growing scourge in U.S.

"(CNN)A Canadian tourist was killed after a small inflatable tour boat collided with a whale off the coast of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, authorities said Thursday. The victim was identified as Jennifer Karren, 35, according to the Baja California Sur Prosecutor General's Office. Karren is a Canadian from Calgary, Alberta, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Two other people aboard the Cabo Adventures' vessel were injured in the incident that happened Wednesday a quarter-mile from the Bay of Santa Maria, the Mexican Federal Attorney General's Office for the Protection of the Environment said. That federal agency is investigating the incident, it said. The inflatable boat, called the Cabo Adventure 9 and designed for recreational diving, was carrying nine people and was returning from a snorkel tour when a side of the craft collided with the whale, authorities said. The skipper, José Salazar Tendis, tried to avoid the whale, officials said. Salazar couldn't be immediately reached for comment. Karren fell in the water, and a tour guide and another passenger jumped in and brought her back on the boat, the federal agency said. The vessel captain immediately informed naval rescue officials, and the boat returned to shore as first aid and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation were performed on Karren, the federal agency said. A tourist aboard the watercraft who was also a nurse performed CPR, authorities said. The Canadian woman was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to the Baja California Sur Prosecutor General's Office. The tour company's general director, Felipe Diez-Canedo, released a statement through Mexican authorities that expressed regret that one of its guests died, despite receiving first aid and being transported to the hospital.

"(CNN)A court in Ivory Coast has sentenced former first lady Simone Gbagbo to 20 years in prison, the official AIP news agency said. Gbagbo was convicted Monday for her role in carrying out crimes against humanity following post-election violence in 2010 which left more than 3,000 people dead. Her husband, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is in the custody of the Hague-based International Criminal Court awaiting trial over similar charges. The charges stem from the aftermath of Gbagbo's husband's election defeat in 2010. Laurent Gbagbo, then the incumbent president, refused to step down after Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the election. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides, leaving thousands dead. In 2012, the ICC issued a warrant against her, alleging that as a member of the president's inner circle, his wife was an ""indirect co-perpetrator."" She attended meetings where plans were discussed and carried out to persecute Ouattara supporters, according to the warrant. Her husband surrendered to the ICC in December of that year, and is currently awaiting trial at The Hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths. Both have denied the charges. But Ivory Coast refused to transfer Simone Gbago, saying it would try her in a domestic court instead. On Monday, it did.

"(CNN)With a little bit of help from Donald Trump, Rory McIlroy was re-united with the golf club he famously threw into the lake at Doral -- but probably wished the golf-loving tycoon had not bothered. Never one to miss a media opportunity, Trump, the owner of the Blue Monster course in Florida, got a scuba diver to retrieve the 3-iron club which world No. 1 McIlroy had thought he had seen the last of during Friday's second round at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. The 68-year-old American entrepreneur presented it to McIlroy before his final round Sunday, telling him that it was unlucky to continue playing with 13 clubs as against the usual 14 allowed under golf's rules. ""He's never one to miss an opportunity,"" McIlroy told the official PGA Tour website after his round. ""It was fine. It was good fun."" Not that opportunity knocked for McIlroy when he chose the 3-iron to play his third shot to the 18th and final hole of the tournament and promptly found the water again. The Northern Irishman feigned to repeat his earlier antics, before placing it back in the bag. His mistake led to a double bogey six and left him tied for ninth at one-under-par, eight shots behind winner Dustin Johnson. McIlroy had promised to return the club to Trump after the round and was as good as his word. ""We're thinking about auctioning it for charity or doing a trophy case for Doral, putting it on a beautiful mount,"" Trump said. Johnson is looking set to be one of McIlroy's main rivals in the first major of the season, the U.S. Masters at Augusta, next month and his victory completed a triumphant comeback to the PGA Tour. The 30-year-old American took a six-month break from the Tour last July to cope with ""personal problems"" and returned earlier this year. Johnson finished with a three-under 69 in testing conditions to leave him one ahead of long-time leader JB Holmes and two clear of Bubba Watson, the reigning Masters champion. Johnson celebrated on the 18th with his fiancee Paulina Gretzky, the daughter of ice hockey legend Wayne, and their newly-born son.","Rory McIlroy re-united with the 3-iron he threw into lake at Doral .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)With partial results reported in the Nigerian presidential election, it appears opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari is leading incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan. Reuters, which has collated results from three-quarters of Nigeria's states as they're broadcast live on state TV, reported that Buhari has so far obtained 11.5 million votes, Jonathan 9.5 million. Electoral officers from each of the 36 states are taking turns declaring results from their respective states at the Independent National Electoral Commission. The vote count was stopped Monday night and will resume at 10 a.m. Tuesday (5 a.m. ET), according to a tweet from Attahiru Jega, the chairman of the electoral commission. Jega will be the one to announce final results. Violent protests after Nigeria's presidential elections Saturday sparked calls for calm from the two main candidates and a warning by the United States and Britain against political interference. Protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state on Sunday as they marched to protest the elections, amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation. Heavy rain eventually forced the protesters to leave, but there are fears it will take more than rain to stop further protests and violence. More than 800 people were killed in post-election violence across Nigeria's north in 2011 after charges that those elections were illegitimate. Now Nigeria has just held what are thought to be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule. The two main candidates are incumbent Jonathan of  the Peoples Democratic Party and retired Buhari of All Progressives Congress. Jonathan and  Buhari last week issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to ""free, fair and credible elections"" after their signing of  the Abuja Accord in January. After the protests in Rivers, Buhari's All Progressives Congress demanded the elections there be canceled. ""There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,"" party spokesman Lai Mohammed said. But the Peoples Democratic Party disputed the accusation, saying the election was ""credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan."" ""We are concerned by what seems to be happening,"" said Jega, the election chairman, about events in Rivers. Voting ended after problems with ballot papers and digital voting cards saw it extended to Sunday in some areas. Read more: Nigerian election extended one day . Britain and the United States entered the fray Monday with their top diplomats issuing a statement welcoming a ""largely peaceful vote"" but warning any political interference would contravene Jonathan and Buhari's peace pact. ""So far, we have seen no evidence of systemic manipulation of the process. But there are disturbing indications that the collation process -- where the votes are finally counted -- may be subject to deliberate political interference. This would contravene the letter and spirit of the Abuja Accord, to which both major parties committed themselves,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. Responding to their joint statement, electoral commission spokesman Kayode Idowu said: ""For all that I know there is no sign of political interference in the collation procedure."" Idowu said the collation procedure ""cannot be subject to interference as long as our representative is present."" The fear is that the results may not be accepted by the loser. If the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party, then the protests in Rivers could spread to northern Nigeria. Both candidates have taken to social media to call for calm. ""I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,"" Jonathan said on his Facebook account. ""Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced,"" said Buhari on Twitter. Nigeria's vote had been scheduled for February 14, but on February 7, Nigeria's election commission announced it would be postponed for six weeks because of security concerns, with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by extremist group Boko Haram. The controversial decision was unpopular among many Nigerians and led to widespread protests. Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram, which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of Sharia law in Nigeria. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed and two more injured in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. In other attacks not believed to be related to voting, suspected Boko Haram militants decapitated 23 people in a raid Saturday night on Buratai village in northeast Nigeria's Borno state, according to residents and Ibrahim Adamu, a local politician in the village. Meanwhile on Monday, Nigeria's police force issued a statement saying police and a ""local vigilante group"" had foiled an attack by unknown gunmen on the town of Tafawa Balewa in northeastern Bauchi state. The assailants had ""stormed Tafawa Balewa town in a convoy of 18 Hilux vehicles and started firing sporadically,"" the statement said. After being forced to retreat and abandon four vehicles equipped with anti-aircraft machine guns, the attackers went to Jitar village, where they killed three ""male vigilante members,"" police said. Security forces had cordoned off the surrounding area, they said. Read more: Democracy was the real winner .

"(CNN)Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton and teammate Nico Rosberg resumed where they left off last season as the 2015 Formula One season kicked off in Melbourne. The Mercedes duo, who took pole position in all but one of last season's qualifying sessions and won 16 of the 19 races, were dominant in first and second practice for Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. Rosberg, who won last year's GP at Albert Park, was fastest around the Melbourne street circuit on Friday, finishing 0.1 second ahead of Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel taking third spot for his new team Ferrari -- the German four-time world champion finished 0.715 seconds off  the pace set by his compatriot. Vettel's Finnish teammate, Kimi Raikkonen was fourth, 1.1 seconds behind the lead with Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Daniel Kvyat, who was making his debut for Red Bull since his switch from Toro Rosso, finishing fifth and sixth respectively. ""It was great to be back in the car at this awesome track,"" Rosberg said, the official Formula One site reported. ""Today we have the evidence that our Silver Arrow is quick again and it was a great start for the team,"" he added. ""It seems again that it's very close between Lewis and me and he is a great driver, so I need to nail the setup every time to come out on top. This year will be a big battle again against him, I'm sure. I'm looking forward to the first weekend of the new season with all the great fans out there."" Hamilton, who was forced to retire from last year's race with engine trouble, was satisfied with his pace. ""It feels great to be back on track and back into a race weekend. In general it's been a good first day,"" Hamilton said. ""Today seemed to confirm that we have pretty good pace. But there are still other quick cars out there and we can't go into tomorrow's sessions not thinking that they will be close."" The opening day's racing was somewhat overshadowed by an ongoing dispute between Sauber and the Swiss team's 2014 reserve driver Giedo van der Garde. The 29-year-old Dutchman recently started legal proceeding against the Swiss team claiming they had reneged on a promise to make him one of the lead drivers for the 2015 season. Van der Garde won the case held in a Swiss court earlier this month, with the decision being upheld by Supreme Court of Victoria in Australia on Tuesday after Sauber had appealed the original ruling. During practice Van der Garde could be seen in the Sauber garage wearing his race overalls, but he did not make an appearance on track as Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr completing both practice sessions. Following the initial court ruling, team principal Monisha Kaltenborn said that changing drivers hours before a Grand Prix could be dangerous. ""What we cannot do is jeopardize the safety of our team, or any other driver on the track, by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers,"" she said, Formula1.com reported. Brazilian Nasr was the highest placed of the two finishing 11th while Swede Marcus Ericsson was 15th. Elsewhere there was also a uncertain start for McLaren who finished way down the pecking order. Jenson Button was 13th, almost four seconds off the pace for the CNN-sponsored team while teammate Kevin Magnussen, who was deputizing for the absent Fernando Alonso, was 16th following second practice. Local favorite Daniel Ricciardo completed just nine laps of practice after his Red Bull suffered engine failure.

"(CNN)Before he was Jihadi John, he was little John -- a young version of the same Mohammed Emwazi who authorities say later became the English-speaking face of ISIS terror. His earlier, innocent image can be seen in video obtained from Britain's Channel 4. It shows a teenage boy in the schoolyard of a West London secondary school. He walks through a sea of fellow students in his zippered sweatshirt over his polo shirt, wearing a backpack and carrying a plastic bottle. At one point, a basketball rolls toward him and he returns it with a deft kick. He looks playful at times as when he skips and lightheartedly pushes two other boys, more serious in others. In other words, he appears to be not much different than any other teenager. But he's not. The boy in the video is Emwazi, his former headmaster at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy told CNN. Who Mohammed Emwazi used to be . Jo Shuter noted that her former student could be shy at times, but overall he was far from a troublemaker and not much out of the ordinary. ""He was bullied a little bit, because he was quiet and reserved,"" Shuter said. ""Generally, he was fine. There (were) no issues with him. There were no problems."" Emwazi became even more focused in his last few years at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, she said. ""He was working hard, he achieved great grades for him, and he went to the university of his choice,"" Shuter told CNN this week, referring to London's Westminster University, from which Emwazi graduated in 2009. Contrast that perception with that of the masked, deep-voiced, British-accented man who months ago was dubbed Jihadi John. There is nothing shy, nothing gentle, nothing playful about him. He starred in grisly ISIS videos depicting the beheading of hostages, punctuating his horrific actions with taunts at the United States. A man who says he is Emwazi's father told the Kuwaiti newspaper al Qabas that ""there is nothing that proves"" the man known as Jihadi John is his son, Mohammed. His Kuwait-based lawyer, Salem Al-Hashash, told CNN that the family plans to sue anyone who makes the connection, calling the father Jassem Emwazi a ""victim of libel."" Yet Western authorities have made just such a link. They say that the Kuwaiti-born Mohammed Emwazi went from being a typical ""boy next door"" type growing up in West London to being one of the most high-profile recruits of ISIS, the Islamist extremist group behind a campaign of terror and conquest in Syria and Iraq. More than a dozen British administrative court documents obtained by CNN indicate that, as far back as 2009, British security services believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa. And in late February, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed reports in British and other media that Emwazi went on to join ISIS and is the man known as Jihadi John.","Video shows a young Mohammed Emwazi in a West London schoolyard .

"(CNN)The murder earlier this month of 27-year-old Farkhunda at the hands of a mob that beat her to death,  burned her body and tossed her into a river shocked Afghanistan, a country in which unspeakable things often hit the headlines. The young woman from Kabul was falsely accused of burning pages in the Holy Quran.  What followed was the horror of mob rule, all captured on video while bystanders looked on. Soon after the incident, the images of her brutal slaying went viral on social media, noted Afghanistan's TOLO News.  And this time, the outrage led Afghans to the streets, with assistance from Facebook and other social media.  These platforms have served both to disseminate the images of her savage beating and murder and as a means for convening those who are mobilizing and organizing to protest her killing. Last week, crowds chanted for days, calling for justice for Farkhunda and ""death for her killers."" And,TOLO News reported, protests were held in different parts of the country, calling for the ""ultimate penalty to the perpetrators."" Indeed, technology and connectedness have played a role in changing the old narratives in Afghanistan, as Farkhunda's killing shows.  Not only was her murder captured and shared online, but some of those men arrested for her killing were found to have confessed via social media posts. And now a country's anguish is shared in those same online and virtual neighborhoods. Some Afghan civil society leaders see the protests that have resulted as yet another sign of an evolving Afghanistan -- a nation whose recently elected leaders, now sharing a unity government, visited Washington, D.C., in an effort to turn the page on the past. ""When we are talking about this case, what is it showing us? First of all, when we are talking about women's rights, we see that we have succeeded; people will not tolerate what they tolerated a decade ago,"" said Nargis Nehan, founder and executive director of Equality for Peace and Democracy, a non-governmental organization created to promote ""a culture of peace, tolerance, transparency and accountability."" She was speaking last Tuesday at a roundtable at Georgetown University's Institute for Women, Peace and Security, organized around the visit by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah.  ""If this was the Afghanistan of a decade before and this would have happened, a small group of Afghan women would have come to the streets to be seeking justice.  Today we have men seeking justice."" Nehan explained that the younger generation, a progressive generation, wants to have a peaceful Afghanistan. ""But at the same time, we have conservatives who have been power-holders for many decades in Afghanistan and they don't want to see that. Change always has a cost and unfortunately in this case we see that a very innocent girl like Farkhunda has paid that."" Nehan and other leaders from Afghanistan could be seen checking Facebook frequently for updates on what was happening on the streets of their capital. What they found was an online community sustaining the strong sense of injustice over Farkhunda's killing that prompted the Afghan President to announce, even before he left for the United States, a fact-finding commission to investigate her murder. Yet some Afghan leaders worried that the brutality of this murder marked another troubling turning point in a country wrestling with a great many transitions -- economic, security and political -- all at once. ""It never (before) happened to women at this level; this was really one of the shocking acts of violence publicly within the capital,"" said Sima Samar, head of the Afghan Human Rights Commission, at the Georgetown panel.  ""It is not far from the palace, less than one kilometer."" ""My personal concern is that if we do not manage the case properly, it might be used against us and against women's rights in the country,"" Samar added. Women have gained a great deal in the roughly 13 years since the Taliban was ousted from power.  Today, 3 million girls attend school. Women serve in the country's security forces -- albeit in very small numbers. They sit in Parliament and work as entrepreneurs, teachers and civil society advocates. Still, violence against women remains rampant and widespread. The practice of child marriage is outlawed but still common in some parts of the country.  And security and the economy are still major challenges, particularly in the more remote provinces of the country untouched by the modernization gripping the nation's more urban centers. Indeed, Samar and other human rights advocates and civil society leaders who have played a role in post-Taliban Afghanistan say they are determined that Farkhunda's death will not be in vain. They say they will continue to fight to keep her case in the spotlight and to see justice served. Their commitment to seeking public justice for a public horror may well be one of the most powerful signals yet of an Afghanistan that is indeed a very different nation than it was only a decade ago.","Murder of 27-year-old woman by mob in Afghanistan set social media ablaze with calls for justice .

"(CNN)Things just got messy with that One Direction breakup. Just when folks were starting to heal from the shock of Zayn Malik's decision to quit the super-successful boy group on Wednesday, a social media dustup has fans all a-Twitter. Zayn Malik leaving One Direction . Music producer Naughty Boy got into a war of words with One Direction's Louis Tomlinson after the producer retweeted a user going by Naughty Boy/Zayn (@naughtyboymus). The tweet was captioned ""The truth"" and contained a video of a little ditty in which an electronic voice croons ""Naughty Boy saved my life"" and mentions ""Zaughty."" Malik is reportedly working with Naughty Boy, and ""Zaughty"" is a combination of their names. Tomlinson -- who is BFFs with Malik -- responded with ""Wow @NaughtyBoyMusic you're so inconsiderate pal, seriously how f***ing old are you? Grow up! #masterofallwisdom."" The producer replied by calling the singer a not-nice word, appearing to have misunderstood the reason behind Tomlinson's ire. The singer corrected him and accused Naughty Boy of trying to get fans worked up. Directioners (as the fans are called) got into it, and the hashtags ""Zaughty"" and ""masterofallwisdom"" started trending. Hours later, Naughty Boy decided to ""let the music do the talking"" and tweeted a link to a song titled ""I Wont Mind,"" which is labeled as a demo from him and Malik. Several fans were not at all happy. After leaving the group, Malik expressed sadness at disappointing fans. ""I feel like I've let the fans down, but I can't do this anymore,"" he told the UK's The Sun.

"(CNN)""A pilot called me last week, concerned he might have Marfan syndome,"" a health care provider told me recently at a meeting.  ""But if I find he has the disease, do I have to report him to the Federal Aviation Administration?  And if so, should I call him first and tell him that?  Would he lose his job?""  She was totally unsure what to do.  Several other providers were present, and none of them knew, either. ""You should definitely call him and tell him,"" a health care lawyer, who was present, said. ""You have to provide full disclosure."" ""But presumably, he knows that you might do so,"" I said.  ""And if you told him, he might not come in for the check-up."" Marfan syndrome affects connective tissue and can lead to sudden tears in the aortic artery, causing sudden death.  Yet if treated, it poses much less risk, though not necessarily zero. The case raised several specific quandaries about what the responsibilities of medical professionals are and should be -- legally or ethically -- in evaluating pilots. The FAA requires that pilots self-report any diagnoses.  But health care professionals have no obligation to notify anyone.  They may know that a pilot has a medical problem that is poorly or not treated and may endanger passengers, but these providers have no obligation to do anything about it. These issues are crucial, given that Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the Germanwings Flight 9525, killing 150 passengers. We still don't know why he committed suicide-murder, but the latest reports indicate he was treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot license. The Germanwings disaster has demonstrated that current standards of medical and psychiatric evaluation are inadequate. The FAA requires only that pilots fill out a psychological questionnaire, asking whether they have had psychological symptoms.  But pilots are not assessed in person by a psychiatrist. Such face-to-face assessments can provide crucial information that self-report forms might miss, partly because pilots might answer inaccurately. Moreover, the FAA requires only that 25% of pilots have a single random drug screen per year.  Pilots may pass drug tests in January and realize that the odds of undergoing subsequent tests that year are nil.  They may hence use more alcohol and recreational drugs. We need to consider changing current policies.  Some alterations are relatively easy.  The FAA should consider requiring far more drug testing -- for all pilots, perhaps every few days. Other possible reforms pose difficult ethical dilemmas, and thus need broad, careful discussion -- e.g., what role providers should play and how much privacy pilots should have. Medical exams and records over time can indicate key problems that a single visit to an FAA doctor may miss.  But requiring more information from pilots diminishes their rights to privacy.  Indeed, such rights impeded investigators from knowing initially the reason Lubitz took a six-month leave and the nature of his medical condition. Physicians have to break patient confidentiality when third parties may be endangered.  The legal precedent for breaking patient confidentiality in this way is the so-called Tarasoff case, in which a young patient told his psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley that he wanted to kill his girlfriend, Tatiana Tarasoff.  The psychologist alerted the campus police, though not the city police or Tarasoff. Unfortunately, the patient then killed Tarasoff.  A court found the psychologist liable. These violations of patient confidentiality make us providers uncomfortable. As a physician, I have had to report patients whom I even suspected might be abusing a child.  I remember one patient who came to the emergency room for psychiatric problems mentioning that she sometimes hit her toddler son with the end of an electrical cord, swinging it until the thick part banged him.  As I asked more, she began to cry. I felt terrible for her and was unsure how dangerous her actions were, but I erred on the side of protecting the child's safety and contacted social services.  When I told her, she nodded, then whispered thank you.  She knew she needed help. Still, in Germany and several states, providers do not have to break patient confidentiality, even when they think the patient may endanger others. Critical dilemmas arise, though, of what threshold should be used concerning which diagnoses and how much their successful treatment should matter.  Some diagnoses may be treatable and thus permissible if doctors examine the pilot more frequently than once a year. Early in the HIV epidemic, for instance, some critics argued that HIV-infected pilots should be barred from flying, since the virus could cause neurological problems.  Fortunately, the FAA decided that evidence of actual neurological deficits -- not infection alone -- should ground these employees. Physicians arguably should consider reporting pilots who have, for instance, epilepsy, manic-depression or diabetes that leads to coma if these conditions are not well controlled with medications. Yet stigma can make pilots fear job loss and thus hide diagnoses and not seek treatment.  The FAA could require that pilots seek treatment in order to fly, but some pilots may still simply cover up problems. Ideally, the clinician should be able to talk with the pilot about the need not to fly and arrange a leave for a few months to improve treatment.  Good employee assistance programs and trust are also needed. In addition, we need research to find how much physician reporting would reduce risks or lead pilots to camouflage problems. Questions still arise of whether even the suspicion of a problem that could impede function should warrant reporting. An individual may seem fine weeks or even days before becoming seriously depressed.  Careful, transparent discussion, involving medical experts, pilots, policymakers and others, to establish  policies with clearly established cutoffs are thus vital. Unfortunately, suicides, for instance, are impossible to predict.  But much can be done to improve the current system.","Robert Klitzman: Physicians should consider reporting pilots who have medical problems such as depression .

"(CNN)A swarm of insects tends to startle us -- chaotic yet organized, fascinating and beautiful. Take it one step further. Instead of bees hovering around a tree, imagine cheese balls. Solo cups in the place of birds, glow sticks as locusts. What seems like a figment of a wild imagination becomes reality in Thomas Jackson's ""Emergent Behavior"" series. Jackson grew up in Rhode Island and worked in publishing in New York for 13 years, ultimately landing his dream gig as an editor with Forbes magazine. But somewhere along the way, he picked up a camera. He found photography ""effortlessly fulfilling"" compared to the frequent challenges of writing. So he dove in, lens first. After a charming series featuring a robot, he struck a cadence in creating ""swarms"" with inanimate objects such as Post-it notes and plastic plates. ""I started creating these whimsical, fantastic scenarios in which the environment is exploiting us,"" Jackson explained. That's what initially catches the eye -- the uncanny. The bizarre gathering in the behavior of insects or birds, made up of something that shouldn't be there. At first, he relied on digital enhancements to polish his illusions. But as the series evolved, he relied less on editing and more on the installations themselves. More than half of Jackson's ""Emergent Behavior"" series is digitally untouched. How Jackson gets a tubful of cheese balls to hang purposefully around the trunk of a tree seems nonsensical. He only hints at the mechanics. It's just ""wires,"" he said, casually, not revealing enough evidence to ruin the magic. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""But if you look close enough, it will reveal all of its secrets."" He spends about a day building the installations, and he usually shoots his photos at dusk. The photo of the pink Solo cups was shot against mountainous terrain in Wyoming. The cups, already at odds with nature, look as though they are a flock of birds flying along the rocks. Jackson seemingly casts a magic spell of manic movement, creating what an Internet commentator calls ""a frat party being sucked into a black hole."" The idea of a swarm -- be it insects or ""thank you"" bags -- fascinates Jackson. They are disconcerting and familiar at once, creating a conundrum that warrants a closer look.

"(CNN)At first Raymond Goldstein thought he'd received a spam email. The message to the Cambridge University physicist was asking for help working out the dynamics of hair, specifically the shape of ponytails. Goldstein thought he'd ""won the Nigerian lottery."" Poised to click delete, he scrolled through the message one more time and discovered it was from global consumer goods giant Unilever. Curiosity piqued, he met with a company representative, and the rest, as they say, is history. Assembling a team of balding physicists, Goldstein set out to tackle the subject, publishing their research in a peer review journal. It detailed the fluid mechanics of hair, drawing on a rich seam of scientific observation stretching back to Da Vinci. They even coined a new term: hairodynamics. Attention from the scientific community soon followed, and within a year they were collecting a Nobel Prize. An Ig Nobel Prize, that is. A satirical cousin to the more esteemed Swedish award, the Ig Nobel seeks to highlight research that first makes you laugh, then makes you think. This year marks their 25th anniversary, so what better time to celebrate the Ig Nobels' contribution to the research community? Every year thousands vie for the awards -- ""always sourced from the cheapest materials"" according to founder Marc Abrahams -- held at Harvard University. The ceremony is bathos at its finest. Winners receive their awards from genuine Nobel laureates, but speeches are curtailed by a screaming girl declaring her boredom. Each year a cast of professional singers and scientists perform a mini-opera. Last year's was set to Mozart and featured a chorus of microbial bacteria. Past recipients include a man who dressed up as a polar bear to scare reindeer and a study of homosexual necrophilia among mallard ducks (commended by Abrahams for ""its high literary quality""). However, not all winners can have such high scientific kudos. The Ig Nobels skewered the U.S. Government in 2012, awarding them the Prize for Literature ""for issuing a report about reports about reports that recommends the preparation of a report about the report about reports about reports."" You can read it here. In 2009 the Math Prize went to Gideon Gono, then head of Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, for printing a Z$100 trillion note (while also printing 1c). Last year the Italian National Institute of Statistics landed the Economics Prize for bringing the country out of recession through the use of prostitutes, drugs and smuggling. (The Italian government ended up setting a precedent in Europe, with the UK soon including the so-called ""black economy"" in its figures -- national GDP jumped by 5% that quarter, equivalent to $15 billion.) As proved by the Ig Nobels, the line between ridiculous and serious research has always been blurred. This is no better reflected than in Dutch-British physicist Andre Geim. In 2000 Geim scooped the Ig Nobel for Biology for using magnets to levitate frogs. Ten years later he went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for his ""groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene."" It is hard to say which is the greater achievement. Abrahams is currently touring the UK touting the Igs, supported by previous winners such as Goldstein and potential candidates like David Dunstan, who found fame by conducting a two year study into the homing properties of garden snails (his modus operandi: throwing them over the garden fence). Soon Abrahams will have to settle down and sift through what he predicts will be about 9,000 entries, before the anniversary ceremony on September 17. Despite his longstanding and much admired pastiche of the Nobels, he is still yet to be invited to Stockholm for the awards proper. Asked if he would attend if offered the opportunity, Abrahams demurs, saying ""he wouldn't want to be a distraction."" And as for what the Nobel Prize could learn from his own mischievous creation? ""Absolutely nothing."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: . Great photos from the world's smallest satellites . So long, transistor: How the 'memristor' could revolutionize electronics .

"(CNN)As an offensive guard for the Baltimore Ravens, John Urschel already has a lot on his plate. He regularly goes head to head with the top defensive players in the NFL and does his best to keep quarterback Joe Flacco out of harm's way. But besides his endeavors on the field, Urschel also keeps up another demanding pursuit that is rarely associated with NFL players: mathematical research. Not content with the respect of the locker room, he also seeks the esteem of top mathematicians around the globe. ""I have a Bachelor's and Master's in mathematics, all with a 4.0, and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals,"" Urschel wrote in a recent article for The Players' Tribune. His latest contribution to the mathematical realm was a paper for the Journal of Computational Mathematics with the impressively esoteric title, ""A Cascadic Multigrid Algorithm for Computing the Fiedler Vector of Graph Laplacians."" Urschel, 23, makes no effort to hide his unusual combination of talents: his official Twitter handle is @MathMeetsFball. As word of his double life spread on social media in recent days, users responded with fascination and admiration. ""You are my goddamn hero (football fan and aspiring complex/functional analyst here),"" tweeted Roy Cardenas, who describes himself as a math Ph.D. student. But Urschel acknowledges that he has faced questions from NFL officials, journalists, fans and fellow mathematicians about why he runs the risk of potential brain injury from playing football when he has ""a bright career ahead of me in mathematics."" After every season, he says in the Players' Tribune article, his mother tries to discourage him from continuing to play football. The Penn State graduate says the reason he keeps going isn't for the money (he drives a used Nissan Versa and lives on less than $25,000 a year) or ""for some social status associated with being an elite athlete."" It's simpler than that. ""I play because I love the game. I love hitting people,"" he writes. ""There's a rush you get when you go out on the field, lay everything on the line and physically dominate the player across from you."" ""This is a feeling I'm (for lack of a better word) addicted to, and I'm hard-pressed to find anywhere else,"" he explains. He shared his thoughts after San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland announced last week that he was retiring from professional football at age 24 because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma. Urschel says he envies Borland but doesn't feel able to quit. ""When I go too long without physical contact I'm not a pleasant person to be around,"" he writes.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)At any moment, Saudi troops could march through Yemen, heating up an already intense conflict that could have ramifications across the Middle East. On Monday, a Saudi-led coalition of nine countries continued airstrikes against Shiite Houthi rebels, who have captured key parts of Yemen and ousted that country's President, and who could spread Iran's influence in the region. And the notion of an Iranian proxy power in Yemen is unacceptable to many -- especially Iran's staunch rival Saudi Arabia. 'Tricky issues' remain in nuclear talks with Iran . ""I think the Saudis ... feel directly, physically threatened by what is happening,"" said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. But if the coalition takes the fight to the ground in Yemen, the consequences could be severe. Houthis are battle-hardened guerrilla fighters and could cross into Saudi Arabia. They've already threatened suicide bomb attacks inside Saudi Arabia. And Yemen, already the home base to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, now teeters on the brink of becoming a failed state and an even more fertile breeding ground for extremism. Here's the latest on the crisis in Yemen and its impact around the world: . Saudi-led airstrikes targeted Houthi military posts and weapons depots in the capital city of Sanaa on Monday, two Houthi commanders told CNN. Yemen's Defense Ministry said a Saudi airstrike hit Al-Mazeraq refugee camp in Haradh, near the Saudi border, killing at least 40 internally displaced people and injuring 250. The group Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) tweeted that one of its teams had received ""30 wounded plus 15 dead bodies following airstrike on IDP camp today."" Previously, airstrikes hit Houthi militant groups, smashed their air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure, a Saudi official has said. Egyptian warships fired on the road that runs from the Yemeni port town of Zinjibar into the key coastal city of Aden but did not fire on Aden directly, according to an official with Yemen's Southern Movement. The road is the eastern approach to Aden and is one of the three main roads into the city. The Egyptian naval barrage is intended to block the Houthi advance on Aden and push those fighters back, the source said. Egyptian warships had deployed to the Bab al-Mandab strait last Friday, according to media reports, intent on protecting that passage that is the only access from the Arabian Sea to Egypt's Suez Canal. The coalition's campaign has been dubbed Operation al-Hazm Storm. The Arabic term ""al-Hazm"" can be translated as ""determinant"" or ""decisive."" Saudi Arabia and Egypt have both talked about the possibility of putting boots on the ground. On Saturday, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in Yemen within days. Saudi leaders have said that if troops do go in, they won't leave until they have degraded the Houthis' ability to fight. The Houthis are apt guerrillas. A fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy. The conflict splits the region along religious lines. Operation Decisive Storm's largely Sunni coalition includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Egypt and Sudan. On Monday, Pakistan's government said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had chaired ""a high-level meeting"" of senior officials to review the situation in the Middle East. ""The meeting concluded that Pakistan remains firmly committed to supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia in accordance with the aspirations of the people of Pakistan,"" it said in a statement. ""It was emphasized that Pakistan stands committed to playing a meaningful role in arresting the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. In the same context, and to facilitate early resolution of the crisis and to promote peace and unity of the Muslim Ummah (community), the Prime Minister would be contacting the leadership of brotherly countries,"" the statement continued. The Shiite Houthis are allied with Iran, a majority Shiite nation. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of boosting the Houthis' weaponry for their offensive. Iran has sharply denounced the Saudi-dominated intervention in Yemen. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of trying to use the conflict in Yemen to ""take over the whole Middle East."" The United States has supported the coalition's efforts. While it is helping the Saudi-led team with logistics and locating targets, the U.S. is not participating in active battle. Dozens have died in the airstrikes, Houthi commanders said. The rebel commanders also said the coalition struck the Houthi-controlled Al Anad air base, which was used as the headquarters for U.S. counterterrorism operations before Houthi rebels took control of it. The Houthis claimed they shot down a Sudanese jet and captured the pilot on Saturday. They distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim. The Yemeni crisis erupted when Shiite Houthi rebels, who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country, began seizing the capital and other parts of the country last fall. Houthis moved into Sanaa in September, sparking battles that killed hundreds of people. Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi fled the capital over a month ago. In January, Houthis surrounded the presidential palace. Hadi resigned and was put under house arrest. He escaped in February and went to the coastal city of Aden, but declared he was still the country's leader. Last week, Hadi went to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend the Arab League summit, where he is rallying support for Operation Decisive Storm. Even from afar, Hadi had strong words for the Houthis: . ""You violated the sovereignty (of Yemen),"" he said, ""and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen."" That Arab League summit produced a notable agreement: the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration, which paves the way for a united Arab force that would be ready to fight insurgents if a member country came under attack. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi actually called for a joint Arab force last month to fight ISIS. But the agreement over the weekend carries extra significance amid the battle against Houthis in Yemen. Egypt: It's time for an Arab coalition against ISIS . The logistics and details of the joint Arab force have yet to be worked out. But the declaration also urges the Houthis to immediately withdraw from Yemen's government institutions and to surrender their arms to ""legitimate authorities."" Many U.N. representatives have had to flee the chaos. And Saudi naval special forces have rescued dozens of diplomats, a Saudi official said. The conflict in Yemen also led to the withdrawal of U.S. special forces earlier this month, seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Haass, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said what's happening in Yemen could devolve into a long, protracted religious war. ""You have civil wars, you have proxy wars. You have regional wars all in one,"" he said. ""And these things have so many logs on the fire, to use the metaphor, that they ... burn and burn and burn for a long time.""

"(CNN)An ancient ring has shed new light on the ties between Vikings and the Islamic world, more than a century after its discovery. The finger ring found in a 9th century Swedish grave is inscribed with Arabic Kufic writing. The letters appear to read ""AL_LLH, researchers say, which they interpret as meaning ""for/to (the approval of) Allah."" In a paper published in the journal Scanning, the researchers say it is the only ring with an Arabic inscription ever found at a Scandinavian archaeological site. The object was originally discovered during a late 19th century grave excavation in the town of Birka, on Björkö island, about 19 miles (30 kilometers) from Stockholm. Birka was a key trading center during the Viking age and made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. The ring is part of the Swedish History Museum's collection, originally cataloged as being made of gilded silver and violet amethyst, bearing the inscription ""Allah."" Researchers led by Stockholm University biophysicist Sebastian Wärmländer say they used ""scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to analyze the ring's composition and found that it was in fact made of silver alloy and the ""amethyst"" was colored glass. ""For the stone, we must remember that even though colored glass might today be perceived as a 'fake' material of lower value, this was not necessarily so in the past,"" the team cautioned. ""Even though glass production began around 5,000 years ago in the Levant it was still an exotic material in Viking Age Scandinavia."" More significantly, the researchers found no trace of the gold that had been assumed to coat the ring and noted the presence of filing marks. ""Together with the absence of gold on the metal surface ... the file marks clearly show that the previous description of the ring as gilded was mistaken: if the surface had been gilt and the gold layer had worn away, also the file markings would be gone. But the metal surface displays no wear, and as the original file marks are still in place, this ring has never been much used."" The team, therefore, believes the ring was passed from an Arabic silversmith to the woman, with few or any other owners in between. While imported coins were also found in the grave -- many from Afghanistan -- they were ""usually worn and torn ... from passing many hands along the established trade routes"" researchers said. The owner of the ring was found wearing traditional Scandinavian clothing, but the researchers said it was impossible to determine her ethnicity due to the decomposed state of the bones in the grave. ""It is not impossible that the woman herself, or someone close to her, might have visited -- or even originate from -- the Caliphate (which then stretched from Tunisia to the borders of India) or its surrounding regions,"" they said. While travel between the Islamic caliphate and the Viking world was recorded in ancient texts, tales of such journeys often included references to ""giants and dragons"" making it hard to tell fact from fiction, the researchers said. ""The importance of the studied Birka ring is that it most eloquently corroborates ancient tales about direct contacts between Viking Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world. Such contacts must have facilitated exchange of goods, culture, ideas, and news much more efficiently than indirect trade involving several merchants in-between,"" they concluded. Modern relationship . This new evidence of ancient ties between the Vikings and the caliphate comes at a time when Sweden's relationship with the modern Islamic world seems to be problematic. The country's foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, has recently come under scrutiny after criticizing human rights in Saudi Arabia. In January, she tweeted that the flogging of blogger Raif Badawi was ""a cruel attempt to silence modern forms of expression,"" which needed to be stopped. Saudi Arabia blocked Wallstrom from giving a speech to the Arab League in Cairo on March 9, in which she planned to refer to human rights and the rights of women. Sweden subsequently announced that it would not renew its memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia on military cooperation -- and in turn Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates withdrew their ambassadors to Sweden. The United Arab Emirates said it had summoned Sweden's ambassador to protest ""the abusive remarks by the Foreign Minister of Sweden, Margot Wallstrom, against Saudi Arabia.""","Swedish researchers have used scanning to examine a ring found in a Viking grave .
The ring carries an Arabic inscription thought to be ""for/to (the approval of) Allah, they say .

"(CNN)The Syrian military claims to have shot down a U.S. drone, state media reported Tuesday. ""Syrian Air Defense systems shot down a U.S. UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) north of Latakia Province,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said.

Claims that the drone was shot down by Syrian forces are still being investigated, the official said. The drone was believed to be conducting a reconnaissance mission near the Port of Latakia. The United States has used drones for surveillance and targeted killings, allowing missions to be carried out without risking the lives of U.S. military personnel. But it's not alone.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)The U.S. military is in the process of evacuating about 100 Special Operations forces members from the Al Anad airbase in Yemen due to that country's deteriorating security situation, sources in the region familiar with the situation told CNN. Those being evacuated are the last American troops stationed in the Arab nation, which is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group also known as AQAP. The United States closed its embassy in Sanaa last month, after Houthi rebels took over the Yemeni capital. And hundreds of al Qaeda members escaped two Yemeni prisons Thursday and Friday, raising further security questions. For years, the U.S. military has worked closely with Yemen's government to go after AQAP, together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki. And U.S. President Barack Obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign. ""Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability,"" Obama said in January, promoting the policy of ""partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government"" as the best approach in a bad situation. ""The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country,"" the President said. But while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month, these cooperative efforts have been hampered by Yemen's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace. These include the rise of the Houthis, their battles with forces loyal to ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the presence of not only al Qaeda fighters but other militants. On Friday, for instance, ISIS purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in Sanaa what, if true, would mark that group's first large-scale attack in Yemen. The claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried ISIS proclamations, but couldn't be immediately authenticated by CNN. Those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others, according to Yemen's state-run Saba news agency. While ISIS and al Qaeda are both Sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of Islam and violent opposition to the West, that doesn't mean they will be working together anytime soon. In fact, AQAP strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released in November, characterizing its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate as illegitimate. More than anything, the idea of the group calling itself the Islamic State violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there. With no one really in control, that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the West -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over. Meanwhile, the main players for control of Yemen's government -- those siding with Hadi, who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year, and the Houthis, a minority group that's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds. Just two days ago, a Yemeni jet commanded by the capital's Houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, said Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour. At least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes, according to Hobtour. Hadi took to the airwaves of Adan TV, a station he recently started, on Saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest. He called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, condemning the Aden strike and urging Yemeni troops to refuse orders from Houthi officials. Hadi tied the Houthis to Iran, which he was said supported the ""coup"" that led to his departure from Aden. ""The Iranian agenda of the Houthis will not last,"" he said. Needless to say, the Houthis aren't convinced. Mohammed Al Bukhaiti, a top member of the Houthi Political Council, said Hadi's speech won't help Yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last September to transfer power. ""We blame Hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved Yemen's ongoing crises,"" Al Bukhaiti said. ""Hadi will be held responsible for the country's failures and that chaos that could follow.""

"(CNN)NATO jets scrambled to intercept Russian military aircraft as they neared Latvian airspace, officials said on Wednesday. Estonian radar detected the aircraft over the Baltic Sea on Tuesday night, NATO said. Other than the lead aircraft, NATO said, none of the other Russian military aircraft was on a flight plan. NATO sent jets to identify the planes and later reported that the military aircraft flew on into Russian airspace. NATO didn't say how many Russian aircraft were involved. The flights come as Russia's Northern Fleet has been placed on full combat alert for military exercises involving nearly 40,000 troops and 50 warships. The exercises have rattled nerves in nearby NATO states, including Latvia, where U.S. troops and equipment recently arrived for NATO training, and where fears are growing about Russian President Vladimir Putin's next move. At the same time on Wednesday, Putin joined a celebration in Moscow's Red Square, where Russians celebrated the one-year anniversary of the annexation of Crimea. NATO has condemned the annexation as an illegal territory grab and is boosting its troop presence in the region in what officials say is an effort to discourage Putin from encroaching into other countries. Putin describes the annexation as a ""reunification,"" saying that Crimea's residents overwhelmingly voted to be part of Russia. CNN's Don Melvin and Catherine E.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Troops from Niger and Chad discovered a mass grave with more than 90 decomposed bodies near a northern Nigerian town recently retaken from the Islamic militant group Boko Haram, security sources from both countries said Friday. The corpses, some of them beheaded, were found in a shallow mass grave under a bridge just outside the Nigerian town of Damasak, near the border with Niger, the sources said. Troops from Niger and Chad took back the town from Boko Haram last week during a joint operation, the security sources said. Damasak is in Borno, one of several northern states inhabited by the Islamist militant group. Borno is in the northeast corner of Nigeria and borders Niger, Chad and Cameroon. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches, mosques and civilians. It has kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April 2014 and remain missing. The group, its naming meaning ""Western education is forbidden,"" has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria. Journalist Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano, Nigeria.

"(CNN)""In order to attain the impossible, one must attempt the absurd,"" wrote Miguel de Cervantes, the Shakespeare of Spain. And the quest to find his remains has sometimes seemed both, even (dare one say it) quixotic in a time of recession. But forensic scientists have persevered, and appear to have triumphed. Almost 400 years after Cervantes' death, a team led by Francisco Etxeberria announced Tuesday that they were confident they had found Cervantes' coffin in the crypt of the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in the Barrio de Las Letras (Literary Quarter) in Madrid. Historical records indicated Cervantes had been buried there, but the convent had been substantially rebuilt since. (Etxeberria, incidentally, performed the autopsy on former Chilean President Gen. Salvador Allende, confirming he had committed suicide.) At a news conference in Madrid on Tuesday, Etxeberria said that while there was no mathematical proof or DNA test available to completely verify the findings, there were ""many coincidences and no discrepancies"" in the examination of ""Osario 32,"" a common grave in the crypt that contained the remains of 16 people. ""We have Cervantes, represented in some form in this group of bones that are unfortunately very degraded and very fragmented,"" Etxeberria told national television. The search for Cervantes' coffin -- using radar -- began last year, funded by the Madrid City Council. It first mapped more than 30 burial cavities in the walls and nearly 5 meters beneath the floor of the church. Mass spectrometry dated fragments of wood and cloth found in these cavities to the 17th century, an encouraging but far from conclusive development. One crumbling coffin found in January had the initials ""M C"" hammered in nail heads, along with a jumble of skeletal remains. Even then Exteberria urged caution, but further research has narrowed the odds. The forensic team had been hoping that some of those remains would positively identify Cervantes, who suffered gunshot wounds in the chest and left hand at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. But they are not in sufficiently good shape, and some of the remains found may be of Cervantes' wife, Catalina de Salazar. Nor will DNA analysis be much help, for there are no known descendants of Cervantes. Catalina was not Cervantes' first partner. As a teenager he ran away from home with a barmaid, Josefina de Perez, before enlisting with the Spanish Navy. It was only in the 1580s that he started to write, publishing ""La Galatea"" in 1585 and his most famous work, ""Don Quixote,"" in 1605 -- or to give its full title, ""The Adventures of the Ingenious Nobleman Don Quixote of La Mancha."" But ""Don Quixote"" would hardly be noticed in Cervantes' lifetime, and he was almost penniless when he died, having joined the Third Order of St. Francis in his declining years. He knew he was dying when he wrote in the prologue of a posthumously published novel, ""Perhaps the time may come when I mend again this broken thread and say what words fail me here and what needed to be said. Farewell, waggish jokes; farewell, wittiness; farewell, merry friends, for I am dying and longing soon to see you, happy in the life to come."" Cervantes was buried on April 23,1616 -- in the same week William Shakespeare died. There are now plans to reinter Cervantes at the convent and build a new entrance to the crypt in time for the 400th anniversary of Cervantes' death next year. Tyler Fisher, a lecturer in Hispanic studies at Royal Holloway College in London, says that such exhumations ""ignite public attention, inspire re-readings, and invest an all-but-forgotten corner of the city with a renewed, imaginative depth."" Cervantes might enjoy all the attention. Many literary critics say he was not aware of his own genius. John Ormsby, a scholar and translator of Cervantes' work in the 19th century, wrote of ""Don Quixote,"" ""Never was a great work so neglected by its author."" CNN's Helena Cavendish de Moura contributed to this report.","Scientists say they've found the burial place of the influential author .

Read the full open letter from Marvin Gaye's children below: . An Open Letter from the Children of Marvin Gaye 3/18/15 . We want to extend our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the outpouring of love and support we have received from all of our father's fans and friends, as well as artists and industry folks who contacted us surrounding the recent events concerning his song, ""Got to Give It Up.""  Your kindness and encouragement gave us incredible strength and perseverance. We are so incredibly grateful for your support as well as the hard work and dedication of our amazing legal team and experts.  We thank you all. We especially want to thank our mom Jan for her belief in what we were doing all along, and for her never ending support. We will celebrate what would have been our dad's 76th birthday next month, and though we miss him every day -- just like the many thousands of well-wishers who have expressed their heartfelt goodwill - it is through his music that we find our compass and our paths moving forward.  We are his children, but we too are his fans and we hold his music dear. It is in that spirit and on behalf of all those who Dad always considered an extended family, his fans, we take this opportunity to set the record straight on a few misconceptions echoing through some news and social media platforms about our intentions, our plans, and the so-called 'larger' ramifications of this case within the music industry. Originally released in 1977, ""Got to Give It Up"" became one of our dad's most cherished hits, still a favorite at backyard barbecues, weddings, parties, on the radio, or on your iPod.  As Oprah said, it is one of her ""favorite party songs of all time."" The comments on social media, emails and calls we received after the verdict affirmed for us that the song continues to touch in even deeper ways, becoming part of the soundtrack to so many lives.  ""Got to Give It Up"" is also recognized by Billboard Magazine as the fourth biggest single of the 30 charting hits our dad created during his extraordinary career. It has been nearly 38 years since its initial release: tastes change, trends evolve, but we should all be able to agree that it's a testament to the enduring power of ""Got to Give It Up"" that we have arrived at this juncture with Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams, at all.  The fact that they have openly acknowledged their respect and admiration for the song is public knowledge, and further proof of its resonance with an entirely new generation of music fans. However, most songwriting begins with an organic approach; a songwriter brings his or her influences to the table and then works creatively from a blank slate in the crafting of their song to ensure originality and the integrity of their creation.  If Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams had tried to create a new song and coincidentally infused ""Got to Give It Up"" into their work, instead of deliberately undertaking to ""write a song with the same groove,"" we would probably be having a different conversation. Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage; a simple procedure usually arranged in advance of the song's release.  This did not happen. We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. This also did not happen. Instead of licensing our father's song and giving him the appropriate songwriter credit, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams released ""Blurred Lines"" and then filed a pre-emptive lawsuit against us, forcing us into court.  They sought to quickly affirm that their song was ""starkly different,"" than ""Got to Give It Up.""  The Judge denied their motion for Summary Judgement, and a jury was charged with determining the ""extrinsic and intrinsic similarities"" of the songs.  The jury has spoken. We wanted to also make clear that the jury was not permitted to listen to the actual sound recording of ""Got to Give It Up.""  Our dad's powerful vocal performance of his own song along with unique background sounds were eliminated from the trial, and the copyright infringement was based entirely on the similarity of the basic musical compositions, not on ""style,"" or ""feel,"" or ""era,"" or ""genre.""  His song is so iconic that its basic composition stood strong. We feel this further amplifies the soundness of the verdict. Like all music fans, we have an added appreciation for songs that touch us in mysterious ways.  Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams certainly have a right to be inspired by ""Got to Give It Up"" but as the jury ruled, they did not have the right to use it without permission as a blueprint for a track they were constructing. Great artists like our dad intentionally build their music to last, but we as the caretakers of such treasures, have an obligation to be vigilant about preserving the integrity of the music so that future generations understand its origins and feel its effect as the artist intended, and to assure that it retains its value. We feel as many do that, our father, Marvin Gaye, is an artist for the ages.  But whether we're talking about a work created 50 years ago or a work created 50 years from now -- protecting the legacy of original artistry is not a personal obligation, but a universal commitment in support of enduring creative achievement, encouraging future artists to also aim for new ground and their own legacies. That is what copyright laws help us do; they give people the incentive to write original songs and then help protect those songs. Our dad spent his life writing music- that is his legacy to us all- he wrote from his heart and was a brilliant songwriter, arranger, producer and one-of-a-kind vocalist.  If he were alive today, we feel he would embrace the technology available to artists and the diverse music choices and spaces accessible to fans who can stream a song at a moment's notice. But we also know he would be vigilant about safeguarding the artist's rights; a sacred devotion to not only the artist, but key in encouraging and supporting innovation. He also gave credit where credit is due. Howard King, the attorney for Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams stated after the verdict:  ""We owe it to songwriters around the world to make sure this verdict doesn't stand.  My clients know they wrote the song 'Blurred Lines' from their heart and souls and no other source."" We never for a minute suggested that Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams' hearts weren't in it.  But a jury of eight men and women have ruled that the source for ""Blurred Lines"" was the song ""Got to Give It Up,"" a song our dad wrote from his heart, and delivered to the world with pure joy. With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist.  It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued. And finally, we want to put to rest any rumors that we are contemplating claims against Pharrell Williams for his song, ""Happy.""  This is 100% false.  We have absolutely no claim whatsoever concerning ""Happy."" Love and Respect, . Nona, Frankie, and Marvin III .

"(CNN)A severe solar storm created a stunning display of light in the night sky over parts of the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand early Wednesday morning, spotted by those lucky enough to be awake in the wee hours. Called aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere, the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived Tuesday about 10 a.m. ET (1 a.m. Wednesday in Sydney). Both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the Earth, said CNN meteorologist Todd Borek. ""When these particles bombard the Earth's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere, the collision often creates brilliant colors,"" Borek said. ""Most of the time, auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint, which suggested the collision with high-altitude oxygen was also seen on Earth."" Share your photos of the aurora with iReport . The stronger the storm, the farther south it can be seen, said Borek. And this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful, reaching as a high as a G4 on a scale from 1 to 5 Tuesday night, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours, and NOAA's latest reports say it's down to a G1. Though the storm could affect GPS technology and power grids, NOAA said Tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions. The most visible impact as been this stunning light display. If the auroras are seen again tonight, Borek said, they won't be as pronounced and most likely won't reach as far south as Tuesday night. People in northern Michigan, northern Minnesota and Maine may be able to spot them, although he warned that clouds from Minnesota to Montana may impede visibility Wednesday night.","A particularly strong solar storm created a stunning light display .

"Aberdeenshire, Scotland (CNN)In an exclusive interview ahead of his U.S. tour -- and ahead of his 10-year wedding anniversary -- Prince Charles paid tribute to the ""brilliant"" way his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has taken on the ""real, real challenge"" of defining her public role. ""It's always marvelous to have somebody who, you know, you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps,"" Prince Charles told CNN. The couple first visited the U.S. together as newlyweds in 2005, and Camilla was confronted by hardcore Princess Diana fans with abusive placards. Polls at the time found that between 57% and 73% of Brits opposed Charles' new wife being known as queen. If you go back even further, to 1997, the year Diana died, an Ipsos MORI poll put it at 86%. Reporter's notebook: Interviewing the royal couple . But there's been a change in sentiment since they married. A new poll conducted by Comres for CNN found that only 35% now oppose Camilla being known as queen. Nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago. This coincides with a change in palace strategy -- away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing Camilla to be herself. When she appears in public, she's either seen supporting her husband or promoting a set of causes she has a genuine connection with. Prince Charles praised how his wife has handled herself. ""She's done an enormous amount for the whole issue around osteoporosis, which of course runs in her family,"" he said, noting that Camilla's mother and grandmother both suffered from the bone disease. He also points to other issues Camilla is associated with, including literacy and preventing sexual violence. The Duchess of Cornwall, by sticking to what she knows and cares about, is able to connect with the people she meets, which doesn't always come across on camera. When Charles and Camilla married in 2005, there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of Diana, who was expected to be queen herself. With this in mind, royal aides announced that Camilla would not use the title of Queen when Charles becomes King. Instead she would be known as Princess Consort. That still stands, although the public of today looks less likely to oppose the title of Queen.","Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, preparing for U.S. trip .

"(CNN)Arsenal crashed out of the Champions League at the last 16 stage for the fifth time in succession after falling agonizingly short in Monaco. The Premier League side recorded a 2-0 victory on the night but went out on away goals after the tie finished level at 3-3 on aggregate. Monaco, which won 3-1 in the first leg, was overwhelmed for much of the contest and was fortunate to escape without being dumped out of the competition. Olivier Giroud's first half strike and Aaron Ramsey's 79th minute effort ensured a tense finale but the visiting side was unable to find a winner. No team had ever overcome a two-goal first leg deficit away from home in the Champions League and progressed -- but Arsenal's first half display gave it hope. Giroud, who has often been criticized this season for failing to take his chances, lashed in from close range with nine minutes of the first half remaining. Ramsey, a substitute, drove the ball into the net after Theo Walcott's effort had struck the post and Monaco's defenders hesitated. Giroud had a chance late on to cap a dramatic fightback but his effort was saved on the line. ""The best team went through,"" Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker told ITV. ""Monaco deserved it because they played much better in the first leg. We played well today but it was a massive deficit, and it wasn't enough tonight. ""We came here and tried absolutely everything, and when you look at the game we could have scored more than two. ""Monaco deserve it and that's absolutely fine. They caused a lot of problems away from home. We have to admit that we regret the first game. ""But if we continue to play like that we'll do well in the FA Cup and the league. But play as badly as we did in the first game and you're out of the Champions League. Monaco deserved it."" Arsenal's exit means Manchester City is England's sole representative remaining in the competition. It faces Barcelona on Wednesday needing to overturn a 2-1 deficit.

"(CNN)The aircraft carrier USS Ranger, which saw action in the Vietnam War and Operation Desert Storm and had appearances in the movies ""Top Gun"" and ""Star Trek IV,"" is on its final journey, a five-month cruise at the end of a tow cable from Bremerton, Washington, to a scrapyard in Texas. The 56,300-ton warship, which was launched in 1956, was decommissioned in 1993 but kept in storage for possible reactivation until March 2004 when it was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it and turn it into a museum. But attempts by groups in Long Beach, California, and Fairview, Oregon, to do so came up short of meeting U.S. government requirements for donation. The Long Beach group called itself Top Gun Super Carrier in reference to the Ranger's role in the 1986 Tom Cruise movie. The carrier was used for interior shots in the film, which also featured appearances by the carriers USS Carl Vinson and USS Enterprise, according to Internet Movie Database. In December, the Navy paid International Shipbreaking of Brownsville, Texas, a penny to take the carrier off its hands. The shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap. The Ranger, which left Bremerton on Thursday, follows two of its predecessors in the Forrestal class of carriers -- the Forrestal and the Saratoga -- to scrapyards in Brownsville. Another carrier, the USS Constellation, part of the Kitty Hawk class, was towed to Brownsville last year. Like the Ranger, the Constellation was stored in Washington and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of South America, as it would not fit through the Panama Canal. The Ranger's final journey is expected to take four to five months, the Navy said.","Aircraft carrier USS Ranger's final journey likely will take four to five months, Navy says .

"(CNN)Could a simple blood test someday tell if you're genetically predisposed to post-traumatic stress disorder? That's what a team of international researchers is hoping after finding a genetic marker linked to PTSD in the blood samples of Marines stationed in conflict zones. ""We'll draw the blood and have a way to do this very rapidly and start to tease apart who is a little more at risk and who is a little more resilient for PTSD,"" says principal investigator Dr. Dewleen Baker of the University of California-San Diego. ""It's exciting."" PTSD can occur after many types of trauma: rape, torture, child abuse, natural disasters and car, plane, and train wrecks, to name a few. According to the PTSD Alliance, more than 13 million Americans have PTSD and the societal cost is in the billions. Women are about twice as likely as men to develop the disorder. Symptoms tend to cluster into three areas: . •Reliving the event via nightmares or vivid images, along with an extreme reaction such as uncontrollable shaking, chills or heart palpitations. •Avoiding reminders of the event, including becoming emotionally withdrawn and detached from friends, family and everyday activities. •Being hyperaroused, easily startled, irritable, angry, or having difficulty sleeping or concentrating. As one might expect, service members are hardest hit. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates 30% of all Vietnam vets have experienced PTSD. Among troops recently deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, PTSD can run as high as 20% in any given year. But why does severe emotional trauma trigger PTSD in some people and not others? The idea that your genes play a role in whether you develop PTSD is a popular focus of recent research. Scientists have discovered genes that help regulate fear reactions in mice. The lack of a fear-regulating brain chemical called gastrin-releasing peptide led to greater fear response among the rodents. In another study, mice without a protein necessary to form ""fear memories"" were less likely to freeze up and more willing to explore unknown spaces. Studies of twins show heredity accounts for about 30% of the differences in response to trauma, with identical twins much more likely to both develop PTSD than fraternal twins. Other research has looked into the role of inherited brain differences, mental disorders, or addictive tendencies. An unusual avenue of research is how our immune systems may contribute to the development of PTSD symptoms. Prior studies of people diagnosed with PTSD compared to control groups without the disorder suggest differences in genes related to inflammation may play a role. ""The body is built to keep us alive and it functions as one big system,"" says Baker, discussing the interface between stress and immune chemicals. ""The systems all talk to each other."" The recent study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, is unique because it compares blood samples from 188 Marines taken before and after they were deployed to combat zones. Another group of 96 Marines was also studied to verify the results. ""Under this experimental design, not only can we identify differences between U.S. Marines with PTSD and without, but we can go back in time, so to speak, to see if any of the Marines who eventually developed PTSD"" showed evidence that it would emerge, says the study's co-senior author, Christopher Woelk. ""In this vein, we are able to start labeling findings as being putatively 'causal' in nature."" In the blood of Marines ultimately diagnosed with PTSD, the study found biomarkers associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function -- the body's first line of defense -- and interferon, a protein responsible for kicking the immune system into action. In addition, this hypervigilant immune response occurred before and after exposure to trauma. ""Why do certain people start out with slightly higher immune response and others have less? Is it somehow just built in or have they been exposed to some kind of pathogen?"" asks Baker. Instead of pathogens, another possible explanation is that the inflammatory response is activated by the stress of going off to war. ""You could try to dampen down the activation and see if that improves symptoms or prevents development of PTSD,"" says Baker. Baker stresses these questions are purely hypothetical at this time and that the study needs to be replicated and expanded. ""We're early in the process of having some clues as to what might predict risk and resilience, and with more research we'll begin to have effective preventions and treatments,"" says Baker.","More than 13 million Americans have PTSD .

"(CNN)Kids, being kids, like to climb on things. More often than not, that's OK. But when the thing in question is a war memorial? That's the question burning up online parenting groups and in family rooms after an amateur photographer snapped a picture of two children scampering on top of the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington. The photographer, Matt Munson, described the shot on Facebook as ""two little brats climbing over war memorial right in front of a veteran."" The parents, he said, were laughing. ""It actually drew a crowd of spectators and the parents realized how evil they were being and quickly took off before I could take a picture of them all,"" Munson wrote. ""The more I look at this photo the angrier I get."" He has plenty of company there. As the photo went viral, comment after comment poured in on Facebook and Twitter, chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue, part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier. One nurse cradles the wounded fighter while another looks despairingly into an empty helmet. The third looks skyward, to a rescue helicopter or perhaps God, according to the memorial foundation's website. In Munson's photo, a visitor to the memorial seems to grimace at the sight as he pushes an older man in a wheelchair. The older man, wearing a Navy ballcap, and a woman also look on. The children's parents aren't shown. Disgusting. ""Disgusting,"" Facebook user Trisha Davidson wrote of the children's actions. ""So wrong,"" Twitter user karsonwithak chimed in. But not everyone was upset. ""I fully take why people can get annoyed and respect that,"" Reddit user z3k3 wrote. But the writer said a grandfather who was a veteran of World War II ""loved watching the kids play on the local memorial."" ""He saw it as a way for the next generation to take some joy out of something so terrible and at the same time gave them a link to the past as many would stop to read the names or even get interested enough to read up on the subject a little,"" z3k3 wrote. Fair enough, some said. But some memorials are meant to be interactive. Others aren't. And a statue depicting a nurse caring for a gravely wounded man just doesn't seem to be the place for play, a Reddit user with the screen name nickfree wrote. ""Unless the memorial is designed to be climbed on -- unless the message of the memorial is clearly 'use me, interact with me, to help carry my message' (e.g. memorial benches), the default is leave it respectfully alone,"" nickfree wrote. On the Mommyish parenting blog, associate editor Maria Guido wrote that ""there's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some."" ""If these kids were just doing that -- gleefully playing all over a memorial -- I wouldn't find anything wrong with the image, actually. But they're not,"" she wrote. ""These parents were disrespectful,"" she wrote. ""The kids were being kids and following their directives."" Though the National Parks Service, which operates the memorial, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect. ""Please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation's veterans,"" the group wrote on Facebook. ""We hope our visitors understand this moving forward.""","A photo of children playing on Vietnam Women's Memorial draws anger .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Even as major airports across the country clamp down on employee screening, a lone wolf could still potentially slip through security, a top airport official said. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. Patrick Gannon, police chief of Los Angeles International Airport, said the 54,000 employees with security badges undergo recurring criminal background checks and random screening. But even that may not be enough. ""I agree that in any airport throughout the United States and here also, there is never a 100% guarantee that somebody who wanted to do something illegal or wrong couldn't make that happen,"" Gannon said. Only two major airports in the United States -- Miami and Orlando -- conduct full employee screening by requiring all employees with access to secure areas to pass through a metal detector, a CNN investigation found. Other airports like Los Angeles conduct random screenings. Many airports don't do any screenings at all other than a criminal background check before employees are hired. The crackdown on employee screening comes after the arrest of a Delta baggage handler and passenger accused of gun smuggling at Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in December. Both Atlanta and Los Angeles have since begun restricting access by closing access doors that lead to the airfield. Nevertheless, Gannon acknowledged that the potential of a lone wolf committing a crime at the airport worries him. ""It concerns me all the time,"" he said. With so many employees, ""[T]here is no way that you are going to have the ability to screen every single person that comes to work in the airport."" At LAX, employees punch in a code and swipe their badge to access the airfield. Gannon said about 18 out of approximately 300 access doors have been closed as the airport evaluates employee screening procedures. He said, ""the more you limit the access doors, the more you can focus things like spot checks and screenings and cameras."" Even at Miami International Airport, Gannon said, ""they still can't 100% say that they can keep contraband or any type of item out of their restricted area."" Lauren Stover, Miami airport security director, agreed that ID badges alone ""are not enough [to] stop malicious intent."" ""You can vet employees for basic information on their backgrounds, but it's not going to prevent them from carrying out some kind of malicious activity against an airport. And airports need to know their threats. For us, we have threats from criminal activity to being targets of a terrorism attack,"" Stover said. In the wake of congressional scrutiny of airport employee screening procedures, private security guards at Atlanta's airport last month began checking employee bags as the first step toward moving toward full employee screening. The airport also plans to reduce the number of secure access doors from 70 to 10. ""In the last six months ... people are being recruited to engage in terrorist acts,"" said Miguel Southwell, the airport's general manager. ""People are being recruited from the United States. So now we have a greater insider threat."" The TSA is conducting a review of the feasibility of full employee screening, although previous government studies have concluded that would be too expensive and inefficient.

"(HLN)Nick Gordon, romantic partner of Bobbi Kristina Brown, sat down recently with Dr. Phil McGraw for his first on-camera interview since Whitney Houston's daughter was rushed to the hospital in January after being found face down in her bathtub. The interview aired Wednesday on NBC. When his team traveled to Atlanta and initially approached Gordon about the interview, Dr. Phil says they found him in a hysterical state. Video showed an intoxicated Gordon crying and mumbling about missing Krissy, as Brown's family calls her. Brown was found unresponsive in her Roswell, Georgia, home on January 31 and remains hospitalized. Authorities say they're approaching her case as a criminal investigation. See more: Who's who: Bobbi Kristina's small family circle . Dr. Phil first spoke with Nick Gordon's mother, Michelle Gordon, who said her son had admitted to her his desire to take his own life. Even though she's never known him to abuse drugs or alcohol in the past, she said she has recently spoken to her son on the phone when he appeared to be drunk or high. ""He has blamed himself for [Krissy] being in the condition that she's in, he's torn up by that,"" Michelle Gordon told Dr. Phil. ""He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop."" She said repeatedly that Nick Gordon is at a breaking point and that he's even attempted to kill himself by taking Xanax and Unisom. ""Left to his own devices, he'll be dead inside a week,"" Dr. Phil told her. That's when Dr. Phil went up to Nick Gordon's hotel room to persuade him that he needs an intervention. On the way back to the interview room, Gordon admitted that he'd had two shots of alcohol earlier that morning and later started crying in the elevator while showing Dr. Phil his new tattoo: Bobbi Kristina's name on his forearm. Read more: Bobbi Kristina Brown's life in the public eye . Throughout the interview, Gordon appeared distracted and distraught. He stood up and walked out of the room multiple times, only to come back to continue the interview. He constantly interrupted both Dr. Phil and his own mother with random interjections about Krissy's engagement ring or how much he hates Bobby Brown. ""I miss Krissy and Whitney so much!"" Gordon repeated several times, adding that he's lost ""the most legendary singer ever"" and that he cannot lose Krissy, too. Gordon kept switching from crying in his mother's arms, to laughing at Dr. Phil's multiple requests to go to rehab, to agreeing that he needs to get sober in order to help Krissy. He admitted to drinking too much and taking too many pills, only to say he's fine and doesn't care about rehab later in the interview. He told Dr. Phil he hasn't been sleeping and has been waking up in the middle of the night, praying for Krissy. He also explained to the host how much emotional pain he's in, saying, ""My heart hurts. I have panic attacks."" At one point, Gordon broke down crying, uttering, ""I'm going to seem so weak in front of the world."" Read more: What's the truth about Bobbi Kristina's marriage?

"(CNN)Creflo Dollar's new scheme to raise $60 million to purchase a luxury Gulfstream G650 airplane is the latest chapter in a long and sordid history of televangelists exploiting their churches' tax-exempt status -- and their congregants -- to line their own pockets. Preaching the word of faith, or ""prosperity gospel,"" and capitalizing on lax government oversight of his church's finances has enriched Dollar and his family to the detriment of his followers and the American taxpayer. World Changers Church International, Dollar's 30,000-member church, is a tax-exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code. That means the church's donors receive a tax exemption for their donations (including for Dollar's new jet ambitions), and the church pays no tax on the revenue. What's more, because it is organized as a church, the federal government does not require World Changers to file a publicly available tax return, as other nonprofit organizations are required to do. Those tax returns provide at least some financial information to donors and the public about the organization, including its revenues, assets, expenditures and executive compensation. Dollar is known for his custom suits, luxury homes and private jets that ferry him, among other places, from his home base in College Park, Georgia, to his satellite church in Manhattan, where he and his wife reportedly have a $2.5 million apartment. For Dollar, though, these excesses aren't embarrassments. Instead, they are proof that his theology works, that God blesses the faithful with abundant riches. Dollar tells his congregants to ""sow a seed"" with him, promising that a plentiful harvest will be their own blessing and, essentially, a return on their investment. To promoters of the word of faith, or prosperity gospel, ""sowing a seed"" with your pastor is required for God's blessing, even if you're taking it out of your rent money or the last remaining cash in your wallet. Many Christians find word of faith a heretical theology, an embarrassing distortion of Jesus' teachings, not to mention a fraud on congregants. While the government cannot constitutionally mediate theological disputes or otherwise interfere in a church's internal affairs, it can use its oversight powers to ensure that preachers who use their pulpits for profit don't exploit the tax advantages afforded to ordinary houses of worship to pursue their legitimate charitable purposes. In 2007, the Senate Finance Committee, under the chairmanship of Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, launched an investigation into the financial practices of six televangelists, including Dollar. The committee requested documents from Dollar and his wife, Taffi, explaining that taxpayers ""should be assured that their donations are being used for the tax exempt purposes of the organizations."" The documents sought by the committee included audited financial statements for World Changers, information about related for-profit and nonprofit entities, and data on executive compensation and the church's real and personal assets. More than three years later, after an outcry from the televangelists, most visibly Dollar's mentor Kenneth Copeland, the committee opted to abandon its efforts to instigate any sort of regulatory changes. Instead, the committee called on the ministries to engage in ""self-reform,"" even though the committee staff's findings plainly demonstrated that four of the ministries, including Dollar's, were unwilling to engage in any sort of meaningful transparency or accountability. Of the six televangelists from whom the committee sought financial data, Dollar was deemed the ""least cooperative."" Without Dollar's cooperation, the committee was left to piece together a puzzle about his finances through public documents, third parties and news reports. It concluded that in 2006, World Changers had received $69 million in contributions at its Atlanta church alone, that the Dollars owned two multimillion-dollar homes in Georgia, and that the church and related business entities had at various points owned four aircraft flown for personal use -- although none was nearly as pricey as the luxury Gulfstream Dollar now seeks to acquire.

Dollar is now looking to raise $60 million for this new aircraft, purportedly ""to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ.""

"(CNN)British actress Emma Watson made an impassioned plea to women around the world: ""Don't let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do, or cannot achieve. ""Just don't allow it. It's wrong. It's so wrong. Be what you want to be -- and prove them wrong."" The emotional Harry Potter star took to the stage at Facebook's headquarters in London on Sunday, March 8, to talk about gender equality as part of International Women's Day celebrations. CNN was among the live audience of around 150 people -- with millions more watching the live stream across the world --as the 24-year-old UN Goodwill Ambassador spoke about her own feminist journey. Emma's Facebook moment . Of the dozens gathered at the event, the majority were bespectacled young men -- not so unlike Harry Potter himself. Describing the ""surreal"" moment she gave a speech at U.N. headquarters, later watched by 17 million, Watson said:  ""Gender equality historically has been a woman's movement. ""And how it's affecting men hasn't been addressed,"" she told moderator Greg James. During the hour-long conversation, Watson gave the audience a  rare glimpse into her private life -- and the difference between chivalry and sexism. ""I love having the door opened for me, isn't that just polite?"" she said. ""But I think the key is, would you then mind me opening the door for you?"" ""Chivalry should be consensual."" And it's not just women affected by gender inequality -- men suffer too, she added. ""I get disturbed by this idea that men can't cry,"" she continued. ""They can't express themselves and I think that's the saddest thing in the world. Being able to express yourself is what makes you human -- it's not what makes you a girl."" When internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress, following her UN speech, she said it only made her more determined in her campaign. ""If they were trying to put me off -- they did the opposite,"" she added. Almost 230,000 men and boys across the world have since joined the HeForShe campaign, including U.S. President Barack Obama, and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Matt Damon. ""I read a letter of support from a 13-year-old boy that was equally as passionate as a CEO,"" said Watson, adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night. ""I asked my younger sister: 'What would be the one thing you'd want from boys in your life?' She said: 'I just want them to play with us.' And I think that really translates at every level. We just want to be included."" Watson also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother, Jacqueline, who was a ""single working mother and type one diabetic."" ""She wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good,"" said Watson, adding: ""She was actually thrilled when I got my first detention... I think I failed a Latin exam."" Answering questions submitted via Facebook, Watson said the recent lack of female representation at the Academy Awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over. ""Why are women not directing their own stories?"" she said. ""The human race is a bird -- and it needs both its wings to fly. And at the moment one of its wings is clipped,"" said Watson, paraphrasing famous American feminist, Gloria Steinem. When asked what things we can all do to affect change, the actress said it wasn't necessarily about grand actions -- but small ones. ""It's everyday, it's individual, it's on a case by case basis,"" she said. ""Whether it's speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue."" In the audience, a man wearing a Hogwarts jumper asked Watson whether women should be paid the same as men, when they are more likely to take maternity leave. She answered: ""I don't think in the grand scheme of things [maternity leave] is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field. ""I think men should be equal partners in raising children."" Those missing out on a place still got watch it live on Watson's Facebook page. See the whole conversation in the videos below. Part 1: .

"(CNN)Starbucks charges more than $5 for a large (""venti"" in Starbucks speak) Caramel Frappuccino, yet no one bats an eye. But when the CEO of Starbucks announced a plan he hoped would ease racial tensions, the response was immediate outrage! This latest controversy started Monday when Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz unveiled a new initiative in which Starbucks baristas would write the words ""Race Together"" on coffee cups to help spark a dialogue on race. Schultz even took out full-page ads in The New York Times and USA Today touting this effort. Twitter immediately lit up with a flurry of angry tweets -- apparently from people who have consumed far too much caffeine. Surprisingly, though, the backlash came from all sides. One self-described conservative tweeted this: . A person who noted her support of progressive causes in her Twitter profile tweeted: . Even people in the middle expressed scorn with tweets such as: . I, on the other hand, applaud Schultz's efforts, at least in theory. As Schultz correctly stated when discussing the genesis for ""Race Together,"" ""If we just keep going about our business ... and ignoring this (racial issue), then I think we are, in a sense, part of the problem."" Sure, I also see some logistical problems with the ""get your iced Mocha Frappuccino with a shot of racial tolerance"" approach. First, I live in New York City, where New Yorkers barely have the patience to wait for a cup of plain old coffee to be poured let alone stand in line longer while people engage in a nuanced discourse on race. I can envision awkward situations where the baristas ask a customer, ""So how do you want your coffee?"" to which the customer responds, ""Black."" For some reason saying ""black"" in the context of this program could feel uncomfortable. Next thing you know, Starbucks will have to coin politically correct terms for ""black"" coffee. And as a practical matter, only 40% of Starbucks employees are minorities. Consequently, in most Starbucks, the conversation about racial tolerance will between be between two white people. But let's put those issues aside. The swift and angry backlash against Schultz's idea proves once again that not only don't we live in a post-racial America, we live in a hyper-racial one. In fact, a recent CNN/ORC poll found 40% of Americans believe racial relations have become worse during the six years Barack Obama has been in the White House. It's strikingly obvious that if we are going to improve this situation, we need to have a candid and brutally honest discussion about the underlying factors contributing to racism, the lack of empathy for people of other races, etc. And that's simply what Starbucks' ""Race Together"" stated goal is: ""to stimulate conversation, compassion and positive action regarding race in America."" Starbucks' senior vice president of communications, Corey duBrowa, deleted his Twitter account Monday after ""feeling personally attacked in a cascade of negativity"" and being ""overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion"" in response to ""Race Together."" But duBrowa was back on Twitter on Tuesday night. Why? Because he truly believed in ""the power of meaningful, civil, thoughtful, respectful open conversation."" DuBrowa's reaction may just be a teachable moment on discussing race. It's truly not an easy topic to broach. The initial response by some, like duBrowa, may be to shut down when racial discussions become uncomfortable. But then, hopefully like duBrowa did later, the conversation can be rejoined within a framework that's respectful to all involved. But to be blunt, one of the biggest obstacles in even starting this conversation is that most white Americans don't want to discuss race, as polls have confirmed. For example, after the grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, didn't indict police Officer Darren Wilson in the killing of teenager Michael Brown, a poll found that 80% of blacks felt that the shooting raised important issues about race that needed to be discussed. How many white people agreed? Only 37%. And personally I have seen some white friends become defensive when race issues are raised. Why? Because many view it as an accusation that they are somehow racist (or at least complicit in racism) as opposed to a starting point for a productive conversation. The question is how can we begin that talk about race that our nation desperately needs to have? True, the line at Starbucks might not be the best place. But it has to start somewhere if we are going to close the racial gap that many, including myself, feel is growing.","Response mostly negative after Starbucks launches initiative to talk about race relations .

"(CNN)A salary dispute between North and South Korea has sent jitters through factory owners operating at an industrial complex that is supposed to be a symbol of cooperation for the divided Korean peninsula. The disagreement started in late February, when the North Korean government demanded an increase of around $8.60 a month for North Korean employees working in the Kaesong Industrial Complex. South Korea is working on a response to the demands, leaving factory owners worried about the threat of a factory shutdown. ""I'm already nervous about the situation because of the traumatic experience in 2013 when the North closed down the complex,"" said Yoo Chang-geun, the South Korean head of an automobile parts manufacturer that employs 400 North Koreans in Kaesong. Yoo's company, SJ Tech, operates out of Kaesong, which is just north of the Demilitarized Zone in North Korean territory. He was referring to North Korea's monthslong closure of Kaesong in 2013, during a period of heightened tension on the peninsula. About 125 South Korean companies operate out of Kaesong, employing more than 50,000 North Korean workers. An official from the South Korean government's Unification Ministry, who according to policy spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, says companies at Kaesong pay their North Korean workers an average of $155.50 a month. North Korea is demanding an increase of roughly 5.5%, to an equivalent $164.10 a month. The South Korean government argues that the salary hike is a breach of an existing agreement for the industrial park, which first opened in 2004. The official called the North's request a ""one-sided demand.""  The official did not rule out the possibility that penalties could be imposed on South Korean companies if they individually agree to raise employee salaries. Manufacturers in Kaesong rely on the government in Seoul to represent them in negotiations with Pyongyang. ""It feels like we're entering a very difficult phase where innocent corporations are being beaten up by political fights between the North and South,"" Kim Seo-Jin, the director of Corporate Association of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, said Wednesday. Experts say this isn't the first time the North and South have butted heads over employee salaries in Kaesong. The industrial park was established as a symbol of cooperation at a time when a previous government in South Korea was pursuing a ""Sunshine Policy"" of friendship with its northern rival. South Korean companies benefited from the extremely low cost of North Korean labor.  Meanwhile, North Korea gained a valuable stream of hard currency revenue by appropriating an undisclosed amount of salary from its citizens working in Kaesong. South Korean employers also made a practice of giving small food bonuses to some hungry employees. For a time, this came in the form of ""Choco Pies,"" a packaged South Korean dessert.  The snacks reportedly became highly-prized items on the black market in the communist North's rigidly controlled economy.  Eventually, employers transitioned to giving workers instant noodles, as one former Kaesong factory owner told CNN in 2014, ""in order to provide a more substantial snack."" ""The whole project is built with an understanding that North Korean wages should and will continue to rise,"" says John Delury, associate professor at Yonsei University's graduate school of international studies in Seoul. But one factory owner said the communist regime's most recent approach to the salaries is problematic. ""The amount of the pay raise demanded this time is small,"" said  SJ Tech's Yoo Chang-geun. ""But having this kind of precedent may lead to losing control of the operation in the complex."" Experts say Seoul and Pyongyang's approach to the Kaesong salary dispute will serve as an important barometer for the direction of future relations between the rival governments. ""Kaesong is the last living legacy of the Sunshine Policy,"" says professor Delury of Yeonsei University. ""If something like wage disputes lead to the shutdown or freezing of Kaesong, that would be a major blow.""","The disagreement started in late February .

"(CNN)As planets go, Mercury doesn't get a lot of love. People spend more time on Google searching for Queen singer Freddy Mercury than planet Mercury ... and Freddie's been gone for nearly a quarter-century. Not even NASA spends much time there, making it the least-explored inner planet in the solar system. But one question has long perplexed scientists: Why's the darned thing so dark? Compared with our own moon, which is about the same size, Mercury reflects much less light. Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Brown University and the Planetary Sciences Institute say they may have found the answer: It's been ""effectively painted black,"" in the words of Megan Bruck Syal, a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore. Over the eons, the researchers argue in a paper published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, microscopic meteorites spawned from carbon-rich comets may have contributed enough dark-hued carbon to reduce the amount of reflected light. The pieces seem to fit together: There's a lot more carbon dust thrown off from comets close to the sun, where Mercury orbits -- about 50 times as much for Mercury as for our moon, the researchers say. And tests using a big NASA gun made to simulate planetary impacts on a small scale seem to show the theory is plausible, the authors say. ""We show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent,"" said Peter Schultz, a professor emeritus of geological sciences at Brown University. ""From the standpoint of spectral analysis, it's like an invisible paint.""","Mercury was ""painted black"" by millions of years of micrometeorites, researchers say .

"(CNN)You may not know it, but comedian Trevor Noah actually made a bit of history even before being named to succeed Jon Stewart as host of ""The Daily Show."" The 31-year-old South African comic has made only a few appearances on that show since popping up as a correspondent in December, but he's better known within the world of standup comedy. In 2013, Noah became the first African comedian to perform on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."" He's been on the cover of Rolling Stone in South Africa, where he's extremely popular.  He's joked about being the son of a black African woman and a white Swiss man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in South Africa. ""My mom would be arrested. She would be fined, and still she was like 'ooh, I don't care, I want a white man, ooh,' "" he once told an audience at London's Soho Theater during his standup show ""The Racist."" ""And my dad was also like, well, you know how the Swiss love chocolate."" Why mixed-race comic was 'born a crime' Race, identity and ethnicity have figured in prominently in his act. Because of his parents' then-illegal relationship, he joked, ""In the streets, my father couldn't walk with us. He would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me like a creepy pedophile. And my mom could walk with me, but every time the police went by, she would drop me. I felt like a bag of weed."" Noah has said in his act that he lost touch with his father for several years because of apartheid. In 2012, he told NPR that he was fascinated by how Americans discuss race. ""I got to Baltimore, and I was expecting ... because urban means built up and new, you know,"" he said. ""So I got there, and I was, 'Whoa, it's not as urban as people told me.' ... But it's very black. I'll tell you that much."" Noah told CNN's ""African Voices"" in 2013 that after finding success in his homeland -- where he starred on a soap opera, hosted his own radio show and was the subject of the  2012 documentary ""You Laugh But It's True"" -- he moved to the United States for a year to try to raise his profile. He returned to his country with new material shaped by his time spent in the States, he said. ""Comedy is really getting quite popular in South Africa,"" Noah said. ""It's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream, which is very good. I think the reason it's doing so well is because South Africans need to laugh and South Africans want to laugh."" Noah has moved to the U.S. permanently and told Newsweek, ""I've always wanted to be a comedian in the world. I don't want to be labeled a South African comedian."" On ""The Daily Show,"" he debuted as a correspondent with a bit titled ""Spot the Africa,"" which juxtaposed modern-day South Africa and the United States. What remains to be seen is whether what the Guardian has described as ""his combination of terribly polite, butter-wouldn't-melt stage presence and biting, often brutal gags"" will translate into success on ""The Daily Show.""","Noah is the son of a black South African woman and a white Swiss man .

"Washington (CNN)No deal is better than a bad deal, say critics of President Barack Obama's nuclear talks with Iran. But what if Republican and Democratic opponents succeed in their intensifying effort to derail the diplomacy? The price of failure could be an ugly blame game and cascade of political reprisals leading to nuclear chicken between Iran and the West -- potentially leading to war. ""We would have to deal with a resumption of Iran's nuclear activities, which we don't want to see take place. Iran would have to deal with the resumption of sanctions, which they don't want,"" said Gary Samore, a top nonproliferation official during Obama's first term. For now, the grave consequences of a breakdown in talks are one reason the United States and Iran are still at the table, as a grueling diplomatic process reaches critical deadlines and painful political decisions beckon. Iran deal: A treaty or not a treaty, that is the question . Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif are haggling over the remaining issues in Lausanne, Switzerland, ahead of an end-of-the-month deadline for a framework agreement, which then must be finalized by July 1. But time may be running out for a deal in which six world powers would lift sanctions that have throttled Iran's economy in return for assurances that Tehran will continue to stay a year or so away from developing a nuclear bomb. The White House puts the chances of a deal at only 50-50: Disputes still rage over the scale of nuclear infrastructure Iran will be allowed to keep, the pace of sanctions relief and the extent of nuclear site inspections. Despite the controversy stoked last week in Washington when 47 GOP senators sent a letter to Iran's leaders warning that the future of a deal was not guaranteed, many analysts believe that the talks will go on, even if the end-of-March deadline slips. ""Not because all sides are desperate to keep talking. But I think sufficient momentum has been created in the last month or so that they see real possibilities,"" said Robert Einhorn, a former senior U.S. State Department arms control official. Obama may now have slightly more political leeway on the talks than before -- ironically because of attempts by U.S. and Israeli critics to pen him in. A few weeks ago, skeptical Democrats appeared to be lining up with Republicans and approaching a veto-proof Senate majority that could have forced Obama to submit a deal to Congress or accept the passage of new sanctions. Either move could have killed the agreement. But the Republicans' letter and a fiercely critical speech to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the proposed deal prompted some skeptical Democrats to close ranks, at least temporarily. But Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" that Obama was on the cusp of agreeing a ""very bad"" deal that would allow Iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure intact. He said that if an agreement is reached, he would bring up legislation that would give Congress 60 days to back or reject a deal, despite fresh pleas from the White House for the GOP to hold off. If no deal is reached, McConnell said on Sunday that he would press ahead with toughening sanctions on Iran, he said. Republican sources, meanwhile, said that despite the furor over the letter from the senators, no Democrats had yet formally pulled support for legislation requiring the Senate to have a say on the deal. That leaves the real possibility of a pitched political showdown on Iran in the coming months. The opening for diplomacy is meanwhile not endless. And if no deal emerges by July, political pressure for a tougher administration stance towards Iran may be unstoppable. If diplomacy fails, how events unfold will be dictated by how the process collapses; who gets the blame; and the political pressures exerted on Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Washington and Tehran. ""If, at the end of June, there is not a deal, and talks have broken off, I think that it is inevitable that the Congress will adopt new sanctions legislation,"" said Einhorn, now with the Brookings Institution. ""What that will mean is the Iranians will reciprocate."" Iran could start up centrifuges halted during the nuclear negotiations, bring more advanced machinery online and enrich uranium to the potent 20% level that would get it closer to a weapon. And if it bars international inspectors, the world would have no idea how far Iran is from making a bomb. What's in the Iran nuclear deal . The administration thinks that if the United States gets the blame for using hardball tactics that derail talks -- if, say, Congress imposes more sanctions, as administration critics want -- there is no way its international partners would keep existing sanctions in place, let alone double down and impose new ones. In addition to unilateral U.S. sanctions Congress has imposed, the United Nations, European Union and other countries have put in place their own sanctions cutting off Iran from international partners and not just the American economy. Cornelius Adebahr, a European security specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, predicted Iran would reap a propaganda victory. ""It would give ammunition for Iran to say the U.S. is not reliable,"" he said. Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Jim Walsh, a specialist on the talks, said the Iranian government would have little choice but to hit back at a tougher U.S. stance. ""The Iranians are just not going to take it. They are going to feel condemned to respond. Both sides will take their shovels and dig the holes deeper."" Walsh continued, ""We would be between a lame duck (U.S.) president for whom negotiations had just failed, a weakened Rouhani, for whom negotiations have just failed, and a coming U.S. presidential election -- not exactly the best environment to return to talks and accomplish a diplomatic settlement."" Aborted negotiations that leave Iran rededicated to its nuclear program raise the specter of Tehran with a bomb -- or some enemy country taking military action to stop it. Did 47 Republican senators break the law in plain sight? But critics of the deal being worked out in Switzerland don't agree that such an outcome is the likeliest scenario. GOP hawks and Israel believe Tehran is so desperate for sanctions relief, especially at a time of low oil prices, that it will have no choice but to offer a better deal than the one currently on the table and agree to the complete halt to uranium enrichment that Israel and conservatives demand. ""If Iran threatens to walk away from the table -- and this often happens in a Persian bazaar -- call their bluff. They'll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do,"" Netanyahu maintained in his Congress speech. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney made the case in a USA Today op-ed Friday that Obama should ""walk away from a flimsy nuclear agreement."" Those opposed to the deal reject the administration that follow their advice would likely blow up the talks and set Washington on an inevitable path to war as the only remaining way to disable Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Instead, GOP congressmen counter that several bills they are pushing, with significant Democratic support, do not forestall the possibility of continued diplomacy if talks fail. They say that extra sanctions would increase Obama's leverage in diplomacy, not weaken it. Even if talks do succeed this year, the long-term future of an agreement still wouldn't be assured. The diplomatic effort has powerful critics among hardliners in Tehran who, whatever's written on paper, could push to illicitly expand Iran's nuclear program and close in on a bomb. It's not just Republicans who fear Tehran may violate any deal or test the limits of compliance. Some people who back the talks admit that may be the case, too. In Washington, Congress will be required to lift the existing sanctions on Iran to sustain the agreement in years to come -- a step that is hardly a given. And the stiff Republican opposition means a deal is not assured of surviving the arrival of a new president in the White House come 2017. A future Republican president could reverse Obama's sanctions waivers fairly quickly, as the senators warned in their letter to Iran. Whether the new president would want to do so is another matter, however, especially if Iran lives up to the terms of a deal, which would include stringent verification by international inspectors. He or she would risk a heavy political price. A unilateral Washington pullout would likely infuriate U.S. partners and leave the rookie president facing a boiling crisis that could overwhelm the new administration's nascent foreign policy. ""That's what the administration is counting on -- if there is compliance and the deal is working well,"" said Einhorn. Kerry reminded Congress this week that Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia would all be cosignatories of a deal. ""If all those countries have said this is good and it's working, (will a new president) just turn around and nullify it on behalf of the United States?"" he asked. ""That's not going to happen."" Congress would face the same cost-benefit calculation when it comes to the sanctions only lawmakers can expunge. In the event of a Democratic White House victory in 2016, the congressional math could also change in favor of a deal. And if Republicans keep their majorities, lawmakers who are bent on thwarting Obama may be less willing to handcuff a new GOP president.","Iran negotiations have large diplomatic and political implications .

"(CNN)The fury of Tropical Cyclone Pam, one of the most powerful storms ever to make landfall, has moved on, but the misery it left behind in the islands of Vanuatu is just starting to become apparent. Aid workers described scenes of extensive devastation in the capital, Port Vila, and expressed fears of even more destruction farther afield. Thousands were in need of shelter, food and water, the Red Cross said Sunday. ""Homes have been lost, crops are destroyed. The damage is enormous, and people need our help,"" said Aurelia Balpe, head of the Red Cross in the Pacific. ""Yet it will still take some time before we really understand the full extent of the damage."" The storm flattened houses, scattered trees across roads and inflicted damage on key buildings meant to serve as safe havens, such as the hospital, schools and churches. ""It's becoming increasingly clear that we are now dealing with worse than the worst-case scenario in Vanuatu,"" said Helen Szoke, executive director in Australia for the aid group Oxfam. ""This is likely to be one of the worst disasters ever seen in the Pacific."" At least 90% of housing in Port Vila has been badly damaged, parts of the hospital are flooded and the state mortuary took a hit, Oxfam said. Some 60,000 children are in need of assistance, UNICEF reported Sunday. How to help Vanuatu residents . At least six people have been confirmed dead. But communications with many of the 80-plus islands in the archipelago are down, so the fear is that the toll will climb as more information emerges. The confirmed deaths, reported by the National Disaster Management Office, are just from Port Vila. For most of a 24-hour period between Friday and Saturday, the cyclone pummeled Vanuatu, where some 260,000 people live, many in flimsy homes built of thatch. It is unclear how many thousands of people have been displaced by the massive storm, which had the power of a Category 5 hurricane when it made landfall. Aerial assessments are being carried out by military aircraft from New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. Relief workers are raising concerns about a lack of clean water and sanitation for the many people left homeless. Aid has started to trickle in. The Australian government said a first contingent of officials and supplies arrived in Port Vila around noon Sunday and more flights were expected to follow. ""In Port Vila, there's a lot of activity now -- people are starting to emerge,"" said Tom Perry of the aid group CARE International. ""You can see trees that are strewn across roads being chopped down. The evacuation centers are beginning to be set up."" Perry, who arrived on one of the first Australian military flights into Port Vila, told CNN the damage there was ""very significant"" with trees that looked like ""snapped toothpicks."" ""It's like a bomb has gone through,"" said journalist Michael McLennan, who lives in Port Vila. ""It's really quite apocalyptic."" Most buildings in the capital were destroyed or damaged, he told CNN on Sunday. Many roads were blocked by fallen trees or power lines. The main objective now is to get disaster response teams into Vanuatu and kick-start the humanitarian operation, Sune Gudnitz, regional head for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CNN from Fiji, about 600 miles away. His aid agency has had word of much destruction on Efate, the island where Port Vila is located, and from the southern island of Tanna, he said. Only a little information has so far trickled out from beyond the capital, but Gudnitz said he fears the worst. ""Unfortunately, the more that comes out, the worse it looks,"" he said. Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale, who was at a U.N. conference on disaster risk reduction in Japan on Saturday, issued an appeal to the global community to help his shattered nation. Vanuatu has officially declared a state of emergency, opening the door for other countries to help. Vanuatu's remote location adds to the challenges the international response faces. Port Vila is more than 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) northeast of Brisbane on Australia's east coast, and some 2,200 kilometers (1,367 miles) north of Auckland, the closest city in New Zealand. Reaching the more isolated communities will also take time. Vanuatu's archipelago -- comprising 83 small islands, about 65 of them inhabited -- is roughly 850 kilometers (528 miles) long. Many of the people are subsistence farmers, said CNN's Bill Weir, who visited Vanuatu recently. He recalled talking to a resident who built the first indoor bathroom on his island and sought advice on where to find a toilet paper dispenser. ""It's setting them back years,"" Weir said of the storm. People away from the capital live much as their ancestors did generations ago. Homes are built of weak materials, including straw and corrugated steel, that stood little chance against Pam's raging winds. ""When you've got a Category 5 cyclone that essentially just sat here for 24 hours -- where do you go when you have a storm that powerful?"" Perry of CARE International said. ""It's very terrifying to think about what people have been through."" While international teams are finding a way in, it will be up to humanitarian agency staffers on the ground and the local communities themselves to do what they can to get by amid the wreckage. Aid workers said the most immediate challenge is to get clean water to people. Many people will be spending another night in emergency shelters. Track the storm . Pam is the South Pacific's second strongest cyclone since record-keeping began in 1970. And it's the strongest of any type since Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the Philippines in 2013, killing more than 6,000 people.

"Washington (CNN)Calling state bans on same-sex marriage ""incompatible with the Constitution,"" the Obama administration Friday filed a brief at the U.S. Supreme Court  in support of couples who are making challenges in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. ""The marriage bans challenged in these cases impermissibly exclude lesbian and gay couples from the rights, responsibilities and status of civil marriage,"" Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote. He said the states have ""burdened petitioners in every aspect of life that marriage touches, from the mundane to the profound."" The brief marks the first time the administration has formally made a filing with the high court supporting its position that bans on gay marriage should be declared unconstitutional nationwide. The court will hear arguments in the state cases on April 28. Verrilli said  the laws ""impose concrete harms on same-sex couples and send the inescapable message that same-sex couples and their children are second-class families, unworthy of the recognition and benefits that opposite-sex couples take for granted."" The bans, he said, ""cannot be reconciled with the fundamental constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws."" He said there is ""no adequate justification for such a discriminatory and injurious exercise of state control."" Verrilli stressed that throughout history lesbian and gay people have encountered numerous barriers that have ""prevented them from full, free, and equal participation in American life."" In an op-ed earlier this week , published in USA Today, Attorney General Eric Holder wrote, ""Marriage equality is an idea whose time has come."" President Barack Obama's position on same-sex marriage has evolved. In May 2012, in an interview with ABC News, he announced his support for gay marriage. ""At a certain point,"" he said, ""I've just concluded that for me, personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married."" At his 2013 inauguration he said, ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law."" In February 2013, the administration filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of couples challenging California's ban on same sex marriage. Verilli argued  that California law provided same sex couples registered as domestic partners all the legal incidents of marriage, but denied them the ""designation of marriage."" Ultimately, the Supreme Court dismissed that case. Supporters of the state bans have until the end of the month to file their briefs. Thursday was the deadline for briefs in support of petitioners. James Obergefell, the named plaintiff in the case, came to the court Friday as the Human Rights Campaign delivered a brief signed by over 200,000 individuals in support of same-sex marriage. In an interview, Obergefell said his journey began when he challenged  Ohio's refusal to recognize same-sex marriage on death certificates. He was legally married to his partner, John Arthur James, in Maryland in 2013, but after  Arthur died, Ohio officials refused to recognize Obergefell as his spouse. Asked what it would mean to him if his side wins, Obergefell said, "" It will mean John and I matter. It will mean we have the  same rights and responsibilities as other Americans.""","Administration files a brief before Supreme Court hears cases .

"(CNN)So now we know. The Germanwings aircraft that crashed earlier this week was deliberately brought down by a co-pilot who had managed to lock himself in the cockpit as he set the plane on a course for destruction, according to officials. We all wish it weren't so, and the investigation, instead of looking at possible deficiencies of the plane, will now look to the co-pilot, who -- by all accounts -- showed no signs that this would be his horrific legacy. The irony would be rich, if it weren't so tragic.  The locked door, the very mechanism put into place to protect the cockpit from unruly or dangerous passengers -- made more secure in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- was used against a pilot who, for reasons still unknown, left the cockpit. It may be too early to draw conclusive lessons from what has happened, but as this unfolds and before we begin constructing a narrative about the pilot that may be filled with rumors, innuendo and half-truths, there are structural issues to address immediately. First, we have seen that there is a real risk of pilots bringing down planes. We have built no back-up plans into the secure cockpit programs.  It might be necessary to devise secure and classified entry access passwords or electronic keys that are available only to both pilots or a pilot and the lead flight attendant.  No system of security should rely on a single point of entry and while the post-9/11 security planning made sense then, it may have outlived the threat now. Second, regardless of pilots' backgrounds and ideologies, airlines as sophisticated as Lufthansa may need to implement more than voluntary stress-relief assessments. The zeitgeist of pilots is very similar to the military: tough, strong, with psychological challenges viewed as ""sissy.""  Perhaps airlines will need to guarantee that pilots who seek counseling will not be unjustly punished.  And instead of sitting back and waiting for someone to approach counselors, regular and consistent check-ins might be necessary. Finally, the ""t"" word. Before the news today, the Obama administration quickly rejected a notion that this was terrorism.  And that may still be accurate. But as someone who has been a part of counterterrorism efforts, I am impressed with the French prosecutor's honesty in a search for the right words. This is obviously terrorism in the general sense to elicit fear in a general population, but whether it was done for some political or ideological reason (in the absence of any group taking credit, it does not fit the model of most major airline terror attacks) we still do not know.  And it isn't as if there is a national response that we can expect from Germany, such as going to war.  Still, it clearly isn't just suicide. This is different. If there is some nefarious ideological motivation, this may be one of a few incidents where a ""loner"" is able to create massive, simultaneous deaths.  Most lone wolf terror is almost always of low consequence.  It may be that we are in an era when we don't have the right words to describe the threats we face from loners with the capacity for mass casualties. As Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said, ""If a person kills himself and also 149 other people, another word should be used -- not suicide."" And that honest assessment is what we heard today.","Juliette Kayyem: Now we know co-pilot brought down Germanwings plane; this shows need for structural changes to post 9-11 security .

"(CNN)There's a steady stream of blood flowing down his face from a cut just above his eye. His rapid, open-mouth breathing inadvertently draws some of the blood inside, discoloring his teeth. He appears dazed, probably with a concussion. But there are no trained physicians around to evaluate. And even if there were, it's doubtful anything a doctor could say would stop him from fighting. The crowd that has gathered in this backyard of a Miami suburb won't let him. They have too much money invested. Besides, this illegal fight is the safest way he can make money. And his best chance of reaching the American Dream. When I first saw this footage from the documentary ""Dawg Fight,"" I recoiled. Here we are recognizing the 50th anniversary of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Selma, Alabama, and in the next state over there are desperate, unemployed black men beating the hell out of each other for a hundred bucks. While the 1999 cult classic ""Fight Club"" made organized street fights look like a sexy form of psychotherapy for repressed men (and some of the guys who participate in street fights do fit the bill), the vast majority in the documentary just need the money. Because in the Miami area the poor reportedly live on $11 a day. And in West Perrine, the suburb where ""Dawg Fight"" takes place and where nearly 75% of the residents are black, unemployment remains high. ""This is the future of America,"" said the film's director, Billy Corben. ""When you look at the incarceration rate, especially for black men, and income inequality, the life you see in 'Dawg Fight' is where we are headed. ""We have these ridiculous drug laws, which makes it nearly impossible to get a job once you've been arrested. And if you can get a job, it doesn't pay enough to feed a family."" The numbers speak for themselves. The United States has 5% of the world's population but 25% of its prisoners -- by far the most of any country. Meanwhile, between 2009 and 2012, the top 1% of Americans captured 95% of all income growth. So while it is true unemployment is down and Wall Street is booming, the combination of a debilitating criminal justice system and low wages has created an environment in which men such as those featured in ""Dawg Fight"" feel backyard fights are actually one of the less nefarious ways they can make money. Sens. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, and Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, have become interesting bedfellows as they work to address the country's runaway prison industry. This week, the pair, along with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, introduced a medical marijuana bill as another step toward decriminalizing the drug. This is a welcome step, because of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001-2010, nearly 90% was for simple possession, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. And while whites and blacks use the drug at the same rate, blacks were arrested four times as often, the ACLU said. That's not to say all of the ex-cons in the 12-by-12 ring are nonviolent drug offenders. Some, by their own admission, have done worse. But they are out of jail now, and don't have the luxury of waiting to see if debates going on in Washington actually result in laws. ""I don't promote violence, I promote hope,"" said Dada 5000, who started West Perrine fights in his mother's backyard and who was once a bodyguard for mixed martial arts fighter Kimbo Slice. ""A lot of these men paid their debt back to society; they did the rehab, but they still can't get a job. They don't blame society for their life. ... (T)hey are back here in these streets, and they would like a second chance, a chance to do the right thing, but those chances are not there. We are an alternative to the bad things."" I asked if the election of the first black President provided any inspiration at all, and he said, ""Obama's black, but he didn't grow up black, not like this. ""He never had to make do, to go without. He never was put inside those situations, those circumstances where desperation pushes you to the edge. He's had what he thinks are hard times, but it's nothing like this. If he came down here, he would be blown away."" Corben echoes the sentiment. ""The unemployment rate is all well and good for people in Washington, but those are not the people who are trying to make it,"" he said. ""People think of Miami, they think of beaches and Ocean Drive and all of that. This is the part of Miami people don't want to talk about. ""But you know what? Miami is not unique. There are a lot of cities like this,"" he adds. ""Dawg Fight"" certainly doesn't sugarcoat anything. The fights are raw, vicious. But then so is the reality in which it is based. Two of the fighters featured are dead -- including one on whom police used a Taser. With prize money as little as $100, the chances this lifestyle alone can elevate a family out of poverty is slim to none. But what are the alternatives? I grew up in a rough neighborhood on the eastside of Detroit. I was mugged in elementary school by a grown man. And even I don't claim to know the desperation these men see on a daily basis. ""We don't have Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson coming down here to this level of hood,"" Dada said. ""This is the real Miami. We may not want to acknowledge it, but it is. ""And I bet if you go to some of the other cities where men don't have any skills, they don't have an education, they may have a record ... you'll find the same thing,"" he added. ""What I'm doing isn't barbaric, it's a message.""","The documentary ""Dawg Fight"" shows men fighting in a Miami suburb for money .

"(CNN)Novak Djokovic led Serbia to the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup World Group after answering a late call to play in Saturday's last 16 doubles victory over neighbor and rival Croatia. Teammate Viktor Troicki had been due to play in the doubles rubber alongside Nenad Zimonjic, but a draining five-set singles match with Croatian teen starlet Borna Coric on Friday convinced Serbia coach Bogdan Obradovic to draft in the fresher Djokovic. It was an inspired choice. The Serbian pair took less than two hours to defeat Franko Skugor and Marin Draganja 6-3, 6-4, 6-1, securing an unassailable 3-0 aggregate lead in the best of five tie after singles wins for Djokovic and Troicki over their Croatian opponents Friday. ""We wanted to finish the job today, to take advantage of the fact that we won the first singles and that was done,"" Djokovic said in quotes carried by the AFP news agency after the match. The World No 1. singles player has looked strong all week after losing in straight sets to Roger Federer at the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships seven days ago. He was cheered on by a packed and passionate home crowd at the Kraljevo Sports Center. Serbia has won the Davis Cup once before, in 2010 when it defeated Croatia on the way to the final. France marches on . In the day's other Davis Cup ties, France secured a last 16 slot for the sixth consecutive year. Julien Benneteau and Nicolas Mahut's comfortable doubles victory over Germany's Benjamin Becker and Andre Begemann pushed the French over the line 3-0. The Bryan brothers fought back to secure doubles victory for the U.S. over Great Britain in Glasgow, reducing the 2-0 deficit built up by singles victories from Andy Murray and James Ward Friday. Meanwhile, defending champions Switzerland, playing without Roger Federer or Stan Wawrinka, are on the brink after falling 2-1 behind Belgium as Michael Lammer and Adrien Bossel lost 1-6 6-3 6-2 6-2 to Ruben Bemelmans and Adrien Bossel.","Novak Djokovic answers late call to help Serbia to Davis Cup victory over Croatia .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)Pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk have withdrawn all heavy weapons from the front lines in accordance with a recent peace deal, the rebel group Donetsk People's Republic said Saturday. On the other side, the Kiev-backed Donetsk regional authority said Ukrainian forces also withdrew all heavy weapons from the front lines in Donetsk, but added that in a 24-hour period from Friday to Saturday pro-Russian militants carried out 46 attacks, all of which were repelled, according to Col. Valentin Fedichev. A shaky ceasefire has been in place in Donetsk and the neighboring Luhansk region, the center of a months-long conflict between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces. The estimated number of people killed in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 now exceeds 6,000 ""in spite of successive ceasefires,"" the United Nations Human Rights Office said earlier this week. The escalation in fighting in recent weeks, particularly near the Donetsk airport and in the Debaltseve area, resulted in hundreds of deaths, both civilian and military, according to the United Nations report. The report paints a picture of ""merciless devastation of civilian lives and infrastructure,"" said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. He called for all sides to adhere to the peace deal, reached last month in Minsk, Belarus, which calls for a ceasefire in many of the conflict's hotspots. Victoria Butenko contributed from Kiev.

"(CNN)When Vladimir Putin reappears, he does it with style -- and an in-your-face attitude. The Russian President attended a large concert in Moscow's Red Square on Wednesday to commemorate the first anniversary of his country's annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, an act condemned by many in the international community as illegal. Only Putin doesn't call it annexation. He calls it reunification. According to the presidential website, Putin attended the ""We're Together!"" concert and meeting ""celebrating the first anniversary of Crimea and Sevastopol's reunification with Russia."" The peninsula became part of the Soviet Union in 1917, following the Russian Revolution. But in 1991, following the breakup of the Soviet Union, it became part of a newly independent Ukraine. On March 16, 2014, Crimea held a referendum on whether to continue as part of Ukraine or to cast its lot with the Russian Federation. The result was overwhelming, at least among those voting: 95% said they wanted to become part of Russia. A mere two days later, Russia annexed the territory. Putin said later that he had been planning the move even before the referendum was held. ""Friends!"" the President said in Red Square on Wednesday, according to his website, ""Exactly one year ago, Russia, which we are speaking of so much right now, and the Russian people showed amazing togetherness and patriotism in supporting the aspirations of the people of Crimea and Sevastopol to return to their native shores."" The issue, he said, was ""our history, our spirituality and our statehood, the things that make us a single people and single united nation."" Also participating, the website said, were ""popular Russian music groups and singers."" Putin was recently out of sight without explanation for 10 days, during which time various meetings were canceled. He reappeared only Monday. Lest anyone doubt he was still in charge, Putin, who prides himself on his fitness, has been displaying a different form of muscle this week -- the military kind. He mobilized Russia's entire Northern Fleet in a military exercise that reportedly ranks among the largest since the breakup of the Soviet Union. NATO reported that, on Tuesday, Estonian radar detected an unspecified number of aircraft over the Baltic Sea. NATO sent jets to identify the planes and later reported that ""the Russian military aircraft"" flew on into the airspace of the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.","Putin attends concert in Red Square to celebrate anniversary of Crimean annexation .

"London (CNN)An 18-year-old British man has been arrested on suspicion of preparing to join ISIS in Syria, UK police say. Counterterrorism officers arrested the man at his home in Hodge Hill, in the city of Birmingham, early Monday, West Midlands police said. ""The operation was pre-planned and intelligence led. There was no immediate threat to public safety,"" they said in a statement. The arrest follows that of three teenagers from northwest London on Sunday after they were intercepted by Turkish police in Istanbul. The two 17-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man were arrested ""on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts,"" the Metropolitan Police said. They have since been released on bail. The investigation started Friday, after police learned the two 17-year-olds were missing and were believed to be traveling to Syria. They were traveling with a 19-year-old, police said. British authorities shared intelligence regarding the 17-year-olds with Turkish officials Friday, and that night, they landed in Istanbul on a flight from Barcelona, Spain, a Turkish official told CNN. The teens were stopped with another person seen as suspicious by Turkish intelligence at the airport's risk analysis center, which monitors risky flights and runs checks on suspicious passengers trying to enter Turkey. Turkish authorities questioned the teens, the Turkish official said, and the Metropolitan Police said the three returned to London shortly before midnight Saturday and were arrested. Last week, Turkish authorities said they had arrested a  person -- working for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service -- on suspicion of helping three British girls who are thought to have entered Syria to join ISIS. British police say they think the three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- traveled to Syria after flying from London to Istanbul on February 17. Metropolitan Police on Monday announced a new media campaign to deter young people from traveling to Syria. Radio and press advertisements highlighting the influence a mother could have on her daughters would be placed in ethnic minority media, police said. The campaign said that it was mothers who often noticed changes in behavior that could signal an intention to travel to Syria, they said. There was increasing concern about the number of women traveling to Syria, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said. ""It is an extremely dangerous place, and the reality of the lifestyle they are greeted with when they arrive is far from that promoted online by terrorist groups,"" she said. ""The option of returning home is often taken away from them, leaving families at home devastated and with very few options to secure a safe return for their loved one,"" Ball said.","Metropolitan Police announce a media campaign to deter young people from traveling to Syria .

"(CNN)There have been a few times in my career when I've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace. No, I certainly don't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing ""Kumbaya"" together in the office, but I'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me wasn't, when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be, when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear, anxiety or what have you. I'd love to say more about each of the women I've met along the way who fit those descriptions, but my point is not to single anyone out. My goal is to ask the question, ""Why?"" Obviously, not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior, but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up? I figured this would be a perfect question for Sophia Nelson, author of a new self-help book for women called ""The Woman Code,"" and she didn't disappoint. Unlocking 'The Woman Code': 4 tips to know your value . ""From the time we're little girls, we're taught to compete,"" said Nelson during a recent conversation at CNN. ""I need to be prettier, taller, smarter, my hair needs to be straighter, curlier, whatever it is. I need to get the better looking guy. I need to always be better than because we're taught to come from a place of lack as women."" The way Nelson, an award-winning author and journalist, radio and television personality and motivational speaker, sees it, we women need to start operating like the boys. Men ""operate from a sense of, there's this whole pie, and I want my piece, and I don't care if he gets his piece, and maybe we even have to work together to start that business, start that company,"" said Nelson. Of course, it's easier for a man not to worry ""if he gets his piece"" since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate America, but that isn't the case for women. Today, just 5% of S&P 500 chief executives are women and only 14% of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women, according to a CNN Money analysis. Sheryl Sandberg teams up with NBA to get men to #LeanIn . Decades ago, the situation was even worse. When I was just starting my television news career in 1990, women who were in their 40s and were in high-level positions were the only women in a position of influence. Naturally, many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job. ""Because they didn't think there could be ten of them, they only thought there could be one of them,"" said Nelson. ""Fast forward 20 years later. Now there ... are a number of women partners at big firms, a number of women in Congress. I could keep going on and on so ... there is a place for more of us."" Which means we can lift as we climb, we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers, says Nelson. ""How exactly do we do that?"" I had to ask. Nelson came armed with five tips on how women can work with as opposed to against each other. First, Nelson says be mindful of the people you surround yourself with and careful about ""who's in your row."" ""If you hear another woman say, and I've heard this, 'I don't do women friends, I don't have women friends,' believe her and leave her alone. I mean that, listen to me now,"" said Nelson. There are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women, so don't invest any time, if possible, with people who don't, she says. If you are in a meeting and you have a great idea, don't feel like you have to hoard it to yourself, said Nelson. ""Collaborate, share, collaborate. ... So you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing."" Competition is healthy and we can compete, but we ought to take a page from our male colleagues' playbook, she said. ""The guys collaborate better than we do because they operate from a place of 'I want the dollars. I want to win the contract. I want to get the business.' We have to get in that same mindset."" We're all busy but we've got to slow down and mentor, said Nelson. ""We have to build a bench,"" she said. ""Men do this well again. You've seen it in corporate, I've seen it. The guys go out and golf. They do things together and they're building up the next young man leader. Whatever field we're in ... we're less likely to do it because we're busy. We've got to mentor."" When you lift other women as you climb, said Nelson, you realize it's reciprocal. ""It's not all about you."" We women win when more women are in executive roles in organizations, I added. ""The right women,"" said Nelson. ""I want to caveat that. And again, I don't mean to be mean or catty but ... I know a lot of women in power positions that don't help other women but there are a lot of women in power positions that do."" This is a tough one for us, says Nelson. We need to be willing to say to another woman that we didn't like something she did or said and do it in a respectful and private way where we are still building her up, not pulling her down. ""Don't go tell 10 of your friends not to like her. You'd be amazed at how silly we can be. We're still in kindergarten some of us,"" said Nelson. ""Gossip is still one of the most rampant, nasty things we do as women to each other. And it hurts. It really damages women.""

"(CNN)Entertainers are paid for entertaining and it's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the Olympics, says 100m hurdler Sally Pearson. In 2014,while the winner of Wimbledon received $2,600,000 and the Augusta Masters champion picked up $1,620,000, when Pearson won gold in the Olympics three years ago she received zero prize money. ""People come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them, we are entertainers"" the Australian, who set an Olympic record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012, told CNN anchor Alex Thomas. ""Entertainers get paid every single time they step up onto a stage, and that's exactly what we're doing in a sporting sense."" Billions might have tuned in to watch London's 2012 Olympic Games which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory, but the International Olympic Committee's current policy is to (IOC) hand out gold, silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes, but no financial remuneration. ""I can see why they don't, and I'm sure they want to keep it like that, they want to keep it pure,"" added Pearson. ""To be honest we're all still going to turn up whether we get paid or not. But the Games wouldn't happen without the athletes."" It also wouldn't happen without sponsors. The IOC has just signed a new eight-year sponsorship deal with car manufacturing giant Toyota -- reportedly worth just under $1 billion -- adding to their list of partners that include McDonald's and Coca-Cola. Athletes usually fund themselves through sponsorship deals, government support, grants and part-time work. In 2012 only half of American track and field athletes -- who were ranked in the top 10 in their nation -- earned more than $15,000 a year from their sport. The fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history, Pearson told the Australia's Daily Telegraph in 2013 how a year after her Olympic gold medal in London she still wasn't attracting enough sponsors. No stranger to hard work -- the hurdler sometimes vomits after intense training sessions -- she decided to chase down her own deals rather than sit on her hands waiting for private sponsorship. While she has some support from Qantas, AMP and Adidas, appearance fees and prize money in the Diamond League -- an annual series of track and field meetings -- also provides revenue earning potential for the 28-year-old. Now targeting more medal success at the  2016 Rio Olympics, Pearson achieved a resounding win at the Queensland Track Classic on March 7 with a time of 12.74s. Even so the issue of Olympic prize money still clearly grates. ""I think the times have changed from 1896 to 2016, I think it might be time to at least have a think about it, and discuss it because there's no such thing as the Olympics without athletics or athletes,"" said Pearson.","Olympic 100m gold medal winner Sally Pearson says IOC should think about paying athletes .

"(CNN)It's hardly news to state that air pollution is bad for people's health.  What might be more surprising to learn, though, is that air pollution is bad for the health of an unborn child, long before his or her lungs ever take their first breath. A growing body of research indicates that various forms of air pollution have a measurable impact on the health of babies, both in utero and after birth. We imagine the infant to be protected inside its mother's body, but pollutants can reach the baby the same way nutrients and medicine do.  Lead, mercury and particulate matter are among the types of air pollution we know can impact the health of infants before and after birth. Ozone, or smog, is the next candidate for addition to the list of air pollutants known to be harmful to fetal health. Over the past several years, a number of studies have indicated a likely link between higher levels of maternal ozone exposure and poor health outcomes in infants, including changes in lung structure and function, low birth weight and neuro-behavioral abnormalities. Many of these health effects can be expected to have lifelong consequences. These are deeply concerning results that require more investigation to understand fully. These studies add to a substantial amount of evidence showing the ill effects of ozone for people of all ages. Estimates place the toll in 2007 at 15,000 premature deaths related to ozone among individuals of all ages. Ozone also causes shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing, asthma attacks, increased risk of respiratory infections and increased need for people with lung diseases -- such as children with asthma -- to get medical treatment or be admitted to the hospital. How can a pregnant woman protect herself and her growing fetus from the harm caused by ozone? After all, ozone is usually invisible (except in certain cases, as smog) and high levels are undetectable to the average individual. Summertime air quality alerts may help in some cases, but some pregnant women cannot avoid exposure. In addition, studies confirm that these daily pollution alerts are inadequate to protect our health because they are based on the present federal ozone standard, which does not include evidence from current, critical health science. In other words, the alerts sometimes fail to accurately indicate when the air is dangerous to breathe. Thinking that it's safe to work or play outside when ozone pollution levels trigger a yellow air quality alert (indicating a ""moderate"" level for ozone pollution) can significantly threaten the health of many vulnerable individuals. In order to truly protect our children, we need strong, national standards limiting ozone. Ozone forms in the air from emissions from a number of sources, but the biggest culprits are cars, trucks and other motor vehicles, as well as power plants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed new ozone standards in November that would bring limits in line with the science.  EPA is accepting comments from the public on the standard until Tuesday, March 17, and both of our organizations have expressed support. An updated standard would help ensure we have access to accurate information about the air we breathe, and help drive reductions in ozone pollution to protect the health of all Americans. ​Strengthening the ozone standard to reflect the best current science will help save lives and protect our families, including pregnant women and their babies.","EPA has proposed stricter ozone standards .

"(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent speech to the U.S. Congress has received disproportionate media attention across the world: the leader of America's most important client state in the Middle East defies the reservations of the White House, abusing Congress as a platform for his Israeli election campaign. Disregarding Israel's already strained bilateral relations with the United States, Netanyahu readily risked the consequences of humiliating the Obama administration in exchange for less than an hour of political self-manifestation -- typical for a man who is domestically known to be not much of a statesman. Netanyahu is a charismatic speaker and a passionate Israel-advocate, however, his personal and political interests have always taken precedence over serving Israel's national interests. Political survival has been the maxim of his domestic and foreign policies. Netanyahu joins a long list of Israeli politicians overwhelmed by the plurality and polarization of domestic public opinion. So far he has been just another Israeli leader seeking ""easy"" short-term answers to fundamentally strategic problems, thereby further protracting an already protracted conflict. As a puppet of ideological, conservative playmakers who whole-heartedly reject a two-state solution, Netanyahu has been held hostage by the likes of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Economy Minister Naftali Bennett who pursue a discriminatory policy of sectarian segregation intending to contain Palestinian public dissidence through mere coercion. Consequently, Netanyahu's foreign policy vis-à-vis the peace process has been a disaster. He took over from Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni -- two politicians who at least believed in a two-state solution and were ready to make sacrifices to keep the peace process alive. Israeli leaders typically fall into two categories: those who believe in peace and those that have the power to make peace. Olmert was the former, and Netanyahu long seemed like he could become the latter. In reality, however, Netanyahu is neither. He has given in to a toxic form of Jewish nationalism, disregarded Israel's relatively good regional position vis-à-vis its otherwise-occupied Arab neighbors; he has continued to build settlements out of spite, thought of ever new preconditions for bilateral negotiations with the Palestinians and waged a ruthless war against Gaza without a clear strategic endgame -- a war that was lost militarily and in terms of international reputation. Apart from the tragic effects of Netanyahu's policy on the peace process, his stubbornness has alienated allies in Europe and Washington. While the Arab world has been widely apathetic about the Israel-Palestinian issue amid regional disintegration, partners on both sides of the Atlantic have tried to facilitate the revitalization of constructive peace talks. Yet, Netanyahu chose to ignore external initiatives, retracting to a Jewish nationalist rhetoric founded on security paranoia, self-victimization and the illusion of Israeli autarky in security and defense. As a consequence, Israel's foreign relations with its most important strategic partners have noticeably cooled. Obama's Middle Eastern focus has shifted from the Israel/Palestinian issue to a rapprochement with Iran.  European lawmakers are considering recognizing Palestinian statehood despite Israeli objections. More importantly, many traditionally pro-Israel Western publics have turned their back on the Jewish state. Younger generations in particular refuse to accept the narrative that shaped their parental generation: Israel as the David in a fight against Goliath. Israel's monopoly on victimhood has been undermined by an inflexible, uncompromising short-minded policy towards a Palestinian people under occupation whose narrative of victimhood increasingly finds attentive ears in the West. At first sight, then, the prospect of four more years of Netanyahu, does not sound too promising -- at least in regards to the peace process. At a closer look, however, a continuation of Netanyahu's policies might actually help the Palestinian cause. His implicit rejection of the two-state solution; his prioritization of short-term security over sustainable security solutions; his pursuit of a toxic Jewish nationalist agenda justifying an intensification of sectarianism between Israel and the Occupied Territories as well as within Israel, are all factors that will leave Israel increasingly isolated. His Israel-first narrative might win Netanyahu votes within a highly polarized electorate that in recent years has become more and more right-wing amid a top-down constructed climate of fear. Hamas' and Hezbollah's mid-tech missile capability, Syria's socio-political disintegration and subsequent rise of Islamist non-state actors, have been used by the Netanyahu government to create an Arab bogyman ostensibly threatening the Jewish state's very existence -- a new bogyman coexisting side-by-side with Netanyahu's ""favorite"" bogeyman, Iran. Despite Netanyahu's pre-occupation with security, the derailment of the peace process has not been much of a topic during the campaign so far. If Netanyahu receives another mandate on Tuesday, Israel will be further driven into the international offside, pressure from the West will increase and thereby the Palestinian cause will receive ever more attention and support from policymakers and publics across the world. Netanyahu has become somewhat of a villain in the West -- an untrustworthy, short-sighted politician who in comparison to his counterparts in Ramallah appears to lack the willingness to compromise, cooperate and empathize. Thus, while another term of Bibi will not be in the national interest of Israel, it will very likely serve the Palestinian interests.","Political survival has been maxim of Netanyahu's domestic and foreign policies, says Andreas Krieg .

"(CNN)What's your company doing this year for March Madness?  If your workplace is like most, the answer is a big fat nothing. Instead of leveraging the NCAA's annual tournament and turning it into a genuine bonding experience between colleagues, most organizations pretend it isn't happening. On the surface, ignoring a sporting event that takes place during regular work hours might appear like sound business practice. After all, companies need to generate profit, and it's hard to generate profit when your employees are huddled around a television, right? Wrong. What this perspective overlooks is that productivity isn't simply a function of how many hours we spend at the office. It also depends on the quality of our workplace experience. And one critical feature of that experience is how closely connected we feel to our colleagues. Research has consistently demonstrated that we are more effective at our jobs when we feel attached to the people around us. How do strong colleague relationships elevate our performance? For one thing, they make us more motivated. When you and your colleagues are close, failing to perform your duties generates more than a dissatisfied customer or an unhappy manager -- it means letting down your friends. The social pressure to achieve results can serve as a stronger motivator than anything a boss can say. Closer connections also foster a sense of trust and more candid dialogue. Studies comparing the collaboration patterns of friends to mere acquaintances indicate that friends are more willing to ask for help and more comfortable speaking up when a colleague is off on the wrong track. Performance aside, workplace friendships benefit organizations for another reason: Employees with richer friendships tend to stay on with their company for longer periods of time. Despite these considerable benefits, at most companies, friendships are an afterthought. To motivate employees, managers tend to rely on bonuses, promotions, and salary increases, ignoring the fact that as humans, we all have a basic psychological need for meaningful relationships. Yet the research is clear: When we feel valued and respected by those around us, we're not only more motivated -- we're also happier, healthier, and more productive. For too many organizations, investing in quality employee relationships means one thing: team-building exercises. Think ice breakers, trust falls and scavenger hunts. Every year, corporations spend millions on off-site retreats and weekend getaways packed with cringeworthy activities that purportedly foster better communication. But here's the truth: While awkward collaborations may spark brief experiences of closeness, they rarely translate into lasting friendships. So what does? Studies suggest three factors are essential to the development of authentic, meaningful friendships: familiarity (being around the same colleague often), similarity (finding commonalities in your background), and self-disclosure (revealing personal information about yourself every now and then, and having your co-worker do the same). Few activities include all three of these elements. This explains why close relationships usually take years to develop. But interestingly, office game-viewing parties come close. They present opportunities for colleagues to mingle with those from other departments and connect over shared interests. For many, the NCAA basketball tournament is associated with their experience at college, which leads them to share stories about their past, prompting co-workers to do the same. Unlike team-building experiences that compel employees to engage with one another, game-viewing parties position people to connect voluntarily. And that feature can make all the difference. In recent years, a number of forward-thinking workplaces have begun leveraging March Madness in intelligent ways. Ogilvy & Mather, for example, an international marketing agency based in New York, invites employees to watch tournament games on projection screens in conference rooms and the office cafeteria. To address the fact that not everyone has the time to follow college basketball, a Virginia financial services firm called The Motley Fool offers a free ""Bracketology"" class, where nonenthusiasts can get caught up on this year's favorites and collect advice before filling out their brackets. A number of organizations, including office furniture manufacturer Turnstone, even serve game-day snacks, such as pizza, popcorn, and chicken wings, to simulate the viewing experience of a sports bar, minus the alcohol. In addition to organizing a vibrant workplace gathering, there are also opportunities for making better use of the office tournament pool. Here's one idea: Instead of having employees pay an entry fee (which discourages nonfans from joining in), sponsor prizes so that everyone participates. Then, go beyond recognizing individual contestants and reward the team or department with the highest average score. This way, employees have reason to root for one another, fostering a sense of collaboration. Another approach worth considering: using the office pool as a motivational tool. Some years ago, NetTel Partners, a sales organization in Philadelphia, launched a competition among its salespeople in the weeks before the NCAA tournament. The more appointments a salesperson secured with potential clients, the sooner he or she could select a team in the office draft. The results were astonishing. Total cost to NetTel for furnishing prizes: $300, plus the price of a personalized basketball jersey. Total impact on the business: a 35% jump in appointments, not to mention a boost in office morale. As the NCAA tournament tips off this month, organizational leaders would be wise to re-examine their approach to March Madness. Instead of treating the tournament as a nuisance that prevents employees from working, perhaps it's time we considered embracing it for what it is: an inexpensive opportunity for bringing our work teams closer together. Without the trust falls.","Friedman: Companies should encourage their employees to bond over NCAA tournament games .

"(CNN)The sounds recorded on one of the ""black boxes"" recovered from downed Germanwings Flight 9525 firms up investigators' theory that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane. ""For God's sake, open the door!"" Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door, pleading with the co-pilot. Thirteen minutes later, the plane slammed into the French Alps. The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published Sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording. CNN translated Bild's report --  which the newspaper says is based on the 1.5 hours of audio that was on  the cockpit voice recorder -- but cannot independently verify the information. France's accident investigation agency, BEA, told CNN that the agency is ""dismayed"" by the voice recording leak to Bild. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the leak could not have come from a BEA agent. She said the agency considers the report mere ""voyeurism."" According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Andreas Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz tells him he can go anytime. Lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot of Flight 9525 out of the cockpit before putting the plane on a rapid descent into the mountains, French authorities have said. The flight took off 20 minutes late. After reaching cruising altitude, Sondenheimer asked Lubitz to prepare the landing. Once that's finished, Lubitz again tells the captain he ""can go anytime."" There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, ""You can take over."" At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend. Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the ""sink rate,"" Bild reported. Next comes the banging. Sondenheimer begs Lubitz to let him in. Passengers then begin to scream, according to the transcript obtained by Bild. Another three minutes pass. A loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters (almost 23,000 feet). A minute and half later and 2,000 meters (about 6,500 feet) lower to the ground, an alarm says ""Terrain -- pull up!"" ""Open the damn door!"" the pilot says. It's 10:38, and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. Screams can be heard one final time. Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. Quest called it ""unbelievable"" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, said on Saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point. But French authorities have said that Lubitz appeared to have crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately into the Alps on Tuesday as it flew from Barcelona, Spain, toward Dusseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind since then, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. The official also said that the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, ""concerning a diagnosis."" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment. The note, which was ""slashed,"" said Lubitz was not able to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The fact that investigators found ""ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,"" prosecutors said. Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. A handful of publications, citing unnamed sources, have reported that Lubitz suffered from various psychological maladies. CNN has not been able to confirm these reports. Lubitz suffered from ""generalized anxiety disorder,"" and from severe depression in the past, Le Parisien newspaper reported Sunday, citing sources close to the investigation. In 2010, Lubitz received injections of antipsychotic medication, the paper said. He was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters, but it's unclear when that happened, according to Le Parisien. The newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes, which forbade him from working from March 16 to March 29. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A subsequent report from the Times on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk.  However, an official with Lufthansa, said that if Lubitz had vision problems, they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination. Authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been psychosomatic, according to the Times. Citing an unidentified senior investigator, German newspaper Die Welt said that Lubitz suffered from a severe ""psychosomatic illness"" and that German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a ""severe subjective burnout syndrome"" and from severe depression, the source told the newspaper. News reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. Investigators are expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside. Lubitz had a girlfriend, a teacher at a school in Dusseldorf not far from his apartment, according to German media. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony Saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains, France. Most of the people on the plane were from Germany and Spain. Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. The mayor of one local community said he had seen Lubitz's father on Thursday evening, describing him as ""a man in deep distress."" ""We get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders,"" Bernard Bartolini, the mayor of Prads-Haute-Bleone, said Saturday. ""I can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken,"" Bartolini said. ""He had so much emotion in him."" CNN's Steve Almasy, Laura Smith-Spark, Frederik Pleitgen, Sandrine Amiel, Jethro Mullen, Lynn Franco, Margot Haddad and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","France's accident investigation agency, BEA, ""dismayed"" by the voice recording leak .

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton is pressing the reset button -- yet again. She's quietly fighting back a week after her awkward and occasionally combative news conference on the furor over the private email server she used while running the State Department. Clinton's Twitter account is buzzing this week with posts that test political messages on health care, college affordability, civil rights and jobs -- issues she hopes will help mobilize President Barack Obama's Democratic coalition and pave her way to the presidency. Meanwhile, her nascent operation is leaking details of future staffers in an unmistakeable message to Democrats spooked by the email flap that the campaign-in-waiting will become an official effort, possibly as soon as next month. A CNN/ORC International Poll out on Wednesday found that she's miles ahead of any potential Democratic challenger and would beat all potential Republican candidates by at least 10 points. Despite fretting among some Democrats who worried that the party's best -- and perhaps only -- viable Democratic candidate appeared to be in trouble, early signs suggest Clinton is doing what the Clintons do best: mounting a comeback. ""The interest in the story is collapsing onto itself. I don't see an organic clamoring for more information,"" said a longtime Clinton ally who didn't want to speak for a campaign that hasn't yet been announced. This person, who has spent time in Iowa, argued that outside the community of political reporters and consultants in Washington and New York who fixated on the story, the people who really count -- voters -- weren't really interested. ""People very much want to know what the campaign is going to be about ... what is she going to do about student loan costs, for example?"" Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist who was Southern regional director of Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, agreed. ""If and when Hillary Clinton decides to run, she will have to address this issue, but I believe the American people are more interested in her addressing the kitchen table issues that matter most to them,"" he said. Of course, Clinton still faces plenty of challenges and the email saga raised questions about whether she can run a more sophisticated, no drama campaign than the one she managed in 2008. But the CNN poll revealed that those critical of Clinton's role in the email affair appear to break close to party lines and her favorable rating remains at 53%. A slow recent decline in that rating appears to coincide with Clinton's slow re-entry into partisan politics and does not necessarily reflect her recent stumbles. Perhaps the most intriguing figure in the poll is that only 1% of respondents had never heard of Clinton. That supports the idea expressed by some Democrats that Clinton may be the most vetted figure in public life. There are people who will never vote for her and those who are dedicated to her quest to be the first female president, but very few whose minds may not be made up. A less well-known candidate might have made a terrible first impression if faced with the kind of hyper-covered flap Clinton was. But Republicans believe the email scandal could be a political gift that keeps on giving, as it touches on a narrative that the Clintons are secretive, resistant to transparency and often blur the rules. There are also other problems -- including the question of foreign funds sent to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's whopper speaking fees -- that Republicans believe could reach a political mass and fan doubts about the likely Democratic nominee's character. Then there are the foreign policy questions, including a now damaging photo op in which Clinton offered a ""reset"" button to Russia only for the country to revert to a Cold War-esque posture. She was also a central player in Obama's foreign policy, which often appears to be overtaken by the Middle East's swift descent into chaos. ""For everything that I can see, the Democrats have put all of their eggs in one basket here,"" said Sean Spicer, communications director of the Republican National Committee. ""That is more of a downfall in the general election than in the primary."" Spicer argued that even with younger voters, who do not remember the Clinton years, the question of impropriety over her emails could provide an entry point into past scandals. Though Clinton is the prohibitive Democratic front-runner, her support in the party is not universal. But where she faces resistance, it is more likely to be over policy than emails, as grass-roots Democrats are suspicious over her centrist, pro-business and hawkish foreign policy leanings. ""As this discussion was playing out inside the Beltway, our members were focused on issues,"" said Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org, which wants Elizabeth Warren to challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Galland said activists were preoccupied with the preservation of the social safety net, constraining Wall Street and those on the ""ragged edge"" of the middle class. Similarly, the young voters who flocked to Obama in 2008 and who will be crucial to Clinton's hopes of mobilizing an effective Democratic coalition in 2016 may also offer Clinton a political cushion. This group is hazy over historic references to long ago Clinton scandals like Filegate, Travelgate and even the Monica Lewinsky episode that led to President Bill Clinton's impeachment. ""The media loves a Clinton scandal,"" said one Democratic source who didn't want to be named because he doesn't work for Clinton. ""But young people are more likely to know her as secretary of state, and someone who ran for president in 2008."" Polling bears out the theory. The CNN survey shows Clinton's favorability among voters age 18 to 34 with a 22 point positive differential. But she's barely in positive territory among voters age 50 to 64, who are likely to have strong memories of her time as first lady, and is  underwater among those 60 or older. Another well-connected Democrat who didn't want to go on the record criticizing Clinton admitted that the email issue did play into GOP caricatures about the allegedly ""conspiratorial"" politicians and that it could challenge the former secretary of state's early efforts to get her message out about her ideas and rationale for running for president. But Democratic operatives think that once Clinton is actually running, with an infrastructure behind her, and striking messages about the minimum wage, college debt and middle-class economic issues, voters will engage. In many ways, the email furor was a story the media couldn't wait to write, so it may be that journalists have inflated the importance of the episode, at least in the absence of any evidence that Clinton broke the law or made classified information vulnerable. Political reporters have pined for weeks for Clinton to swing her campaign into action, and her failure to offer a storyline opened a vacuum that was easy for unflattering stories to fill. Her slow response breathed new life into a question that only Clinton can answer: Will her 2016 campaign be as dysfunctional, reactive and distracted as her chaotic and unsuccessful 2008 effort? But there were a few lessons. It's clear the Clinton machine is not about to morph into a humming, scandal-free effort in the image of Barack Obama's first presidential campaign. And Clinton's bitter relationship with political reporters seems as bad as ever. The days when she partied with a State Department press corps more preoccupied with policy than politics seem like ancient history. But here also, Clinton is trying a reset. Her nascent campaign has made it known that she is staffing up her campaign and press operation. John Podesta, who is expected to take a leadership role in her campaign, is respected by reporters, as is Jennifer Palmieri, the outgoing White House communications director expected to take on a similar role for Clinton. On Tuesday, it emerged that Clinton would name Brian Fallon, who has also good ties with reporters, to be lead press secretary.","Hillary Clinton fights to put furor over a private email server behind her .

"(CNN)NASA astronaut Scott Kelly has started a trip to the record books. He plans to spend 342 days on the International Space Station -- the longest stretch of time any U.S. astronaut has spent in space. Kelly lifted off Friday aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that launched from Kazakhstan. The rocket docked at the ISS at 9:33 p.m. ET, according to a tweet from NASA, with hatches between the Soyuz and the space station scheduled to open about 11:15 p.m. ET. Kelly will stay twice as long as any U.S. astronaut has ever stayed on the space station, giving scientists a chance to study how the human body responds to long-duration space flights. On Earth, scientists will perform parallel studies on Scott Kelly's identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly. ""It's a lot of fun,"" Kelly said at a media briefing in January. ""Space station is a magical place."" Two cosmonauts are riding up with Kelly: Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka. Kornienko also will stay up for a year. Padalka will only stay up for six months. The trio will join three crew members already on the space station: U.S. astronaut Terry Virts, Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov and Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. Other crew members also will rotate in and out during their year in orbit so it will never be just Kelly and Kornienko on the station. Kelly, 51, hopes to break the record for the longest mission on the space station set by NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin. They spent over seven months on the ISS -- from September 18, 2006, to April 21, 2007. He is expected to spend 342 days off the planet on this mission. When added to his previous space missions, that would give him a total of 522 days in space, breaking the record of U.S. astronaut Mike Fincke. Fincke spent a combined 381 days, 15 hours and 11 minutes in space, according to his official NASA bio. While Kelly shoots to set space station and other U.S. records, Padalka is on schedule to set a record for the most total time in space for a human. He's already spent more than 710 days in space, including stays on Russia's Mir space station and three previous stints on the International Space Station. Why do it? Why stay up on the station so long? NASA wants to know more about the impact of long-duration spaceflights on the human body to help plan missions to Mars and deeper into space. And the space station, in orbit 250 miles above Earth, is the best place available to study that. Spending that much time in a weightless environment will take a toll. NASA says space station astronauts have vision changes, bone loss, muscle atrophy and other problems. NASA says the experiments should have benefits on Earth, such as helping patients recover from long periods of bed rest to improved monitoring of people whose bodies are unable to fight infections. The space station has about the same living space as a six-bedroom, two bathroom house. And it has a 360-degree bay window with a great view. But astronauts and cosmonauts still report feeling isolated and confined at times. Kelly will document his feelings about being away from his two children and the rest of his family. ""I'm going to keep a personal journal of the experience,"" Kelly said. He also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long-term space flight. Will he tell all? ""I plan to be completely honest about it,"" he said, but ... ""who knows, maybe there are some crazy thoughts I'll have at the end that I wouldn't want to share."" Mark Kelly has volunteered for NASA's ""Twins Study"" to see how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments. He is the husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who left office after being wounded in a January 2011 assassination attempt. ""He thinks it's great that he can still be a participant in this,"" Scott Kelly said. So Mark will be on Earth getting poked and prodded by researchers -- while Scott makes history in orbit. Final candidates announced for one-way trip to Mars .","Scott Kelly aims to set a record for longest stay on the International Space Station .

"(CNN)Roberto Mancini says he carries Manchester City's supporters in his heart -- but there's not much love being shown towards the man who replaced him as manager of the Premier League champions. Manuel Pellegrini is a man feeling the heat -- and the current City manager has come under fire from his predecessor just 24 hours after insisting he is not under pressure to win a trophy every season. Mancini, the man who led Manchester City to its first Premier League title in 44 years back in 2012 says Pellegrini is ""lucky"" to have inherited the side he left behind after being sacked exactly a year to the day since winning England's top division. Pellegrini, who led City to the domestic title last season, is under fire with City trailing Chelsea by six points in the league and facing elimination in the European Champions League. ""I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players,"" Inter Milan coach Mancini told CNN's Don Riddell on the eve of City's crucial game with Barcelona in the Champions League. ""I think City can win a title every year and have a chance -- it should and must try to win a title every year."" Nicknamed ""the Engineer,"" Pellegrini has seen the wheels come off his side's title charge in recent weeks. The Chilean is reportedly on the brink with his team having apparently surrendered its Premier League title with another meek showing in the 1-0 defeat by minnow Burnley last weekend. His team have managed just three victories in their past 11 games -- its season could be more or less over by tomorrow night. City faces a daunting task to reach the last eight of the European Champions League -- a competition it has struggled in despite spending $482 million on players since the start of the 2011-12 season. It must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday after being outplayed for the majority of the home fixture. Only once in nine attempts has Barcelona won the first leg of a two-legged Champions League knockout tie and not progressed. Pellegrini has spent heavily since arriving at City but a number of those purchases have failed to impress. Eliaquim Mangala, who arrived from Porto for $47million has endured a dismal first season in English football, while $32million man Stevan Jovetic has also struggled to make an impression since arriving from Fiorentina. ""It's my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League,"" said Mancini. ""It's in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it's the best team. ""In the Premier League anything can happen right up to the last game, in the last minute,"" perhaps a nod to City's last gasp English Premier League title win in 2012, thanks to Sergio Aguero's stoppage time winner against Queens Park Rangers. ""I think they should think that they have a chance to win the title."" Mancini, who replaced Mark Hughes in December 2009, enjoyed great success during his three-and-half-year tenure. He led the club to the FA Cup in 2011 before winning the league title the following season. Under Mancini, the club attracted star players such as Yaya Toure, Mario Balotelli, David Silva and Aguero. He signed a new five-year deal with the club in July 2012 but results dipped with rival Manchester United regaining the league title and City suffering a shock FA Cup final defeat by Wigan. Mancini was criticised for his side's lack of success in the Champions League, where the failure to negotiate the group stage playing a key role in the decision to relieve him of his duties. The Italian, 50, was also involved in a series of high-profile disagreements with Carlos Tevez, the Argentina striker, which cast doubts over his ability to handle the big names in the City squad. In the 12 Champions League ties under his stewardship, City managed just three victories -- a damning indictment on the team's failure on the European stage. At the time of his sacking, the club said that Mancini failed to hit ""stated targets"" and that it wanted to ""develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football"". ""I had a fantastic time in England,"" he added. ""We won the Premier League after many years. I have all City's supporters in my heart and all those moments in my head because it is impossible to forget this. ""Maybe I miss the Premier League because I worked there for three-and-a-half years. I built the team that is now in second position. ""I think they play with the same players and I am very proud of this."" Mancini faces a struggle of his own at Inter with the club unlikely to qualify for European competition next season. Inter is eighth in Serie A and is eight points off the qualifying places for the Europa League. It faces German side Wolfsburg in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday having lost the first leg 3-1.","Roberto Mancini says Manchester City still the best team in the Premier League .

"(CNN)The desert and dun-colored cliffs around the town of Tataouine were once the backdrop for the movie ""Star Wars,"" much of which was filmed in this neglected corner of Tunisia in 1976. This struggling town on the fringes of the Sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict, as a way-station for jihadists crossing the Libyan border 60 miles to the east. Earlier this month, before the gun attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis, three young men were arrested here as they allegedly made plans to cross into Libya to join a terrorist network. A local official told CNN they had since been taken to Tunis for questioning. Two arms caches have also been found in the region this month, one of which included rocket-propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, thought to have been removed from a Libyan armory in the aftermath of Moammar Gadhafi's ouster in 2011. Driving near the border, it's quickly obvious why the Tunisian government is so anxious about Libya's implosion and the emergence there of an ISIS affiliate whose tentacles stretch half-way across the country. This open space is vast and sparsely populated. Smugglers' tracks criss-cross the endless scrub and steep, arid hills that run along the border. Gasoline, drugs and other contraband have long been smuggled across the frontier. Near the town of Remada, south of Tataouine, a couple of soldiers manned a checkpoint. They wore protective jackets -- whether for show or because of the perceived threat from Islamist militants, it's hard to know. When we arrived, passports were requested and phone calls made. We were escorted into the town and politely but firmly told we could go no further without written authorization. Exactly four years ago we had passed through Remada unchallenged. Tunisians had just launched the Arab Spring. There was a mood of heady optimism and the security apparatus of the Ben Ali regime had melted away. But already Libya was falling apart, as different groups of rebels fought to oust Gadhafi. Thousands of foreign workers were then trying to escape the violence through the few official border crossings. Now Libya's descent into chaos means those crossings are sometimes closed, and it's foreign fighters using the smugglers' trails that Tunisia must worry about. At the national guard building in Remada the officer in charge -- a burly figure in his mid-40s - was wearing a ""New York 1999"" sweatshirt and appeared to be one of many plainclothes security personnel in the town. He was happy to talk but didn't want his name reported. Ignoring calls on his cell phone, he lamented the state of the Arab world and the expansion of Daesh, as ISIS is frequently called. Look at Iraq, Syria, Libya....of course Tunisia is threatened, he said. The Tunisians are doing what they can, he said. There is now a 1.8-mile no-go zone inside the border, and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles. The security presence has been boosted seven- to ten-fold, but even so there weren't enough men or equipment. The border, after all, is 380 miles long. A much wider buffer zone -- 12 miles deep -- has also been created, which people can only enter with permission. This has not gone down well with local herders whose goats and sheep live off the desert scrub. Other measures taken by the Tunisian authorities, according to the official in Remada, include a ban on men aged 18-35 from going to Libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there. Another source said the ban applied to men under 30. Even so the two gunmen who stormed into the Bardo Museum last week -- both of them in their twenties -- had been able to cross illicitly into Libya in December, according to Tunisian State Security Minister Rafik Chelly. Chelly told a Tunisian network that the pair had received weapons training in the ISIS stronghold of Derna. The mood among many Tunisians seems much harder and more pragmatic than it was four years ago. A shopkeeper in a small village between Tataouine and Remada said there needs to be a security crackdown. He said people in the area led simple lives -- but they knew each other and noticed strangers. Bassim, a taxi driver on the island of Djerba, some 60 miles to the north of Tataouine, was of a similar view. ""The people need to be the third eye of the security forces"" he said. ""And we need to think of the safety of visitors like we think of the safety of our families."" Bassim and hundreds of thousands of other Tunisians have reason to be worried. They rely on tourism to make a living, and fear that ISIS will -- as it has threatened -- launch further attacks against foreigners visiting Libya. Bassim ferries tourists around Djerba, whose luxury hotels and beaches are a popular destination for French and German tourists. It took the tourist industry years to recover from a terror attack on a synagogue on the island in 2002 in which 21 people were killed. Bassim says he's heard all too many horror stories about events in Libya from the oil workers he took to Djerba's airport. Others, mainly in the capital Tunis, are apprehensive that the democratic gains of four years ago may be eroded or lost in a new security clampdown. They point to new anti-terrorism legislation that strengthens detention powers and the right of the authorities to monitor suspects' phones and social media. The measure was being discussed in parliament Wednesday when the attack was launched on the adjacent museum. Tunisians say their country is at a crossroads as it tries to fend off the jihadist contagion seeping across North Africa. Their democracy is young and vulnerable. ""We want to be the hope of the Arab world,"" said Bassim, ""like we were four years ago."" ""We still have hope, but now we have fear too.""","Tataouine, near ""Star Wars"" set, lies just 60 miles from the Libyan border .

"(CNN)December 16, 2014 was a dark day, not just in our nation's history, but the world's. Young innocent children were brutally massacred in a school in Peshawar along with their teachers. It shook a nation that had already seen more than 55,000 of its innocent civilians die in the hands of terrorism in the last 10 years, to a whole new level. Naturally, I was in no less despair. Hailing from a humble background, where both my parents have served in the field of education their entire lives, the strong emphasis on education in our house was probably another reason why this incident had affected me so deeply. READ MORE: Bloodstains, bullet holes mark Peshawar classrooms . I canceled my tours and concerts and couldn't gather myself to do much in coming weeks. However, being an artist, I had to express myself; even more so because I have always believed that an artist should be more than a tool for his art to resonate through. He must also resonate the voice of his surroundings by being socially aware and strive to contribute to his environment for the better in whatever little or large manner that he decides for himself. I thought that each one of us needed to wake up to this call and help and inspire the other to do more for our future. So I picked up the phone and started calling all my colleagues from film, fashion, TV and music. I was pleasantly surprised that all of them agreed with my initiative and came on board without a second thought on such a short notice. We all got together because we all want a progressive, peaceful, tolerant and positive Pakistan. And the response to the song and video further solidified my belief that every Pakistani wants the same. They just need someone to show them the way. And to me, education is the way forward. It's the the key to progress and peace. I also feel that there is a lot more to Pakistan than what the world gets to see. Pakistan is a beautiful land with beautiful people who -- like those in any other nation -- want to live in harmony with themselves and the world. A place where people sing, dance and play. Unfortunately because of an extremist minority, it is sometimes seen as an extremist country. But no society is void of extremism in one way or the other. This is something that we all need to work towards -- the international community and us. Pakistan needs your help. It has been fighting this battle for years and lost countless lives in the process. Its economy has also suffered. The world needs to see Pakistan in a whole different light to help us out of this darkness. They need to partner with us towards progress. They need to understand the complexities of this society and the fact that it's not easy to survive through all that this country has been through. Today the entire nation stands as one for this cause. And that is what I have tried to show the world in this video. A Pakistan that stands united to make sure that the lives of those innocent children did not go to waste. I also didn't want this to be just a song. I wanted to practically help towards a cause dear to me -- education. So, I collaborated with a leading Pakistani educational non-profit organization, The Citizens Foundation (TCF) and 141schools.org (141 SCHOOLS), a new citizen web movement. Together, they are building 141 schools across Pakistan. Each school will be dedicated to the children and teachers who lost their lives in attack on December 16, 2014. All proceeds from the downloads of the song will go towards building schools for the children of Pakistan and ensuring a bright future. I aspire to build at least one school which would cost around 20.7 million pkr ($202,900).

"(CNN)In the midst of all the shouting over Indiana's new religious-freedom law, which many fear will lead to increased discrimination against LGBT people, culture warriors marked the grim anniversary of another conservative ""victory,"" one that left more than 10,000 needy children without their pledged financial support. A year ago this week, I rose each morning with red, puffy eyes and heavy sense of exhaustion. I hadn't slept soundly since March 26, a day many of my friends and readers mark as the last day they wanted anything to do with organized Christianity. It all started when World Vision, a humanitarian organization I had long supported and promoted, announced a change to its hiring policy allowing people in same-sex marriages to work in its U.S. offices. In response, conservative evangelicals rallied, and within 72 hours, more than 10,000 children had lost their financial support from canceled World Vision sponsorships. Ten-thousand children. In addition, funding for schools, hospitals, water projects, and medical care was threatened as churches vowed to cut off support to an organization that hired LGBT people. As one of my readers, Anthony, recalls, ""Our church leadership vowed that they would pull all support, including over $2 million to build two hospitals in Zambia."" To try and stem some of the bleeding, I joined with other World Vision bloggers to encourage my readers to sponsor children or make one-time donations to the organization. We had raised several thousand dollars and multiple sponsorships -- many coming from gay and lesbian couples -- when the CEO of World Vision announced the charity would reverse its decision and return to its old policies discriminating against gay and lesbian employees. It had worked.  Using wells and hospitals and child sponsorships as bargaining chips in the culture wars had actually worked. Never in my life had I been so angry at my own faith tradition. Many conservative evangelicals count the World Vision reversal as a major victory in the culture wars. Eric Teetsel, director of the Manhattan Declaration, told Christianity Today he considered it ""the best news of 2014"" for evangelical Christians. ""This was Christianity at its best,"" he said. But as I survey the battlefield a year later, I can't help but wonder if even the most strident culture warriors would consider the World Vision campaign worth its many casualties. There are, of course, the families around the world affected by the sudden drying up of funds meant to support their hospitals and schools, not to mention the kids who used to receive letters and gifts from their sponsors, but whose pictures were casually ripped from the refrigerator and tossed into the garbage can once they were deemed expendable collateral in an American political battle. Then there are the many gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, (especially LGBT Christians caught in the middle), for whom the campaign represented yet another blow to their humanity.  I remember a gay friend of mine telling me, through tears, ""Christians don't even think I'm worthy of answering phones in the office of a humanitarian organization. What makes them think I would be welcome in their churches?"" And then there are the many Christians and former Christians for whom the World Vision campaign was the final straw in a drawn-out disillusionment with organized religion. When I marked the anniversary with a Facebook status on the topic, I was surprised by how many of my readers marked March 26 as the day they left the church. ""I don't think I can ever get over this,"" wrote Kelly. ""Changed my views on evangelicalism and my faith forever."" Anthony, who once taught Sunday school at his church, only rarely attends now. This is the tragic irony of the culture wars: The casualties tend to be the very people Jesus went out of his way to serve: the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the outcasts, the people ostracized and deemed ""sinners"" by the religious elite. And when the world sees Christians hurting rather than helping such people, in the name of political gain, our testimony is profoundly diminished. We have lost the way of Jesus when we are more committed to self-preservation than service, more occupied with waging war than washing feet. In all likelihood, Indiana's religious-freedom law will not directly affect many people. But the conversation that has surrounded it, in which discrimination against LGBT people has been characterized as a ""deeply held religious belief,"" will have far more lasting effects, not unlike the effects of the campaign against World Vision. So to the culture warriors, I plead: Before you wage the next campaign, assess the potential collateral damage and ask yourself if it's worth it. Remember that the fruit of the Spirit is not power or might, influence or entitlement. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control, and  ""against such things, there is no law"" (Galatians 5:23). And to the wounded, I offer only this: You are not alone. Please know there are field medics -- pastors and priests, artists and activists, poets and parents and healers and dreamers -- ready to welcome you back to faith and to church whenever you're ready. We can walk the long road to healing together, even if it's with a limp.","Indiana's religious freedom law will not directly affect many people, but conversation around it, will have lasting effects, writes Held Evans .

"London (CNN)Tunisia's ultra-radical fringe has come back to bite a government born out of the most successful experiment in constitutional reform to emerge from the 2011 Arab Spring revolutions. Wednesday's attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis was grimly predictable, coming from what the Tunisian Interior Ministry calls a violent ultra-radical Islamist fringe forced underground -- but not crushed -- by security services. Jihadist firebrands representing thousands of active militants at home and abroad have been threatening retribution on Tunisia's outward-looking, investment-friendly majority. The attack was carried out by two gunmen, believed to have been supported by at least two accomplices. It may torpedo efforts to revive Tunisia's employment-generating tourism industry and may discourage other big-spending visitors. It will probably lead Tunisians -- who have shown a sage propensity to unite in the face of greatest adversity despite a marked appetite for political bickering -- to support a robust response by elected President Beji Caid Essebsi. The attack adds to the global narrative by which Islamic revolutionaries -- increasingly flying under the flag of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) -- pose an existential crisis to moderate states, often Western allies, in the Arab world. Tunisia is the sole country to have emerged from an Arab Spring revolution with its political process intact -- current president, Essebsi, who was elected in November 2014, and his ruling coalition, are the products of a long constitutional process. In four tumultuous years they have competed hard with, but also showed a capacity to work with, opposition parties, led by the ""moderate Islamist"" Ennahda, which is represented in government and parliament. Islamists of a very different hue were responsible for the Bardo attack. Local Salafist groups (of whom the best known is Ansar Al-Sharia) as well as multinational units including ISIS have been most effective in recruiting disaffected young Tunisians in the capital's poorer quarters and in dusty towns of the south and interior, where the original revolution that removed Ben Ali in February 2011 surged up. Legitimate claims for more jobs and resources in these underprivileged areas during the four subsequent years have largely come to nothing, adding to frustrations. Radical jihadists -- some with back bases in Libya and Algeria -- have posed a major security challenge to successive governments, murdering two prominent ""secular"" politicians in 2013. The Tunisian armed forces, supported by Algeria's more experienced and better equipped military, have been fighting jihadist radicals in the Mount Chaambi region for nearly three years. They have yet to declare final victory, pointing to the resilience of underground groups. While successive governments have acted against radical Salafist groups, thousands of Tunisians have gone underground; they are widely believed to make up the biggest national group fighting with jihadists in Syria (over 3,000 by many accounts), and are present in Libya and other failing states. In January 2013, Tunisians and Libyans made up the majority of jihadists who attacked a strategic gas plant operated by BP and Statoil in southern Algeria. So, the Bardo attackers are a known enemy. Prime Minister Habib Essid has promised a robust security response. But the Tunis tragedy is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the political process. A majority of Tunisians remain foursquare behind preserving ""republican institutions,"" even if they vocally disagree on the detail of policy. It will remind Tunisia's many friends that the country's transition is brittle, and that Tunis needs commitments of support to become reality, with more military and wider financial assistance, and, above all, investment that can kickstart an economy in the doldrums since 2011. Massacre at the Bardo places Tunisia more centrally within the global ISIS narrative, which has recently expanded to neighboring Libya. It is a ghastly way to remind the world that Tunisia's experiment in democratic reform needs all the help it can get.","Jon Marks: Ultra-radical fringe has previously threatened Tunisia's liberal majority .

"(CNN)The debate over health care reform once again blooms in D.C., but this time Democrats and the President whose legacy rests on the Affordable Care Act are tending a garden challenged by some rather invasive species. The GOP has kicked off its season by pulling Obamacare up by the roots in its proposed 2016 House budget. But this budget will not become law. And so Republicans are also preparing strategic plays if the Supreme Court rules in their favor this summer, or if a Republican wins the White House next year backed by complementary majorities in the House and Senate. Either scenario would mortally wound Obamacare. But this isn't a zero sum game. Smart Republicans already know they don't win just because the other side loses.  Upending Obamacare may poison the GOP's standing with 16.4 million Americans who will face adverse, even dire consequences without legislative patches to the law, or a swift switch to a solid alternative health care policy. This week, the conservative weekly The Washington Examiner aimed to mark Obamacare's fifth anniversary by asking a panel whether to ""reform, replace or restart"" the law. A gas leak scuttled the event. Once they've regrouped for their next panel, Republicans should instead entertain a different R: Revise. So far every plan Republicans are offering strikes out any mandate to purchase insurance, which, oddly for a party celebrating self-reliance, encourages some people to continue shifting their adult responsibilities onto others. Many of the GOP plans replace the subsidies that make exchange plans affordable for low-income Americans with tax credits. Tax credits don't make much sense when you don't have a lot of taxes to pay in the first place. These alternatives appear to be thinly veiled transitions away from the key Obamacare principle of providing guaranteed access. To date the law has reduced the rates of uninsured Americans by a whopping 35%.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, lifted his veil even during his own plan's debut by insisting ""every last word of Obamacare must be repealed"" while promoting his own Health Care Choices Act that ditches subsidies and the mandate. Republican presidential front-runner Jeb Bush shares Cruz's preference to dismantle the ""monstrosity"" altogether, describing his preference for cheaper catastrophic insurance that helps people with massive bills but leaves poor Americans to fend for themselves when it comes to needless perks -- like insulin and blood pressure pills. And besides repealing the ACA, House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Georgia, wants to tear into President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society achievements as well.  His budget proposal dismantles the federal Medicaid program by slashing its funding and devolving it to the states, while asking seniors on Medicare to try their luck with a voucher-discounted private insurance. What these approaches don't get is that we live in a country entirely populated by citizens who want and expect to receive medical care when they need it, yet not all of these citizens want to pay anything for the privilege. The beating heart of Obamacare is its mandate to purchase health insurance, which keeps costs down for everyone, makes it fiscally feasible to cover patients with pre-existing conditions, and makes government subsidies possible for those who can't afford any insurance without them. If Republicans shift their focus to revising Obamacare, there are an array of spots to trim and weeds to pull, and they can expect many Democrats to join in the work. But after dealing with a withering onslaught of over 60 Republican attempts to kill the bill, Democrats can't make even the most basic fixes for fear of losing everything. But there are some places to look. Even ACA supporters can acknowledge some specific anti-competitive features in the law.  This should interest Republicans. The ACA's push toward offloading risk onto hospitals rather than insurers is encouraging hospital consolidation, with large hospital corporations seeking to build economies of scale to offset future risk  This trend may drive up costs as hospitals face less competition. Meanwhile consumers shopping the exchange plans can select from few in-network hospitals and physicians, again making the health care marketplace less competitive. The United States may be graced with institutions offering stellar care in complex conditions that attract patients across state lines as well as across the world, centers that contribute to medicine generally through their research and training. But going out of state to seek such care isn't an option for many patients on exchange plans.  Cruz proposes opening up health insurance markets nationally, an idea that we should build on. Years of a rough economy have left many consumers without the income or savings to pay the high copays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums that Obamacare uses as a cost-control measure. Among families making 250% to 400% over the federal poverty line, 55% to 68% can't make their deductible, depending on their plan. The numbers are considerably worse for families under that threshold, and even for families making over 400% of the poverty line, 25% to 38% can't pay the out of pocket maximum if they become seriously ill. Despite these costs, the ACA penalizes responsible consumers further by capping flexible spending accounts. Furthermore, Obamacare is in part more expensive than it might be because it takes a gamble covering preventive testing for people with no sign of disease for ""free,"" yet makes patients with chronic conditions pay deductibles even when we know their care will save money in the long run. That's not the most rational distribution of funds if we're trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number at the lowest cost. Since Jeb Bush is interested in focusing on the big-ticket items and not sweating the small stuff, perhaps this is an area where he can throw his support. Obamacare isn't a work of art by any means. It's a messy, pragmatic attempt to reach a goal the majority of Americans want: access to affordable health care when it's needed. Some rather fundamental revisions lie ahead, like a forthcoming administrative decision on whether to continue allowing state variability among the prescribed Essential Health Benefits it covers. So, my advice to Republicans is that they pick one or two specific aspects of Obamacare they'd like to improve, let's have the policy debate, then introduce your legislative fix to the existing law, leaving its beating heart intact. Show you're open to constructively improving the ACA and I'm sure we'll see Democrats start coming to the table with their own pet peeves about the law. 2016 doesn't have to be a hyperbolic, hyperventilating contest for the fate of 16.4 million Americans.","Ford Vox: With its budget proposal to kill Obamacare, or hopes the Supreme Court will do the same, the GOP makes a mistake .

"(CNN)""Breast is best"" -- you could call it a mantra of sorts that sums up much of today's research on breastfeeding. Not only does breastfeeding have clear short-term benefits, such as protection from infectious diseases and a reduction in mortality, it's also been shown to be associated with an increase in intelligence. Prior studies have shown an increase of up to 7.5 IQ points in elementary age children who were breastfed, as well as an increase in verbal, performance and comprehensive IQ in adults. The latest addition to this perspective is a long-term study of infants born in Pelotas, Brazil, in 1982. Published in Lancet, the study interviewed 5,914 new mothers about their plans for breastfeeding and then followed up to see how they did. ""Information on breastfeeding duration was collected very close to the time when weaning happened, so we had a very precise information on the duration of breastfeeding,"" said study author, Dr. Bernardo Lessa Horta, in a podcast on Lancet. What makes this study unique is that it followed the subjects all the way to age 30. ""We were able to follow about 68% of the participants, which is a very good follow-up rate,"" said Lessa Horta. ""We observed that breastfeeding was positively associated with performance and intelligence at 30 years old, as well as with education, school achievement and higher monthly incomes."" In fact, Lessa Horta said the subjects who had been breastfed for 12 months or longer had a higher IQ (about 3.7 points), more years of education and earned roughly 20% more than the average income level. ""It's suggesting that the positive effect of breastfeeding on IQ leads to a higher income,"" he said. ""This is our main finding at this moment."" One possible reason for the advantage of breast milk, Lessa Horta added, is that it is ""rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which are important to brain growth and development."" Called LCPUFA for short, these essential fatty acids are found in salmon and shellfish and have been added to infant formulas since the 1990s. However, the benefit to mental or psychomotor development from adding LCPUFA to infant formula is unclear. Because the study did not measure home life, intellectual stimulation or bonding between mother and child, it was not able to tease out whether these factors may have also contributed to the increase in IQ.  That leaves it open to critics, such as Texas A&M Professor Joan Wolf, author of  ""Is Breast Best? ""This study does not address the very real possibility that mothers who choose to breastfeed, regardless of income or education, distinguish themselves from those who bottle-feed in all kinds of ways that are likely to promote intelligence,"" Wolf wrote CNN. For Lessa Horta, the implications of his study are clear: ""The finding supports the promotion of breastfeeding. It's more evidence that besides the clear short term benefits, breastfeeding also has long term consequences in terms of human potential.""","Long-term study finds that IQ at age 30 was nearly 4 points higher for babies breastfed for a year or more .
Study conducted in Brazil also associates longer breastfeeding with higher income and education levels .
Critic points out that the study doesn't account for other possible contributing factors ."
"(CNN)The country's largest Presbyterian denomination has changed its definition of marriage to include gay couples -- though not explicitly. Presbyterian Church (USA) approved an amendment to its constitution after most of its 171 presbyteries -- or governing bodies -- voted for it, PC (USA) said Tuesday. Before, the definition said marriage was between ""a man and a woman."" The new definition says, in part, that ""marriage involves a unique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman, to love and support each other for the rest of their lives."" Already, PC (USA) ministers can perform same-sex marriages in states where such marriages are legal, the group said. But no teaching elder or session can be forced to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies if they do not believe they are appropriate. Not all members supported the decision. In a post on PC (USA)'s website,  Jean and Robert Gorney accused the church of going against the Bible and threatened to leave. ""We are not to change the Bible,"" their post said.   ""I don't care who disagrees."" But the Covenant Network of Presbyterians, which says it supports ""a fully inclusive church,"" welcomed the news Tuesday night. ""The change aligns the church's constitution with a reality that has long been true: Both same-gender and opposite-gender couples have been living in relationships that demonstrate covenant faithfulness, shared discipleship and mutual love,"" the group said. ""We are also aware that the discussion has been a difficult one for many, and that some will feel a deep sense of pain over this decision. The Covenant Network is committed to fostering healthy dialogue and working with those who hold a view different from ours, seeking opportunities for us to model an authentic and productive unity.""

"(CNN)The sack and pillage of the Mosul museum by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria displayed a violence rarely seen since the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyian. The bulldozing of the archaeological site of Nimrud marked a new step in the cultural cleansing underway in Iraq. These acts are a deliberate attack against civilians, minorities, heritage sites and traditions. In the minds of terrorists, murder and destruction of culture are inherently linked. It is appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism in a region that is a cradle of civilization, whose temples, palaces and frescoes have born witness to the glory of Iraq and Mesopotamia for the last 3,000 years. It is important we understand the true nature of this conflict. This war against culture is a war against people. It is part of a strategy to crush free thinking and to ensure domination through oppression. This is why extremists attack schools, media, or other places of culture. Through modern methods of communication and information, they use warped learning and distorted academic texts to hijack young minds. They forbid girls to go to school, kill journalists and vandalize museums: all symbols that embody freedom of thought and respect for cultural diversity. There can be no justification whatsoever for the systematic destruction of the heritage of humanity, and I wholeheartedly support the many religious leaders who have taken such a firm position denouncing these destructions and the perverted use of religion. When culture is under attack, we must respond with more knowledge, and with ever greater effort to work to explain the importance of humanity's shared heritage. This is why we appeal to all cultural institutions, museums, journalists, professors, and scientists to share knowledge widely about the Mesopotamian civilization. We need to remind ‎all of the history of this land which led the Islamic golden age. And we also call on all people everywhere -- and especially youth, in Iraq and elsewhere -- to claim this heritage as their own. Pre-Islamic heritage in Iraq belongs to all Iraqis, just as the Pyramids are written into the identity of all Egyptians. What is happening goes far beyond the domain of archaeologists and discourse on the ""irreparable loss of treasures of humanity."" What is happening is a security issue. The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage is a war crime. We see how terrorists are using such destruction to destabilize populations, spread terror, and encourage violence. We see also how extremists use heavy military vehicles to transport artifacts from looted‎ sites, and how illicit trafficking is directly funding terrorism. With this in mind, we have joined forces with all partners and neighboring countries to halt these crimes. The acceleration of such violence must be met with an acceleration of global solidarity and action. Faced with such crimes, we hope we can better understand the values we all share, and stand united in respect of humanity.","ISIS bulldozed site of ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq .

"(CNN)They say time and tide wait for no man, as Henrik Stenson discovered at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida when he complained he had been decisively rushed after being put on the clock in the closing stages of his dramatic defeat. The Swede -- who lost to defending champion Matt Every by one stroke -- was ticked off that he and playing partner Morgan Hoffman were subjected to time constraints from the 15th hole onwards because of alleged slow play Sunday. Under competition rules, players are put on the clock if they have fallen behind the allotted time for each hole and well behind the preceding group of players. Once the measure is imposed, shots are timed and players given a one-stroke penalty for the second shot -- but not the first -- on which they are found to have taken too long. Stenson said the decision ""got to me, and obviously I was rushing"" as he three-putted both that hole and the 16th, opening the door for Floridian Every to seal the title with a round of 66 crowned by a long-range putt on the final green. Officials at the Bay Hill course said Stenson and Hoffmann's had been the slowest pairing of the day Sunday. But the frustrated 38-year-old Swede said he ""could not see the point"" of being put on the clock. ""When someone is sitting there with a stopwatch it affects you a little bit,"" he explained, accusing officials of ""influencing, potentially, the outcome of this tournament towards the end."" ""I didn't really have much time to look at my putt [on the 15th] and rushed that one a little bit, the first one, and three-putted,"" the PGA Tour website quoted him as saying. ""Morgan got a bad time on his second shot on 16, and again I kind of rushed my putting on 16 and three-putted that one. That's really what cost me the tournament, those two three-putts on 15 and 16. ""We might have been a couple minutes out, for sure -- but then again it's normally not the quickest when you're playing in the last group. ""[There are] more people, more movement. You have to back off every now and then for some mobile phones and stuff like that."" The PGA Tour was not immediately available for comment about Stenson's remarks. Stenson told reporters that ""it's hard when you don't feel like you can take the time you want,"" adding that he was ""disappointed with the rules official for pushing us up late in the round for no obvious reason."" And he was unimpressed when told that part of the reason for the imposition of the ticking clock could have been a desire to complete play before live TV coverage came to an end at 18.00 local time. ""I thought we were here to play golf, not to finish at 6pm,"" he snapped. Meanwhile, a delighted Every was left to reflect on the 17ft birdie putt on the final green that took him to the title. ""You watch tournaments on TV where guys make putts like that to win and everybody goes nuts -- it's cool to close one out like that,"" he said.","Swede and Morgan Hoffman subjected to time constraints from 15th hole .

"(CNN)It's playing out like a scene from ""Night of the Living Dead""-- in the boardroom of one of Italy's most famous clubs. Director George A. Romero's horror cult classic revolved around a swarm of slow-moving cannibalistic corpses snacking on the inhabitants of a shopping mall and Parma general manager and team legend Alessandro Melli talks in similarly apocalyptic tones as he details the financial crisis engulfing the Serie A club. ""It seems like we are zombies, working without knowing where we are heading,"" Melli told CNN's Don Riddell. Rooted at the bottom of Italy's top flight, Parma has debts of approximately $100 million and faces a looming financial collapse -- barring a miracle ownership rescue. The club has been docked points twice this season for failing to pay its players and faces a bankruptcy hearing on March 19. ""Every day they take away a part of our work and piece of our hearts. Bits of the club are foreclosed every day and we come here to work just because we love our work and our team, but we cannot do our job,"" added Melli. ""We're living in a nightmare, whichever way you look at it. Because this is not just about the money, even though we can't ignore it, there is a lot more that they are taking away. Dignity, the smile; they took away our respect and it hurts."" Last season Parma finished sixth in Serie A, only to be barred from taking part in European football's second tier competition -- the Europa League -- over an income tax bill. Between 1992 and 2002 Parma won two UEFA Cups, the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup and three Italian Cups in a successful spell between 1992 and 2002. In 1997, led by current Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti and with the caliber of players like Gianfranco Zola, Faustino Asprilla and Hernan Crespo, Parma finished runners-up in Serie A. ""Look at the team we had,"" said Angelo Manfredini, president of the Parma supporters club, referring to those halycon days, as he rattled off other players including Melli, Fabio Cannavaro and longtime Italy captain and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who now plays for Juventus. ""All were players who meant something to football."" Fast forward to more austere times and Parma's current players haven't been paid since August. They're so fed up they've threatened to go on strike -- that is if the games are allowed proceed in the first place, with two of Parma's recent fixtures having been called off given the club's problems. Parma was once owned by the world's leading dairy company, Parmalat Spa, which collapsed under financial fraud in 2003. The club has already changed hands twice this season after a Russian-Cypriot conglomerate sold the club to Giampietro Manenti. A despairing Melli depicted a club that is being seemingly taken apart seat by seat, screw by screw. ""One day, we won't have the laundry anymore,"" said Melli.  ""The next day, computers (will be) taken away, then we don't have emails anymore. ""And then the physical objects related to sport, like benches, like the team bus...everyday it's like being stabbed."" For his part, Manenti has reportedly said he will not sell the club, which will likely mean another spell in administration for Parma, the second time in the past 10 years. Their next scheduled match is a home game on March 22 against Torino, but Melli is more concerned about what the future holds in store for Parma rather than the next 90 minutes. ""I hope to have a new owner to sort out our debts and save the brand, starting again from Serie B and to start again with new management that loves what they are managing,"" said Melli. ""Slowly, we can rebuild. It will take time and patience, with the right people in the right places. Only in this way can Parma be reborn like a Phoenix. ""Objectively, it's unlikely this will happen. This is just the hope of a lover, trying to find his lost love. But he needs the help of others, we can't make it by ourselves.""","Legendary club of Cannavaro and Buffon faces bankruptcy court March 19 .

"(CNN)Brace yourself Europe -- ""Moneyball"" is coming to a football pitch near you. Spend-thrift baseball executive Billy Beane -- made famous by Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated portrayal in ""Moneyball"" -- is taking up a position with Dutch club AZ Alkmaar. ""I'm truly excited for the opportunity to be part of AZ Alkmaar in an advisory role,"" Beane told the AZ website. ""Despite being a great football club with a storied history, they face many of the challenges we have with the Oakland A's. My love for football and AZ's vision of the future of the club made this an attractive pursuit."" The idea behind ""Moneyball"" is to obtain maximum value for each player bought or sold. Beane has had a longstanding fascination with European football, citing Arsenal's Arsene Wenger as a manager he admires for his blend of performance on the pitch and financial prudence. The American has said in the past that it was his dream to be an executive at a football club once his baseball career ended.  It turns out he didn't have to wait that long. ""I think it's interesting and exciting for him personally,"" said Chris Anderson, co-founder of the sports analytics consultancy Anderson Sally. ""He's been a football fan for many, many years and is very well informed about the sport and industry. This is not as much a stretch as one might imagine; he actually knows football."" Beane will retain his general manager duties with the Oakland A's, a team that remains competitive despite sporting one of the lowest payrolls in Major League Baseball (MLB). The A's have qualified for MLB's playoffs each of the past three seasons, only to be knocked out before the World Series every time. Critics of baseball's sabermetrics system -- using data to analyze the sport as exposed in Michael Lewis' ""Moneyball"" book which inspired the film -- are quick to point out that Beane has never won a title with the A's. In Holland, Beane won't need to start from scratch, as AZ currently sits comfortably in fourth place in the Dutch Eredivisie. AZ's director of football Earnie Stewart is a known ""Moneyball"" fan himself, having organized a screening for his fellow AZ execs shortly after joining the club. The former U.S. midfielder, who scored against Colombia in the 1994 World Cup, is half-Dutch and hopes the collaboration with Beane can give the club an extra edge. ""We've had a lot of contact with Billy In the last few months"", Stewart told the club's website. ""His knowledge and ideas are impressive. Also Billy's soccer network is excellent. We have already noticed that Billy thinks two steps ahead in the area of innovation. That's what really connects with the ambitions of AZ."" Like the A's, AZ have managed to compete with the big boys of the Dutch league -- chiefly PSV and Ajax -- on a limited budget, winning the domestic league twice -- most recently in 2009 -- while finishing in the top five in three of the past five seasons. Beane's philosophy is shaped by getting maximum bang for your buck in the transfer market. ""There is a misconception that you never pay much for anybody, but that is not true at all,"" Beane told the Telegraph in 2011. ""You want to make sure you are getting more value than you are paying. That may come in the form of a very expensive player, it may come in the form of a very young player, but it's not about being cheap or not spending money."" But it's questionable whether ""Moneyball"" principles can be applied to football, a sport where -- unlike in U.S. sports leagues -- players are rarely traded for one another. Instead, athletes are sold for prices determined by a marketplace, untethered by salary caps. However, Anderson argues Beane could be about to exploit a gap in the market. ""I would say unequivocally that markets for players are much more inefficient in soccer than in baseball,"" said Anderson, who also wrote ""The Numbers Game: Everything You Know About Football Is Wrong."" ""The combination of a global market plus inefficiency means that is a huge opportunity in soccer that there isn't in the same way in baseball."" Either way, Beane is likely to relish the challenge of imparting his knowledge to the boardrooms of European football, perhaps even as a pre-cursor to a full time job in the sport. ""I think he certainly would be open to the possibility of taking on a role,"" said Anderson, adding that Beane could be using the advisory position to dip his toe into the shark-infested waters of football player transfers. ""In football we're still in a pre-'Moneyball' era,"" added Anderson. ""So the baseball equivalent of the mid-1990s. is the football equivalent of 2015.""","Baseball's Billy Beane to join top-tier Dutch club as executive .

"(CNN)With his KISS makeup on, frontman Gene Simmons always looked a little scary. So maybe this new venture makes sense. The rocker and reality-show star is teaming with WWE Studios to launch Erebus Pictures, a label that will finance and produce horror movies. The joint venture kicks off with a three-picture deal starting with ""Temple,"" expected to begin shooting this summer. ""The horror genre continues to fascinate me as it proves to be endlessly thrilling and engaging for audiences,"" said Simmons, who with KISS has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide. Erebus Pictures is named after the Greek mythological deity that personifies darkness. It has a logical marketing platform in the WWE Network, a subscription-based streaming service known for pro-wrestling shows such as ""Monday Night Raw"" and ""SmackDown"" that appeal to primarily young male fans, arguably the core of the horror-movie audience. WWE says ""Temple"" is about a team of highly trained operatives who find themselves trapped inside an isolated military compound after its artificial intelligence is suddenly shut down. While investigating the source of the malfunction, the crew begins to experience strange and horrific phenomena as they try to uncover who or what killed the team previously stationed at the compound. The studio says a director for ""Temple"" will be announced shortly. Erebus Pictures' second feature will go into production later this year. WWE Studios' most lucrative film has been ""The Call,"" a 2013 thriller starring Halle Berry, which earned $68 million worldwide.","KISS' Gene Simmons is teaming with WWE Studios to launch Erebus Pictures .

"(CNN)Ferguson City Manager John Shaw resigned Tuesday in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report. The report blames Ferguson, Missouri, police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets African-American residents. ""Over the last several months I have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community,"" Shaw wrote in his resignation letter. He continued: ""During this time I have also worked closely with the Department of Justice to identify opportunities to improve, and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change. ""And while I certainly respect the work that the DOJ recently performed in their investigation and report on the City of Ferguson, I must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target African Americans, nor falsify charges to administer fines, nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor. Any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false."" Shaw's resignation was announced the same day the City Council voted 7-0 on a mutual separation agreement with Shaw. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including the Police Department. Along with other officials, Shaw was heavily criticized by the Justice Department report, which found that authorities in Ferguson frequently saw residents as ""sources of revenue."" In fact, the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that Ferguson, population 21,000, was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in St. Louis County by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said. In one March 2012 email, the captain of the patrol division reported to Shaw that court collections the previous month reached $235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $200,000. The city manager reported the email to the City Council, congratulating police and court staff on their ""great work,"" the report said. When Ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million for the whole of 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email: ""Awesome! Thanks!"" according to the federal report. The DOJ's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, who was shot by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in August. Wilson, who was not indicted on any charges, has resigned from the police department. But when Ferguson resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd. ""I'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe Darren Wilson an apology,"" Schmidt said, prompting laughter by some in the audience. ""The same justice report that you're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100%.""

"(CNN)Spirit Airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes. The low-cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $69 round-trip fares in April and May that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply. Round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight. But the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy, which obliquely references a sexual act. ""We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,"" reads the offer on Spirit's website. ""It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going."" Some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste. ""You can't object to that price point, but you certainly can object to the discount airline's marketing strategy, which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if Spirit's website was hacked,"" wrote Aaron Rupar of KMSP in Minneapolis. Spirit spokesman Paul Berry, in a prepared statement, said the promotion reflects the airline's quirky culture. ""Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be. We enjoy being different than other airlines,"" said Berry, Spirit's director of corporate communications. ""When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.  But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent. They get lots of attention,"" he added. ""The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are. We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently."" The $69 fares must be booked by the end of the day Tuesday. Questionable taste or not, the promotion may be working: People were complaining on Twitter that they couldn't access Spirit's website to book flights. Based in Florida, Spirit Airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can. The airline's defense is simple: Pay for what you want on your flight, and don't pay for what you don't want.

"(CNN)Wildlife services in California are being pushed to their limits this year. Since January 2015, every month has set a record in sea lion ""strandings,"" mostly sea lion pups, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""There has been an unusually high number of sea lions stranded since January,"" said Justin Greenman, assistant stranding coordinator for NOAA on the West Coast. ""Stranding does happen, but just to give you perspective, 1,800 [sea lion] pups have been responded to this year alone. We responded to 1,600 strandings total during the entire year in 2013,"" he said. Stranding is the official term to describe marine life that ""swim or float into shore and become beached or stuck,"" according to NOAA. Strandings are taking a toll on the resources available in coastal counties from San Diego to Santa Barbara. Local care facilities have taken in more stranded sea lions this year than 2004-12 combined, and it is only mid-March. Greenman said he expects the problem to continue beyond April, when weaning normally occurs, when the pups are 10 or 11 months old. Dave Koontz, director of communications for SeaWorld San Diego, said SeaWorld has rescued nearly 500 sea lions this year. ""This is a new record for Sea World,"" Koontz said. ""In 1983 we rescued 474."" Some of the sea lions responded to have had to be euthanized. ""They [sea lion pups] have to be able to eat and fish on their own before they can be released back into the wild, and a lot of these pups haven't even been weaned,"" Greenman said. Greenman said California has had warmer weather than usual this year, and, while NOAA is still conducting studies on the Channel Islands to get a more proven explanation, warmer water drives the food source farther out or deeper into the ocean, where the colder water is. When food is farther away, the mothers are away from the pup too long in search of food, and return with little food or too few nutrients for a growing sea lion. ""We have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches,"" Greenman said. However, he said, the species has made a comeback since the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. California's sea lion population has grown to 300,000 from an estimated population of 10,000 in the 1950s, according to the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife. People who observe stranded sea lions are advised not to touch them or attempt to rescue them, because it can be dangerous and it is illegal. Instead, call any of the rescue agencies listed on NOAA West Coast Region's website. If the animal has died, the local dead animal pickup service should be alerted.","""There has been an unusually high number of sea lions stranded since January,"" NOAA representative says .

"Beijing (CNN)When it came to the environment in China, it was hazy through much of the weekend -- literally and figuratively. As a thick layer of toxic air blanketed Beijing and much of northern China on Friday, censors smothered a wildly popular but controversial documentary on the country's air pollution, removing it from all major video streaming sites. At a standing-room-only press conference Saturday, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection ignored raised hands of foreign journalists eager to ask about the development and made no mention of the documentary that he had praised just a week earlier. Without a hint of irony, he promised to be more transparent and reassured the masses of their right to oversee the government's fight against air pollution. ""Under the Dome"" -- a slickly produced two-hour documentary on journalist Chai Jing's dogged quest to find the causes and solutions to China's severe smog problem -- attracted over 200 million views online in just one week, an unprecedented number even in the world's most populous nation. Supporters and detractors of Chai, a famous former anchor and reporter at state-run national broadcaster CCTV, began a war of words almost immediately after the video's release on February 28. Admirers compared it to ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the Oscar-winning documentary on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming. Critics, on the other hand, portrayed it as a piece of shoddy investigative journalism filled with bad science and biased conclusions, which blamed the problem largely on the entrenched interests of the state oil industry. Some even called it propaganda for President Xi Jinping, who had declared keeping the sky blue a top policy priority. The new environment minister's initial response to the video -- in the form of a widely reported text message of gratitude to Chai -- reinforced some doubts over Chai's claim of editorial independence for her self-funded project. Many more people, however, perceived it as an encouraging sign of the government's adoption of a more open attitude to a politically sensitive topic, as Xi and other leaders started to publicly acknowledge the severity and urgency of the issue. But such optimism was dashed 24 hours after the documentary's launch, as censors moved to reign in increasingly heated online debates surrounding air pollution and beyond, and removed all mention of the video from homepages of major websites. As the week progressed, leaked state media memos -- widely circulated on social media -- revealed ever-harsher wording from propaganda authorities as they scrambled to limit the continuing impact of the video. Finally, after millions of clicks, ""Under the Dome"" vanished from much of Chinese cyberspace Friday as heavy smog descended on the capital. Also in Beijing were almost 3,000 delegates who had gathered to attend the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament that meets in full once a year to approve the ruling Communist Party's legislative proposals. Pollution has remained a hot topic at this year's session, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, adding that Xi vowed to legislators Friday ""to give an iron hand to any polluters in the smog-choked country."" With Chai's viral video also encountering an iron hand, analysts explained that the seeming contradiction makes perfect sense in a one-party dictatorship with little tolerance for open dissent. ""Smog is like any other problem in China -- dig it too deep and you touch the issue of political system,"" said Yao Bo, a well-known news commentator with more than 1.2 million followers on Chinese social media. ""The video doesn't do that but comments on it had started to question the system."" ""I think the video caught censors off guard,"" he added, dismissing the idea that its fate reflected infighting among China's senior leaders. ""The censors eventually acted as expected, after going through this bureaucratic process that is always half a step behind."" As gusty winds blew away Beijing's smog Sunday afternoon, this much became clear to the public: In China, the government cares about the environment as much as you do, but only one of you is free to talk about it.","Film on China's air pollution problem drew praise from environment minister when it came out .

"Beijing (CNN)China's premier on Sunday offered a sobering assessment of the world's second largest economy amid fears of a sustained slowdown but brushed aside concern that it could face a full-blown economic crisis. ""I don't deny that the Chinese economy is facing downward pressure and multiple risks,"" said Li Keqiang at a nationally televised press conference. ""The key is to find the balance between stable growth and structural adjustments under the new normal (of slower growth)."" ""We haven't adopted the policy of strong short-term stimulus in recent years -- in other words... we still have plenty of tools in our toolbox,"" he offered. Earlier this month, the People's Bank of China -- the central bank-- cut interest rates to guard against deflation and the country set its lowest growth target in 25 years. Li, the No. 2 leader in China behind President Xi Jinping, also promised a further streamlined government to strengthen the role of free market in the economy. ""The pain of reform is still there, actually the pain is becoming more acute and in more places,"" he said. ""During the course of reform, vested interested will be tested -- but this is not nail clipping, this is like cutting off one's limb with a sword and we have to do it despite the pain."" Li held the highly choreographed annual press conference -- often the only occasion a senior Chinese leader faces the media -- after China's rubber-stamp parliament approved the government budget and concluded this year's 10-day session. Li answered questions from pre-selected journalists that focused on the economy and touched on the government's stance on the anti-corruption campaign, the environment and foreign policy. Before he was ushered out of the ornate room, the premier responded to a question shouted from the audience about Myanmar, whose warplanes reportedly dropped a bomb Friday in a Chinese border town and killed four civilians. ""We have the responsibility and capability to firmly safeguard the stability of the Chinese-Myanmar border -- and will firmly protect the lives and property of our citizens,"" Li said to applause from Chinese reporters.","Chinese premier says economy faces multiple risks .

"(CNN)In tennis, a hitting partner is someone who often does more than just practice with a big star. They sometimes have to be psychologists, waiters, chauffeurs and even bodyguards. They may get to travel the world but the job isn't without its perils. Two years ago, for example, the father of Bernard Tomic, one of the most hyped players in the last decade, was found guilty of assaulting the player's former hitting partner, Thomas Drouet. Now, one of the longest lasting relationships -- and one of the highest profile -- has come to an end. Sascha Bajin, a constant in Serena Williams' life the past eight years, suggested on Twitter earlier this week that he was no longer working with the 19-time grand slam winner and has instead begun a partnership with Williams' friend and tennis rival, Victoria Azarenka. Williams wished him well. Their split was confirmed by Williams' agent, Jill Smoller, in an email to CNN.com, and Azarenka's coach, Wim Fissette, confirmed that Bajin is indeed the two-time grand slam champion's new hitting partner. They practiced together for the first time this week. ""I'm very excited about having Sascha in the team,"" Fissette told CNN.com in an email. ""Sascha is a great guy ... and has so much experience in working with Serena. ""I saw Sascha hit many times so I know he is just a very good tennis player. To give the player the best rhythm is extremely important. ""On the other hand I think it's very good there is someone else in the team with experience winning grand slams. That's always very important. Sascha knows what it is like to be in semifinals and finals in grand slams."" No one has disclosed what led to the parting of ways but Bajin wasn't with Williams as she won the Australian Open in January. Bajin said he was injured, with Frenchman Jonathan Dasnieres de Veigy replacing him. Fissette, who was formerly alongside Kim Clijsters, Simona Halep and Sabine Lisicki when they either won or reached grand slam finals, said he was ""very surprised"" that Bajin became available. ""Sascha was working so many years with Serena and I felt they had an excellent relationship, more than just player and hitting partner,"" he said. ""I felt they were very good friends. ""But it's not my business to know what went wrong. Maybe they both needed a new challenge. I think everybody will remember the many years they worked together and the excellent results she had during that time."" Williams, about to make her return to Indian Wells after a 14-year absence, once likened Bajin to a brother. ""Outside of my parents, I think he's probably the most important person on the team,"" Williams told USA Today in 2013. ""He's much more than a hitting partner. He's my older brother. He's family."" Bajin's alliance with Azarenka serves as another change for the Belorussian. Azarenka split with coach Sam Sumyk -- who quickly moved on to Eugenie Bouchard -- and hired Fissette in his place in February. Azarenka is attempting to recapture top form after foot and knee injuries derailed her in 2014. ""From the first meeting, I felt a good connection (with Azarenka) and after the first two weeks I feel a very good connection,"" said Fissette. ""Vika is very motivated to get back to the top and wants to become a better player. That is what I feel on court and I believe it can be a great year for her. ""I believe it's also great for women's tennis that Vika is back. She is a great tennis player and an excellent entertainer.""","Serena Williams is no longer working with hitting partner Sascha Bajin .

"(CNN)The University of North Carolina will pay whistleblower Mary Willingham $335,000 to settle her lawsuit with the university, following the largest academic fraud scandal in NCAA history. Willingham is the former athletics literacy counselor who blew the whistle about the fake classes that went on for nearly 20 years at the prestigious university. Willingham spent years fielding attacks from university officials -- including accusations that she was lying when she said that officials within the athletic department steered underprepared athletes into the fake classes to keep them eligible. For nearly five years, UNC denied those claims, but Willingham refused to keep quiet. She first told her story to the News & Observer in Raleigh, and then to national media when the university refused to admit that the classes were well-known to faculty. The added attention forced UNC to hire a new investigator and launch a new probe in 2014. That latest review, led by Ken Wainstein, a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Justice Department, found exactly what Willingham had always claimed -- widespread and systematic cheating. Willingham left her job last spring after complaining that she was being retaliated against. ""The University's settlement with Mrs. Willingham resolves all of the outstanding legal issues in the case,"" said Rick White, associate vice chancellor of communications and public affairs. ""We appreciate the efforts of the mediator to help us achieve a successful and timely conclusion to the mediation. We believe the settlement is in the best interest of the University and allows us to move forward and fully focus on other important issues."" When she sued, Willingham said she hoped to accomplish what no other investigation has done -- to subpoena documents and to depose university officials under oath. Her lawsuit never got that far. Instead, she says she's hoping that will be accomplished by a larger class-action lawsuit filed by powerhouse attorney Michael Hausfeld on behalf of two former UNC athletes. Devon Ramsay and Rashanda McCants both sued in January, saying they were promised an education but didn't get one because of the paper class scandal. Hausfeld is the attorney who beat the NCAA last summer in federal court on behalf of former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, winning a case that will forever change college sports by forcing the NCAA to eliminate the rule that forbids schools from paying players. That lawsuit is the reason Willingham says she was OK with entering into mediation in her whistleblower suit. She shared the settlement document with CNN. ""It's about the students and not about me.

"(CNN)Scientists at NASA are one step closer to understanding how much water could have existed on primeval Mars. These new findings also indicate how primitive water reservoirs there could have evolved over billions of years, indicating that early oceans on the Red Planet might have held more water than Earth's Arctic Ocean, NASA scientists reveal in a study published Friday in the journal Science. ""Our study provides a solid estimate of how much water Mars once had, by determining how much water was lost to space,"" said Geronimo Villanueva, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ""With this work, we can better understand the history of water on Mars."" To find answers to this age-old question about Martian water molecules, scientists used the world's three major infrared telescopes, in Chile and Hawaii, to measure traces of water in the planet's atmosphere over a range of areas and seasons, spanning from March 2008 to January 2014. ""From the ground, we could take a snapshot of the whole hemisphere on a single night,"" said Goddard's Michael Mumma. Scientists looked at the ratio of two different forms -- or isotopes -- of water, H2O and HDO. The latter is made heavier by one of its hydrogen atoms, called deuterium, which has a neutron at its core in addition to the proton that all hydrogen atoms have. That weighed down HDO more, while larger amounts of hydrogen from H2O floated into the atmosphere, broke away from Mars' low gravity and disappeared into space. As a result, water trapped in Mars' polar ice caps has a much higher level of HDO than fluid water on Earth does, the scientists said. The scientists compared the ratio of H2O to HDO in Mars' atmosphere today to the ratio of the two molecules trapped inside a Mars meteorite, a stone that broke off from Mars -- perhaps when an asteroid hit -- and landed on Earth some 4.5 billion years ago. They were able to determine how much that ratio had changed over time and estimate how much water has disappeared from Mars -- about 87%. The findings indicate that the Red Planet could have had its fair share of blue waters, possibly even yielding an ocean. According to NASA, there might have been enough water to cover up to 20% of Mars' surface. That would amount to an ocean proportionally larger than the Atlantic on Earth. ""This ocean had a maximum depth of around 5,000 feet or around one mile deep,"" said Villanueva. NASA scientists say that much of this water loss happened over billions of years, along with a loss of atmosphere. And as the planet's atmospheric pressure dropped, it was harder for water to stay in liquid form. Heat also contributed to its evaporation. As a result, the remaining primeval ocean water continued to move toward the poles, where it eventually froze. ""With Mars losing that much water, the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,"" said Mumma. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Scientists studied water in Mars' atmosphere with three giant infrared telescopes .

"(CNN)Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot who authorities say deliberately crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 in France, passed all his tests and medical exams and gave no voluntary indication that he was unstable or mentally ill, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told CNN Thursday. ""We have at Lufthansa a reporting system where crew can report without being punished their own problems or they can report about problems of others without any kind of punishment. That hasn't been used either in this case, so all these safety nets we are so proud of here have not worked in this case,"" Spohr said. Lubitz had been with Germanwings since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time after training at the airline's flight center in Bremen, Germany, the company has said. Germanwings is the budget carrier for Lufthansa. The CEO said he didn't know much more than what has been released by French authorities: The captain left the cockpit, tried to regain access by knocking on the door and ""the door was either kept locked or not opened in the way it was supposed to be, and that for sure is a clear indication that the remaining pilot -- the co-pilot -- didn't want the captain to return."" Had the copilot suffered a medical emergency -- as some experts speculated in the initial hours after the accident -- there are safety procedures in place so that the pilot can re-access the cockpit, he said. That is, ""unless the person on the inside locks it and this apparently has happened here,"" the CEO said. After the September 11, 2001, attacks, cockpit doors were manufactured to withstand manual force and small weapons, so there was ""no way to get back to the cockpit for the captain,"" he said. Spohr was asked why Lubitz was allowed to be alone in the cockpit. American airlines require that any pilot leaving the flight deck be replaced by a flight attendant, so that two people remain in the cockpit at all times, but that's not the case with all airlines internationally, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. An 8-minute descent to death . A Lufthansa spokesman previously said that the airline complies with all German and European aviation regulations, something Spohr reiterated in his CNN interview. ""Most airlines around the world follow the same procedures as Lufthansa that in flight phases with low workload, the pilot can leave the cockpit -- especially for physical need -- and then he returns to the cockpit as fast as he can. That's a global thing, most accepted procedure, which we have used at Lufthansa for many, many years,"" Spohr said. Asked if the airline might reconsider this policy in light of Tuesday's crash, Spohr said it was possible. ""I think we look at that as well, but we should not put the whole system at stake just because of this terrible single accident,"" he said. The airline will be consulting with its own experts, aviation authorities and experts with other airlines to determine what, if any, of its procedures need to be bolstered to prevent future such accidents from occurring, Spohr said, adding that he stood strongly by the manner in which Lufthansa operates airplanes and trains its employees. ""We understand emotions after this terrible accident, but for us as professionals we need to ensure the safety focus of Lufthansa is in no way touched -- and I promise you it's not -- and we will do our very, very best to even improve it further."" Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? CNN's Frederik Pleitgen conducted the interview in Cologne, Germany, and Eliott C. McLaughlin wrote the story from Atlanta.

"(CNN)Two days after Odin Lloyd was found dead, New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez looked into the eyes of team owner Robert Kraft and said he was innocent, Kraft testified Tuesday in Hernandez's murder trial. Kraft, answering questions from a prosecutor and one of Hernandez's attorneys on the witness stand in a Massachusetts courtroom, recalled a private conversation that he had with the star Patriots tight end on June 19, at the Patriots' Gillette Stadium, as news spread that Hernandez was being investigated in Lloyd's death. ""He said he was not involved,"" Kraft testified in the courtroom in Fall River. ""He said he was innocent."" Hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, a semipro football player who was found dead in Massachusetts on June 17, 2013. Hernandez also has pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Kraft testified that he asked to speak with Hernandez in an office near a weight room in the stadium, and asked the player to look him in the eye and tell him if he was involved in Lloyd's death. According to Kraft, Hernandez told him during that meeting that he hoped the time of Lloyd's death ""came out,"" because Hernandez had been at a club that night. According to testimony from Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, the player had not been at a club, but was at dinner with her and some friends before the shooting. Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst, called Kraft's testimony ""explosive."" ""What a great, great witness for the prosecution,"" she said. ""Basically what happened is Aaron Hernandez lied to his boss. And the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand."" How did Hernandez know when the murder happened, Robbins asked, unless he was there? The Patriots' owner also testified, when asked by a defense attorney, that he'd never had any problems with Hernandez, and that the player was always respectful to him. The billionaire magnate of The Kraft Group, a company with interests ranging from paper and packaging concerns to sports and entertainment, said Hernandez always greeted him with a hug and kiss. Asked by the defense why Hernandez was signed to a $40 million long-term contract, Kraft said simply: ""He's a very good player."" At times during his 30 minutes or so on the witness stand, Kraft seemed uncomfortable. ""Do you work?"" Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley asked Kraft. ""I think so, yes."" Asked where he worked, Kraft responded, 1 Patriot Place, or Gillette Stadium, where the Super Bowl champions play their home games. ""What do you do for work?"" ""Whatever they ask me to do."" Outside court, surrounded by cameras, Kraft expressed sadness over Lloyd's death. ""A man died,"" he said. ""This is about a man being killed. It's unfortunate."" Later, Mark Briggs, head of security at Gillette Stadium, testified that he also asked Hernandez whether the former star was telling the truth about Lloyd. ""He swore on the baby's life that he was telling the truth,"" Briggs said. Hernandez was arrested in connection with Lloyd's death a week after that meeting with Kraft. The Patriots released Hernandez less than two hours after the arrest on June 26, 2013. Jenkins, 25, and Hernandez are the parents of a young daughter. Jenkins' sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors. The trial began in late January.","Aaron Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of Odin Lloyd .

"Istanbul (CNN)A prosecutor involved in a controversial case died Tuesday after he was shot during a hostage siege in an Istanbul courthouse. Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz died in the hospital from injuries he suffered during the attack, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said, speaking to reporters on Turkish television. The two gunmen who took the prosecutor hostage were killed in a shootout with police after a standoff that lasted for hours. Kiraz was assigned to the controversial case of Berkin Elvan, a 15-year-old boy who was injured during the anti-government Gezi Park protests in June 2013. The teen died the following March after having spent nine months in a coma. The case, with its overtones of possible police overreaction, has been politically contentious, just as the protests themselves were. In an online post widely cited in Turkish media, the left-wing Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front claimed responsibility for the attack. The post said the gunmen were seeking to avenge Elvan's death. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the gunmen as terrorists and said they were disguised as lawyers when they entered the courthouse. ""This is not to be taken lightly,"" he said. The gunmen took the prosecutor hostage around 12:30 p.m. in his office on the sixth floor of the Caglayan district courthouse, the semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. Police evacuated that floor of the building, the agency reported, and snipers were deployed. An explosion, followed by sounds of more gunshots, could be heard coming from the courthouse Tuesday evening, hours after the siege began. Istanbul Police Chief Selami Altinok said Kiraz had been shot before Turkish security teams entered the room where the hostage crisis was unfolding. ""There is nothing else to do but to pray at this moment,"" Erdogan said. The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, known as the DHKP-C, is viscerally hostile to the Turkish state, the United States and NATO, and has had links with the far left in Europe. The Marxist-Leninist group claimed responsibility for a 2013 suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara. Among other attacks attributed to the DHKP-C was the assassination of a former justice minister, Mehmet Topac, in 1994, as well as the murders of a number of senior police and military officials and, 1996, a prominent businessman, Ozdemir Sabanci.

"New York (CNN)Korean Air's ""nut rage"" case has made its way back to New York, with the flight attendant who served the offending macadamia nuts filing a lawsuit against the airline and a former executive. Heather Cho, a Korean Air executive and daughter of the airline's chairman, is serving a one-year prison sentence in South Korea after throwing a fit on a New York flight because her nuts were served in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl. In a civil suit filed this week in state Supreme Court in Queens, New York, Cho -- whose name is listed as Heather Hyun A-Cho in court documents -- is accused of ""verbally and physically"" attacking flight attendant Kim Do-hee in December on a Seoul-bound flight departing from John F. Kennedy International Airport. At the time, Cho, who was seated in first class, demanded that the plane go back to the gate so Kim could be kicked off the flight, according to the lawsuit. The episode, which was widely reported, was a ""prime example of the corrupt and entitled behavior of the members of elite South Korean business families,"" the lawsuit states. The suit describes Cho as the ""princess"" of the ""so-called royal"" family that controls Korean Air, and says the executive screamed obscenities at Kim before hitting, shoving and threatening the flight attendant. On her return to South Korea, the lawsuit states, Kim was ""pressured to lie to government regulators in order to cover up the incident, and to appear in public with Cho as part of an orchestrated effort to try and rehabilitate Cho's public image."" A South Korean judge last month said that Cho's actions threatened the development of the aviation industry and inconvenienced passengers, and ruled that she violated aviation law, changed a flight path and interfered with operations. She was sentenced to a year in jail. The judge blasted Cho for her conduct, saying that she had used the plane as if it were her personal car and that as a passenger, she could not override crew members and give orders during a flight. The case is emblematic of growing resentment over the perceived privileges and nepotism of the families that control the country's top companies. Cho resigned as vice president at the company a few days after the incident and publicly apologized, saying she accepted ""full responsibility."" Last month, she appeared in a South Korean court wearing a green prison uniform. She gazed downward. Her hair hung in her face. ""I don't know how to find forgiveness,"" she said. Park Chang-jin, the chief steward who was booted from the flight instead of Kim, has said the former executive treated crew members like ""feudal slaves."" Park and Kim, the flight attendant who served the nuts, had knelt in front of Cho in apology. Kim testified that Cho berated them about the service and later shoved and cursed her. When the flight arrived in Korea, the flight attendant said another airline manager, Yeo Woon-jin, pressured her not to talk to investigators about Cho's physically abusing her and Park. Yeo was found guilty of interfering with an investigation. Korean Air Chairman Cho Yang-ho apologized to the flight attendants and the public following the public uproar over the incident. In a statement, Kim's lawyer, Andrew Weinstein, called Heather Cho's behavior ""humiliating, degrading, and damaging to Ms. Kim, but ... also emblematic of Ms. Cho's unbridled arrogance and disturbing sense of entitlement."" The incident has damaged Kim's ""career, reputation, and emotional well-being,"" and efforts to settle the case out of court have been unsuccessful, according to the statement -- which didn't specify how much was being sought in damages. Attempts to reach representatives of Korean Air as well as lawyers for Cho were unsuccessful.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)So what has U.S. State Department subcontractor Alan Gross been up to since he was released from a Cuban prison exactly three months ago? It turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us. Gross, 65, has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in Cuba by traveling abroad, attending the State of the Union address as a guest of the Obamas and last week meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican to personally thank him for his role in helping to win Gross' freedom. After five years of being disconnected from the outside world, Gross now frequently posts on social media, writing of family reunions, eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in Cuba. ""I can't get away from Cuba,"" Gross wrote after hearing a Cuban song playing in an airport on his travels. While visiting Israel, he posted a photo of Cohiba cigars advertised for sale in a Tel Aviv tobacco shop. In 2009, Gross was arrested by Cuban state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island. Gross said he was merely helping the island's small Jewish community get online, but Cuban officials accused of him being part of a U.S. government plot to destabilize the island's single-party Communist government. Cuba has highly restricted Internet access, and most people are not able to access the Web in their homes or on their phones. On December 17, 2014, Gross was freed, along with three Cuban intelligence agents and a Cuban man convicted of spying for the United States. It was part of a deal between the Cuban and U.S. governments to reestablish diplomatic relations after five decades of Cold War animosity. Gross, his wife, Judy, his attorney and three U.S. congressmen flew from Havana to his home state of Maryland aboard a U.S. military jet, one of the smaller versions of Air Force One used to transport President Barack Obama. The image of Gross celebrating his freedom aboard the flight home with CNN reporting the news of his release on a TV screen in the background became the picture he would use on his @AlanPGross Twitter page. The night of his release, he enjoyed a meal of spicy Thai food with family and friends, a far cry from the bland rations he was forced to eat in prison. In January, Gross changed the status of his Facebook page to read that he had left his job as ""hostage"" at the Carlos Finlay military hospital where had been held in Havana. Later, he shared pictures of a visit to the dentist's office to replace the teeth that he lost while he was held in Cuba. With his dental concerns met, he moved on to food. Gross also recounted savoring long-denied bowls of chili and bagels loaded with lox and cream cheese. Many of the posts are the daily jottings of a man returning to his life after an extended absence: Gross renewing an expired driver's license or visiting a Starbucks for the first time in five years. But in other posts, he writes about taking in a sunset on the beach in Israel, seeing the snow fall in Washington and believing citizens in every country should have unimpeded access to the Internet. A spokeswoman for Gross turned down a CNN request for an interview with him but confirmed that the social media accounts are his. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the Democrat representing the Maryland district Gross hails from, called it ""incredibly moving"" that a man who spent five years in a Cuban prison has since sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and met the pope. More than that, he's come to signify the changing dynamics between officials in Washington and Havana. ""Alan did not ask for this special role in history,"" Van Hollen said, ""but he's become a catalyst for this new chapter in American and Cuban relations."" The photos that Gross posted online show a smiling man, slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison, no longer the gaunt-faced, hollow-eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in Cuba. ""The distance we've come since December 17th 2014 has been a rewarding journey,"" Gross wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. ""For which we're grateful.""","Rep.

"(CNN)The news that the U.S. military will charge Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl with desertion for abandoning his post in Afghanistan revives a deeply disturbing and morally wrenching incident in America's troubled war in Afghanistan. From the moment last year that the world learned about the prisoner-swap deal that secured his freedom, the questions that surrounded Begdahl's disappearance gained significance. After all, the United States had agreed to a very high price for his release. Based on the evidence that has come to public light, desertion seems the right charge against Bergdahl, whose comrades say he walked away, abandoning his commitments as a soldier in a war and creating new and greater dangers for them. But even before the charges were filed, there were other question whose answers are emerging. Was the United States right to negotiate a high-price trade? Did ""leave no man behind"" trump ""no negotiating with terrorists""? And if it did, did the importance of saving one man outweigh the dictate not to pay ransom even if that man was a traitor or a deserter? New information about his disappearance and life of the people freed in exchange for Bergdahl make the case all the more troubling. Bergdahl, you will recall, spent five years as a prisoner of the Haqqani network, a group allied with the Taliban organization, America's principal enemy in Afghanistan. Taliban fighters had captured him in June 2009, just after Bergdahl, apparently disenchanted with the military, left his post in southeastern Afghanistan. The Taliban handed the American soldier to the Haqqanis, who shuttled him between locations as they and their partners negotiated for his release, seeking to maximize the profit from their valuable captive. In May 2014 they struck a deal. Five Taliban commanders were flown out of the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, freed in exchange for the American soldier whose disappearance many had already labeled a desertion. The images became iconic. A strikingly pale Bergdahl, blinking painfully against the bright sun as he was handed over to U.S. officials. The scene contrasted sharply with a video of the Taliban chiefs' receiving a heroes' welcome in Qatar, where they prepared for a new life after their American captivity. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Bergdahl had served with ""honor and distinction."" If that had been the case, the trade would have proved much less controversial. But from the moment Bergdahl went missing there had been questions. In the letters he wrote home before vanishing, Bergdahl showed a steady erosion of his faith in the military and belief in the mission. ""The future is too good to waste on lies,"" he told his parents. ""And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others."" Men who had served with Bergdahl said he had simply walked off the base carrying little more than a compass. Not only would such a move constitute near-suicidal foolishness, it also put his comrades in great danger, particularly as they set out on a desperate quest to find him. What has been the cost of Bergdahl's odyssey? Some said the search for him cost the lives of six American soldiers. The specific circumstances are complicated, but it is clear that the six died in Paktika Province in the months after Bergdahl vanished, during a period in which every mission, even if not directly aimed at finding Bergdahl, included some element of a search. As one former team leader told CNN, ""when those soldiers were killed, they would not have been where they were if Bergdahl had not left."" One of them, 2nd Lt Darryn Andrews, received a posthumous Silver Star for saving the lives of five soldiers during a mission that had shifted from searching for a Taliban target to looking for Bergdahl. Andrews left behind a pregnant wife and a 2-year-old son. Then there is the cost of signaling to the Taliban, of telling all of America's enemies, that if they capture a U.S. service member they could trade him for a ransom. This could endanger other Americans. And there is another potential cost: The men who were freed in exchange for Bergdahl could go on to fight again. The more you learn about the details of their post-Guantanamo lives, the more distressing the transaction looks. Under the terms of the deal, Qatar agreed to keep the former prisoners from leaving the country for one year. In the meantime, they are said to be living a life of  fantastic comfort and luxury, courtesy of their gracious Qatari hosts. According to reports, they have each been allowed to bring five more families to keep them company. The 35 Taliban households are living in the lap of Qatari luxury, but the fighters are getting restless. At least two of the former Guantanamo detainees reportedly want to go back to the battlefield, perhaps adding to the eventual tally of the Bergdahl transaction. Now Bergdahl will face his punishment; he could be sentenced to life in prison for what the military says was desertion and misbehavior, and what his comrades said was a shameful betrayal -- one that cost lives. The question remains, should the United States have traded for this man? My sense is that the United States has a duty to the soldiers it sends to war. All soldiers should know that their country will do what it takes to bring them back. America could not leave Bergdahl to die in a mountain cave, especially if it did not know with certainty the circumstances of his disappearance -- but even if it did. Whether the Obama administration negotiated as effectively as it could have is another matter. On that count, I am skeptical. The trade -- Bergdahl for several hardened prisoners -- was a heart-splitting dilemma, but it was the right call.","Frida Ghitis: Desertion charges against Bowe Bergdahl revive questions: Was swap deal for him correct?

"(CNN)When it comes to the U.S. fraternity and sorority system, it's a disturbing truth: Life is largely segregated by race, money and power; and, yet, most of us find that unsurprising. This week, however, we got more evidence this callous status quo needs to change. The push came in the form of a nine-second YouTube video, which I'm sure you've seen by now. It reportedly shows members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma chanting these chilling lines: ""There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me."" ""The students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant,"" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin writes, describing a clip that rocketed around social media, leading OU's president, David Boren, to rightfully shutter and ban that fraternity from the school. The video is hard to watch, but I have a feeling it's one we need to see, both because it hints at the inner workings of certain Greek organizations, and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the United States. I'm thankful someone -- someone who was on the bus to witness the racist chants -- was brave enough to film this and to help it become public. That alone should give some reason for hope. Others weren't, but I was shocked by the video. This, in 2015? In my home state? Both of my parents participated in Greek life in Oklahoma, but at a different university. I know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement. What happened on the bus at OU doesn't negate their positive experiences. But it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion. Sometimes students are excluded from Greek life, in theory, because they're seen as uncool or don't ""fit in"" with a particular chapter. But we'd be kidding ourselves if we didn't realize that, often, a person's race -- or sexual orientation, for that matter --  factors into this you're-in, you're-out process. Oklahoma school's response to video caught between racism, Civil Rights Act . And it's hard for me not to see the SAE video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this exclusionist ideology. This is a case of dangerous group-think run amok. In a system that remains largely divided by race, perhaps videos like this shouldn't be so surprising. That's the view of Matthew Hughey, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who studies racial dynamics in American Greek life. The U.S. fraternity and sorority system is ""a form of American apartheid,"" he told me in an interview on Monday. Instead of thinking of the Oklahoma fraternity members as ""bad apples,"" he said, we should see them as part of a ""bad orchard."" That orchard includes, but isn't limited to, Greek organizations, he told me. It also includes the rest of us and our country's racist history. ""Largely, these organizations reflect a supersegregated and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world,"" he said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . Comparative data on the racial make-up of these organizations is impossible to come by, but anecdotal evidence suggests these groups are starkly divided by race. From 2003 to 2006, Hughey spent time interviewing students from Greek organizations at three colleges on the East Coast. ""At the time of interviews, the average membership size of the organizations was 63 members, and there was an average of 2.4 nonwhite members per organization,"" he wrote in a 2010 paper published by Society for the Study of Social Problems. That's 3.8% minority members, in those instances. Hughey's sample size is small but his results also echo what anyone who's spent time on a college campus knows to be true: There are white fraternities and there are black ones. Sometimes we even dare call them that. Far too many of us, especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in Greek life, either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism, sexism and violence in the U.S. Greek system as somehow isolated. It's clear that's not the case. ""In 1992, Texas A&M University fined its chapter $1,000 after it threw a 'jungle party' attended by frat brothers in blackface. Then in 2002, Syracuse University suspended its chapter after one of its members went to a bar in blackface. As recently as 2013, the fraternity got suspended following allegations it had photographed African American students while pledges recited rap lyrics laced with racial slurs,"" according to The Washington Post's Terrence McCoy. All of that was just SAE. Other examples are easy to come by, too. According to The New York Daily News, here's the text of an invitation to a 2013 Asian-themed Kappa Sigma party at Duke University: ""We look forward to having Mi, Yu, You and Yo Friends over for some Sake. Chank You."" And in January 2014, according to The New York Times, Arizona State University investigated an MLK-day party hosted by the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity in which ""nonblack students mocked blacks by donning loose basketball jerseys, flashing gang signs and drinking from hollowed-out watermelons."" It's clear there is a recurring problem here -- one that needs fixing. One easy place to start would be simply getting more information. Why don't universities force these organizations to report their demographics so we can see exactly how segregated this system really is? Hughey told me that data isn't available. Then we could know the answers to some interesting questions: How segregated are Greek organizations? Are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others? What's the trend over time? Is there progress? John Lewis on Oklahoma students: 'They should be gone' Universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations. Do traditionally black and Latino fraternities get as much school funding and attention as the white frats? If not, why? And why are these groups so incredibly divided in the first place? What does that do to the student body as a whole? I'm not calling for an end to the Greek system. But it's a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes. ""Any time there are racist remarks made, we must speak up as Americans,"" Boren, the OU president, said in a news conference. He added that he hopes the SAE students ""think long and hard"" about the incident as they pack up and vacate their fraternity house early this week. ""I hope they think long and hard about how words can injure and hurt other people,"" he said. The rest of us should do that, too.","CNN's John Sutter talks with a sociologist about race in the fraternity system .

"Paris (CNN)French lawmakers are weighing a ban on extremely thin models. New legislation debated in Parliament Tuesday would require modeling agencies to get medical certificates from models proving that their body mass index is at least 18. Models would also be required to undergo regular weight checks. And agencies that violate the law could face fines and even possible prison sentences. Dr. Olivier Veran, a doctor and French lawmaker who's proposing the measures, said it's time to put a stop to the practice of pressuring models to be so thin that it's dangerous for their health. ""We want to combat the idea that an agency could urge a model to stop eating; for example eating cotton balls to lose their appetite, to always lose more weight,"" he said. Seeing models' bones as they parade down the catwalk is a troubling trend, Veran said. ""We have had chief editors of prestigious magazines tell us that more and more often, they are obliged to use Photoshop, not to make the models look slimmer,"" he said, ""but to erase the tracks of bones under the skin, to make them look bigger."" Vernan's proposed amendments to a health bill would also target the dark online world of pro-anorexia websites that promote self-starvation and encourage young women to post photos of their emaciated frames. The average BMI for a woman in France is 23.2 -- the lowest average in Western Europe, according to a 2009 study from France's National Institute of Demographic Studies. In France, Veran said, 30,000-40,000 people suffer from eating disorders, mainly teenagers. Marisol Touraine, France's minister of social affairs, expressed her support for the new anti-anorexia measures in an interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV. ""The approach is good,"" she said, adding that the government will have to examine the wording of the new legislation in further detail. Extreme cases such as that of French model Isabelle Caro have sparked calls for change for years. Caro died in 2010, three years after she posed nude in a controversial ad campaign against anorexia. Similar concerns in Spain, Italy and Israel prompted those countries to adopt laws against the use of ultra-thin models on catwalks and in advertising campaigns. Israel even has strict rules on how model's bodies are Photoshopped; any changes must be clearly marked on the photo. Some in the industry are supportive of the proposed laws, but say they don't strike at the real issue. ""The fact of the matter is, fashion creatives have to think about the messaging they are promoting around body image ideals and the fact they are normalizing an unachievable physical appearance,"" said Caryn Franklin, a fashion commentator. Veran's legislation is set to go before the French Parliament at the end of the month for discussion. And he wants to outlaw what he calls starving models by the end of the year. ""I think that by the end of 2015,"" he said, ""we will no longer have anorexic models on the catwalk."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","French lawmakers are considering measures setting limits for how thin models can be .

"Barrington, New Hampshire (CNN)U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was delivering his normal rhetoric during a New Hampshire speech on Sunday, hitting the current administration on the economy, Obamacare and national security. ""And the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind -- the whole world is on fire,"" the senator from Texas declared. But he was stopped by a 3-year-old girl sitting in the front row. ""The world is on fire?"" she yelled out. Cruz took it and ran with it. ""The world is on fire -- yes! Your world is on fire,"" he exclaimed, seizing the moment as the crowd burst out into laughter. ""But you know what? Your mommy's here and everyone's here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better."" The scene -- while cute -- captured Cruz's determination to remain unwavering in his views and language, never backtracking. There was no ""just kidding"" or ""that was only a metaphor"" to assuage the little girl. Instead, the first-term senator continued with his speechifying and used the moment to illustrate his point that while things are bad now, they could get better -- especially, cough cough, if he becomes president. A woman who identified herself as the child's mother named Michelle later told the WRKO's Kuhner Report that her child's reaction came in a ""high question kind of voice,"" but that her daughter was ""quite happy"" in the aftermath. ""She really, basically was like 'oh, oh, this is a great man.' He's the firefighter in her mind as a three-year-old. And was quite happy and she wanted a cookie."" Cruz is bringing the resolute disruptor brand that he's built in Congress out on the trail as he lays the groundwork for a White House bid. This weekend, he was on a two-day swing through New Hampshire, stopping Sunday afternoon at an event put on by the Strafford County GOP. In the same way Cruz challenges establishment Republicans in the Senate, he's trying to build a campaign that breaks from the mold and showcases his firebrand conservatism. For example, his first question from the audience came from a woman who wanted to know how Cruz was going to make campaign finance reform a reality, a huge issue in the first-in-the-nation primary state. But Cruz argued that not only is money a form of speech, it emboldens speech. ""The answer is not to muzzle citizens; it's to empower citizens across the country,"" he said. Throwing a bone to his questioner, however, he said he supports requiring that campaign donations be disclosed. He took the same steadfast approach last weekend in Iowa, when he and other contenders were asked about the ethanol mandate requiring that gasoline contain a certain amount of ethanol -- a popular regulation in Iowa where corn is king. While nearly every other potential candidate expressed at least some measure of support for the mandate, Cruz flatly opposed it, saying in front of close to a thousand Iowa farmers that he doesn't think the government should be involved in the private sector. Gov. Scott Walker, who's vying with Jeb Bush for frontrunner status, said he supported the mandate in Iowa, despite previously opposing it in his home state of Wisconsin . Asked by reporters Sunday about accusations that Walker is a flip-flopper, Cruz first praised his potential rival but made sure to mention that candidates need to be challenged on their actions. ""It's easy for candidates to give an answer,"" he said, but added: ""The proof is in the pudding. What I've urged Republicans to ask of every candidate is: Have you walked the walk? Show me your record."" Cruz got heavy applause when he said he wanted to ""repeal every word of Common Core,"" a set of testing standards that Jeb Bush staunchly defended when he appeared at a nearby event in Dover, New Hampshire just two days earlier. Common Core, however, was not legislation approved by Congress. Rather, it was created by a bipartisan group of governors and state leaders, and states received financial incentives by the government to adopt the standards. Still, Cruz played somewhat coy with his White House aspirations, aware of the tight federal regulations that would start holding contenders to different standards once they admit they're running for president. When voters pressed him Sunday to make a White House bid, Cruz told them to ""stay tuned."" ""I'm looking at it very, very seriously,"" he told the audience. ""I would point out a week ago I was in Iowa, yesterday I was in South Carolina, and today I'm in New Hampshire."" But he truly charmed the crowd when he said that after he and his wife got their daughters a puppy recently, one of the girls gave her approval for Cruz's presidential aspirations. ""If you win, that means Snowflake will finally get a backyard to pee in,"" his daughter said, according to Cruz. In terms of energy and turnout, Sunday's event stood out from other events held by potential White House contenders who were in New Hampshire this weekend, in part because it was open to the public, unlike other events headlined by Walker and Bush. His remarks were met with boisterous applause, and he was frequently urged to run for president by people who shook his hand before and after the event. Halfway through Cruz's remarks, a small-business owner in the audience was called on to ask a question but instead stood up proudly next to the senator and went off into a two-minute rant about how other Republicans in Washington aren't representing their conservative constituents. ""It is D-Day in America folks,"" he said, getting the crowd on their feet. ""We can't wait for another Republican. We need Ted Cruz."" The man said his wife wrote a blank check for Cruz and pulled out his wallet, only to throw it on the ground at Cruz's feet. ""For those who believe in miracles, this gentleman just threw his wallet at a politician,"" Cruz said, getting a big laugh from the crowd. ""And he actually got it back."" Cruz could not accept the money because he's not yet a candidate. One man, Bill Higgins, stood outside in the snow for four hours hoping Cruz would meet his goat named Izak, an apparent fixture on the campaign trail which was wearing a hat that said ""I voted"" and who happened to bite Jon Huntsman in 2011. Cruz waved hello at Higgins as the senator exited the building Sunday afternoon but didn't stop to greet the goat. ""He'll be back again,"" Higgins said, trying to appear unfazed. ""I'm sure he wants to get to his next stop.""","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz visits New Hampshire, hits the White House on economy and Obamacare .

"London (CNN)Best-selling British fantasy author Terry Pratchett has died at the age of 66, his website said Thursday. Pratchett, who wrote more than 70 books, including those in his ""Discworld"" series, had been diagnosed with a rare form of Alzheimer's disease in 2007. A statement on the website announced the news of his death at home Thursday with ""immeasurable sadness."" ""I was deeply saddened to learn that Sir Terry Pratchett has died. The world has lost one of its brightest, sharpest minds,"" said Larry Finlay, managing director at Transworld Publishers. ""In over 70 books, Terry enriched the planet like few before him. As all who read him know, 'Discworld' was his vehicle to satirize this world: He did so brilliantly, with great skill, enormous humor and constant invention."" Pratchett continued to write following his diagnosis, completing his last book, a new Discworld novel, in the summer of 2014. Revealing his illness in 2007, the author -- who had a strong following among fans of fantasy fiction -- said he had been diagnosed with ""a very rare form of early onset Alzheimer's,"" which he described as ""an embuggerance."" He said then, ""Frankly, I would prefer it if people kept things cheerful, because I think there's time for at least a few more books yet."" According to Thursday's statement, he had posterior cortical atrophy, a progressive degenerative condition involving the loss and dysfunction of brain cells, particularly at the back of the brain. The last posts on his verified Twitter account, run by Pratchett with close friend Rob Wilkins, give a poignant farewell -- and have already been retweeted thousands of times. ""AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER,"" the first tweet in the series reads -- an apparent reference to Death, a recurring and generally sympathetic character in the Discworld books, who always speaks in ALL CAPS. ""Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night. ""The End."" Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, a charitable organization, said Pratchett -- who spoke out publicly about his condition and called for greater funding for Alzheimer's research -- had ""fundamentally changed the way dementia is seen and understood."" ""His vehement determination to reduce the stigma of dementia meant he helped drag it out of the shadows -- kicking and screaming at times,"" he said. ""Shouting from the rooftops about the absurdity of how little funding dementia research receives, and fighting for good quality dementia care, he was and will remain the truest of champions for people with the condition."" Pratchett was also a patron of the British Humanist Association, which paid tribute Thursday to the humor and dedication with which the author ""turned his suffering into a positive campaign."" Pratchett, who began writing while a provincial newspaper journalist in the 1960s, became a full time writer in 1987 and received the Order of the British Empire ""for services to literature"" from Prince Charles in 1998.

"(CNN)From the moment we are born, the first question our parents are asked is, ""Is it a boy or a girl?"" The answer to that seemingly simple question quickly establishes the child's path and trajectory for years to come; however, the question is not simple. The question is tragically flawed and here's a newsflash for everyone who has ever asked new parents that question: You're asking the wrong people. I realize that parents are simply sharing a bit of biological information based on their baby's physical ""parts,"" but only that beautiful baby can accurately and authentically tell you what gender he or she is. You may want to give it a little time before you paint that nursery bright pink or pick out junior's first baseball glove -- it's just not that simple. I may only be 15 years old and will be the first to admit that I know very little about this great big world, but I know way too much about gender and being mislabeled. Why transgender teen Jazz Jennings is everywhere . You see, the doctor told my parents, ""It's a girl,"" but he couldn't have been more wrong. Aside from my biology, I knew I was a boy from the age of 2. I was 100% sure of who I was and biology was an insignificant part of the conversation. Keep in mind that this was a time before I had even realized that being a boy trapped in a girl's body was anything beyond normal, and this was long before I could possibly articulate what was happening. However, there was no need to articulate anything. I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind -- not yet distorted by biology, other people's confusion, or fear. It was when I was older that other people let me know something was ""off."" No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part. I want to address the moment where people, gender, and respectful communication part ways. That is the moment when the word ""sexuality"" creeps into the conversation. That is when people get scared, cite religion, start whispering, and disconnect. It's a sad moment, but I get it. People have always mocked what they don't understand, and this is a tough one for most to grasp. That said, it has to change and I believe it is changing. The transgender life: What to know, say and understand . I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight. Save your fear people. This is not something to be afraid of; it's an opportunity for us to evolve. Nothing is completely black or white, hot or cold, here or there, or male and female; there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that, the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are. It all starts by taking sexuality out of the initial conversation. I first heard the term ""gay"" in the second grade, long after I had my first ""girlfriend"" and had proudly written ""a penis"" at the top of my Christmas list. Not until after I learned that there was such a thing as sexuality and homosexuality did I become afraid of who I was. It wasn't until I learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality ""abnormal"" or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that I became terrified that I was ""different."" I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay -- but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over. Thankfully, I grew up in a household that taught me that I could love anybody I wanted to and it was fine because it is fine. Anyone can love anyone and there is nothing wrong with that. Fortunately, people have developed more of an understanding of that over time, but there are always going to be people that think differently and we all have to accept that. Do they matter? Of course they do because we all matter, equally; however, ignorant people are here to help us learn how to better communicate; everyone is reachable with the right circumstances and I look forward to the battles as much as the victories. As long as you're happy, you're indestructible. That said, I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either. I was afraid of being thought of differently. The most crippling fear came from people not understanding that I was a boy trapped in a girl's body and simply labeling me something I'm not. That's what I was truly afraid of. Experience how one family reacted when their daughter said she's a boy. CNN Films presents ""Raising Ryland,"" a short film available exclusively on CNN Digital on Wednesday, March 18. Discovering that I was transgender was a miraculous moment. I finally found the key that unlocked the cage I'd been trapped in for 14 years and that's why I call this journey, ""My Transcension."" With the support of my parents, I am sharing my story. Breaking free and owning your sexuality is something you find within yourself and is spectacular, but it is just the tiniest part of the greater transgender conversation. I am going beyond that and my journey is one that is constantly moving forward and upward. I'm taking the body I was born into and transforming it into the body I know I'm supposed to be in -- thanks to my family, friends, Dr. Jo Olson, the support groups, the science, and lastly, myself. See, that's the irony, I was the first person and truly the only person capable of answering the ""is it a boy or girl"" question -- not the doctor, my parents, or anyone who thinks they know better. That is the lesson, let each of us dictate our own path and respect everyone's choice. I realize that it's easier said than done but if you read this and find yourself open to a new conversation about gender, I consider that a win for us all. Truthfully, I'm most proud of myself for having the courage to find my own way and owning it, to proudly begin my transcencion from someone I wasn't -- into the man I always knew I'd become. Whether I'm a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it's completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I'm Avery Wallace and I've always known exactly who I was. I'm here to share my journey and hopefully, help someone else recognize theirs.","Avery Wallace says he knew he was a boy from age 2 .

"(CNN)Two million illnesses. 23,000 deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that's the human toll from antibiotic-resistant ""superbugs"" each year in the United States. To fight the growing problem of infections that can't be treated, the administration of President Barack Obama is implementing a five-year national action plan at a cost of $1.2 billion. Those funds, part of the President's 2015 budget, which must still be approved by Congress, would nearly double the amount of federal money allocated to the fight. The plan calls for creating a ""one-health"" approach to testing and reporting superbugs around the country, as well as establishing a DNA database of resistant bacteria. New, rapid tests to detect emerging resistant bacteria will be developed. Research for new antibiotics and vaccines will accelerate. The plan calls for two new options for people, and three for animals, by 2020. Global surveillance and cooperation is also stressed, including a global database for animals. A key goal is to slow the growth and spread of superbugs by reducing the use of antibiotics when they aren't needed. The plan calls for a 50% reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use in doctor's offices and a 20% reduction in hospital use by 2020. ""This is a lofty goal,"" said internist and Emory Associate Professor Dr. Sandra Fryhofer. ""It's important for both patients and professionals to be on board."" There are still details to work out. ""Who determines what's appropriate?"" asked Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu. ""Are we going to have a checklist of requirements that have to be met? I think it might be a bit tough to measure, but I think improvement can definitely happen."" A recent survey of 796 health care professionals found 63% of the sample prescribed antibiotics when they weren't absolutely necessary, at least 10% of the time. A top reason: the patient requested it. ""Some patients put a lot of pressure on doctors to give them an antibiotic, and they may think they're not getting good care if they're not given one. But that's just not true,"" said Fryhofer. ""It's become like an insurance policy but it's an insurance policy that doesn't give good dividends."" ""I do find there is a lot of education that has to go on with patients that might expect antibiotics when their child is sick,"" said Shu, ""but I think in recent years I have seen more of an awareness, and many of my patients are more hesitant to ask."" Another part of the plan pledges to eliminate the widespread use of antibiotics to boost the growth of animals raised for food. It will also phase in oversight by veterinarians for other uses of antibiotics in feed and water. While applauding the spirit of the pledge, critics say the limits are still too voluntary and limited in scope. ""The problem we have with the plan is that it only removes the growth claims from the label,"" said senior analyst Steve Roach at Keep Antibiotics Working. ""What we hoped for in the plan was a commitment from FDA to identify which antibiotic uses other than growth promotion need to be changed."" ""With 80% of the antibiotics produced in the United States being used in agriculture mostly for prevention,"" said Louise Slaughter, D-New York, who has an alternate proposal in front of Congress, ""any meaningful solution to the looming antibiotic resistance crisis must begin with limits on the farm. Trusting a voluntary policy that lets industry police itself will not bring about real change.""","Antibiotic resistance is a pressing public health issue, CDC says .

"Leicester, England (CNN)Richard III, the King found beneath a car parking lot, has been reburied in a solemn but celebratory service, 530 years after his death in battle. The remains of the medieval monarch were sensationally rediscovered beneath a blanket of tarmac in the center of Leicester in August 2012. They have been pored over by scientists at the city's university ever since, but after more than two years of legal wranglings, the bones were finally laid to rest Thursday in a coffin built by Richard III's distant relative, Michael Ibsen, whose DNA helped prove their identity. It was standing room-only at Leicester Cathedral -- which had been partially rebuilt for the occasion -- as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby led prayers for the long-dead King, swinging incense and sprinkling holy water over the casket, before scattering it with earth from key locations marking his birth, life and death. Oscar-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch, a distant cousin of England's last Plantagenet King, read a poem dedicated to Richard III, written by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. ""My bones, scripted in light, upon cold soil, a human braille. My skull, scarred by a crown, emptied of history. Describe my soul as incense, votive, vanishing; your ownthe same. Grant me the carving of my name."" Queen Elizabeth, represented at the ceremony by the Countess of Wessex, sent a special message to mark the reinterment, which she hailed as ""an event of great  national and international significance."" ""Today we recognize a King who lived through turbulent times and whose Christan faith sustained him in life and death,"" it read. But though it bore many of the hallmarks of grief -- polished coffin, empty tomb, relatives clad in gloomy, pitch-dark suits -- this was not, the organizers insisted, a sad occasion. ""This is not a funeral at which we mourn,"" said Professor Gordon Campbell, of the University of Leicester, welcoming the congregation to the cathedral, just yards from that famous parking lot. Instead, the aim of the service was to offer Richard III a fitting farewell, and a lasting memorial -- neither of which he was granted following his death at Bosworth in 1485. Back then, his body was slung over a horse and carried back to Leicester -- legend has it that his head struck Bow Bridge on the way -- before being put on display for three days, to prove to friends and foes alike that he really was dead, before being slung into a hastily-dug grave at the Church of the Grey Friars. Now Richard's bones, accompanied by a specially-crafted rosary, recognizing his Catholic faith, rest in a lead-lined coffin of English oak, his grave marked by a 2.3 ton block of pale Swaledale fossil limestone resting on a plinth of black Kilkenny marble carved with his name, dates, coat of arms, and his symbol: a white boar. Speaking before the commemorations, Philippa Langley, founder of the ""Looking for Richard"" project, said she did not expect to feel upset at the reinterment: ""Richard died over 500 years ago, so I don't think there will be a sense of sadness there at all. I hope there's perhaps some joy, that something has been done well and right and that we've made peace with the past."" But Ibsen admitted he found Sunday's service at which the remains were carried in to the cathedral surprisingly moving: ""there was a slight dampening of the eyeballs, which caught me completely unawares,"" he said phlegmatically. ""Leicester born and bred"" sisters Susan Foster and Sharon Stirling were among the crowds waiting outside the cathedral to listen in on the service and catch a glimpse of the guests arriving. ""This is history, isn't it, it's never going to happen again,"" said Foster. ""We grew up with all the stories of Richard III. We lived close to Bow Bridge, so we know all the legends about him."" Stirling said she thought the Richard III story would be a big bonus for the city: ""I think it will boost the economy and bring visitors in -- he's got quite a fan club, after all."" Leicester has always been proud of its links to Richard III; the city boasts pubs and schools named in his honor, there's a walking tour and a brand new visitor center built over his original grave. But in recent days, interest has risen to fever pitch: shop windows are full of Richard-themed displays offering everything from wooden toy castles to chain mail jewelery. The florist around the corner from the cathedral is doing a roaring trade in white roses, which people have been leaving at Richard III's statue, and his face is emblazoned on all manner of souvenirs, from paperweights and pens to mugs and bars of chocolate. There's even a ""Return of the King"" beer -- locally brewed and promising ""a distinctive regal flavor."" Some 35,000 people lined the bunting-and-flag-draped streets of Leicester and its surrounding villages on Sunday to watch as the King's coffin was carried in a procession out to the scene of his death and back again. Another 20,000 lined up for hours to file past the casket and pay their respects as it lay ""in repose"" at the cathedral in the days since, watched over by an honor guard of veterans. Among them was Jane Gregory, who traveled two hours by bus from her home in South Derbyshire twice in a week to be there. ""It was just something I had to see and experience -- it's part of history,"" she told CNN outside the reburial service on Thursday. ""I came on Monday too, to view the coffin -- it was a great experience. I queued for two and a half hours and it was worth every minute."" History enthusiast Paul Eames stood in the drizzle and watched the service on his iPad after missing out on a ticket -- to his wife Karen: ""I applied for tickets for both of us; I could have cried when I saw the envelope with her name on it."" ""I didn't originally want to go,"" Karen admitted, smiling. ""But he told me 'you'll be part of history, you don't realize!' The service was amazing, really lovely."" Not everyone was there just to celebrate Richard III, though. Leicester student Sherry Xie said she was ""proud"" of her university's role in the discovery of his bones, but she and her classmate Wendy Jiang admitted they'd come along with an ulterior motive: ""to see Benedict!"" In his sermon, the Bishop of Leicester, Tim Stevens said those who had joined the commemorations ""(came) not to judge, condemn or praise, but to stand in silent, humble and reverent attentiveness at the meeting place of time and eternity."" Stevens said the search for Richard III had ""broken open not just a car park, but a nation's story."" It also provoked bitter quarrels between rival factions over where and how he should be buried, and how much scientific testing he should be subjected to. But Campbell insisted that the service was held in a ""spirit of reconciliation,"" a thought echoed by Stevens: ""Whether we bear a white or a red rose, whether for Richard or Henry ... whether for Leicester or York, we recognize at the graveside that all our journeys lead us to this place, where reputation counts for nothing and all human striving turns to dust."" Langley, the driving force behind the search for the King, said Thursday's service would mark the end of one chapter in the long-running saga; but she said work to re-examine Richard's life and legacy would go on. ""It's the conclusion to his story in that he's been found ... and we're laying his physical remains to rest. But in terms of Richard's story, that is only just beginning.""","Remains of Richard III were sensationally rediscovered 530 years after death .

"(CNN)Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength. There are no official rules to this female fight club. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014. Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or ""cat fight."" There's no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they've decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside. ""When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,"" said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. ""Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat."" At first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn't satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action. ""It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,"" she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. ""I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet."" For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn't always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning ""How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?"" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,"" she said. She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too -- they're mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives. Even years later, the fight club is still running and is ""better than ever,"" Mazur said. ""Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,"" Mazur said. ""It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind)."" Katarzyna Mazur is a Polish photographer based in Berlin.

"Hong Kong (CNN)Taipei is fast becoming the go-to Asian city for some of Hollywood's biggest hitters. Martin Scorsese is filming his latest opus ""Silence"" there, and French director Luc Besson chose Taipei over seven other Asian cities for his sci-fi thriller ""Lucy,"" starring Scarlett Johansson. And this May ""The Walking Dead"" star Andrew Lincoln will begin filming in the city for a movie project. Tasked with attracting international film makers, Jennifer Jao, head of the Taipei Film Commission, said that 92 foreign film crews shot in the city last year, up from 56 in 2013. ""We hope the whole island can be like a big studio,"" she told CNN while in Hong Kong Thursday. It wasn't always this way. For years, Taiwan, while home to acclaimed filmmakers like Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, was overlooked in favor of its ritzier neighbors Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo. And even when Hollywood came knocking, the city didn't always have its act together. The producers of ""Mission Impossible III,"" released in 2006, had wanted to film at Taipei 101, at that time the world's tallest skyscraper. But faced with red tape and reluctance, they ended up choosing the 53-story Shanghai Bank of China Tower for Tom Cruise's memorable bungee jump. ""We lost an opportunity for the world to get to know Taipei,"" says Jao. Jao's commission was set up in 2008 to court international film makers but it wasn't until director Ang Lee, who was born in Taiwan, filmed the Oscar-winning hit ""Life of Pi"" on the island that it began to earn a reputation as an accommodating and affordable place to shoot. Lee filmed the memorable and technically difficult scenes of a shipwrecked boy and a tiger at a purpose-built facility at abandoned airport in the Taiwanese city of Taichung. With its relatively unknown cityscape, Taiwan can also function as a generic Asian backdrop. The island, which was a Japanese colony, is already being used as a stand-in for Japan. Japanese director Takashi Miike used Taiwan's high-speed rail system in a bullet-strewn action sequence for crime drama ""Shield of Straw,"" which competed at the Cannes International Film Festival. Japanese rail authorities turned him away. And Scorsese's ""Silence,"" due to release in 2016, is a historic drama about two Jesuit priests who travel to Japan. Taiwan is also a popular alternative to China, where there are many restrictions on filmmakers -- authorities can censor scripts considered politically sensitive or obscene. Hong Kong director John Woo used both Taiwan and China as locations in ""The Crossing."" Dubbed China's ""Titanic,"" it focuses on a ship that sank when the Nationalist government fled China for Taiwan in 1949 as the Communists took over -- a sensitive period in Chinese history. Taiwan and China are still governed separately. Chinese authorities asked Woo to tone down the heroics of a Nationalist soldier, according to the South China Morning Post -- not something that Taiwan would ever require, says Jao. The commission offers incentives for international film crews. Up to $2 million is available per movie -- half of that as a cash subsidy. But just as important is the island's versatility as a location, says Jao. While many of the film crews are from neighboring Asian countries, the city has hosted crews from Latvia and Germany, while the BBC shot some of its newly released drama ""X+Y"" in the city. ""It's a small island. Within half an hour, you can go from the streets to the mountains to the sea.""","Taipei is attracting more international film crews .

"(CNN)In 2011, journalists flocked to Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to cover the presidential election and the violence leading up to the vote. Photographer Leonard Pongo had different plans. ""I could have focused on the election, but I chose to follow people around,"" Pongo said. ""I wanted to experience what life in the country was like ... to understand another side of those events -- not those usually reported, but one that was much more personal."" It was Pongo's burning personal quest that brings us ""The Uncanny,"" a black-and-white series that helps us experience the Congo in flesh and blood. These rich portraitures and compositions of Pongo's family members give us a vivid emotion of what it is like to be human as your country spirals into chaos. It is also a photographic detour from the cliche images of the Congo -- a subtler but deeply psychological representation of how war affects daily lives. War is something only experienced marginally by Pongo, who was born and raised in Belgium to a Belgian mother and a Congolese father. Stories of the Congo were narratives whispered into his European upbringing. ""I had never been,"" to Congo, he said. ""It was a latent desire I had for a very long time to go there. I don't feel particularly drawn to Belgium ... but going (to Congo) made me feel even more lost."" Connecting with his family in the Congo, the photographer attended baptisms and weddings, exorcisms and political rallies. Everywhere he looked, he felt a challenge to his core beliefs as he went down his DNA chain. ""I felt very challenged in my identity, sometimes as a 'white,' others as a 'black' person,"" Pongo said. ""This led to many conflicts, internal and external; many arguments; and it also directed the way I photographed."" While feeling the warm welcome of his family, Pongo still felt a certain reticence when they looked at the camera. Their trust was not always unshakable, and that state of awareness become synonymous with the Congo. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. He uses a photo of a family reunion -- the first in the gallery above -- as an example. ""I find that photo a little disturbing, because all the gazes are going into different directions,"" Pongo said. ""There are clearly some mixed emotions here. And that is the DRC. It is a very complex country, and it is not always easy to read which signs are being communicated. There is a state of tension and confusion."" Working with the approach of an artisan, Pongo plays with light to create a certain magic in the aura of the people he portrays. It is a useful tool in a place with so many contrasts. ""I like to remain loyal to the principles of film development and darkrooms,"" said Pongo, who shot ""The Uncanny"" on a digital camera. ""The light is a combination of using flashes and taking advantage of the amazing presence of the sun. The humid atmosphere, fog and dust renders some interesting possibilities ... like a natural filter."" Pongo went back in 2013 and said his journey through the country is not over yet. ""I think I reached my objective, to embed into the daily life in the Congo, which clearly transformed me,"" he said. ""I was allowed into the life of people who were former strangers ... and got a deeper understanding of what daily life in the Congo could feel like. ""I was also deeply impressed to discover how much life there is in this country, how much more there is to discover, how complex it is to understand, and how much work that will require.""

"London (CNN)CNN International presented the CNN Journalist Award for excellent international coverage to up-and-coming journalists from Germany, Austria and German-speaking parts of Switzerland at an exclusive dinner at the London Century Club last week. The event, in the award's 10th year, was hosted by Greg Beitchman, VP for content sales and partnerships CNNI, who talked about its commitment to recognizing those who stand out, stand up and make an impact. Gerhard Zeiler, President Turner International, delivered key remarks focusing on the importance of accurate and passionate story-telling, and London Bureau Chief Tommy Evans underlined that in journalism, it's all about authenticity. London-based anchors Hala Gorani and Nina dos Santos, and Turner's MD for Germany, Austria and Switzerland Hannes Heyelmann, were among other colleagues attending the event, and Daniel Puntas Bernet and Jörg Thadeusz from the awards jury were also on hand. As the presentations got under way, the next big stars of German-speaking journalism covering international issues were honored in the categories of TV, Radio, Print, Online and Photography. Stephanie Doetzer (DRadio Wissen), winner in the Radio category, was revealed as CNN Journalist of the Year 2015 for her moving radio piece ""Take care, Habibi."" The ceremony was followed the next day by a series of masterclasses held at Turner House where guests heard from CNN producers and editors about how CNN International deals with data, its approach to social media and what it takes to produce a successful online video. Award winners were then hosted at a special lunch by London Bureau Chief Tommy Evans and Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour. The awards were an inspirational testament to the power of good journalism and everyone involved with the event was thrilled to host the winners for this special program of events. CNN Journalist of the Year 2015 and Winner in the category Radio: Stephanie Doetzer: ""Take care, Habibi"" (DRadio Wissen) Stories about the civil war in Syria are often quite abstract. Yet, a war is very real. It is not only about the destruction of residential areas and fighting militia. It is also about families that argue about what happens, about friends who don't talk to each other anymore and relationships that fall apart. Political life becomes private, and personal life becomes political -- for all Syrians but also for those who feel connected with Syria. ""This contribution is written as a first-person narrative that is very compelling and emotional. It forces you to see what is happening in Syria, and there was no doubt that it had to win the award. The contribution has won our hearts by a long way, we are completely convinced,"" says jury member Ingrid Thurnher. Photography: Jelca Kollatsch (""Houses without People and People without Houses"", ver.di Publik) The photo series by Jelca Kollatsch shows the effects of the financial crisis on people in Spain who live in Andalusia, the region with the country's highest rates of unemployment and evictions. ""The contribution covers an important issue, and it tells a story, almost following the structure of a drama: With breathtaking rigor, the artist goes from the sources of the problem to the eviction of the people in the end,"" the jury said. Online: Christian Salewski and Felix Rohrbeck (""The GPS chase. What happens with our waste?"", ARTE Future) AND Trainees of Deutsche Welle: ""My Granny, the Regime and I"" (DW) This year, the jury chose two winners in the category Online: ""Digital journalism has a lot to offer. The two prizewinners represent a different approach in an interesting way and show how journalism generally evolves with multimedia possibilities,"" explains the jury. In the first contribution, Christian Salewski und Felix Rohrbeck track the disposal of electronic scrap in Germany and find out that it isn't always legal and fair. In the second contribution, a group of Deutsche Welle trainees asked their grandmothers from Belarus, Brazil, Chile, China, Kenya and Germany about their personal experiences in times of dictatorship or autocracy. They created a multimedia online project with videos, words and images, combining the stories of the grandmothers with the history of the different countries. Print: Alexandra Rojkov and Jan Ludwig (""You think you can help me?"", Der Tagesspiegel) The contribution of the two authors tells the personal story of an escape from Syria and asks how far we would go in a safe country like Germany to help people in war and crisis zones. ""The authors touch their audience by transferring the ongoing conflict in Syria to the fate of two individuals,"" says jury chairman Franz Fischlin. TV: Lukas Augustin (""Unforgiven"", NDR) Twenty years after the civil war in Rwanda, the victims and the offenders live door to door. Lukas Augustin presents a documentary about the efforts made to foster forgiveness. The movie provides insight into the tangle of guilt and atonement in modern Rwanda. ""This contribution is more than a TV documentary. It is a film about a country that deals with its own history in an incredibly spectacular and exceptional way,"" says jury member Ingrid Thurnher. The jury members of this year's CNN Journalist Award were: Franz Fischlin (Tagesschau host, editor and reporter SRF), Frederik Pleitgen (CNN senior international correspondent), Stefan Plöchinger (editor-in-chief sueddeutsche.de & member of the editorial board Süddeutsche Zeitung), Ingrid Thurnher (host and editor ORF), Hans Demmel (managing director n-tv),Daniel Puntas Bernet (editor-in-chief of the magazine Reportagen) and Jörg Thadeusz (host, author, journalist).

"(CNN)On any other Wednesday morning, the steps in front of the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium would be packed with kids on their way to class, discussing homework, chattering about last night's TV shows, or laying out plans for the coming weekend. But not today. Instead, students approached in silence, carrying photographs and flowers. In small groups, the teenagers lined up to lay tributes to their lost classmates before hugging each other wordlessly, or dissolving into tears. At 10:53 a.m. Tuesday morning, this school in the small western German town of Haltern was changed forever by events more than 1,000 km (about 620 miles) away. A Germanwings plane carrying 16 of its pupils and their two teachers home from a school exchange trip to Spain crashed in the French Alps, killing all of those on board. Headmaster Ulrich Wessel said when the first reports of a crash came through he was still hopeful, thinking ""perhaps they had missed the plane, or perhaps there was a second Germanwings flight at the same time."" Instead, the worst was confirmed, leaving him ""stunned and somewhat speechless,"" the community devastated and the classmates of the dead struggling to understand their loss. ""A week ago Tuesday we sent 16 happy young people and two young colleagues off on a trip,"" Wessel told reporters. ""What was intended as a school exchange ended in tragedy."" Of the 16 teenagers killed, 14 were girls, and two boys; one of the two female teachers who died was a newlywed. In a post on the school's website, Wessel and other school representatives announced the names of the dead, ""who will never again return to us,"" leaving all those concerned ""unutterably sad."" The teenagers who died were: Linda Bergjurgen, Elena Bless, Lea Druppel, Selina Eils, Gina Michelle Gerdes, Ann-Christin Hahn, Julia Hermann, Marleen Koch, Paula Lutkenhaus, Fabio Rogge, Rabea Scheideler, Lea Schukart, Helena Siebe, Steffen Strang, Aline Venhoff and Caja Westermann. The two teachers were identified as Sonja Cercek and Stefanie Tegethoff. As news of the crash spread, the area at the entrance to the school became a makeshift memorial, filled with red and white candles, notes and swiftly-painted signs. ""Yesterday we were many, today we are alone,"" reads one. ""Why?"" demands another, with painful simplicity. Philippa, a friend of many of those who died, told CNN she was shocked by what had happened: ""I knew all of them, they were in my grade. To some I was very close. ""We had already planned things for the future, what we were going to do when they returned from their trip. It is very hard to believed that we cannot do that."" Grief counselors, chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster. ""I've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve,"" said Wessel. ""I hope we will all get through it, if we share it."" As the world's media descend on the town, messages of support have come flooding in too. The local newspaper is running an online book of condolence, in which people can leave messages of sympathy and ""light"" virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school. ""A silent hug says more than many words,"" wrote Manuela Donovang. ""Wishing the families, friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead."" In his message, Udo Hentschel said the suffering of the parents, friends and families was ""incomprehensible, unfathomable"" and offered them his condolences: ""This, the worst of all fates, will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together."" In an attempt to show that solidarity, schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on Friday at 10:53 a.m., the time the plane crashed. For the classmates of those who will never return, that silence will go on, as the seats they left empty remain unfilled in the weeks and months to come. ""Our school is no longer what it once was,"" said Wessel. ""In Haltern we had 1,283 students. It is horrifying that now we have 16 fewer.""","German town of Haltern in mourning after loss of 16 students and two teachers in plane crash .

The academy will display the ship in its museum of movie history, scheduled to open in 2017 in Los Angeles. ""We're excited to add such an iconic piece of movie history to our collection,"" the academy told CNN in a statement.

"(CNN)The prospect of a Palestinian state is nil so long as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in office, Netanyahu said in a Monday interview. Asked by an interviewer with the Israeli news site, NRG, if it was true that a Palestinian nation would never be formed while he's prime minister, Netanyahu replied, ""Indeed."" His interview with NRG came as he courted conservative supporters a day before Israelis head to the polls for national elections. ""Anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state, anyone who is going to evacuate territories today, is simply giving a base for attacks to the radical Islam against Israel,"" he said. ""This is the true reality that was created here in the last few years."" Netanyahu went on to say that any opponents on the left who might argue otherwise are ""sticking their head in the sand, time and time again."" He further said a strong government led by his Likud Party is necessary to beat back international pressure to divide Jerusalem and return Israel to its pre-1967 borders, according to a Jewish Telegraphic Agency report on the NRG interview. ""I do not give in,"" Netanyahu told NRG. ""We stood fast against huge pressure, and we will continue to do so."" Following Netanyahu's interview, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who is also a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the Israeli Prime Minister's stance is nothing new. ""Netanyahu has done everything possible to bury the two-state solution,"" he said. ""Netanyahu's statement at the illegal settlement of Har Homa is a response to all those governments who tried to block Palestinian diplomatic initiatives. He couldn't have done that without counting on full impunity from the international community. Now the world must learn its lesson and understand that impunity won't bring peace, only justice will."" Earlier in the day, Netanyahu continued his efforts to drum up support during a campaign speech in the Har Homa neighborhood of Jerusalem, which he boasted that he helped establish in 1997, during his first prime ministerial term. Israel considers Har Homa part of a unified Jerusalem, while Palestinians consider the neighborhood an illegal settlement. If he is re-elected, Netanyahu said, he will continue to promote construction in Jerusalem as a means of national security, he said. ""The pressure around this decision back then was enormous. But I insisted -- I ordered the construction and it paid off,"" he said. ""Today, Har Homa is a flourishing neighborhood in which tens of thousands of Israeli civilians are living. As we proved in the past, my friends in the Likud Party and I, we will keep Jerusalem protected and keep developing it."" Opposition leaders Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni of the Zionist Union, he alleged, are ""ready to surrender to every dictate."" Livni, he said, has denounced previous calls for more construction in Jerusalem's Jewish neighborhoods, while Herzog would strive to establish a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. ""I will not let that happen,"" he said. ""My friends and I in the Likud will keep Jerusalem united in all its parts, and we will keep fortifying it so that dividing it will not be possible and it will always remain united. We will keep developing our eternal capital."" A vote for Herzog or Livni is a vote for the establishment of ""Hamastan,"" Netanyahu said, referring to Hamas, the Islamist group which dominates Gaza. He further alleged that his opponents would yield to international pressure and ""huge financial support coming from abroad, from left-leaning tycoons and foreign governments."" He closed his speech saying, ""The meaning of this is simple: We will not be able to keep Israel safe and secure and the terror against us that once emerged through these hills with machine guns will turn into missile fire.""

"(CNN)NBC is upping its live musical game. The network on Monday announced that ""The Wiz"" will be its next live musical performance — with Cirque du Soleil boarding the project with plans to bring the show to Broadway in 2016. NBC's ""The Wiz,"" set for Thursday, Dec. 3, will again be executive produced by Sound of Music and Peter Pan duo Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, with Tony-winning director Kenny Leon attached to direct both the live event as well as the Broadway revival in 2016-17. Tony winner and Broadway icon Harvey Fierstein will contribute new material to the original book by William F. Brown and work alongside Zadan, Meron and Leon. Leon won a 2014 Tony Award for directing ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" and earned a nomination for ""Fences."" Fierstein, as a writer, won Tonys for ""La Cage Aux Folles"" and ""Torch Song Trilogy."" He's also written books for musical hits including ""Kinky Boots"" and ""Newsies."" As an actor, he's won Tonys for best actor in a musical (""Hairspray"") and best actor in a play (""Torch Song""). ""We love this yearly tradition and we're more excited than ever to not only bring another Broadway musical to America's living rooms, but also see it land on Broadway as well,"" NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt said. ""It's a natural next step for our live musical events, and we're so pleased to be in business with this award-winning creative team and Scott Zeiger, president and managing director of Cirque du Soleil's new theatrical division. Cirque's incredible imagination will help bring the fantasy world of Oz vividly to life and give this great show a modern spin on the age-old story we all love."" Broadway musicals that have sung their way to the big screen . Zadan and Meron will reunite with Leon, with whom they worked on ""Steel Magnolias"" and ""A Raisin in the Sun."" Universal Television will produce. Casting for both the NBC telecast and Cirque's Broadway production will be announced at a later date. ""The Wiz"" is adapted from L. Frank Baum's ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"" with a book by Brown and music and lyrics by Charlie Smalls. The production opened on Broadway in 1975 at the Majestic Theatre and won seven Tonys, including best musical. It ran for four years. TV ratings: 'Peter Pan Live!' falls from 'Sound of Music' ""The Wiz"" is a retelling of ""Oz"" in an African-American/multicultural context. It was adapted as a film in 1978 starring Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne and Richard Pryor. It centers on Dorothy, a young woman from Kansas, who is swept up in a tornado and relocated to a fantasy world inhabited by munchkins, good and bad witches, and flying monkeys. She eventually takes a path down a yellow brick road to find a wizard who can help her go home. Along the way, she meets a scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lion, who all learn to help one another. NBC chief tackles Bill Cosby, live musicals and comedy woes . For NBC, ""The Wiz"" combines two of TV's biggest trends: live programming and the growing appetite for diversity — both in terms of casting and programming that best reflect society today. It comes as networks continue to look to live programming like sporting events and awards shows in a bid to break through the clutter in a crowded DVR landscape.

"Delhi (CNN)A court in New Delhi Wednesday summoned India's former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, as a suspect in a trial over alleged irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks, a spokeswoman for the investigating agency told CNN. Singh and his former government have repeatedly denied accusations they cost the treasury billions of dollars in lost revenue by selling coalfields to private companies, without allowing competitive bidding. The 82-year-old leader, who served as the nation's prime minister for two successive terms until last year, was not named as a defendant in the original dossier of charges, said Kanchan Prasad, the spokeswoman for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Nevertheless, the trial court summoned him and some other corporate leaders to testify in person on April 8, she said. The case Singh has been asked to appear for relates to the licensing of a coal block to a private firm some 10 years ago, when he was also guardian of the nation's coal ministry. The summons has been issued under India's anti-corruption law. Singh said he was open to legal scrutiny. ""(I) Am sure that the truth will prevail and I will get a chance to put forward my case with all the facts. I have always said I am open for legal scrutiny. Of course I am upset,  but this is part of life,"" he said in a text message issued by his office. Singh's Congress Party also came to his defense. The former prime minister functioned with ""utmost probity and utmost transparency"" during his term, said senior Congress Party leader Manish Tiwari. He said Singh's legal team would thoroughly examine the summons, and indicated it may be challenged in a higher court. The Oxford-Cambridge educated Singh has been credited with ushering in economic reforms in India as its finance minister in the 1990s. In his first term as prime minister, he initiated a historic nuclear deal with the United States that ended the South Asian nation's decades-old isolation in the global nuclear market. His second tenure was hit by the unearthing of a series of scandals spread across various sectors. In 2012, the national auditor alleged a widespread scam in the allocation of coal blocks. India depends heavily on coal for power. The fuel is abundantly available in the country, but that's still not enough to satisfy the demand for energy in Asia's third-largest economy. For the current financial year, national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at 551.6 million tonnes, according to official figures. Of it, at least 84.7 million tonnes is being met through imports, coal minister Piyush Goyal told the Indian parliament in December. The state-run monopoly Coal India Limited (CIL) accounts for more than 80% of the output. Plans by current Prime Minister Narendra Modi for future privatization of the industry faced resistance recently, when CIL workers stopped work in January. The two-day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas, but forced the government to go slow on reforms.","Court summons former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .

"(CNN)As the U.S. and several Eastern European NATO countries conduct a series of military exercises near Russia's border, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his Northern Fleet ""to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise"" in the Arctic, state-run media reported Monday. At least one Russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the ""international situation."" The fleet got its orders at 8 a.m. Monday, according to Sputnik, launching a land, sea and air drill that will involve 38,000 troops, 41 ships, 15 submarines and 110 aircraft. ""The main task of the (combat readiness drill) is to assess the armed forces from the Northern Fleet's capabilities in fulfilling tasks in providing military security of the Russian Federation in the Arctic region,"" Russian Defense Minister Gen. Sergey Shoigu told the media outlet. ""New challenges and threats of military security demand the further heightening of military capabilities of the armed forces and special attention will be paid to the state of the newly formed strategic merging (of forces) in the North."" The drills will run through Friday, Sputnik reported. A flotilla of minesweepers will support the Northern Fleet's nuclear submarines in the Barents Sea as part of the drill, the Tass news agency reported, citing a Defense Ministry statement. ""Mine-sweeping groups of the Kola Flotilla have moved to the designated areas of the Barents within the framework of a snap check of combat readiness of the Northern Fleet forces for supporting the deployment of the main forces of the fleet, including the deployment of nuclear and diesel submarines of the Northern Fleet,"" the statement says. The ships will conduct magnetic, acoustic and contact demining sweeps during the drill, Tass reported. Despite a number of countries participating in various military drills in Eastern Europe, a Kremlin spokesman described the Northern Fleet inspection as routine practice aimed at improving military capabilities. ""The practice of snap checks will become regular, as it is beneficial for improving the mechanisms of control and operation of the armed forces. This is an absolutely regular process of the armed forces' operation, of preparation and development of Russia's armed forces,"" Dmitry Peskov told Tass on Monday. Conversely, a diplomat told Tass that Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about NATO drills near its border. ""It is especially surprising that this is happening in Northeastern Europe, which is the most stable region not only on our continent, but also maybe in the whole world,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexey Meshkov said. ""Such NATO actions lead to destabilization of the situation and increasing tensions in Northeastern Europe."" Among the recent drills in Eastern Europe: . • In its largest military operation in decades, Norway sent 5,000 troops to conduct military exercises between Alta and Lakselv in Finnmark county, which borders Russia, according to the Barents Observer. • About 100 U.S. soldiers are expected to conduct an exercise this month using a Patriot missile battery and a Polish air defense brigade ""at a location on Polish territory,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said. The exercise is part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which began in response to Russia's involvement in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea last year, the U.S. Defense Department said. • Also as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, the U.S. Army will soon send armored Stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six European countries to show solidarity with its allies. The ""highly visible"" convoy will travel through Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Latvia and the Czech Republic en route to Vilseck, Germany, a U.S. Army Europe spokesman told the military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. • In a ""regularly scheduled"" exercise aimed at demonstrating NATO's commitment to ""collective defense"" in the Black Sea, the Standing NATO Maritime Group Two -- a collection of warships -- will train with the Bulgarian, Romanian and Turkish navies and visit Varna, Bulgaria, to meet with local authorities and navy officials, NATO said. • The U.S. Air Force moved a dozen A-10 Thunderbolt ""tankbuster"" attack jets to an air base in Germany and the U.S. military placed hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in Latvia, where they'll be matched up with 3,000 troops from Fort Stewart, Georgia.

"(CNN)In some ways, America's president pilots our ship of state as a captain pilots a jumbo jet, and this analogy suggests one possible way to avoid a repeat of the Germanwings massacre: Give the plane's flight crew certain powers akin to those given to America's Cabinet in the rare and terrifying situation when the president and vice president are at swords' point. Some background. Both presidents and plane captains must be shielded from lunatics and terrorists. This is why airlines across the world hardened cockpit doors after 9/11 and why Americans of all stripes are outraged by stories that the Secret Service on several occasions has failed to maintain proper security at the White House. Both presidents and plane captains are human, and subject to all the frailties of humans, from temporary disabilities created by bathroom breaks (for pilots) and scheduled surgeries (for presidents) to sudden death. Transitions in both the Oval Office and the cockpit should be made as smooth as possible. Hence the need for a vice president at the ready, able to take over at a moment's notice. The obvious aviation analogy here is the second pilot in the cockpit. In case of sudden death, the vice president or co-pilot simply takes over immediately. In case of a temporary disability -- say, a scheduled surgery under general anesthesia -- the president can hand over control to the vice president and then take back control when the disability ends. It is exactly what happened when President George W. Bush underwent planned colonoscopies in 2002 and 2007. On both occasions, Bush handed the tiller to his trusted co-pilot, Dick Cheney, and then resumed control when ready, under rules clearly laid out by the Constitution's 25th Amendment -- an amendment drafted and ratified after the shocking assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But what happens if a president is unable to predict his own future disability, or unable to recognize a genuine disability when it arises? The 25th Amendment allows the vice president to take over control in this situation, but to do so, the vice president needs the support of a majority of Cabinet officers -- officials previously appointed by the president himself and thus unlikely to support any inappropriate vice presidential power grab. On a jumbo jet, a co-pilot may likewise take over in certain situations. But current airplane architecture fails to use the crew in the optimal way. When one officer has barricaded himself in the cockpit and the other officer is banging on the door demanding entry, current airplane design enables the man in the cockpit unilaterally to block the demand for entrance with the flick of a switch. Think of this as an absolute veto. (Some airlines get around the problem with a rule that a flight attendant must replace a pilot so that there will always be at least two people in the cockpit.) But suppose instead that airlines were to borrow sensibly a page from America's Constitution. The man in the cockpit could temporarily block entrance, but this veto could be overridden if -- and only if -- the door-banging officer is backed by a majority of the flight attendants. The need for some sort of secure cockpit lock is obvious. Perhaps the officer banging on the door has gone mad, or is being held hostage at knifepoint, or is a terrorist mole. But the need for an override is also obvious. Perhaps the man in the cockpit is the bad guy. And just as America's Cabinet officers are well-positioned to decide any dispute between a president and vice president wrestling over the key to the Oval Office, so too with an airplane's crew:  The cockpit lock button could be electronically overridden whenever a majority of flight attendants punched in their own individual passcodes in sequence on a keypad somewhere outside the cockpit door. This proposed technological fix will not prevent all future tragedies. No human system is foolproof. But giving the crew a collective key brings more human minds into the equation -- as does the 25th Amendment's rule empowering the Cabinet to resolve certain terrifying disputes at the highest level of executive power. On planes, as in a constitutional democracy, there is often safety in numbers.","Akhil Amar: When a leader is irrational or incapacitated, we need an override mechanism .

"New York (CNN)Kayla Mueller, Peter Kassig, Alan Henning, David Haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by ISIS in the past year. The exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive. What we do know is ISIS holds at least one female aid worker, and possibly more. The International Federation of the Red Cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in October 2013 remain missing, but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them. Abductions and killings of aid workers are, unfortunately, nothing new, but the numbers are. According to Aidworkersecurity.org, at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013, a 121% increase on 70 recorded killings the year before. Not all were victims of ISIS, a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled Syria. In fact, according to the same report, it is the Taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers, in large part in Afghanistan. Here's the difference: ISIS is changing the game. The Taliban may have many reasons for abductions (flexing their muscles, negotiating prisoner releases), but they also have a record of frequent hostage release. The need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters, or mattered. For ISIS, it appears to matter less. Abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income (ISIS demanded at least $6 million for Kayla Mueller, and reportedly $200 million for two Japanese hostages) or, failing that, their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness. So far the number of hostages of all backgrounds freed by ISIS is extremely low, save for those whose ransoms were paid. The freeing of 19 kidnapped Assyrian Christians shocked many, because release is not a common part of ISIS' playbook. These tactics can serve as models to other extremist groups worldwide, who may look to emulate ISIS' model of abduction and violence. One example is West African extremist group Boko Haram, which released a video purportedly showing the beheading of two men claimed to be spies, an approach disturbingly similar to ISIS'. ""Humanitarian work has always been risky, but it's never been more dangerous than it is now,"" says Caryl Stern, president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. ""There used to be a time when an organization's flag provided a great deal of protection. That's no longer the case."" The response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of Syria and its environs altogether, but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers. Still, outside workers like Mueller, Kassig, Henning and Haines were inside Syria when they were taken, and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations. Not only that, but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency, local staffers become bait. Indeed, the majority of victims have been working in their own countries. ISIS doesn't just target aid workers. Journalists, soldiers and anyone who conceivably could fetch a ransom are high on their hit list. But in the Wild West that is Syria and its borders, few of these remain, save for aid workers. In a space devoid of government, refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities, the new front line in the war on terror, a sometimes unwelcome association. And as ISIS spreads beyond Syria's borders, the risks grow further afield. Yet despite these risks, thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million. While some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection, many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit.  Their security and locations for the most part are under constant review. When CNN approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences, and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level, many declined, in large part due to security concerns. For this reason, some of those mentioned below are wholly or partially anonymous. If I think back, I've been doing this work for about 20 years, and I remember we used to have this sense that there was some sort of protection, some sort of ... humanitarian space ... it feels very much like that is shrinking ... our job is becoming much, much more difficult; we're asking people to put themselves in harm's way in some circumstances. I mean, we don't do that, but it's not the exception any more. My family is not thrilled at all because what they see on the news is Westerners being kidnapped and beheaded ... when they worry, I worry about them and that doesn't help me be in a good state of mind to do my work. I'm very selective about where I say I go. I need to find ways to switch off and do silly things and not worry about the dire situation that's here, not just the humanitarian situation but ... being responsible for the people I'm responsible for in this region. I don't think people see the human side so much ... innocent people who through no fault of their own have been forced to flee their home one, two, three times -- who don't see a future for their children... Someone has to be there to help and support and provide some sense of safety and security, and I mean that in the personal sense of a mother who, when she goes to sleep at night with her children, she knows she has a blanket to keep them warm and something to feed them the next day. Fear is always there in the back of everyone's mind. We just need to continue what we're doing, stopping is not an option, halting our operations is not an option, and we are taking great risks, our staff are taking great risks. It is a difficult thing to tell family, to tell colleagues. Oftentimes I just don't mention all the details of where I go because they just don't need to know. But it needs to be done, we also can't run an operation remotely. ... I'm not going to the front lines, I'm not going to where the conflict is actually hot ... we're not adrenaline driven people. We want to be able to help the people and do our work and to do our work does entail taking some risks, but it's about calculated risks. We don't want to put ourselves directly in front of danger. If we say we give up on it for whatever reason -- security, morale, pressure from here, pressure from there -- no one else is going to come to take our place. There's not going to be another organization that's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that IOCC may create, that's not going to happen. So that puts more responsibility on the shoulders of our staff and the shoulders of our organization; we feel that responsibility that we've got to deliver on this thing. Donate to IOCC . There's an internal motivation that keeps you going. You feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance, and know it's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service. So yes, you need be of course strong, motivated, passionate, and of course feel the need to assist and deliver. It's an unprecedented time, and what we're calling the new normal ... as we've seen in the last year, the complete radicalization of these spaces with extremist groups, who have a very hard view in terms of cooperation with neutral and humanitarian organizations such as ours ... we're not the U.S. Army, we don't have a physical ability to repel. There may be in people's perceived minds there was a golden age of humanitarian acceptance: like if you were a charity and waved a white flag and drove a white car, you'd be protected by bad guys and loved by the community. I think that golden age is more myth than reality, but regarding today's reality it's extremely dangerous it's so true. And your flag, your neutrality, your white car, all the good intention you have, that recipe is very difficult in these complicated emergencies. There's a phrase that the U.N. uses and a lot of NGOs use which is ""stay and deliver,"" so we have a humanitarian imperative to be there, but we always have to be in a risk management role; we have to critically look at: do the risks outweigh the benefits we hope to get? The fear factor comes in just managing the emotional toll it takes with your family and friends, and that has more of a toll, I think, with individual staff members than actual external environment ... frankly, sometimes I don't tell them till I'm already on my way so I don't have to have those calls before I even get on an airplane. It's hard; there are some areas where the family and friends don't understand why you're going there, and you re-articulate, ""If not you, then who?"" and you ask, ""Would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened?""

"(CNN)As a person-of-color, African-American, veteran minority journalist and longtime enthusiast of all things ""Daily Show,"" I am of course as happy, proud and thrilled as the wife of a successful Apollo astronaut over the impending ascension of Trevor Noah, the biracial comedian from South Africa, to Jon Stewart's anchor chair on what's believed by many to be the most trusted half-hour of news and information in America. As a person who believes in fair play and equal opportunity for all, I am also moved to wonder when a woman will get the chance to preside over a talk show after sunset? Look. I don't mean to sound ungrateful. After generations of near-to-total invisibility on mass media airwaves, it's bracing to find a whole one-hour block of high-profile cable television infotainment anchored by men who look like me. Indeed, in pushing forth both Noah and Larry Wilmore, the writer, comic and erstwhile National Black Correspondent for ""The Daily Show,"" to preside over both halves of Comedy Central's much-coveted 11 p.m.-to-midnight bloc, Stewart is acknowledging what the mainstream of the country truly is: i.e. not as pale-faced as it once thought it was. And so far, Wilmore's ""The Nightly Show,"" which premiered earlier this year as a replacement for the very different ""Daily Show"" companion once hosted by Stephen Colbert, is gradually establishing its own identity as an equally cheeky hybrid of sketch satire and celebrity forum with its own multicultural flavor. Still, one does wonder what happened to the groundswell of support building among ""Daily Show"" constituents for Jessica Williams, a three-year veteran of the show and an early favorite for Stewart's spot after he announced last month he was leaving. Williams, who is black, tweeted back to her supporters her grateful opinion that she was ""extremely under-qualified for the job."" Maybe, but what about Samantha Bee? She's the ""most senior correspondent"" for ""The Daily Show"" and is taking her penchant for performance artistry and provocation to TBS, where she'll create her own satiric news franchise. Her track record bodes well for her prospects there. But it's difficult to find any evidence that she was considered a Stewart successor -- though her announcement that she was leaving the show came a month after Stewart's. Besides Bee?  No one, least of all those affiliated with Comedy Central, have disclosed any candidates besides Noah. There was even less buzz about the Stewart opening than Colbert's a year ago, during which time there were many willing to say that now was the time to finally give a woman a shot at late-night TV for the first time since the late Joan Rivers' Fox Network effort, ""The Late Show"" came in 1987-- and went in 1988. And yes, we aren't neglecting Chelsea Handler, whose ""Chelsea Lately"" was for seven seasons on the E! Network a bawdier late-night alternative to whatever Letterman, Stewart and others were putting down beyond prime-time. She's supposed to start streaming a new show through Netflix sometime next year. So one supposes she's pretty busy. It will happen, perhaps sooner than one now expects. Look how long it took before Diane Sawyer and Katie Couric were given their shots to anchor evening news broadcasts on ABC and CBS respectively. Hmmm ... wonder what they're doing after 11 p.m. these days.","As a  black man, Gene Seymour thrilled Trevor Noah tapped  for ""Daily Show."" But in service of fair play he asks: Why not a woman for the job?
Jessica Williams, Samantha Bee would have been good candidates. When will women finally get their shot at late night?"

"(CNN)Buddy Elias spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin Anne Frank. His death Monday brought back memories for me. We met three years ago in an Atlanta hotel conference room. He and his wife, Gerti, were touring the United States to promote a new book. I could tell instantly that he was related to Anne. His face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though I was meeting her in person. ""Anne Frank's Family"" had just been published, based on 14 boxes of letters, postcards, photos and documents that Gerti accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in Basel. Elias told me that it wasn't just Anne who loved to write; everyone in the family did. The 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-Semitism. That day in Atlanta, I listened to Elias tell me about loved ones he lost. He told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral Switzerland when World War II broke out. I thought back to our conversation Thursday when I learned the news of Elias' death. He died peacefully at his home in Basel, Switzerland, at 90, said an announcement posted on the website of Anne Frank Fonds, the foundation that Elias headed. Like millions of people who read ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" I was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family's courage. Anne received her diary on her 13th birthday and wrote in it for the two years that her family hid from the Nazis in the secret annex of an Amsterdam apartment. I was only in seventh grade when my father bought me the book in 1975. After the family was discovered, they were sent to Auschwitz. Later, Anne and her sister Margot were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they both died in March 1945. Her father, Otto Frank, was the sole survivor of the family, one of only 7,000 people who made it out alive from Auschwitz. In the course of my two hours with Elias, I learned new things about the young, Jewish girl whose journal is arguably the most famous in the world. She called him Bernd, short for Bernhard, Elias' formal name. In his youth, Elias was an actor and a skater with Holiday on Ice. He was her first cousin and 4 years older. They adored one another. ""Bernd, maybe we can skate as a pair together someday,"" Anne wrote in January 1941 from Amsterdam. ""But I know I'll have to train very hard to be as good as you are."" In another letter, Anne outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue, fur-trimmed dress she would wear when she finally skated with Elias. ""She never did get to do that,"" Elias said. On his 17th birthday in 1942, she asked him how it was going with a girl he had met. It was an ordinary letter that one keeps like any other. But it turned out to be her last to him, and he preserved it like a relic, as proof of his cousin's affection, as something to treasure. ""That was the last sign of life I had with Anne,"" Elias told me. After the war, Otto Frank searched frantically for his family and eventually learned their cruel fate. He published Anne's diary in 1947 and helped transform it for the stage and film. He created the foundation in her name in 1963. The first edition of the diary was in Dutch. Elias told me he had to wait several years for a German language edition before he could read it. That was when he came to truly understand his childhood playmate. By the time he read her words, he had not seen Anne in many years. In his mind, he treasured the image of a spunky girl who loved the Jack-in-the-Box puppet shows Elias staged and played hide-and-seek. ""Anne,"" he said, ""was always good at hiding."" I wondered whether he caught the irony of his own words. Otto Frank kept alive his daughter's legacy until he died in 1980 and passed on that role to Elias.  He was devoted to the task until the day he died. In 2012, he helped create the Frank Family Centre in Frankfurt, where archives of his extended family will be made accessible to the public, according to the Anne Frank foundation. Elias was my closest personal encounter with a girl who opened my eyes to the cruelty of this world. Anne Frank never gave up on humanity, despite everything she endured. It was her goodness that amazes every reader of her diary. In Elias, I saw that same goodness.","Anne Frank was extremely close to her first cousin Buddy Elias .

"(CNN)Here's a dog tale about a pooch with a literal ""spring"" in his steps. Brutus, a 2-year old Rottweiler, is walking again thanks to modern technology and months of training. He's said to be only the second dog ever known to have four prosthetic limbs. ""You can't explain to an animal why you are putting these contraptions on their feet. You can't explain to them, that it's to help them,"" foster mom Laura Aquilina told CNN affiliate KDVR. The Loveland, Colorado, dog's paws suffered extreme damage from frostbite. His feet were then reportedly amputated by his trainer. Brutus has been adopted by Aquilina who's been walking and exercising the dog to learn balance. ""He just has these little peg legs to get around on and he does a pretty good job inside the home,"" says Aquilina. But his challenge has been walking outside where his ""high-stepping...resembles a bucking bronco.""

"(CNN)Tina Fey's follow-up to ""30 Rock"" is getting a lot of attention, not all of it good. Her new Netflix series, ""The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"" is being criticized online for dealing in offensive humor and stereotypes. The show, which had been picked up by NBC but ultimately dropped, stars Ellie Kemper (""Bridesmaids,"" ""The Office"") as an upbeat woman stuck in the 1990s after being kidnapped by a doomsday cult leader: not exactly fodder for humor, on its surface. After she's released from an Indiana bunker, Kimmy moves to New York to start a life, and much of the humor comes from her misunderstanding of the modern world, her seventh-grade education and her relationships with a diverse cast of pals. Since its debut, Buzzfeed has declared that the show has a ""major race problem,"" and others criticized its treatment of an Asian character named Dong. Slate says that the critics ""aren't wrong ... but they are missing the point."" ""Tina Fey's high-wire act is all about the alchemy of making it OK to laugh at big, heavy issues -- like kidnapped women, the experience of undocumented Vietnamese immigrants, and people with Native American ancestry passing as white -- by skimming over them with a light touch,"" Arthur Chu wrote on Slate. The Daily Dot's Jacqueline Keeler wrote that she once hid her Native American past, just like Kimmy's employer, a wealthy woman played by Jane Krakowski. Keeler said that watching the show made her uncomfortable but at the same time praised Fey's ""genius"" writing. But Tituss Burgess, who plays Kimmy's black gay roommate, Titus (whom some have called a stereotype), says the whole controversy is ""ridiculous."" He told the Huffington Post, ""I just find it hilarious that people are trying to arrest us for doing the opposite of what everyone thinks we're doing."" The show is certainly not afraid to go right up to the edge with jokes about race, age, class, gender and sexuality. Consider these biting one-liners and bits of dialogue. 1. ""WHITE WOMEN FOUND; Hispanic woman also found."" An onscreen news graphic zings the media after Kimmy and her bunker-mates are freed. 2. Julian: ""My first wife ..."" Jacqueline: ""... turned 50. And I would never do that to you."" Kimmy's wealthy employers, Julian and Jacqueline Voorhees, consider their marital difficulties. 3. ""We came all this way in the great iron sky eagle. I'm kidding. I know what planes are; I was in the Air Force."" Jacqueline's father, Virgil, explains how he and Jacqueline's mother, both Native Americans, traveled to New York to see their daughter. 4. ""You know Disney lies to little girls. Stepmothers aren't scary, and nannies aren't magical, and dwarves do not let you sleep in their house without expecting something."" Xanthippe Voorhees, the spoiled teen stepdaughter of Kimmy's wealthy employer, offers up a cynical take on the new nanny's Pollyanna-ish (or emotionally stunted) attitude. 5. ""Well, I had a cellphone, Xan, obvs, but I lost it at the zoo. A monkey took it, and she wouldn't give it back. Yeah, Xan, the monkey was a woman. Women can be anything these days."" Kimmy was underground as cell phone use exploded -- but she hides that truth from most people, especially the vengeful Xanthippe. 6. ""My dad cannot find out about this, please! He'll kill me! Or marry me off to one of his Saudi friends!"" Xanthippe begs for a break like any teen but gives a glimpse at the life of a 1% adolescent. 7. ""I'm not even gonna know what box to check on the hate crime form."" Such is the life of Titus, Kimmy's roommate, a gay black man from Mississippi, trying to make an acting career in New York. (Warning: The following video is not suitable for kids, or work.) 8. ""Straight guys can be vegetarians. Hitler was a vegetarian."" Charles, Kimmy's colleague and potential love interest, defends his diet in the most awkward way. 9. ""Yeah, it's real popular now, like taking pictures of your food or being biracial."" Cyndee, Kimmy's closest friend from her days in the bunker, offers swift commentary on how the world has changed in the 15 years she was away. 10. Kimmy: ""Dong is the name of the Vietnamese guy in my class. He's good at math."" Titus: ""That's racist!"" Kimmy: ""But he is good at math."" Titus: ""I don't make the rules."" Kimmy and Titus have a conversation about race, as if over cups of Starbucks coffee. 11. Lillian: ""I will not bury another beautiful black man. You know my dear husband Roland was killed in our very own apartment."" Titus: ""Yes, I've heard this story before."" Lillian: ""He got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and on his way back to bed, he was shot in the face."" Titus: ""By you, Lillian."" Lillian: ""Well, it was dark out, and a black guy was trying to get in bed with me. It was the '70s!""

"Washington (CNN)In a strongly worded letter, the White House Saturday told Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) a bill he is drafting would likely have a ""profoundly negative impact"" on the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. Corker is working on legislation that would force the Obama Administration to submit any deal reached with Iran for a vote by Congress.  The White House earlier threatened to veto such a measure. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, in the three page letter released publicly Saturday evening, told Corker his legislation could be detrimental to the talks with Iran by ""emboldening Iranian hard-liners, inviting a counter-productive response from the Iranian majiles (Majles, the Parliament); differentiating the U.S. position from our allies in the negotiations; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal."" As the U.S. and Iran prepare for the next round of negotiations this coming week, there has been a growing debate between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Obama Administration about how much authority Congress has regarding the fate of the agreement. ""The legislation you have introduced in the Senate goes well beyond ensuring that Congress has a role to play in any deal with Iran. Instead, the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that Congress must vote to 'approve' any deal and by removing existing sanctions waiver authorities that have already been granted to the President,"" McDonough wrote. The chief of staff said that only Congress can terminate the existing Iran sanctions that are included in laws, but the President can relax some sanctions put into place by executive order unilaterally. One of the major issues between the U.S. and Iran is the timetable for lifting of the sanctions. ""If congressional action is perceived as preventing us from reaching a deal, it will create divisions within the international community, putting at risk the very international cooperation that has been essential to our ability to pressure Iran. Put simply, it would potentially make it impossible to secure international cooperation for additional sanctions, while putting at risk the existing multilateral sanctions"" now in place, McDonough said in his letter. For his part, Corker on Sunday released a statement: ""On this issue where Congress has played such a vital role, I believe it is very important that Congress appropriately weigh in before any final agreement is implemented."" Corker also urged the President not to go to the United Nations for a vote regarding lifting of the sanctions on Iran, as Reuters reported was being considered. ""Enabling the United Nations to consider an agreement or portions of it, while simultaneously threatening to veto legislation that would enable Congress to do the same, is a direct affront to the American people and seeks to undermine Congress' appropriate role,"" he wrote. The chief of staff told Corker, ""The Administration's request to the Congress is simple: let us complete the negotiations before the Congress acts on legislation"" and added ""we will aggressively seek public and congressional support for a deal -- if we reach one -- because we believe a good deal is far better than the alternatives available to the United States."" McDonough also mentioned a separate letter sent to Iran's leadership and signed by 47 Republican senators. Corker did not sign it. The letter maintained that a future president could reverse some of what is agreed to in these ongoing negotiations and said any agreement reached would need congressional approval. It has generated much controversy. It also drew rebuttal from Iran's foreign minister, who called it a propaganda ploy. On Sunday, Iran's speaker of parliament and former nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, said the letter signed by the senators tarnished Washington's reputation internationally, according to state-run Tasnim news agency. He said it showed that the United States is untrustworthy, and he advised current negotiators to be wary. McDonough also said the letter's premise was incorrect. ""Non-binding agreements -- like the deal we are negotiating with Iran...are an essential element of international diplomacy and do not require congressional approval,"" McDonough said. Secretary of State John Kerry, who heads back to Switzerland on Sunday for more talks with Iranian representatives, again blasted that letter from the 47 Republicans. ""It is a direct interference with negotiations in the executive department,"" he said at a news conference in Egypt. ""It is completely without precedent, and it is almost inevitable it will raise questions in the minds of the folks with whom we are negotiating.""","A Republican senator is drafting legislation to allow Congress to vote on negotiations with Iran .

"(CNN)Three Florida police officers were fired and a fourth resigned after exchanging a series of racially offensive text messages and a video that portrayed President Barack Obama in a derogatory way, Fort Lauderdale police said. Jason Holding, James Wells and Christopher Sousa were terminated after a five-month internal affairs investigation found sustained department misconduct, conduct unbecoming of a police officer and engaging in ""conduct prejudicial to the good of the order of the police department."" A fourth officer, Alex Alvarez, resigned but authorities said Friday that he would have been fired had he not done so. In the text message exchanges, the former officers used racially derogatory terms to refer to people they encountered while on duty, included  racially insensitive material from the film, ""Django Unchained,"" and talked about getting drunk and ""killing n*****,"" according to investigative documents. The men allegedly criticized co-workers, including African-Americans, making crude comments about their grammar, appearance and work ethic. One message referred to an entire shift as ""lazy f****,"" the documents state. Alvarez created a faux movie trailer with the title ""The Hoods,"" with offensive language and images of Obama, the Ku Klux Klan and African-Americans. ""There was no criminal behavior detected during this investigation, however, the four officers' conduct was inexcusable and there is zero tolerance for this kind of behavior in the Fort Lauderdale Police Department,"" Chief Franklin Adderley told reporters. ""Its attempt was to damage the image of our agency and I just hope that the people and the public realize that we're not going to tolerate it and anyone that's engaged in this behavior will be addressed immediately,"" he said. In a statement, the Fort Lauderdale Fraternal Order of Police said the officers deserve their due process, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. ""The Fraternal Order of Police is a multicultural organization which does not tolerate racism,"" the group's president, Jack Lokeinsky, said in the statement. ""Our officers take great pride in our commitment to diversity. Our dedicated officers have positive relationships with residents in every community we serve."" The officers worked in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. ""I am very disappointed, disgusted and shocked by this incident,"" Mayor Jack Seiler said. ""The inappropriate racist behavior exhibited by those involved is unacceptable and reprehensible, it violates the trust we place in our law enforcement officers, it damages the bond we have established in our community and undermines the standards in which each and every city employee is held accountable,"" Seiler said at a news conference. Police officials were alerted of the existence of offensive material by Alvarez's ex-fiancee, who discovered it when the couple agreed to check each others' phones, according to the documents. The woman told police she thought their behavior was wrong, but feared he would hurt her if she told anyone. After the 10-month relationship ended, she went to the authorities. Adderley said that four officers had not exhibited a pattern of race-related complaints. Holding was recently disciplined with a two-day suspension for mishandling property of a suspect. The police department is implementing a mandatory ""diversity class"" for officers and a screening process for new hires,  said Adderley.","Fort Lauderdale officers exchanged racially offensive text messages .

"Moscow (CNN)In his first substantive comments since Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov's death, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday called the killing a ""disgrace"" and lashed out at what he called ""extremists"" and protesters. Nemtsov had been one of Putin's harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the President's government. The 55-year-old opposition leader was gunned down Friday night in Moscow as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin with his girlfriend, Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya, 23. His slaying spurred thousands to rally in his honor in Moscow, with many calling him a true Russian patriot at his funeral Tuesday. Nemtsov isn't the first of Putin's critics to turn up dead, with others including Anna Politkovskaya (who was fatally shot) and Alexander Litvinenko (who was poisoned). The Kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it's targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths. The Russian leader has condemned Nemtsov's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate, the Kremlin has said. He also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice. Yet those expressions came in Kremlin statements. Wednesday was the first day Putin spoke at length on the subject, remarks that were reported by state media outlets. Referring to ""the daring killing of Boris Nemtsov in the very heart of our capital city,"" he said, ""Russia should be made secure, at last, from the disgrace and tragedies of (this) kind."" The President added, according to the official Tass news agency, ""The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including those having political motives."" No one has been arrested in connection with Nemtsov's death, though Russia's Federal Security Service chief Alexander Bortnikov did say there are suspects, Tass reported. The same agency, citing Russia's Finance Ministry, said that investigators are looking for a car that belongs to a state enterprise that provides services to that ministry. Putin didn't identify any person or group that might be directly responsible. But Wednesday he took the opportunity to lay blame generally at what he called ""color technologies,"" an apparent reference to using mass street protests and overseas funding to try to overthrow a government. ""The actions of extremists are becoming more and more widespread,"" the President said. ""We are running into attempts of using so-called color technologies, from organizing illegal street protests to open propaganda (expressing) hatred in social networks."" CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN)It was always going to take an extraordinary performance from a very talented swimmer to beat Michael Phelps at his favorite event in an Olympic final. For more than a decade, the great American had vanquished all comers in the 200 meters butterfly on both the world and Olympic stage, but then along came Chad le Clos. When the South African chased down Phelps in the final 50 meters of the race to snatch a dramatic fingertip victory by 0.05 seconds he created one of the defining moments of the 2012 London Olympics. As a 12-year-old, le Clos had gazed into his television set at home in Durban watching in awe as Phelps, widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all-time, won six Olympic gold medals at Athens in 2004. So perhaps it's not surprising that lining up alongside his hero in an Olympic final eight years later took on a slightly surreal air. ""My dream was always to swim like Michael Phelps so when I raced against him in the final it was actually a crazy feeling,"" le Clos tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""When I touched at 150 (meters) I think I was 1.5 meters behind him. When I turned I actually looked at him underwater and I thought I was him -- I know it sounds absolutely crazy, but I saw myself as him going past someone else."" ""I remembered how he used to come off the last turn and, you know, smoke everyone ... I thought, he's done this for so many years and I remembered that when I was swimming. I don't know what it was but it was magical."" The mind-altering moment quickly morphed into a life-changing experience for the then 20-year-old who edged out Phelps in the final stroke. ""It was such a huge moment for South Africa. Obviously, to represent your country is a huge honor but to beat Michael Phelps at the Olympics was amazing,"" he says. ""As a young kid everyone wants to be like their heroes but you don't actually think one day that you're going to beat them."" The remarkable victory was memorable not just for le Clos' reactions -- which went from joy to disbelief immediately after the race -- but for those of his father Bert, whose elated response and subsequent TV interview have become an enduring part of the swimmer's story. The excitable tribute to his ""down-to-earth, beautiful boy,"" which included repeated mentions of the word ""unbelievable,"" touched the hearts of viewers and turned le Clos senior into something of a household name himself. ""I never knew my father was such a celebrity until like five, six days after the Games -- I was so wrapped up in (my own) bubble,"" le Clos explains. ""We were walking down the street and everyone was taking photos of me, but I couldn't find my dad, and I saw him and there were a line of people taking photos of him and I was like: 'Dad! You are stealing my thunder here. C'mon!' It was incredible. ""Everywhere he goes he's that famous dad and that's amazing because he really is. Nothing was put on for the cameras -- that's how he is back home. To my other brothers and sister he's a great dad."" Success in the pool has been rich reward for Bert, who steered the Chad towards swimming when a football career looked more likely. ""My parents were hugely influential in helping me make decisions throughout my life, especially my sporting career,"" he says. ""When I was young I played football until I was about 13 or 14 years old -- I played for the state team (Natal). I had to make a decision and my dad realized that I was a better swimmer, even though my family had a football background. ""Ninety-nine percent of fathers would have told their son to play football ... I still thank him every day for helping me make that decision."" There is now another le Clos in the pool -- teenager Jordan is hoping to follow in his brother's large footsteps, having already competed at South Africa's national championships. ""You know, 2020 is very important to me,"" says Chad. ""Hopefully my brother can make the Olympics then and swim in the same relay team."" Originally a breaststroker, le Clos switched to butterfly after he tore both his abductor muscles (in the groin) in 2008 when he was 16 years old. ""Butterfly movement is really different. It's unlike freestyle or other strokes where it's very, very technical. I compare it to dancing -- I'm a terrible dancer! -- it's about getting your hips right, your kick is very important. I just really enjoy it. It's a fast stroke, so I guess the injury was a blessing in disguise for me."" While swimming's toughest stroke remains his favored discipline, le Clos has also struck gold in the individual 200m freestyle -- at the short-course world championships in Doha last year -- and the 400m medley (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle) at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. But it is butterfly where he has dominated in recent years. After pipping Phelps in the 200m in London, le Clos had to settle for silver behind the American in the 100m, but he hasn't missed a stroke since. A 100m and 200m double at the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona was followed by gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland last August. He capped a brilliant 2014 in December with three more titles (50m, 100m and 200m) at the short-course worlds in Doha before being crowned FINA World Male Swimmer of the Year -- an award he is incredibly proud of. ""The Olympic gold will always be there and it will be the most outstanding moment of my life, but to win the 2014 Swimmer of the Year award was up there. Not many people have won the Ballon d'Or of swimming, so it was a very special moment for me."" For le Clos, who turns 23 in April, the best is almost certainly yet to come with another Olympics fast approaching. He concedes that it will be ""very, very difficult"" to get anywhere near Phelps' record haul of 18 Olympic gold medals (and 22 overall), but he may get the chance to race him one more time. Phelps, who announced his retirement following the 2012 London Games, made a shock return to the pool last year although things haven't exactly gone to plan -- the ""Baltimore Bullet"" is serving a six-month ban imposed by USA Swimming after he was arrested for drink-driving last September. The ban has put his planned appearance at this year's FINA World Championships in doubt, but Phelps is still hopeful of qualifying for his fifth Olympics in 2016. ""I really, really hope that he and his team decide to swim in Rio, I really believe it will be great,"" le Clos told Reuters last year. ""It's added motivation for me ... with Michael back, it's really sparked my fire, so to speak. I don't think he will be worse in Rio, I think he'll be back where he wants to be. He's a champion in all respects but I believe I can beat him again."" If he can, then le Clos will have taken a giant step towards his ultimate aim of swimming and sporting immortality. ""I want to cement myself in the sport as one of the greats. In swimming terms, I want people to remember Chad le Clos -- the guy that not only beat Michael Phelps, but who is the best fast swimmer of all time,"" he says. ""In South Africa we have a rich history of great champions -- rugby players, cricket players, a lot of great golfers -- so I'm among really tough competition, but I believe that after 2016 and 2020 I can hopefully be the greatest.""","South African swimmer stunned Michael Phelps at 2012 London Olympics .

"(CNN)I was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago. I had only two subjects remaining before I graduated from university with a degree in English literature. Since I was 10 years old, I have loved English and dreamed of becoming a teacher. I want to teach the younger ones, especially now, because children are the ones who will rebuild our country. They are Syria's future, and they deserve our significant investment. Three years ago, my family was forced to flee our home near Damascus, in east Ghouta. Thankfully, we got out before chemical warfare was used there. We stayed in Syria for the next year, moving from one house to another, from one village to another. With each move, we felt no comfort, no safety. When you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day, you eventually must make a choice: Ours was to leave. And with only two packed bags, we did. We went to Jordan. I've thought of returning to Syria. I want to be part of my country's rebuilding, but sadly, I don't expect this to happen any time soon. When we arrived in Jordan, I thought I would return soon to Syria -- in only a few weeks. We all thought so. It's been two years. And while I still hope to go home one day, my biggest question is: ""When?"" I want to return so that I can teach. As a child, I was inspired by my third-grade teacher, who believed children are the future and who challenged us at that young age to create a better world. I think it's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students, but I want to try. Although I hope to follow in my teacher's footsteps, my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home, by a war that has driven me here, by tuition costs in Jordan that are prohibitively expensive. Being away from home presents many challenges. You feel like a stranger in a foreign place. You're not among people who know you, or who want to know you.  As a Syrian refugee, it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed, and I've no money to complete my studies. Overnight, my dreams changed. In one moment I was at home with family and friends dreaming of studying English, of becoming a schoolteacher.  In the next, it all feels lost. It's impossible to work, impossible to study. We hope to meet our needs today, not so much to fulfill our dreams tomorrow. In Syria, I was responsible to my parents, now I am responsible for them. I dreamed of being a teacher, but because my parents are old, I must try each week just to protect them, to cover their basic needs of shelter, food and medicine. I needed some way to support my family. While most Syrians are not permitted to work, we can volunteer. I found a role with the poverty-fighting organization CARE in the urban refugee center in East Amman, Jordan, where I earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work. I have enjoyed it so much. After working there, I have become more social, and no longer feel isolated. It's not like sitting at home, feeling powerless, losing confidence, wondering what I can do to help my family, to help my people. Instead, I feel empowered. I recognize my potential. And, because of that, I refuse to give up on my dreams. My hope is to resettle for the short term in another country so I can continue my studies. I want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching Syrian children. Resettling could help shape my future so that I can help shape theirs. One day, I will tell them of the crisis we faced in the Syria that I left. We must be aware of this history, and learn from it. We must empower children to speak up and then be sure that their voices are heard. Change starts with them. And it starts with us. Each person has the right to pursue an education, to meet their most basic needs, to express themselves. When those rights are stifled, so, too, is a person's potential, her opportunities, her power to create a better world, and in my case, a better Syria. My question to the U.S. people and the international community is this: Imagine your life has been turned upside down after you lose everything in a matter of hours: What do you believe in then? What do you cling to? The answer, I think, is: your dreams. We all have them. Mine, for the time being, have been deferred.","Four years of war means four years without schools and education in Syria .

"(CNN)""Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero."" It was a routine sign-off, an all-is-well. On March 8, 2014, at 1:19 a.m., someone spoke those last words from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 to air traffic controllers before the Boeing 777 vanished. A year later, searchers have no new clues as to where it went with 239 people on board. Radar and satellite reports have provided hints, but searchers still have nothing to hold in their hands. No wreckage seen floating at sea or beached on shore. No fuselage resting on the sea floor. Experts have said the data indicate the flight path from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing unexpectedly veered, putting the commercial jet over the southern Indian Ocean. But the water's vast and intricate depths have revealed no secrets. And as clarity has eluded grasp, analysts have made many speculations about what happened. The most controversial idea: Is the maritime search area all wrong? Did the plane land clandestinely on solid ground? Here are some expert theories about what happened to MH370. Investigators have since cast doubt on some of their details. Who radioed those last words to air traffic control? Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah? First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid? There was much speculation over that, but the Malaysian inspectors in April said it was Zaharie. The pilots were supposed to check in with new air traffic controllers in Vietnam, but never did. One theory is that one pilot may have incapacitated the other, then guided the plane to its end, taking the passengers down with him in a dramatic suicide. Mark Weiss, a retired American Airlines captain, has flown a Boeing 777. He believed shortly after the crash that there may have been a struggle. ""It was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane,"" he said. But Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya has vehemently defended his employees, particularly the pilot. ""We do not suspect any one of our crew until there's such evidence. ... Captain Zaharie is a very capable man,"" he said. ""We have no reason to suspect (him)."" Weiss also thought there could have been another person -- a crew member or someone else -- in the cockpit who ""was bent on perhaps committing suicide or doing some destruction on the aircraft."" Copilot Hamid, 27, reportedly once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit on a 2011 flight between Thailand and Malaysia. ""That's an enormous breach of security,"" Weiss said. But investigators punched holes in the idea, saying there was no indication of a third party in the cockpit, CNN reported in April. The difference between hijacking and commandeering is nuanced. The former term is often used when the hijacker issues a demand such as being taken to a safe-haven country or receiving ransom to release passengers. When people commandeer a plane, they might keep the motives secret, said political analyst Peter Bergen. They may want to steer it themselves at a target, like the September 11, 2001, terrorists did. In 1994, a FedEx employee burst into the cockpit of FedEx Flight 705 with a hammer and spear gun. He wanted to crash the plane into the company's Memphis, Tennessee, headquarters. The crew thwarted that takeover. ""Commandeering would fit with the few facts that we do know, and (it's) certainly a theory that we haven't heard a lot of that isn't a conspiracy,"" Bergen said. Experts are divided on this theory, partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world's attention -- unless potential terrorists were waiting for something. MH370 went to Kazakhstan. Outlandish conjecture or genius insight? The theory that Russian actors on board MH370 found a way to get the plane through the border territory of China, Pakistan and India to a Kazakh landing strip leased to Russia comes from science journalist and private pilot Jeff Wise. Fleets of ships and search aircraft are looking in the wrong direction, he says. The airliner went north, not south. Investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the Inmarsat satellite data. ""This is not a normal investigation. They need to throw out the book,"" Wise has said. Another aviation analyst, David Soucie, also cast doubt after MH370 went missing on the most widely held belief that the plane hit the Indian Ocean. ""If it had crashed in the way that we think it did, which is to run out of fuel and hit the water and break up into pieces, there would be pieces somewhere,"" he said. But Michael Exner, an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry, says the data ""accurately and unambiguously"" shows MH370 went down near the so-called 7th arc, a path along which the search has been focused. ""The current ATSB search strategy remains the best search strategy,"" he said. In a less sinister but equally lethal explanation, some experts theorized the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction. Perhaps the electronics died, or a fire broke out, preventing the pilots from communicating. Maybe they turned to look for a landing strip but couldn't steer the plane properly. Pilots had trouble embracing the thought. ""I've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened,"" said Jim Tilmon, an aviation expert and retired American Airlines pilot. ""One possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very, very hard to imagine because (the plane) has so many generators coming from different places,"" Tilmon said. If they fail, there are other backups. He has said he's never heard of anything like it happening before. For months after MH370 disappeared, Malaysian officials reported details of the search to next of kin and the public. Something would be spotted, hopes rose, and then it didn't pan out. Hopes were dashed; anguish returned. Sunday, a year to the day after the plane disappeared, the international independent investigation committee released an interim report on the disappearance of MH370. It found no indications of unusual behavior among the aircraft's pilots and cabin crew before it took off, and said that Zaharie had had no personal or financial problems that would cast suspicion on him. The interim report also revealed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon on the plane's flight data recorder had expired more than a year before its disappearance. The battery on the plane's other so-called black box, the cockpit voice recorder, had been replaced as scheduled, and remained within its expiry date, the report said. CNN's Pamela Boykoff and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Many experts believe the plane went down in the South Indian Ocean .

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)A former lawyer for the doctor who helped the CIA look for Osama bin Laden has been shot dead in northwest Pakistan, police said. Unidentified gunmen attacked the lawyer, Samiullah Afridi, in his car near the city of Peshawar on Tuesday, said Mian Saeed, a police superintendent in Peshawar. Two different militant groups claimed responsibility for the killing. The lawyer had represented Dr. Shakeel Afridi, who was convicted of treason in 2012 by a Pakistani tribal court and is now serving a 23-year prison sentence. The two men are not related. The doctor helped the CIA set up a fake vaccination campaign in an attempt to collect DNA samples from relatives of Bin Laden in an effort to verify his presence in a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. The Qaeda leader was killed in a U.S. raid on the compound in May 2011. It was unclear which of the two groups claiming responsibility for the attack was actually behind it. Fahad Marwat, a spokesman for the militant group Jundallah, told CNN that Afridi was on the group's hit list. But Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesman for a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, said his group had carried out the assassination because Samiullah Afridi defended the doctor, whom he described as ""a friend"" of bin Laden's killers. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said Jundallah is ""kind of a splinter group"" of the Pakistani Taliban that's ""been around for a long time."" ""They're extremely violent,"" he said. ""They've been killing all sorts of religious minorities in Pakistan."" Last month, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside a Shiite mosque in the city of Rawalpindi. Bergen said Dr. Afridi is ""a very unpopular figure in Pakistan"" because of the perception that he was involved in helping find Bin Laden. ""And his lawyer, by extension, would also be seen as an unpopular person because of that perception,"" he said. But Bergen said he didn't think the doctor played a key role in the hunt for Bin Laden. ""The idea was the doctor and his staff would take DNA samples from the Bin Laden kids as part of this 'vaccination program,'"" he said.  ""That never happened because the kids never came out."" Although Dr. Afridi was working for U.S. intelligence, ""the CIA wasn't telling the doctor, you're helping us find bin Laden,"" Bergen said. After the killing of bin Laden, health workers administering polio vaccinations have come to be viewed with suspicion by many Pakistanis. The vaccination teams have repeatedly been targeted by militants. The latest instance came Wednesday when unidentified attackers killed one polio vaccination worker and wounded another in Bajaur agency in northwestern Pakistan, local authorities said. Journalist Zahir Shah reported from Peshawar, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

"(CNN)Ryan Reynolds gave us a sneak peek at his new costume last week, and followed it up with a first look on video. The actor posed on a bearskin rug to show off how he looks as masked Marvel character Deadpool in a post that quickly got positive responses from fans on social media. The photo is a parody of Burt Reynolds' famous nude image from a 1972 issue of Cosmopolitan and is very much in keeping with Deadpool's wisecracking, tongue-in-cheek persona. (Here's the original, in case you were born after 1972 or chose to delete the image from your mind.) Deadpool's costume, a favorite among comic book fans and convention cosplayers, includes a mask that covers the entire face, so we might not see the face of 2010's sexiest man for much of the movie. Reynolds played Deadpool in 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" but he never wore the famous red and black attire. Instead, he wore an unremarkable black suit bearing none of the hallmarks of the costume worn in the comics. As the vanity shot indicates, Reynolds will be fully suited when returns to the role in first the feature-length ""Deadpool,"" scheduled for release in 2016. In response to skepticism online who was beneath the mask, screenwriter Rhett Reese confirmed via Twitter that Reynolds was indeed in the suit. Then as a special treat for April Fools' Day, Reynolds was ""interviewed"" by ""Extra"" host Mario Lopez, about the debate over whether the movie should be rated PG-13 or R. The ultraviolent Deadpool would seem to lend himself to an R rating, but Reynolds settled all that in memorable fashion, ""killing"" Lopez in the process.","Ryan Reynolds debuts first look at his Deadpool costume .

"(CNN)Deep within the Amazonian rainforest of Ecuador live the Huaorani. Photographer Trupal Pandya traveled about 30 hours by air, water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits. The Huaorani, which means ""the people"" or ""human beings,"" are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years. Until about the 1960s, they never had any contact with the outside world. Pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation, who travel to areas outside of their community, and the older generation, who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living. Diverse changes have taken place within the community: the introduction of radios within many Huaorani homes, the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of Westernized clothing. For Pandya, these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the Huaorani. ""The biggest (reason) was to just go out there and photograph the change before everything changes,"" Pandya said. ""I think if I would have (photographed the Huaorani) 10 years back down the line or a little later than that, I don't think I would have got what I just got."" Another aspect of modernization has to do with language. Many Huaorani, who for years have only communicated using a regional dialect, now speak the Ecuadorian native language of Spanish. Pandya speaks English, so he needed translators to interact effectively. But it is apparent from his experiences with the Huaorani that actions can certainly not only speak louder than words, but be more effectual than words when attempting to convey one's intentions. ""I never started photographing when I (first) saw (the Huaorani),"" he said. ""I didn't even have my camera. I waited to let them get used to me around them. I gave myself time to get a little easier around them. Even if you cannot talk in the same language, I feel that you definitely connect to them as a human being."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Prior to creating formal portraits using his professional camera equipment and lighting, Pandya took Polaroid photos of the Huaorani that they were then able to keep. ""I think some of them saw the Polaroid for the first time, so they were really happy to see themselves like that,"" Pandya said. For his formal portraits, Pandya placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the Huaorani in a very direct and concise manner, eliminating the presence of any distractions. ""The main reason was to have the focus only on the people and their clothes and nothing else but them as an individual, them as a human being,"" he said. Pandya's decision to use a white background also proved effective in highlighting the coexistence between the Huaorani and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment. Creating portraits of the Huaorani has been a ""fascinating, challenging"" experience for Pandya, who is studying photography in New York at the Fashion Institute of Technology. After witnessing firsthand the simplicity in which the Huaorani live in harmony with their environment, Pandya said he finds himself thinking about and reflecting upon what it truly means to be satisfied and content with life. ""I think the question I ask myself is: 'Who's richer?' "" he said. ""(This has been) a really big learning curve of how to just live a very beautiful, normal life.""

"(CNN)As a well-traveled photographer, Pieter ten Hoopen is no stranger to refugee camps. But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there. His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound. ""I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,"" ten Hoopen said. With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available. The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken. One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered. ""This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,"" ten Hoopen said. The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees. The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos. Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely. ""They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible,"" he said. ""I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective."" The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well. ""I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,"" ten Hoopen said. He said some patients at the hospital ""had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio."" Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength. Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera. Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography. ""I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,"" he said. ""It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you."" How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear? ""It wasn't hard,"" he said. ""I just told them to relax and have fun. ""Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature.""

"(CNN)A Delta airplane had a close call Thursday, skidding off a snowy runway and stopping within feet of icy waters. Any accident raises questions, and the National Transportation Safety Board is sending people to New York's LaGuardia Airport to investigate. Although the cause of the crash is not yet clear, officials will no doubt be looking at the conditions on the runway. Was it cleared and ready? Did the pilot have all relevant information? CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo breaks down the responsibilities around runways. ""There are a couple of things that airports have to do,"" she said. ""The airport has to go out and measure whether the airport runways have friction, meaning when those tires touch down that they will have some contact with the runway."" That information is then relayed to the air traffic control tower, according to Schiavo. ""As to whether the runways are slippery, that is breaking action, and the airport gets that from the reports of previous pilots,"" she said. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Patrick Foye told reporters that the runway in question had been plowed shortly before the incident. Pilots on previous planes reported ""good braking action,"" he said. Just minutes after the Delta plane landed, all of LaGuardia Arport shut down to air traffic. One runway reopened at 2 p.m. ET. The other remained closed. Miles O'Brien, another CNN aviation analyst, highlights how difficult it is to understand all the elements in play. ""The wind was changing. The temperatures were changing. It was moving from rain to freezing rain, ultimately into snow. So you had a very dynamic weather picture, and let's not forget, it's kind of a subjective thing,"" he said. ""One pilot might say, 'oh that was no problem,' but he might have learned how to fly in northern Canada.""","Port Authority chief: Runway was just plowed, other pilots reported ""good braking action""

"(CNN)""Attenzione, the wine!"" That is an old punchline in the Weir home, thanks to plastic cups of Chianti, a low bridge and a gondolier named Marco. His concerned bark broke the spell as my wife and I smooched and gaped, moon-eyed dorks on our first night in Venice. When I told my dad I was taking my wife to Italy for our first anniversary, he snorted. ""Where you gonna take her for your 10th? The moon?"" He was right. It was perfect. Pigeons in San Marco, sunset over the Grand Canal, Bellinis and cheeseburgers at Harry's. Venice entered our bloodstream that trip. But in the years since, I've heard very different stories from disappointed folks back from their first trip to La Serenissima because the city of water and love now has too much of both. Too much water, and way too many lovers. Because this impossible city of palazzos and cathedrals is built atop wooden posts driven into the muddy floor of a lagoon, Venice has been slowly sinking since Casanova canoodled down its canals. When aquifers were tapped to build massive petrochemical plants on the nearby mainland, Venice sank faster. And then folks noticed that the sea level was on a slow but steady rise. In the 1920s, there were about 400 incidents of acqua alta, or high water, when the right mix of tides and winds drives the liquid streets up into homes and shops in the lowers parts of the city. By the 1990s, there were 2,400 incidents -- and new records are set every year. But, the Italians have a plan. It is called the MOSE Project. MOSE is an acronym for ""Experimental Electromechanical Module,"" but it is also the Italian word for Moses, a guy known for parting the sea and protecting the faithful. It's a system of 78 massive gates mounted to hinges on the ocean floor. The gates are filled with air, and designed to rise and create a temporary sea wall. Since the plan was hatched, low-lying cities from Miami to Mumbai have taken a keen interest to see if the idea can work. Everybody is still waiting: MOSE is now 10 years behind schedule, and $5 billion over budget. And on one early morning in 2014, police rounded up 35 people at the highest levels of MOSE, including Giorgio Orsoni, the mayor of Venice. While several went to prison on plea bargains, the now-former mayor is fighting charges of corruption and kickbacks. But while I went back to Venice to do a story on rising water, instead I found a surprising drama about the rising tide of humanity. People know Venice is special and fragile, so they come -- to the tune of 20 million tourists a year. Meanwhile, the watery headaches and cost of living has created a mass exodus of native Venetians: 100,000 have moved to the mainland in a single generation, and around 60,000 remain. On a busy summer day, in the most popular section of the city, tourists can outnumber Venetians 600-1. In Manhattan, that number is 8-1. When a cruise ship dumps thousands of people into Venice at once, they squeeze down jammed medieval streets where purveyors of overpriced pizza and cheap masks have replaced the shops of artists and artisans. Each year, more people come. Each year, less get to enjoy the city we found on that first magical night. People have been worrying about the impending death of Venice for centuries, but the place is in trouble, now more than ever. And in an age of rising seas and exploding populations, Venice is a test.  A test to preserve beauty, history and harmony from the greatest threats: time, tide and greed.","Venice, Italy, has slowly been sinking .

"(CNN)A 17-year-old male fatally shot an Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown, targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside, Dallas police said Friday. Authorities don't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim, Ahmed Al-Jumaili, Dallas Police Maj. Jeff Cotner said reporters, nor do they believe he knew Al-Jumaili's ethnicity. And they haven't given any indication Al-Jumaili had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend's apartment, if that in fact happened. Cotner said that, while there have nearby shootings that might be tied to gangs, ""we (have been) unable to substantiate ... whether or not there was an actual shooting at the apartment."" What police do believe, based on witness testimony and other evidence, is that the teenager shot and killed Al-Jumaili, for whatever reason. ""When he saw Mr. Al-Jumaili and their family, he targeted them, he shot at them with intent,"" Cotner said of the suspect, who is under arrest. ""And as Mr. Al-Jumaili ran back toward his apartment, he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire."" Dallas police named the suspected shooter, though CNN is not identifying him yet since he's a minor and it's not clear if he'll be charged as an adult. The teen turns 18 in May, police said. Until the fatal shots ended Al-Jumalli's life, March 4 had been a day of fun and joy for Al-Jumaili and his family. The 36-year-old, who had immigrated to the United States 20 days earlier, joined his brother and wife taking pictures in the parking lot of a Dallas apartment complex amid the snow. ""Just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us,"" Cotner said. Then came the gunshots and Al-Jumaili's cry, ""I'm hit!"" A few hours later, the Iraqi immigrant was dead. Three days later, a Dallas detective found surveillance footage from a nearby elementary school showing four people coming from the apartment complex. The black-and-white soundless surveillance video shows one person apparently carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person seemingly carrying a hand gun, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said. Then, on Tuesday, a witness walked into the Richardson, Texas, police station and provided a nickname of a possible suspect -- Kaca. That nickname eventually led to the 17-year-old police believe shot Al-Jumaili. Investigators interviewed him for the first time Thursday, at which time he denied ever leaving his girlfriend's apartment. Then, authorities got the OK to search his apartment and found an unfired rifle cartridge, Cotner said. The teen was brought to Dallas police headquarters for another interview, and he changed his story. Yes, he had been at the scene of Al-Jumaili's killing. But no, he hadn't done it. Yet that's not what someone who'd been with him said. According to Cotner, this witness said he saw Al-Jumaili taking pictures in the snow, . ""The witness stated that he observed (the suspect) raise the rifle,"" the police major said. ""... The witness then heard one shot, followed by several more."" Then all of them bolted. The incident caused waves in Dallas' Muslim community. While police haven't given any indication this was a hate crime, though Alia Salem -- executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area -- noted ""a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims."" Speaking Friday on behalf of Al-Jumaili's family, Salem expressed gratitude to police and others for their work on the case and said ""our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this tragic death."" ""We just want to see justice happen here,"" she said. ""And this is the first step in that.""

"Hong Kong (CNN)The search is on for China's teen top guns. China said Monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits. The schools, in 11 provinces across the country, will recruit 1,000 male junior high school students aged between 14 to 16, the China Daily reported. Successful applicants will receive flight training and ""military standard"" physical training in addition to their regular high-school studies. It's the latest attempt by the People's Liberation Army's air force to attract more talent. Last year, it said it would require wannabe pilots to take psychological assessments and a flight simulation test. China's military has traditionally been focused on winning land battles and is now making efforts to improve its air and naval power in the pursuit of what President Xi Jinping has called ""balanced strength."" ""China has made many strides in the development of advanced aircraft, but it must make sure there can be sufficient, well-trained pilots to fly them,"" Wang Ya'nan, deputy editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine told The China Daily last month. The recruits will receive a stipend and board at the schools. Traditionally, serving in the military has not been a sought-after career in China and a U.S. report on China's military transformation released last month singled out the quality and professionalism of new recruits as a major challenge. Many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education, while country's one-child policy, which has created the ""little emperor"" phenomenon of spoiled children, produces recruits who ""may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline,"" the report added. To this end, China has been making efforts to recruit more high school and college graduates as it modernizes its armed forces. On completing the three-year program, students will take a pilot selection test, and those who pass will join a PLA flight academy and those who fail can choose to enter other military universities or civilian institutes.","China wants 1,000 male junior high school students for pilot training .

"Fall River, Massachusetts  (CNN)Shayanna Jenkins, the fiancee of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez, revealed for the first time Monday she suspects marijuana was in a box she was instructed to remove from the couple's home the day after the slaying of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, the boyfriend of Shayanna Jenkins' sister and semipro football player who was found dead June 17, 2013. Hernandez has also pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. For the first time, Shayanna Jenkins told jurors on Monday the box smelled ""skunky,"" making her think it was marijuana. Her new description came during cross-examination. Earlier, she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn't know what was in the box, said Hernandez never told her, nor did she look. Jenkins testified Friday that on the day after Lloyd's slaying, her fiance called her with instructions that it was important to discard the box.  On Monday, she described his tone as ""normal"" when he made the request and said she had never been asked by prosecutors what she thought the box smelled like. ""Were you ever asked what you thought was in the box?"" asked Hernandez lawyer Charles Rankin about her previous testimony to the grand jury. ""Never,"" said Jenkins. ""Were you ever asked if it had any smell to it?"" he asked. ""Never,"" she replied. Jenkins' revelation contradicts the prosecution's previous suspicion that the weapon used in the slaying was in the box. No weapon in the case has been recovered. Home surveillance video played inside the courtroom Monday showed  Shayanna Jenkins hoisting a black garbage bag from her home and putting it in a trunk of her sister's car. At the time, Shaneah Jenkins had been at her home grieving over the death of her boyfriend. Shaneah Jenkins was present in court on Monday and cried while listening to the testimony and watching the video of her sister Shayanna carrying the trash bag. The two sisters now barely speak to each other. Shaneah Jenkins sits next to Lloyd's mother in the courtroom on the opposite side of Hernandez's defense team. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Shayanna Jenkins said she disposed of it at a location she cannot remember. ""I found a random dumpster, and put it in there,"" she told Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley. When questioned about her inability to remember the dumpster's location and other details, Shayanna Jenkins said she had been unsettled at the time. ""I was nervous. I had to comfort my sister. Everyone's emotions were on me, and it was a form of breaking down at that point,"" she said. On Monday, Shayanna Jenkins was asked about what she called  an ""on-again, off-again"" relationship with Hernandez, her high school sweetheart. She recalled spending time apart from Hernandez after discovering evidence of infidelity on Hernandez's phone. She told the court that before getting back together with him, she had to make a difficult choice about her future with the football star. ""I made a decision that if I was going to move back in with Aaron, I would need to compromise with his behavior, including his infidelity,"" she told the courtroom and then started to cry. After Hernandez proposed in October 2012, Jenkins said she continued to tolerate his infidelity. Jenkins admitted giving some different answers during her grand jury testimony, in part, she said because of confusing questions by prosecutors. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty. This week, the jury is expected to hear from Alexander Bradley, Hernandez's former right hand man, who has accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face in February of 2013. However, a judge has barred him from discussing that. Bradley is jailed in an unrelated shooting. The trial is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. Tuesday. Susan Candiotti and Lawrence Crook reported from Fall River, Massachusetts.  CNN's Karen Smith wrote from Atlanta.","Aaron Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of Odin Lloyd .

"(CNN)This is what it's come to. Starbucks asked its local baristas to have conversations about race. Not the federal government or Congress. Not academia or the NAACP. But a national coffee shop chain waded into an area of social conflict that is as old as the slave ships and as modern as stop-and-frisk policing. Then people went crazy. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was accused of ruining that magic morning moment when customers fork over $4.15  for a ""grande"" coffee with warm skim milk and vanilla extract. A barista writing ""Race Together"" on cups was called an affront to mornings and coffee -- such important conversations belonged inside a hallowed institution, not a common coffee shop, where apparently people no longer chat. A lot of the reaction came via snipes on Twitter from people calling Schultz out on Starbucks' diversity, the hue of his mochaccinos, or his liberal ""brewing"" of controversy.  The nastiness drove the company's communications chief briefly off Twitter. Then, after barely a week, Starbucks shut down the whole darned thing, pushing ahead with a hiring and media initiative instead. But treating Twitter as an important voice of American conscience is like focusing on the annoying beep emitting from your smoke detector instead of addressing the fact that the battery's run dry. What's trending is not necessarily what matters. People do need to talk about race. Not because of a harmless coffee cup, but because we have a real race problem and we need solutions. Starfish Media Group just finished a nationwide tour of American colleges, universities and communities called ""Black in America 2015."" It's based on our CNN documentary series that takes a close look at the challenges and triumphs of being black in America: from the hopes of the Martin Luther King era to today's unlikely brew of un-kept promises and vast opportunities. There were plenty of conversations about race among the thousands of black and white college students and panelists like rapper Chuck D and Cedric Alexander of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. They lined up to talk about how their experiences mirrored those of the people in the documentaries: black families finding common roots with whites, the politics of skin color, or the black-and-blue conflict over the police engaging in racial profiling. The topics and perceptions were an unending thread. Not only did people talk when they were offered the chance; they wanted to talk. At Stony Brook University, one of our tour stops, a young white male student asked our panel if effecting change in racial discrimination today was even harder to achieve than it was during the Civil Rights era when racism was more overt.  What a good question. There are no longer signs segregating our bathrooms and water fountains, but police are being caught on cell phone videos in apparent attacks on young black men -- the new signposts of racial inequality. New technology has multiplied and spread symbols of racial injustice, but that has created new challenges and new reasons to talk. In this country we sometimes pretend we are so far past the ugly days of Jim Crow and middle-of-the-night cross burnings as to have no racial issues to discuss. We did, after all, elect a black president who, like me, has both a black and a white parent and descends from immigrants. But blacks and whites don't see things the same, and that is a big problem we need to discuss. Pew Research Center asked people of both races this year how much more needs to be done to achieve racial equality. Seventy-nine percent of blacks said ""a lot"" more work needs to be done. Just 44% of whites thought the same. Our country is more diverse than ever -- 13% African-American and 17% Latino, according to the U.S. Census -- but we still live in different worlds.  Blacks have more debt, higher unemployment, less financial security, are less likely to be married or own homes, and are less likely to be represented in corporate boardrooms, the tech industry or even Congress. Perhaps more alarmingly, 75% of black students are going to schools where the majority of the students look just like them. It has been 60 years since Brown v. Board of Education was supposed to bring our schoolchildren together on an equal playing field. That is something worth talking about. Recently, Bryan Stevenson, who founded the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, examined the details behind 3,959 lynchings in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950. He wants to raise money to memorialize the sites. We may not live in that land any more, though the FBI is investigating the death of a black man found hanging among the walnut trees this month in Mississippi. But we do live in a land where there is a modern terror digging roots in the minds of young black men. In 2014, our CNN documentary ""Black in America: Black & Blue"" showed police officers talking fearfully about facing off against young criminals on familiar streets and African-American men in fear that they would become the victims of police shootings. The documentary was released just as grand juries chose not to indict the police officers in the Eric Garner and Ferguson, Missouri, cases. To me, it reveals how damaging the rift in our perceptions can be. A young man named Keeshan Harley talked about being frisked over 100 times. Why? ""Because I fit the description,"" said the black college student. Seventy percent of blacks believe, just like Keeshan, that the police treat racial and ethnic groups differently and do not hold police officers accountable for misconduct, according to a study by the Pew Research Center. The percentage of whites who agree with that perception hovers in the mid-30s. Much of the white community doesn't perceive or understand the persecution of a Keeshan Harley. But when they see a videotape, as in the Eric Garner case, many finally recognize there is a problem. We need to consider how a lack of confidence in government and law enforcement is dangerous in a civil society. A young man named Luis Paulino shared a cell phone video with me when I was reporting ""Black & Blue."" It shows tall white police officers beating Luis on the street for no apparent reason. He couldn't call the police for help. These were the police. What if there had been no tape, I asked him. ""Nobody would have believed me,"" he said. ""It would have been my word against 15 police officers."" That is modern-day terror, and worth at least a coffee shop chat. Black people talk about race all the time, from processing comments about our freckles to recounting how someone rolls their fingers through our child's curly hair. We don't get or expect an even playing field at work. We don't ever get to cross a street in a hoodie at night without the other pedestrians making a string of assumptions. We don't have some mutable characteristic. We wake up and go to bed black, and that makes a difference in this country. CEO Howard Schultz was left wondering why it was such a bad idea to encourage people to talk about race. His initial letter to his staff made it clear he believes his #racetogether coffee cup campaign can contribute to starting an important conversation. ""What if our customers ... had a renewed level of understanding and sensitivity about the issue, and they themselves would spread that to their own sphere of influence?"" What a good question it was. What if?","Starbucks quickly shut down its program of asking baristas to talk to the public about race .

"(CNN)There are two main ways visitors to Ho Chi Minh City cross the streets. One approach is to step with zen-like calm into the swirl of honking scooters and serenely stride across the road without breaking step. Like locals, they're part of the flow, part of the (exhaust-choked) stream of traffic. The other is to stand anxiously on the edge of the curb, toes curled like a diver's, waiting for a non-existent stoplight, then plunge into the melee while letting out a small yelp before slaloming across the street like a demented Frogger. Some, like Steve Mueller, would question why cross the road at all. If you can't beat them, join them. Which is what the South Carolinian did -- he now runs the city's Vietnam Vespa Adventures. It's a tour company that provides two-wheel thrills on the Italian vintage scooters, Vespa, around Ho Chi Minh City, out into the Mekong Delta and beyond. Being on a scooter in Ho Chi Minh is the best way to feel a part of the city, says Mueller. ""It's really an authentic experience,"" he says. ""Being side by side with the locals."" Day tours take in popular sights like the Opera House and central post office designed by Gustav Eiffel, but also stop at local eateries and offbeat locations. One popular early morning pit stop is Tao Dan park where Ho Chi Minh City's bird fanciers puff themselves up like their caged pets in a display of tweeting one-upmanship. Unfortunately/thankfully, you're not the one driving. All the mopeds are driven by local, experienced drivers who have no problem with the swarm of vehicles on the roads. A local tour guide rides along, too, to add context to the sights, smells and sounds experienced from the back of a two-stroke motor. Mueller took a circuitous route to setting up the company. After traveling around Southeast Asia in 1997 he settled in Vietnam the following year and discovered a glut of classic Italian scooters that needed a bit of TLC. He bought his first one after just three days in the country and spying an opportunity to tap into international Vespa enthusiasts' desire for authentic rides, set up a restoration and export business. It became so successful he was in danger of putting himself out of a job, so in 2006 he decided to start a tour company offering multi-day tours outside of Ho Chi Minh City. According to Mueller, his business was kick-started by Vietnam's appearance on the TV program ""Top Gear,"" which showed the country's beautiful countryside and underused roads. Longer trips are still offered by Vespa Tours, taking willing riders as far as the Vietnam Highlands and the coastal city of Nha Trang over seven days. Most of the scooters in Mueller's garage hark back to the golden age of Vespas, the late '60s and 1970s, refurbished with replacement parts from Piaggio-licensed machinists in India. True to their reputation, the 100 or so classic scooters owned by Vespa Adventures break down frequently -- mechanics are on hand for running repairs -- but Mueller believes its all part of the charm in a city where two wheels beats two legs.

"(CNN)After enduring about four days at sea under stressful conditions, Tyke, an African elephant, escaped during a circus performance, crushing her trainer to death and injuring dozens of others while storming through the streets of Honolulu. Tyke suffered a slow and painful death after being hit by a barrage of bullets fired by police officers. That incident happened 20 years ago, but the welcome announcement last week by Feld Entertainment -- parent company to Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus -- that it plans to retire elephants from its circuses by 2018 is a reminder of how that controversy lingers. In analyzing the horrific experience involving Tyke, it was reported that the elephant had been rebellious before she arrived on our shores, and she is said to have had a history of acting out and being unpredictable. And though she was not submissive and was difficult to train, her owners sent her to Honolulu anyway. Sadly, performing animals in circuses and traveling shows are too often subjected to inhumane conditions, especially in their training. Reward-based training takes time and patience, which are things that many circus trainers do not have. Instead, these trainers frequently resort to other inhumane means, involving beating the animals, using electrical prods, depriving them of food, chaining them and other brutal methods to force the animals into submission. Following this sort of brutal training, the animals may appear tame, but they are still wild and their original wild instincts will appear if provoked. Meanwhile, animals that are no longer useful to the circus or traveling shows due to age or temperament may be given away or sold to other less reputable organizations. They lack proper veterinary care, and what little quality of life they did have is diminished further. The welfare of the animal is not taken into account. Rather than being treated as a commodity by the owner, animals should be protected and well cared for. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey has said it prides itself on providing a healthy environment for animals. Yet whatever provisions they may make, the reality is that circuses are particularly unsuited to meet the unique needs of elephants. These extremely intelligent animals live in large family groups when in the wild, and they form close social ties with other elephants. But the circus environment keeps them isolated and provides little to no interaction with their own species. Their herd-like behavior is ignored when they are being trained to perform. These very social animals, simply put, should not be living in solitary confinement. Animal welfare advocates have often been criticized as being against ""fun."" We are told that circuses and traveling shows are about education. But what could one possibly learn about animals from watching these shows? Observing wild animals perform unnatural tricks while dancing in tutus only teaches the public that the sole purpose of animals is our entertainment. Are these really the values we want our children to learn? Wildlife sanctuaries and accredited zoos should exist for conservation, preservation and propagation of species and for public education. This is where learning should occur. Wild animals should be permitted to exist undisturbed in their natural environments, and when they must be confined, it should be in a natural setting consistent with their physical and behavioral needs. This is the proper setting for education and study. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus has come a long way in its thinking, and for that we congratulate the company for its decision to move the elephants to its sanctuary in Florida. Rather than fighting the many cities and counties that have taken steps to pass anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances, the company instead is putting its resources toward the study and protection of elephants. With this step, we look forward to the day that it, and other circuses, phase out all wild animals, including the lions and tigers that also are featured in their shows. After all, wild and exotic animals are not meant to entertain us. The Hawaiian Humane Society feels strongly about the humane treatment of all animals, whether domesticated or wild. Our organization, like others in the animal welfare movement, seeks to prevent any practice that might produce pain, stress, injury or suffering to any animal. This is an important part of creating a more humane society -- for people and all animals.","Feld Entertainment plans to retire elephants from its circuses .

"(CNN)While Boston and other New England cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons, other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record-breaking winter conditions. All that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year. March is typically a transitional month, where warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold Arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. This year, however, the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the East remains stuck in more of a winter mode. ""We're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather, and the right ingredients -- moisture, instability and lift -- (have yet to come together),"" said Greg Carbin, the Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather. So far this year it's been extremely quiet. By this time in mid-March the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide. This year they have issued a paltry four. Both January and February were well below normal. March has been even quieter.  At a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably, there has not been a single report this month of a tornado. ""We are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather"" Carbin said. In fact if we make it through the entire month of March without any tornado reports it would be a first, according to the center. There have been around 20 tornadoes reported since January 1, well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-March. This year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the United States the past several years.  In 2014, we ended the year with a count of 881, well below the average of 1,253. Meteorologists don't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes, but one possible answer is the development of El Nino, a warming in the equatorial Pacific, which can influence weather patterns globally. Recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the United States during these events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently said that a weak El Nino had developed. So while all agree this is good news so far this year, it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet. Weather patterns can change quickly. In 1984, for instance, there was a very similar slow start through mid-March and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of June, according to data from the storm center. It's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low, you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example. The year ended being roughly 30% below normal for the number of tornadoes, yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record. The twisters in Moore and El Reno, Oklahoma, occurred in May of that year with devastating results. Tornadoes Fast Facts .","There have been only four tornado watches in 2015 .

"(CNN)Americans like to complain about the endless political gridlock in our capital. But if we're honest we need to look in the mirror too. Many of us abandoned the field by not voting in last year's midterm elections. Those of us who did vote elected more fire breathers than bridge builders to Congress. What's more, when we're invited to tell our representatives what we want, we can be as demagogic as they are. Remember the Town Hall meetings in the summer of 2009, which erupted in shouting matches between citizens and legislators over health care?  Who can forget the Massachusetts woman holding a picture of President Obama defaced to look like Hitler, who demanded to know why former Rep. Barney Frank supported the ""Nazi policy"" of extending health care to all? His frank response: ""Ma'am, trying to have a conversation with you would be like trying to argue with a dining room table. I have no interest in doing it."" Rather than blame our leaders for the dysfunction, we need to change the game.  We can turn to public forums to tackle big issues of the day. Consider two efforts to move beyond the contentious debate about climate change. In Washington, the Senate made a splash by voting for the first time to acknowledge that global warming is really happening. Unfortunately, senators couldn't agree on whether humans are changing the climate and what to do about it. Stalemate. Outside of the Beltway, in Southeast Florida, it's been five years since the region adopted a comprehensive climate action plan with 110 steps aimed at mitigating its dangers and reducing the region's carbon emissions. As research by Dan Kahan of Yale Law School shows, these counties took action not because Floridians are less divided over political issues, or less partisan, or more scientifically literate than the rest of America. No one sang Kumbaya or hugged a polar bear. Instead, Florida officials engaged their constituents through scores of open forums convened by governments, businesses and community groups. Local leaders appealed across party lines by framing the issue as one of protecting residents from rising sea levels and storm surges, rather than as a divisive referendum on whether to believe in climate science. Rather than seeing citizens as targets of a political campaign, officials governed with the diverse residents of their community to develop practical solutions that garnered broad support. ""We recognize each other's differences,"" explained Susanne Torriente, Fort Lauderdale's assistant city manager, ""but also recognize that if we work together we can make South Florida more resilient."" Given what Florida accomplished, Gov. Rick Scott's ban on using the terms ""climate change"" in state policy discussions to avoid polarization looks smart, not smarmy. Florida is not alone.  Our research identifies many successful examples of political deliberation in well-designed forums where citizens and officials engage in give-and-take discussion and arrive at solutions. These forums have developed ""participatory budgets"" in many cities, energy policy in Texas and Nebraska, community policing in Chicago and much more. Some of these forums are healing the rotting roots of democracy. For example, gerrymandering of political districts has become one way to protect the party in power and create safe seats for incumbents, sapping their incentive to represent constituents from the opposing party or craft bipartisan legislation. As a North Carolina state senator once said, ""We are in the business of rigging elections."" In response in 2010 Californians used their power to approve ballot initiatives to create a nonpartisan Citizens Redistricting Commission, which redrew political districts that better reflected the state's communities and helped elect a legislature that could work together more productively. This is one reason why the state's budgeting process, once an endless game of chicken that paralyzed public services and rang up huge deficits, has become less rancorous and more fiscally responsible.  Let's hope the Supreme Court doesn't kill this reform. But not every ballot initiative is as enlightened. Many are highly technical proposals pushed by special interests, and multiple initiatives can overwhelm the public's ability to evaluate them all. Oregon's legislature responded by creating a Citizens Initiative Review Board, which researches proposed ballot measures, deliberates about their pros and cons, and makes recommendations on how fellow citizens should vote. Many Oregonians rely on the board's recommendations, which are published in the state's voter guide and mailed to every household. Unlike politics as usual (and those infamous Town Hall meetings), these forums put citizens at the center of decision-making.  Citizens are challenged to deliberate with each other and forge agreements, with officials and experts joining the effort by giving testimony and feedback. Moderators challenge people to treat other respectfully and consider a wide range of arguments and evidence, rather than engaging in hand-to-hand political combat. Grandstanding and obstructionism don't play as well in these forums as they do on the Senate floor, partisan media outlets or the local tavern. It's still politics, but it's a politics that offers better odds of success by engaging both citizens and officials productively. The people who participate, many of whom regard typical public meetings like Ebola, say they actually enjoy talking politics with other citizens and officials, sometimes for the first time in their lives.  Can you imagine that? While there are experts who know how to design good forums, it's no easy task. As the health care Town Hall Meetings showed, simply throwing open the doors is not sufficient. Most people don't have the time to attend a forum, so they need to know whether people like them deliberated and the rules of engagement were fair. It's important to ensure that citizens can participate on equal terms. If we want to move beyond political stalemate, we should strengthen these innovative forums for citizens to deliberate with each other and officials. When these forums work, they put citizens and leaders on the same side of the chessboard.","Americans like to complain about the political gridlock in Congress where nothing much gets done .

"(CNN)The 1-0 scoreline that took Barcelona through to the Champions League quarterfinals made their clash with Manchester City all seem rather academic. Yet it was anything but as Lionel Messi's masterful first-half display had some purring once again about his status as the greatest footballer of all time. Meanwhile, the second half witnessed another masterclass as England international Joe Hart somehow kept City in a lively encounter with save after save. In between, the man that City usually rely on to dig them out of tight spots -- Sergio Aguero -- failed to score a late penalty that could have set up a tense finish. In truth, the English champions deserved little over the two legs as Barcelona built upon their 2-1 victory in Manchester three weeks ago to go through as 3-1 aggregate winners. The four-time champions may not have added the goals they deserved but they did reach the last eight for the eighth year in a row, a competition record. ""It was a game with a lot of chances where we could have finished it off a lot earlier,"" Barca coach Luis Enrique told reporters. ""We got what we wanted which was to go through to the next round and I am happy with the display. We played well and this is a big boost for us at this stage of the season."" The high-profile scrutiny of the relationship between coach Enrique and Argentine superstar Lionel Messi suddenly seems a distant memory with Barca still capable of repeating their wonder year of 2009. On that occasion, they won the Champions League, La Liga and Spanish Super Cup under the guidance of Pep Guardiola, who was one of many enthralled spectators inside the Camp Nou. Now in charge of fellow quarterfinalists Bayern Munich, Guardiola was out of his seat -- seemingly in celebration -- as Ivan Rakitic opened the scoring after 31 minutes when lifting the ball over Hart following a fine pass from Messi. The diminutive Argentine flashed two free-kicks from distance onto the top of the goal netting while also displaying an array of twists, turns and embarrassing 'nutmegs' for his opponents. It was enough to make former England international Gary Lineker, the top scorer at the 1986 World Cup, proclaim him the best footballer ever. While that engrossing debate rumbles on, Messi set about trying to put the tie to bed but he met fierce resistance from Hart, who had kept City in the tie in the first leg when saving the Argentine's injury-time penalty. England's number one made 10 saves, the most of any keeper in any Champions League this season, not only repelling Messi but also Neymar and Suarez, both of whom were also denied by the post in the first half. To their credit, the Premier League side -- who were looking to reach the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time -- improved after the break but found chances hard to come by. That was until Aguero won a penalty after going down under a challenge from first Gerard Pique, and then Argentina colleague Javier Mascherano, with just over ten minutes left. But Dutch keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen dived right -- in both senses -- to beat away the spotkick and ultimately seal City's fate. Barcelona can now prepare for Sunday's superclasico clash with Real Madrid, whom they lead in the La Liga table by one point. ""We've gone out to a magnificent side for the second time in two years,"" Joe Hart told Sky Sports television. ""They will get a lot of plaudits but we had a big chance with the penalty."" Questions will now be asked of coach Manuel Pellegrini, who had been expected to perform better in the Champions League after Roberto Mancini twice failed to get out of the group stages. It means that for the second time in three years, no English team have made the last eight, where Barca have joined Madrid sides Real and Atletico, Bayern Munich, Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, Porto and Juventus. The latter made it through after beating Borussia Dortmund 3-0 in Germany to secure a convincing 5-1 aggregate victory. On a night when Manchester City had failed to score, it was not lost on many that their former striker Carlos Tevez netted twice and made one, converted by Alvaro Morata, for the Italians. ""It was a game to forget. It started badly and did not get any better,"" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who led his side to the 2013 Champions League final, told reporters. ""We deserved to be eliminated.""

"(CNN)Well-off North Koreans really love baguettes -- and the country is dispatching citizens outside its borders to learn how to make them, says a report by a pro-North Korea newspaper based in Japan. According to the Choson Sinbo, a North Korean factory sent its staff abroad in an attempt to improve its food products -- which include baguettes and sweet potato cakes. No word yet on whether they've succeeded. But it's not the first time North Korea has sent its citizens into the world to seeking culinary skills. Last April, officials from the reclusive authoritarian state traveled to the National Dairy Industry College in Franche-Comte, eastern France, in an attempt to master the art of cheese making. But they were turned away at the door. ""There is no basis to go further with North Korea because such a partnership does not fit into our priorities and strategy,"" its director Veronique Drouet told AFP. North Korea's Kumkop food plant isn't just focused on French food, though. In January, North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA) said Kim Jong Un toured the factory and asked it to produce chewing gum. Food security remains poor for most North Koreans. The World Food Programme reported a ""severe"" food availability situation in the country last September, with rations dipping to their lowest level in three years.","A North Korean food plant has sent staff abroad to try to learn how to make baguettes .

"(CNN)It's called the Grand Renaissance Dam -- and the clue is in the name. With some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction, the imposingly-named dam is surely one of Africa's most ambitious infrastructure projects, reaffirming Ethiopia's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power. When completed, the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports. The most striking aspect of the nearly $5 billion enterprise is, however, that it is entirely funded by Ethiopia, without any foreign investment. According to the authorities, 20% of the project is financed from bond offerings to Ethiopians, and the remaining 80% from tax collection. ""It was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the Ethiopian people are financing it 100%,"" says Zemedeneh Negatu, managing partner at Ernst & Young Ethiopia. ""They have come up with a very creative and innovative way that I think will be a lesson for other African countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects, and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves,"" he adds. Hydroelectric powerhouse . So far, Ethiopians at home and abroad have contributed about $350 million, and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening, with 40% of the work already complete. Ethiopia's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world, but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000, averaging 10.9% annually, which has resulted in a 33% reduction of people living in poverty. If the Grand Renaissance Dam and other hydroelectric projects, such as the Gibe III dam on the Omo river, are completed on time, The World Bank estimates Ethiopia could earn $1 billion a year from electricity exports. Negatu says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in Africa, and second only to South Africa when it comes to installed capacity. Unhappy neighbors . Yet, not everyone is happy about Ethiopia's energetic drive to harness its water resources. The Grand Renaissance Dam is being built on Blue Nile, a tributary of the Nile River which has been powering the agriculture of Sudan and Egypt -- through which it flows -- for millennia. These countries have opposed the project in the past, fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the Nile water. The ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi had even threatened to defend ""each drop of Nile water with our blood if necessary"" back in 2013. Passions have been calmer more recently, and today the Reuters news agency reported that representatives of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement  in Khartoum on how to operate the dam. Negatu is convinced that a compromise will be reached, as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just Ethiopia but most other East African nations. ""This is actually a regional project because up from Egypt all the way down to Rwanda, countries are going to buy the power that's generated by this dam,"" Negatu says, adding that both Rwanda and Kenya have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished. A lack of reliable power has long stunted Africa's development, with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators, kerosene lamps and candles. In Ethiopia, only 15 to 20% of the population has access to power according to a study by Chatham House. ""It's Africa's Achilles' heel,"" says Negatu. ""With anyone who wants to build a factory in Africa, the first thing they ask is infrastructure, and within infrastructure, whether there is sufficient electricity. Industrialization has always been about electricity, and this [dam] addresses this basic need."" He adds that, after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades, governments across Africa should be pursuing a strategy of industrialization, following the example of China. ""We've got to move up the value chain, and it's what Ethiopia is doing right now. Its strategy is industrial-based -- not to export commodities but to manufacture value-added things, and other African nations are trying to emulate that. But without electricity there won't be industrialization in Africa."" More from Africa View . Read this: New railway links to transform West Africa .

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton worked hard last week to put the ""dead end"" sign on the State Department email story by announcing there was nothing to find. But in her rush to control the narrative, Clinton may have (once again) missed the bigger picture: In politics as much as in business, authenticity matters. Her press conference had the familiar ring of a controlled performance -- the carefully parsed explanation, the combative posture -- that stretched our belief that what she's telling us is really the whole story. People wonder: Is she playing it straight with us? Why the nagging suspicion that Brand Hillary does not include bringing to the public table who she really is? As the author Joe McGinniss reported in his classic book on the 1968 Nixon campaign, ""The Selling of a President,"" political consultants long ago began marketing candidates like bars of soap. The practice has accelerated since the '60s as campaigns have concluded that political brands face the same tests among voters that consumer brands do among customers. And among consumers today, authenticity means more to success than at any other time in the history of brands. The desire for authenticity is a tangible driver of revenue for brands. Increasingly, people want to give their money to brands -- political as well as commercial -- that have a set of values they can also buy into. As author James H. Gilmore told The New York Times, a sense of authenticity reinforces trust in what is real ""in an increasingly staged, contrived and mediated world."" A recent global study found that 63% of consumers would buy a brand they perceive as authentic over its competitors, and more than 60% would recommend an organization they perceive to be authentic. Ignoring the importance of authenticity to voters is a significant risk, as both Mitt Romney and Al Gore learned too late. And they were running in a perceptual environment more forgiving than today's. Voters easily identified the space between who these candidates really were and how they wanted us to perceive them. Romney, the successful entrepreneur and moderate politician, struggled to seem ordinary and ""severely conservative,"" while Gore was perceived as having such an overblown sense of himself that the claim of having invented the Internet stuck to him like mud, even though he'd never said it. The two shared what will likely also be Clinton's destiny: winning a party nomination by default as there were few compelling alternatives. For Clinton, an uncontested rise to the Democratic nomination could mislead her campaign into believing that she doesn't have a problem with authenticity. She does, especially among Independents and Republicans. To be fair, Clinton's appeal as potentially the first woman to reach the White House makes her seem virtually bulletproof among certain voting groups. A recent Gallup Poll shows ""first female"" status as the ""best thing about a Hillary Clinton presidency,"" leading the positives mentioned by 30% of Democrats and 17% of Independents. But the next-closest best thing about Clinton is a long way off: Her experience is mentioned by only 16% of Democrats and 8% of Independents. A fledgling campaign apparatus, with powerful political recruits like John Podesta and Robby Mook and marquee brand wizards from Coca-Cola and Microsoft, might want to be looking hard at the dangerously lukewarm voter sentiment about experience and suitability that is lingering just beneath the surface of the ""first female president"" juggernaut. Part of the heightened danger coming out of her press conference lies among millennials, who will be a critical voting group for Democrats in the 2016 presidential election. And authenticity is of paramount importance to millennials in how they relate to everything in their lives, including politicians. As one commenter on a MediaPost article on millennials put it, ""If brands can't be authentic Millennials will call them on it. Want to win our hearts? A little self-deprecation and humility never hurt."" Forty percent of millennials in the U.S. admit to full-blown cynicism about the way they are approached by brands of all kinds. According to the MediaPost article, authenticity and the allied trait of trustworthiness are two of the top brand attributes millennials look for before they make a decision to hand over their money and, one could argue by extension, their vote. These days, too, it's trickier than ever for brands to stay in step with the conversations that move people to make judgments. Whether they're consumers or voters, people are more in tune with each other than at any other time in human history. They can gang up more easily to support or reject a person, an idea, and, yes, a company, brand or politician. Brands are left on the outside looking in, puzzling out how to insert themselves into a meaningful relationship with constituents who can turn on them at any second. This trend of demanding more authenticity from brands they invest in, and rewarding brands for it, has been accelerating with consumers across the U.S. over the course of the very same seven years since Clinton last ran for president. Since consumers are also voters, it stands to reason that any political brand -- including Hillary Clinton -- should look even more seriously today at how to increase its value by focusing on perceptions of its authenticity.","Martha Pease: Hillary Clinton struggled last week to put the email story behind her .

"(CNN)When photographer Richard Ross wants to talk to a child at a juvenile detention center, he knocks on their cell door. He asks them if he can come inside. The 67-year-old Californian is used to taking off his shoes when he enters homes, so he does the same in a cell. ""Most of the kids, they've never had that kind of respect,"" he said. ""But I give it to them, I give them the power. I sit on the floor so they're looking down on me."" Ross doesn't begin by hammering them with questions. He wants to have a conversation. ""I say, 'What's gone on in your life?' "" The result of that tenderness and patience is Ross' latest collection of photos, ""Girls in Justice."" The images are unflinching. They convey the ugliness of a young person's life behind bars. The pictures are replete with the unique loneliness, anger and boredom of a juvenile detention center. But the girls also tell their stories alongside the images. One photo shows a girl in a tan jumpsuit, hand on her head, sitting alone in a drab, cavernous room. ""I've been here 17 times,"" one girl says. Many of the stories are bleak, reflecting adults who endangered the girls or, at the very least, failed repeatedly to protect them. ""Mom's a stripper. Dad was an alcoholic, drug addict, murdered last year,"" said one girl explaining her past. ""They took my brother and I away because my dad chained us in the house and tried to burn it down. I lived with my grandma and uncle. The people who are supposed to love you never do."" The photos show girls wasting the day in their bunks, staring at the wall. Some struggle with mental illness. The girls obscure their faces or are turned away from the camera. That works to protect their identities, but it also evokes shame. Ross seems to be saying the shame isn't the girls' -- it's ours as a society for jailing children. His images aren't always literal. A photo shot toward an azure sky is framed by concertina wire. A straight-forward photo, of a utility wall holding dozens of scissors, turns the stomach after reading the caption -- the guards need the scissors to cut away any cloth a teenager might use to trying to hang herself. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Ross recalled one particularly agonizing interview with a girl who kept telling him, ""I can't wait to get out of here so I can kill myself."" ""She was just a kid, but she was at that place where you have no hope,"" he said. ""I feel all these stories, but that one just hit me hard. I was sobbing. You want to say, 'It will get better,' but you also know the system and you know that you can't say that."" Ross, the son of a New York City police officer, had a happy upbringing in a home of modest means. He got into a decent amount of trouble growing up, and he said he could have easily wound up in the justice system. But times were different then, he said, and there's been a cultural turn in America toward criminalizing a child's bad behavior. He recalls a detention-center director in Reno, Nevada, who asked him to visit and take photos. At intake, he photographed a fifth-grader who had been taken to jail because he had acted up in class. ""This fifth-grader came up to my belt buckle,"" Ross recalled. ""He was drinking warm milk, like someone gave him a cardboard thing of milk. I can still smell that milk. That intake area smelled like elementary school."" The child's single mother couldn't pick him up for hours. She was holding down a job that wouldn't allow her to leave until after 6 p.m. The detention-center director sent Ross' photo to every principal in the area to make a point: Children do not belong in lockup, so find another solution. Ross is adamant that he's making photographs to bring about ""immediate change."" He speaks across the country to law schools and works closely with child welfare advocates. His work has been shown during legislative sessions to illustrate how sorely the juvenile justice system needs fixing. ""I'm trying to wake people up, make them realize there are lives at stake,"" he said. ""At the same time, I don't, I can't, position myself as the great hope. I might not be able to do much but listen. But I think I'm a good listener, and I think these kids deserve to tell their stories."" Richard Ross is a photographer based in California.

"(CNN)It shouldn't come as a surprise that Yemen has collapsed -- again.  A country that has split and been pulled together before, has the youngest and fastest growing population in the region, is running low on oil and water, and possesses a ""personalist"" government rather than stable institutions, was on the top of every expert's list as the fragile state most likely to fail next. What is surprising is that U.S. policy ignored all of this and proceeded on the premise that simply drone-bombing al Qaeda terrorists could keep Yemen intact and stable. Indeed, last fall, when President Barack Obama pointed to U.S. policy in Yemen as an example of a ""success"" and a model for the plans that would roll back the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), I shivered. For as September ended, Shi'ite Houthi rebels from the north moved south and took the capital city, Sanaa. By January, the Islamic State was noticeably increasing its recruitment in Yemen, and that same month the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for organizing the deadly Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Last week, the Islamic State bombed two Shi'ite mosques in Yemen, killing more than 130 worshippers at prayer.  This week, the Houthi forces are closing in on Yemen's second major city,  Aden, on the south coast, and the U.S.-supported President, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has reportedly fled the country. As the United States has closed its embassy and withdrawn its last troops, Yemen has slid into total chaos, with rebels and jihadists on both sides capturing military bases and seizing tanks and heavy weapons. The situation is so dire that a coalition of Sunni nations, led by Saudi Arabia, has launched massive airstrikes against the Houthis, with a Saudi adviser threatening to bring up to 150,000 ground troops into Yemen to restore the Hadi regime. Yemen does have value as a lesson -- this is what happens when you ignore the basic foundations of social stability. These include legitimate leadership with stable succession plans; a united elite; institutions to bridge regional and ethnic divisions and assure fairness in political and economic access and a functioning economy with capabilities for providing employment and growth. Rather than working to secure these things, the U.S. administration has succumbed to the illusion that precision bombing or other surgical interventions to remove ""dangerous elements"" will sustain broader social and political stability. Anyone could see that the conditions for collapse were progressing in Yemen and that aerial attacks on al Qaeda terrorists would have no effect on them. Those attacks were a sideshow -- like firing a lousy band performing on the deck of an ocean liner, while a hull full of holes is taking on water fast. What we have now is an area with about 24 million people, more than twice the population now under the rule of the Islamic State in eastern Syria and western Iraq, that is virtually ungoverned and up for grabs and is falling into the grips of an all-out civil war between Iran-supported Shi'as and al Qaeda/ISIS-aligned Sunnis. It is a war that the West loses no matter who wins. It is now too late to do much of anything except watch and try to either support any moderate elements if they should emerge as capable of holding regional or national power, or contain any dangerous jihadist elements if they should do so. Either task will be difficult, and provide yet another costly distraction to efforts to restore peace in Syria and Iraq. In other words, what has happened in Yemen, although predictable, is about the worst outcome imaginable for U.S. policy.  That America ever deluded itself into thinking airstrikes were enough to deal with the problems of failing states in the Middle East and North Africa -- and the crisis of ISIS -- is a notion that could only be made more frightening if it keeps on doing it.","Goldstone: U.S. policy of drone-bombing al Qaeda terrorists ignores need to build social stability .

"Atlanta (CNN)The daughter of the late singer Whitney Houston, in a medically induced coma after being found unresponsive in January, has been moved to a rehabilitation facility, a source close to the family said Friday. Bobbi Kristina Brown, 22, had been treated at Emory University Hospital. No details about the transfer to a rehab facility were given. Brown, Houston's daughter with singer Bobby Brown, was found unresponsive January 31 in a bathtub at her home in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell. The extent of her injuries isn't known. Last month, doctors at Emory removed her breathing tube, allowing Brown to be ventilated through a hole in her throat. At the time, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta said the procedure suggested she would need to be on such support for ""weeks and months to come."" Police have said they are treating Brown's case as a criminal investigation. When Houston died in 2012, she was also found in a bathtub. A coroner ruled her death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Brown is Houston's only child. Brown's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, says he performed CPR after finding Brown in the tub.

"(CNN)[Breaking news update, posted 9:04 p.m. ET] . The live stream from what is believed to be the wreck of the World War II battleship Musashi in the waters around the Philippines began at 9:03 a.m. local time (9:03 p.m. ET) Friday. An underwater camera showed various sections of the ship, which displaced 69,000 tons when it was built, putting it in the largest class of battleships at that time. [Previous story, posted at 7:47 p.m. ET] . It's a journey beneath the waves and back in time. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen plans to live-stream an underwater tour of a wreck off the Philippine coast that's believed to be the remains of a long-lost World War II Japanese battleship. Allen, a philanthropist, said last week that he and his research team had discovered the wreck of the Musashi, which was once one of the two largest warships in the world. They had been searching for the ship for more than eight years. After the discovery last week, the team shared photos and video footage of parts of the vessel. Now, they're planning to take viewers on a real-time tour of the wreck with the unmanned submersible they used to find it at a depth of around 1 kilometer (3,280 feet). The live-stream is scheduled to start at 9 a.m. Friday, Philippines time (9 p.m. Thursday, ET). It's expected to show various parts of the warship, including the bow and stern sections and the conning tower. Launched in 1940, the Musashi was, at the time, the largest class of warship ever constructed, displacing more than 69,000 tons. It was one of two Yamato-class battleships constructed by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ship sank on October 24, 1944, during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the central Philippines. According to U.S. Navy documents, torpedo planes from U.S. aircraft carriers scored at least 10 hits on the battleship over the course of four hours. Navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times, but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the Musashi. More than 1,000 of the Musashi's crew were killed during the battle and sinking. Over 1,300 survivors were taken aboard by other Japanese warships, according to the U.S. Navy report. ""We are proud to have played a role in finding this key vessel in naval history and are honored to share it with the survivors, the families of those who perished and the world,"" Allen said in a statement. He has said his long fascination with World War II history was inspired by his father's service in the U.S. Army. Last week, he tweeted images of the wreck, including one that he said showed the bow of the ship -- featuring a distinctive chrysanthemum, the emblem of Japan's royal family -- and a big anchor. Another photo showed valves on which the Japanese characters for ""main valve handle"" and ""open"" are legible. Robert Kraft, director of subsea operations for Allen's Vulcan company, who will provide commentary during the live-stream, spoke more about the process. ""We used historical records from four countries, detailed undersea topographical data and advanced technology to identify the wreckage as the Musashi,"" he said. ""That moment of discovery was exhilarating."" Kazushige Todaka, the director of Japan's Kure Maritime Museum, said last week after viewing the information posted by Allen that it appeared that the vessel was the Musashi, although pictures of the entire body of the ship were needed to know for sure. Todaka said, given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found, he was ""90% sure"" that the ship was the Musashi. ""I was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down,"" he said. ""I have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered, but they all turned out not to be true."" Todaka said Allen's team had been in contact with the museum about the expedition and the ship's potential location.

"(CNN)Legendary fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are in a public spat with pop music icon Elton John over some eyebrow-raising comments the pair made about gay parenting. Long against same-sex marriage, the Italian designers -- who are not only openly gay, but were once a couple -- took their counterintuitive rhetoric to the next level this weekend when Dolce said in an interview: . ""You are born to a mother and a father -- or at least that's how it should be. I call children of chemistry, synthetic children. Rented uterus, semen chosen from a catalog."" John, who along with his husband David Furnish is raising two children that were conceived through IVF, took to Twitter to essentially say ""Oh no he didn't,"" followed by ""#BoycottDolceGabbana"" because nothing expresses anger quite like a hashtag. Not to be outdone, the pair responded with #BoycottEltonJohn. So what should we make of all this boycott talk? Combined, the three men are worth an estimated $3 billion. The openly gay Ricky Martin, who is raising two boys via a surrogate mother, sided with John (but he's only worth an estimated $60 million, so I'm not sure if anyone noticed). Regardless, while I find the archaic thinking of Dolce and Gabbana disappointing, the truth is my budget boycotted their clothing years ago. Some of it's really nice. But I just can't afford to spend $500 on a T-shirt. And even if I could, I don't know how I would justify doing so with a kid to put through college. That's why I find this whole ultra rich on ultra rich violence so disconnected from the reality most of us on Twitter are living. Boycott? Besides the 1%, who the hell is buying Dolce and Gabbana regularly enough to actually call the act of not buying their clothing a ""boycott""? That's a little like me saying I'm upset with the way James Dolan is running the New York Knicks so I refuse to play for him. Even misguided consumers wallowing in debt and living way above their means likely do not have enough credit cards to keep up with the purchasing power of the Elton Johns of this world.  (No lie -- the online store has a pair of ""Polka Dot Print Slim Fit Denim Jeans"" for $795. And you still have to pay for shipping. And there's also a cotton vest on sale for $795. A COTTON VEST!!) Here's an idea: Considering it can cost about $20,000 for each attempt at IVF, and the procedure has roughly a 40% success rate, I would say the vast majority of people who were the direct targets of Dolce's words are not using their expendable cash to buy their clothing anyway. If John, Martin, Courtney Love and other ultra-rich celebrities really want to leverage their celebrity to ignite a movement we can buy into (pun intended) take that would-be Dolce and Gabanna money and start an endowment for those who can't afford IVF treatments. Or consider ""Modern Family's"" Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who tweeted he wanted to unload his Dolce and Gabanna suits in a way that would help those who can't afford the IVF treatments. Retweeting a hashtag is a great way to publicly shame. But crowdsourcing among the 1% could make a difference in the lives of people who so desperately want to be parents that they mortgage their homes trying. It also creates a medium in which us regular folks can legitimately express our disappointment in the designers' words and not take the convenient route via blogs and hashtag activism. And yes, I realize I'm criticizing myself as well. But I have some self-awareness. When you tweet ""Je Suis D&G"" -- thus comparing your PR nightmare to the one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in recent Europe history -- you don't.","Elton John called for D&G boycott over IVF remarks .

"(CNN)For four years, William Bruce James II called the University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon his home. He walked its halls, bunked in its rooms, held office as one of its leaders, considered his fraternity brothers his dearest friends. He was proud to be SAE. Now that pride is tainted. A video shot this Saturday of party-bound shows SAE members clapping, pumping their fists and chanting in unison: ""There will never be a ni**** SAE,"" they sing. ""You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me."" These young men are talking about him, James said. That's because not only is he an SAE alumni, he is also African-American. How do you make sense of the fact that those behind these hateful words wore the same pledge pins, occupied the same house, preached ""the same motto that I hold dear to my heart"" as James did? ""I couldn't look at myself,"" he said, ""still claiming to be that."" Since the video surfaced Sunday, students have been expelled and SAE's Oklahoma chapter has shut down. The episode has left James disgusted, horrified that members of a fraternity that once welcomed him could espouse such hatred. Students expelled over racist chant . ""I don't know what happened to the culture of my home,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. ""That is not my home. That is not SAE. They are not my brothers."" While the Oklahoma frat has never had a lot of black members, that didn't matter to James when he joined in 2001. SAE was where he forged lifelong friendships, where he and others grew into men. ""We were becoming something while I was there,"" he said. ""Something that I don't think these kids grasped. ... I don't think they know what it means to be a brother of any fraternity, let alone mine."" James doesn't believe the racist chant was an isolated incident, not given how many on the bus seemingly sang it so easily and enthusiastically. Nor does he think that only those leading the chant deserve punishment. Just as easily as one person could have started it, someone else could have called for it to stop. That's what James thinks that his own fraternity brothers would've done, whether he was around or not. They understood the importance of stepping up to say: ""This isn't right, this isn't what I stand for, this isn't gentlemanly, this isn't even human,"" he said. ""That's what being an SAE is."" ""My pledge class ... wouldn't let that happen,""  he said. ""And I don't know what's happened to (the Oklahoma SAE chapter) since then."" Many members of that pledge class, as well others who he knew from SAE, have reached out to James in recent days by text, phone, email and Facebook. He knows he is not alone, including in his support for disbanding Oklahoma's SAE chapter. ""That entire house has accepted the culture that accepts that song, those words, that imagery,"" James said. ""So the whole house has to be punished."" His former frat brothers are different from him, of course. Their skin color wouldn't have stopped them from getting into SAE if the twisted chant reflected reality. Still, James feels their pain is real and sincere. Those on this weekend's video may not be his brothers, but those he knew from 2001 to 2005 still are. ""I don't think that they can fully encompass the pain and betrayal that I feel,"" James said of his white friends from the fraternity. ""But by holding me so close in their life, they know that their brother was hurt."" ""So it's a thing they're feeling in their family. I'm family to them.""","William Bruce James II was in Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter from 2001 to 2005 .
He's disgusted by the racist chant tied to the frat; ""the whole house needs to be punished""
While those involved are ""not my brothers,"" James calls his former frat brothers ""family"""
