"'Who was the most important photographer covering the sixties' rock and roll music scene? I can think of no one else whose work was so comprehensive and who captured the essence better than Linda,' Paul McCartney writes about his wife who died tragically of breast cancer at 56. Paul McCartney remembers his adored wife who died in 1998 with portraits from this family album he states is a testament to her artistic talent. Linda's passion for music inspired her to work independently and she amassed a major portfolio of photographs of rock musicians from the 1960s to the 1990s. Linda Eastman McCartney was born in New York City in 1941 and raised in suburban Westchester County. Scroll down for video . Lovely Linda: Eastman met Paul McCartney in London in 1967 at the Bag O'Nails Club. They met up again days later at the launch album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.The couple married in March 1969, had four children together and remained close until her untimely death of advancing breast cancer at age fifty-six in 1998 . Paul,  the last of the Beatles to marry poses with his bride Linda Eastman and her daughter Heather after their wedding . She was not related to the George Eastman family of Eastman Kodak fame. Rather, her father, Leopold Vail Epstein, was the son of Jewish Russian immigrants and had changed his name to Lee Eastman. After high school, Linda headed west and was living in Arizona where a friend encouraged her to take an art history course at the Tucson Art Center with Hazel Archer. Archer introduced Linda to the great photographers Walker Evan, Dorothea Lange, Ansel Adams and told Eastman to 'Borrow a camera, buy a roll of film and take pictures'. 'She inspired me to become a photographer, because of the photographs she showed me, unlike fashion photography, they were photographs of life, of people, of sadness, of poverty, of nature, everything – I loved it'. Back in Manhattan, Linda's photographic break came while working as a receptionist at Town and Country Magazine. She used an extra invite to a Rolling Stone promotional party to shoot pictures of the band. That was the beginning of her career chronicling the musical revolution of the Sixties. She met Paul McCartney in London in 1967 at the Bag O'Nails Club and met up again days later at the launch of their album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The couple married in March 1969, had four children together and remained close until her untimely death of advancing breast cancer at age fifty-six in 1998. These photographs appear in Life In Photographs by Linda McCartney and, in a new edition of the book published by Taschen. Paul McCartney appears to be flying while diving into a swimming pool on vacation in Jamaica in 1971. He wrote the song 'Bluebird', apparently inspired by the act of 'flying,' with Linda and Denny Laine providing background harmony . Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw, Jamaica, 1973. Ali was Steve's second wife and the couple fell in love on the set of the film, The Getaway, 1972, in which she played his wife. They married the following year but the union only lasted five years. McQueen did not want his wife to make movies while they were together and allegedly cheated on Ali . Linda first met and photographed the Rolling Stones when she attended a Stones album promotional party on a freebie invite in 1966 that marked the beginning of her commercial photography career . Paul, Stella and James and Linda loved McCartney's modest farmhouse in High Park on the Kintyre Peninsula in Scotland in 1982. Paul bought the small farm after the breakup of the Beatles in 1970 and it saved him from the drug and the heavy drinking scene of London nightclubs. The simple lifestyle inspired him to write the song, The Long and Winding Road . The Beatles in London in 1968, a year after Linda and Paul first met. This was the first year that the Apple Boutique, a retail store located on the corner of Baker and Paddington Streets, opened in London, the first business undertaking by the Beatles under the name of Apple Corps. Paul described the shop as 'a beautiful place where beautiful people can buy beautiful things.' It closed that same year.","Paul McCartney's wife Linda Eastman McCartney amassed a major portfolio of photographs of rock musicians from the 1960s to the 1990s .

"A 'senseless' thief was filmed stealing two live koi carp by stuffing them into his pockets in a 'sickening' act of cruelty. CCTV footage captured the man walking around Aquatic Supplies Wales in Swansea before hovering around the tanks where the exotic fish were kept. He plunged his hands into the water, dropping one of the £60 fish before trying repeatedly to put it in his pocket. The thief was filmed putting fish in each of his pockets before walking out of the aquatics store in Swansea . Eventually he made off with two of the creatures, with staff at the store unaware of his crime until they reviewed the footage later. 'It was really sickening to watch, 'I've never seen anything like it,' said Dani Grogan, who works at the shop. 'We were thinking maybe he’d have a bucket of water out in his car - but he didn't intend on stealing the fish to keep, he just put it in his pocket to kill it. 'It doesn't make any sense whatsoever, it’s just a horrible thing to have seen.' Footage shows the man walking towards the back of the store to where the expensive fish are kept. He lifted one small carp out of its tank with his bare hands then returned to try to steal a larger creature with a handheld net. After around four minutes the thief walked out of the shop with a fish in each pocket. Staff at the shop did not realise the fish had been stolen until they reviewed CCTV footage of the crime . Determined to identify the person in the tape Miss Grogan shared the footage on the Aquatic Supplies Wales Facebook page. It was viewed more than 30,000 times with customers eager to help find the thief. 'We had to do something and all our customers wanted to help,' said Miss Grogan's partner and the shop's owner, Thomas Dodd. 'We love running this shop and work hard to pay the bills. It is terrible when someone abuses it like this.' The couple have reported the incident to South Wales Police. 'Police have received a report of theft from the Aquatic Supplies store in Fforestfach, Swansea which happened at around midday on Friday 27th February,' a spokesman for the force said. 'The theft is being investigated and anyone who has any information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously 0800 555 111 quoting occurrence number 1500076456.'

"A student at an elite all-boys high school has been advised not to bring his chosen partner to the Year 12 formal because it is another boy. The student from Brisbane's Anglican Church Grammar School, also known as Churchie, was told to 'keep with school' tradition' and bring a female date to the senior formal in June, the Courier Mail reports. Headmaster Dr Alan Campbell said the formal was a social opportunity for male students to learn how to 'mix and mingle' with 'ladies' and the school had a strong preference they bring a female date. The student from Brisbane's Anglican Church Grammar School, also known as Churchie, was told to 'keep with school' tradition' and bring a female date to the senior formal in June . 'We want young men to learn from and interact with young ladies so these opportunities are very important in providing a well-rounded education,' Dr Campbell said. It isn't the first time the school has advised students against bringing their gay partners. Several students raised the issue back in 2008 but were told to bring members of the opposite sex. The headmaster at the time, Jonathan Hensman, told the Courier Mail the issue hadn't come up before, but was expected because of the 'changing times'. 'Not all students take their girlfriends. Some take a female friend. It's about protocols and decorums,' Mr Hensman said. Headmaster Dr Alan Campbell said the formal was a social opportunity for male students to learn how to 'mix and mingle' with 'ladies' and the school had a strong preference they bring a female date . But the Anglican school isn't alone, with the Queensland Catholic Education Commission saying they had similar models of behaviour in their schools. Queensland’s Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Kevin Cocks encouraged schools to be accepting. 'I would encourage schools to be inclusive and be supportive of students at this very difficult time of their life,' he told the newspaper. Dr Campbell said the school's governing body would not oppose a student's choice of guest but the school's guidelines and recommendations remained the same. 'I think in the end, it really is a decision that a young man would make with his parents and his family,' he said.","Student at Brisbane's Anglican Church Grammar School told to bring female date to Year 12 formal in June .

"Australia's top radio company allegedly provides condoms to their staff in an attempt to  to avoid the  impact of maternity leave on their business. One of Southern Cross Austereo's senior executives Linda Wayman also reportedly revealed that she does not believe in the union's push to encourage women to return to work part time after maternity leave. She labelled it an 'idealistic and anti-commerical stance,' according to Mumbrella. Ms Wayman, the General Manager of CA's two Perth stations Mix 94.9 and Hit 929 was speaking at a Mumbrella Perth conference. One of Southern Cross Austereo's senior executives Linda Wayman told a conference on Thursday that 'We do have a big jar of condoms at work. I'm not lying, I'm not exaggerating' It is allegedly vital for Ms Wayman to prevent pregnancies amongst her staff members. 'That is a big area of focus for me, encouraging people to have sex with condoms,' she said . Ms Wayman told the audience that of her 100 staff a third are either on maternity leave or covering for someone who has just had a child to emphasise the impact on the company .

'I'd love to, but I'd be lying if I said that was wonderful. It's an idealistic and anti-commercial.' She elaborated on this, explaining: 'There's no such thing as work-life balance, it's bullsh**, you just do it. Make the decision to do the best you can.' Southern Cross Austereo's CEO Rhys Holleran defeneded Ms Wayman, insisting that her comments were not meant to have been taken seriously. 'Clearly these remarks were made 'tongue in cheek',', Mr Holleran said in the statement. 'Linda is one of our most highly recognised and awarded General Managers. 'She has an exemplary record as one of Perth's most compassionate advocates on all issues surrounding equality of women in the workforce.' Another SCA Perth staff member, who preferred not to be named,  told Daily Mail Australia that the reports are sad and not a true reflection of the General Manager's attitude towards women in the work force.

"In a rare series of interlinked operations, 12 patients will participate in a 'kidney swap' at a San Francisco hospital. The procedures - which take around three hours - will be performed Thursday and Friday at California Pacific Medical Center, with six organ donors and six recipients. People in the chain are not compatible with relatives or friends to whom they are willing to give kidneys. So, they donate to strangers they do match. Back-to-back: In a rare series of interlinked operations, six patients are getting kidney transplants from six donors at a San Francisco hospital . Dr William Bry says the 'paired donations' are occurring thanks to a woman who started a chain of donations and a computer program that matches donors to recipients. Zully Broussard, 55, of Sacramento agreed to give a kidney to a man who was not compatible with his relative. That relative, in turn, will donate a kidney to a patient who also has a family member or friend unable to donate because of compatibility issues. This kind of pairing continues down the line four more times until all six kidney patients get transplants, the San Francisco station reported. The paired kidney exchange happened through computer software called MatchGrid, developed by David Jacobs, who is a kidney recipient. Its algorithmic program uses a person's genetic profile and finds potential matches. Once the matches are confirmed, doctors, nurses and case managers work on the logistics of making it a reality. Inspiration: Dr William Bry says the 'paired donations' are occurring thanks to Zully Broussard, 55, (pictured) who started a chain of donations and a computer program that matches donors to recipients . Ready to go: The procedures - which take around three hours - will be performed Thursday and Friday at California Pacific Medical Center (pictured), with six organ donors and six recipients . Broussard said her son died of cancer 13 years ago and her husband passed away 14 months ago, also from cancer. 'I know what it feels like to want an extra day,' she said when asked why she volunteered to donate a kidney to a stranger. Three transplants are planned for Thursday and the remaining three on Friday. Most of those involved are from the San Francisco Bay Area. 'I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big,' Broussard said. More than 100,000 people in the U.S. are awaiting kidney transplants. Most on the waiting list need the transplant within three to five years and many have died waiting.","The procedures will take place on Thursday and Friday at California Pacific Medical Center .

"A teenager who pulled out so much of her hair she was left nearly bald has shaved her head in an effort to tackle her condition. Eden Cahill, 15 from County Antrim, Northern Ireland, suffers from trichotillomania. The condition means she is compelled to pull out her hair, eyelashes and eyebrows – something she has done since she was six years old. By the time she was a teenager, Eden had hardly any hair at the top and the sides of her face, only a layer of hair at the base of her neck. However, in a bid to battle trichotillomania, she has recently shaved off her hair and set up her own YouTube channel to document her journey. Scroll down for video . Eden Cahill, 15, shaved off her head in order to tackle trichotillomania - a condition that compelled her to pull out her hair, eyebrows and eyelashes . Eden started pulling out her hair at age six as it brought her a sense of relief (she is pictured left before she started pulling). By the time she was a teenager she was almost bald (right) Eden said: 'I remember the moment I started to pull my hair out. I was at my grandma's watching television and I felt an odd hair. 'I pulled it out and it felt right so I carried on pulling a lot more after that. 'The day I shaved my hair I felt a major release, I felt so much better about everything and my head felt free.' Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a condition where a person is unable to stop themselves carrying out a particular action. Some experts think hair pulling is a type of addiction, while others believe it may be a way of relieving stress and anxiety. By her teenage years, Eden was bald all bar some hair at the side and back of her head. This led people to ask if she had chemotherapy, or alopecia, comments she says were upsetting. At school, she wore a headband 24 hours a day to hide her baldness, and clipped hair extensions on to her remaining hair. Trichotillomania is a condition where a person feels compelled to pull their hair out. They may pull out the hair on their head or in other places, such as their eyebrows or eyelashes. Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action. It is not known what causes trichotillomania but there are several theories. Some experts think hair pulling is a type of addiction. The more you pull your hair out, the more you want to keep doing it. Trichotillomania may be a reflection of a mental health problem. Psychological and behavioural theories suggest that hair pulling may be a way of relieving stress or anxiety. In some cases, trichotillomania may be a form of self-harm, where you deliberately injure yourself as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress. The most effective treatment is therapy to change your hair-pulling behaviour, combined with a network of emotional support. Visit your GP if you are pulling your hair out or if you notice that your child is. Source: NHS Choices . Now, she has spoken out about her trichotillomania to help people realise the condition exists and has set up a Facebook group and YouTube channel to help raise awareness. She says she is inspired by TOWIE star Samantha Faiers who has previously spoken out about her trichotillomania. She said: 'I was so embarrassed of how I looked and I was scared to hear what people thought of my hair so I wore a thick headband over my hair to try and cover it. 'I never took the band off, not even when our class went swimming but when Sam from TOWIE spoke about trichotillomania it inspired me and more people at school understood what I had.' Eden's Facebook group, 'Trichotillomania & Me' and her YouTube channel have amassed hundreds of views and comments supporting Eden's bid to raise awareness. Speaking in her first video post, she said her auntie convinced her to start the blog as a way of describing her illness and explaining it to others. She said: 'I wasn't sure I was going to do it because I didn't want to be judged. 'But at the end of the day who cares what people think of you because you are who you are for a reason. 'I am what I am and I am trichotillomania.' She described how trichotillomania affects her confidence. She said: 'You know people are looking at you while you pull your hair out. 'It's embarrassing to see all of your hair all over your school work. 'It lowers your self-esteem, makes you feel crap all the time. I see other people looking great in their photos and it makes me feel down in their dumps. 'I go through really bad spots.' On 31st January Eden decided to shave her entire head to stop her pulling out her remaining hair, in an effort to beat her condition. Eden decided to shave off her hair on 31st January this year, as she hoped this would stop her pulling out her hair and help her beat the condition once and for all . Throughout her teenage years, Eden wore a thick band (pictured left and right), even when swimming, as she was embarrassed people would see her bald head . Eden's family are supportive of her video blogging, saying she is an 'inspiration'. She is pictured (from left to right) with father David, sister Abbie and brother David . In a blog post before the hair cut, she explained: 'I’m still able to pull it and I don’t want it to be a length at which I can pull it. 'I’m really excited and nervous to get it done.I know people will support my decision. Once I get it done I’ll be more comfortable and confident.' She hopes continuing the video blog will help others understand the daily struggles of someone living with trichotillomania. Eden's mother Louise, 43 has been a constant support to her daughter and admits they have both learned a lot about trichotillomania. Mrs Cahill said: 'When we found out about Eden's trichotillomania I messaged loads of people and pages to try and understand her condition. 'We have both learned so much and when Eden decided to shave her hair I've never been prouder. 'She's an inspiration to us all.'","Eden Cahill, 15, began pulling out her hair, eyebrows and lashes at age six .

"Readjusting to the American workforce after active military service - particularly when dealing with injuries - can be notoriously challenging, which is why two enterprising philanthropists have put their heads together to form an unlikely solution. Dog Tag Bakery - which trains and employs wounded veterans, not just in baking but in actually running the business - was launched last year in Georgetown, Washington D.C., by Father Richard Curry, a professor of Catholic Studies at Georgetown University, and entrepreneur Connie Milstein.

Community hit: More than 50per cent of the bakery's business comes from daily regulars, who enjoy the sweet treats and are keen to support the initiative . Dog Tag Bakery's general manager, veteran Justin Ford, says they are swamped with 'a ton of regulars'. 'More than 50per cent of our business is regulars who come in almost on a daily basis,' he explains.

Speaking to CBS News, co-founder Father Curry, who trained as a baker himself in his youth, remarked: 'The world thinks that disabled veterans can't be hired. 'And that's absolutely absurd. We're here to prove them wrong.' Veterans who have completed the program include retired Army Ranger Sergeant Major Sedrick Banks, who sustained brain and spiral injuries in a mortar attack in Iraq. 'Dog Tag was my first major step back into the working mindset,' he said. 'Before the program, I didn't have confidence. I didn't feel like I had the ability. Now I'm confident in myself, you know?'

The breaks in the Lake District are being organised by the University of Bolton so its controversial vice-chancellor can give pep talks. Professor George Holmes, who was recently lent almost £1million by the university so he could move house, owns a private yacht which is moored less than ten miles from the hotel. The four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa on Windermere is 70 miles from campus and usually costs about £220 a night for a room with a view of the lake. The university says the one-night ‘working residential’ trips, for which it pays all the travel, food and accommodation costs, are an ‘informative’ and ‘valuable’ way to discuss strategic aims. It has organised 20 breaks as part of its staff development programme. The first was in September and the last will be in May. Professor Holmes, a former adviser to Labour whose yacht is moored at a marina on Windermere, addresses each group ‘engaging directly in dialogue in respect of the strategy’. The university, which in 2013 was ranked worst in the country in two guides, said feedback from employees had so far been positive. But according to Times Higher Education, a source at the university said staff were ‘amazed’ by the scheme because it ‘must cost a fortune’. A university spokesman said it ‘considers this an appropriate developmental investment in staff to underpin the growing strength of the university’. The spokesman said it was part of a multi-million-pound investment in teaching and learning infrastructure, adding: ‘For the avoidance of doubt, the yacht belongs to the vice-chancellor personally and is operated, maintained and moored at the vice-chancellor’s own expense. ‘The yacht is not university property and has no relevance to the university’s current staff development programme taking place at the Lakeside Hotel.’ The four-star Lakeside Hotel and Spa (pictured) on Windermere is 70 miles from campus and usually costs about £220 a night for a room with a view of the lake . Last month, it was revealed that the University of Bolton gave Professor Holmes a two-year £960,000 loan to buy a house nearer the campus without him having to sell his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The move was to save him a 100-mile round-trip, allowing the 53-year-old, who took up his post in 2006, to ‘play a greater role’ in the university and the town. Professor Holmes, who in 2013 was paid a £47,200 bonus on top of his £198,200 salary, bought an imposing Edwardian detached house, described by estate agents as a sublime example of the Arts and Crafts movement. It is understood the £920,000 property acts as both his personal home and a space to host VIP dinners and events connected with the university. The loan, at a 3.25 per cent interest rate, is due to be paid back once the Wakefield home is sold.","The breaks in Lake District are being organised by the University of Bolton .

"A cheerleader coach and teacher's aide at a Greece, New York high school has been charged with felony third-degree rape after being accused of having sex with a 16-year-old male student. Christina Jewell-Belluccio, 32, from Greece Olympia High School will face the allegations in court after allegedly having sex with the minor in both her home and a second location several times during June 2014. She was also brought up on a second charge of felony third-degree criminal sex act on Tuesday. Christina Jewell-Belluccio (above), 32, from Greece Olympia High School will face the charges in court after allegedly having sex with the minor in both her home and a second location several times during June 2014 . Jewell-Belluccio, awarded Class A Coach of the Year in 2014, was hired by the school two years ago and also began working as a senior teacher's aide last year, according to the Democrat and Chronicle. School district officials were informed of the allegations through rumors on Monday which led to an internal investigation. They then alerted police, said Laurel Heiden, a spokeswoman for the district. Cheerleaders from Jewell-Belluccio's squad are rallying behind her with many showing their support on social media. The coach and senior teacher's aide was also brought up on a second charge of felony third-degree criminal sex act on Tuesday. School district officials were informed of the allegations through rumors on Monday which led to an internal investigation, and then alerted police (above file photo of Greece Olympia High School) One student wrote: 'Regardless of everything my coach was the best person I've met, and this won't shake my image of her. We love you JB. OHS always and forever.' Another student wrote  that she felt bad for the cheerleaders and said that Jewell-Belluccio brought the cheer program back on its feet. Her tweet said: 'I just feel so bad for the cheerleaders. They must feel awful right now. She brought the cheer program back on its feet...it's just so sad.' Following the incident, Jewell-Belluccio resigned from her position at the school and was released on bail. She will face the charges at Greece Town Court on March 11.","Christina Jewell-Belluccio, 32, charged with both felony third-degree criminal sex act and rape .

"A series of mutilated animals have been found on the streets on Sacramento, leading officials to fear a local cult may be responsible. The latest discovery - the third in as many days - was made yesterday by a Sacramento Bee reporter investigating the killings. He found a bag of decapitated chickens along railroad tracks in California's capital city. Scroll down for video . A series of mutilated animals have been found in Sacramento, including a box of chicken corpses (pictured) On Tuesday night, authorities reported finding two bags containing dead animals also beside railroad tracks in Midtown Sacramento. One bag contained a beheaded rabbit with several tea candles. A second bag held at least two decapitated chickens with their feet cut off, News10 reported. Gina Knepp, head of Sacramento's Front Street Animal Shelter, said authorities are investigating whether at least some of the killings may be tied to religious rites that sacrifice animals. She explained tips have been pouring in, many of them suggesting the findings are linked to a cult. 'Local cults, religious groups. Nothing solid, you know, but it is very bizarre,' she said. Gina Knepp, head of Sacramento's Front Street Animal Shelter, said authorities are investigating whether the findings are linked to cults . 'The most recent case I will say involves what appears to be some type of ritual, who knows what kind of practice,' she told the Sacramento Bee. She added, others cases may be simply a case of copycats following the growing news coverage of the incidents. Two decapitated chickens were found in a box along a bike trail near the Sacramento River on Monday. Inside the box were also five blood-soaked $1 bills. There have been at least nine separate discoveries of decapitated goats, sheep and chickens and other animals since the start of the year at various locations in Sacramento. But the mystery began last fall,  when a 120lb cow's head was found in Reichmuth Park and another one was found a few miles away at Garcia Bend Park.

"Simon Hennessey, 50, was back behind bars tonight after 15 years on the run in Australia . A convicted killer who went on the run in Australia for 15 years evaded capture by using the identity of a brain damaged man, was tonight back behind bars in the UK. Fugitive Simon Hennessey, 50, mutilated his elderly aunt in a frenzied attack. Hennessey was just 14 when he was convicted of knifing Mary Webber, 72, to death after stabbing her more than 70 times in her Plymouth home. At the time, he became the youngest person in British legal history to be sentenced to life in a secure mental health unit. He had served 20 years of a life sentence for manslaughter, when he walked out of Leyhill Open Prison in south Gloucestershire just before Christmas in 1998. For years officers tried to trace the wanted man without success, until he was arrested in Australia as part of a probe into a credit card scam. Hennessey was detained  in Queensland in summer 2013,  but for weeks officers did not realise that he was a wanted killer in Britain. Unbeknownst to them he had stolen the identity of Robert Jeffery from New Zealand who had been left brain damaged in a car accident a decade earlier. Robert Jeffery, 44, was in a head-on collision with a vehicle in 2005 and thrown from the flat-bed truck he was driving. He has been in permanent care ever since and struggles to retain information. He has never held a passport. Hennessey was jailed for five and a half years for fraud after the scam unraveled. As soon as he was eligible for parole, the Australian authorities deported him back to the UK. He was arrested on his return and charged with evading lawful custody. Hennessey, who has changed his name from Simon to Robert, pleaded guilty to the charge and was jailed for 16 months by a judge at Bristol Crown Court. Hennessey had been using the identity of Robert Jeffrey from Hawkes Bay in New Zealand, pictured . Detective Constable Stuart Brooks, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'Robert Hennessey was arrested on suspicion of fraud offences in the Queensland area of Australia in 2013. 'Since then we've been working closely with the Australian authorities to ensure he was returned to the UK to serve the rest of his sentence and to face justice for the unlawful absconsion. 'With the assistance of Devon and Cornwall Police, the victim's family have been kept updated on Hennessey's deportation and subsequent court appearances in the UK.'","Killer Simon Hennessey jailed after 15 years on the run in Australia .

"Astronomers have captured four images of the same exploding star nine billion light years away as it performed an incredible cosmic illusion. In doing so, they have confirmed an effect predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity 100 years ago. The Hubble Telescope snapped the surprising multiple images with the help of a galaxy cluster that acted as a natural magnifying lens. The powerful gravity of a galaxy embedded in a massive cluster of galaxies in this Hubble Space Telescope image is producing multiple images of a single distant supernova far behind it. Both the galaxy and the galaxy cluster are acting like a giant cosmic lens, bending and magnifying light from the supernova behind them . The supernova could be seen because its light took different paths around the cluster located between the exploded star and the Earth-orbiting telescope. The cluster's gravity causes passing photons, or particles of light, to bend. Gravitational lensing occurs when galaxies and other objects amplify the light coming from other distant objects. It enables telescopes like Hubble to see objects that would otherwise be too faint and far away. This will combine the power of Hubble with the natural amplification caused by strong gravitational lensing of distant galaxy clusters to study the past universe. Einstein predicted this when explained how huge objects bend space-time to create what we experience as gravity. Astronomers have been taking advantage of so-called 'gravitational lensing' to boost Hubble's imaging powers and peer farther back in time. They say the latest images could help refine their estimates of the amount and distribution of dark matter in the lensing galaxy. Dark matter cannot be seen directly but is believed to make up most of the universe's mass. By chance, the supernova, which exploded about nine billion years ago, was aligned with the intervening galaxy cluster being used during a Hubble observation period in 2011. Scientists returned to the images in November to look for supernovae and found the quadruple rendering - a configuration known as an Einstein cross. 'The supernova team was looking at these image and bam, up popped not one, not two, not three, but four images,' said astronomer Jennifer Lotz, with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. 'They were incredibly lucky.' Although astronomers have discovered dozens of multiply imaged galaxies and quasars, they have never seen a stellar explosion resolved into several images . The object has been named Supernova Refsdal in honour of Norwegian astronomer Sjur Refsdal and is the first detected multiply imaged supernova. Astronomers have been taking advantage of so-called 'gravitational lensing' to boost Hubble's imaging powers and peer farther back in time. They say the latest images could help refine their estimates of the amount and distribution of dark matter in the lensing galaxy. The supernova appears in the bottom centre of this image . It appears about 20 times brighter than its natural brightness due to the combined effects of two overlapping lenses, said Jens Hjorth with the Dark Cosmology Center in Denmark. The light from the supernova will fade as the explosion tapers off, but due to additional warping of its light by the galaxy cluster, astronomers expect a re-run. Supernova occur where there is a change in the core of a star. A change can occur in two different ways, with both resulting in a supernova. The first type of supernova happens in binary star systems. Binary stars are two stars that orbit the same point. One of the stars, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, steals matter from its companion star. Eventually, the white dwarf accumulates too much matter. Having too much matter causes the star to explode, resulting in a supernova. The second type of supernova occurs at the end of a single star’s lifetime. As the star runs out of nuclear fuel, some of its mass flows into its core. Eventually, the core is so heavy that it cannot withstand its own gravitational force. The core collapses, which results in the giant explosion of a supernova. 'The four supernova images captured by Hubble appeared within a few days or weeks of each other and we found them after they had appeared,' Steve Rodney, with Johns Hopkins University. 'But we think the supernova may have appeared in a single image some 20 years ago elsewhere in the cluster field, and, even more excitingly, it is expected to reappear once more in the next one to five years,' he added. 'At that time, we hope to catch it in action.' The supernova's various light paths are analogous to several trains that leave a station at the same time, all traveling at the same speed and bound for the same location. Each train, however, takes a different route, and the distance for each route is not the same, which makes them arrive at different times. Similarly, the supernova images do not appear at the same time because some of the light is delayed by traveling around bends created by the gravity of dense dark matter in the intervening galaxy cluster. 'Our model for the dark matter in the cluster gives us the prediction of when the next image will appear because it tells us how long each train track is, which correlates with time,' said Professor Rodney. Measuring the time delays between images offers clues to the type of warped-space terrain the supernova's light had to cover and will help the astronomers fine-tune the models that map out the cluster's mass. 'We already missed one that we think appeared about 20 years ago, and we found these four images after they had already appeared,' Professor Rodney added. 'The prediction of this future image is the one that is most exciting because we might be able to catch it. We hope to come back to this field with Hubble, and we'll keep looking to see when that expected next image appears.' The galaxy cluster focuses the supernova light along at least three separate paths, and then when one of those light paths happens to be precisely aligned with a single elliptical galaxy within the cluster, a secondary lensing effect occurs. The dark matter associated with the elliptical galaxy refocuses the light into four more paths . Nine billion light-years away, a galaxy's gravity is projecting a distant supernova onto the sky forming what's called an Einstein Cross (shown by the yellow points)","Supernova could be seen because its light took different paths .

"Cyril Neame's (pictured) distraught family have moved the 83-year-old from his care home after he was bitten by a rat while he slept . A  war veteran with dementia has been moved from his care home after being bitten by a rat while he slept. Cyril Neame's family accused staff at Haydon Mayer care home of failing to promptly tell them about the attack which left him with bite marks, bruising and recurring nightmares. The 83-year-old was taken to hospital and given a tetanus jab after being bitten on his right hand but staff at the council-run home didn't tell his wife for another two days. When the dementia sufferer was returned to hospital five weeks later for a bad case of cellulitis - a skin infection - the local authority decided to investigate. They cleared the care home of any wrongdoing but Mr Neame was too scared to return and has now been removed by his family. His wife Mavis, 79, said: 'It was such a shock because it's such an unusual thing to happen. It was very upsetting. 'It didn't seem real and it's only afterwards you realise how bad it is. 'He was very worried about going back to the care home because he was worried that if he complained he wouldn't get good treatment. 'It's one of those things, it's so rare and unfortunate.' Daughter-in-law Natasha Ann Neame said staff told them the rat must have entered through an open window because it was raining outside the home in Herne Bay, Kent. The pensioner was left with puncture marks and bruising on his arms after being bitten by the rodent and had to be given a tetanus jab by care home staff . Mr Neame was attacked last October at the council-run facility in Herne Bay, Kent but his family say they were not told about the incident until he was taken to hospital with cellulitis and doctors discovered the bite mark . She also questioned the decision not to inform them immediately of the attack last October. Natasha, 26, said Mr. Neame, who fought with the Gloucester Regiment in the Korean War, was tormented by nightmares of the incident. The Korean War veteran, who fought with the Gloucester Regiment, has been tormented by recurring nightmares ever since the incident . She added: 'He said it was a big rat and that it had climbed up onto his bed and it was on his abdomen. 'He didn't realise what it was and when he brushed it off it bit him on the hand and he called for help. 'At first he was joking about the whole thing but then he started having nightmares about the incident. 'He said he feared the rats were going to get him when he was in hospital. 'They should have called us immediately rather then wait so they could talk to us face to face as he was really distressed. 'His care in general was just not good enough and the doctors couldn't believe his cellulitis had been allowed to get that bad. 'We are angry about it but he is safe now and that is what matters.' Kent County Council launched an investigation after the retired postman's admission to hospital but have now cleared staff of any blame. A spokesman said: 'Our investigation found that the staff had acted professionally and appropriately to safeguard residents. 'Mr Neame was later admitted to hospital with a condition unrelated to the rat bite and then decided he no longer wanted to remain at Haydon Mayer. 'Mr Neame's case manager supported him to move to another nursing home after leaving hospital and we understand he has settled in well.' The most recent CQC inspection of the care home found no problems with the quality of care provided. Mr Neame has now been moved to the High Meadows home in Canterbury. The local authority launched an investigation into the incident at Haydon Mayer Care Home (pictured) in Kent but have since cleared it of any wrongdoing .

"A 10-year-old boy is facing expulsion from school after teachers called the police when he brought in a fake orange gun for bring-a-toy session. Little Jayden Taljaard took the model handgun - which does not fire or make a noise - to a regular Friday class where pupils can bring their own toys. But staff called the police after three teachers reported feeling 'threatened' by the replica. It emerged today that Jayden has been immediately suspended from Selwood Academy in Frome, Somerset, and has  been told he could be permanently excluded. Jayden Taljaard, pictured with his mother Natasha Taljaard, was sent home from school and now faces potential expulsion after he took an orange toy gun in for a 'golden hour' session in his class . A police officer is due to visit the youngster at home to warn him of the dangers of firearms. But Jayden's stepfather Kevin Pleasants said the schoolboy had made a simple mistake and the issue has been 'blown out of all proportion'. The 56-year-old construction worker said: 'We were totally unaware that a bright orange toy gun that doesn't fire anything would cause so much mayhem. 'We have a policeman coming to the house to give him a lecture on the dangers of firearms - he's 10, it's ridiculous. 'It's being blown out of all proportion. We had no idea about the school's policy on toy guns. It's a simple mistake. 'He asked his mother if he could take a toy to school. She didn't let him at first. He explained about golden time and took the gun. 'Three teachers said they felt threatened by this gun. Could they not see it was bright orange and plastic?' Jayden's parents have hit out at the school's actions after teachers said they felt 'threatened' by the gun . They insist the gun does not fire or make a noise and teachers 'blowing the incident out of all proportion' Jayden's school holds the so-called 'Golden Hour' sessions for the last hour of every Friday where pupils are allowed to bring in a toy of their choice. But Jayden was suspended after taking in the replica weapon on February 27 and told not to return until Monday 9 March. At meeting on Wednesday evening, his mother Natasha was then told his exclusion could be made permanent. Jayden suffers from ADHD and other learning difficulties but was making good progress at the school since joining in September, according to his parents. Mr Pleasants, from Frome, added: 'He was supposed to go back on Monday but my partner had a meeting at the school and they said he might not be allowed back. 'He was doing fine at the school. He brought an award home for very good behaviour. I framed it and it is on his wall.' The school has brought in the police over the incident and officers will now talk to the 10-year-old boy . Selwood Academy has not commented on its threat to expel Jayden other than to say it will handle the issue 'internally' Mr Pleasants added: 'My partner is devastated by this. She is in a state of depression. She feels like she has failed as a mother. 'I think that they can't handle Jayden and this is an excuse. We worked hard to find the right medication for him and we think we finally have. He was making progress. 'We received a letter saying he is not allowed out in public otherwise we might face prosecution because he is not in school. 'He has to stay in the house all day. It's like he is a prisoner in his own home. Natasha is an assistant nurse and she has had to take time off work.' Headteacher Jean Hopegood said the school would be 'dealing with the matter internally'.","Jayden Taljaard was suspended after teachers felt 'threatened' by toy .

"U.S. talk show host John Oliver has compared the leadership of Prime Minister Tony Abbott to watching a car crash in slow motion. The host of HBO's Last Week Tonight, a satirical news and current affairs program, called Mr Abbott a 'car crash of a human being' but said that his behaviour was still entertaining to watch. 'It's like watching a truck jack-knife on a road. It's like, ""It didn't crash this time. Let's give it five minutes, then it's going into a ditch"",' Oliver said. Scroll down for video . The host of HBO's Last Week Tonight called Mr Abbott a 'car crash of a human being' but said that his behaviour was still entertaining to watch . The English-born funny man, who hosted a summer season of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, told The Sydney Morning Herald that Mr Abbott was a fascinating man. 'The fact he's the leader of a country is in itself appealing as a comic. What's nice is being able to present someone who people have not seen here [in the US] and just to give them a glimpse into other people's pain, as well as their own,' he said. Oliver has previously lampooned Abbott on Last Week Tonight, featuring the Australian Prime Minister for his 'Other Presidents of the United States' segment in June last year. The popular HBO show – which has a large online fan base with more than 1.3 million subscribers on YouTube – satirised Mr Abbott's stance on immigration, the way his religious beliefs impact his policies, his views on homosexuality and his comments about women. The comedian presented a series of clips to suggest reasons why Mr Abbott's approval rating had fallen to 30%, showing a clip from The ABC's Q&A where the Prime Minister discussed his hardline 'stop the boats' policy. 'Jesus knew there was a place for everything and it is not necessarily everyone’s place to come to Australia,' Mr Abbott said. 'It's like watching a truck jack-knife on a road. It's like, ""It didn't crash this time. Let's give it five minutes, then it's going into a ditch"",' Oliver said about Mr Abbott's leadership .

Oliver has previously lampooned Abbott on Last Week Tonight, featuring the Australian Prime Minister for his 'Other Presidents of the United States' segment . Oliver's voice-over satirically points out that 'Australia is for real Australians like Tony Abbott, who was born in London, England,' and labelled his 'rhetorical inconsistency' as personally insulting 'everyone in the country'. Oliver is also no stranger to Australian politics, having interviewed former prime minister John Howard for his story on gun control while reporting for The Daily Show. 'I'm not a huge fan of [Howard], so hurting his feelings was not the worst thing that had ever happened to me,' Oliver said, describing the interview as 'bumpy'. The comedian has also previously labelled Australia one of 'the most comfortably racist places' he had ever visited. 'You can say what you like about Australian racism, it is undeniably specific. I had a couple of Australians – more than one – complain to me about all the ‘Lebbos’ in the country, referring apparently to the Lebanese. Who the f**k is annoyed by Lebanese people?,' he asked in his Bugle podcast. 'How many Lebanese people can there actually be in Australia? There’s only just over four million of these people in f***ing Lebanon,' he said. The comedian has also previously labelled Australia one of 'the most comfortably racist places' he had visited .

'The one thing Australia cannot argue is: there’s no room here in this country because that land is fucking gigantic. That aside, fantastic place, can’t wait to go back.' Despite his stance on Australian politics and racist proclivities, the 37-year-old said  has previously praised the governments fight to introduce plain packaging to cigarettes. In an 18-minute video, Oliver described tobacco as: 'An aging product that's decreasing in popularity and yet somehow, it just can't stop making money. It's basically the agricultural equivalent of U2.' 'Australia's plain packaging laws banned tobacco company branding from packaging and replaced it with upsetting photos such as the toe tag on a corpse, the cancerous mouth, the nightmarish eyeball or the diseased lung,' he said. 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, since this law was implemented total consumption of tobacco and cigarettes in Australia fell to record lows… and nightmares about eyeballs have risen to record highs.' U.S. talk show host John Oliver has put Australia's plain packaging cigarette laws in the spotlight . The talk show host then went on to suggest a 'compromise' with tobacco companies, allowing them to market their products using 'Jeff the Diseased Lung' as their mascot . He then pointed to a picture of a health warning on a cigarette package and joked: 'Take it down, take down the demon eye!' Oliver made reference to Australian Department of Health statistics which show that consumption of cigarettes and tobacco fell to their lowest recorded levels ($3.405 billion) in the March quarter of 2014, down from $3.508 billion in the December quarter of 2012. The talk show host then went on to suggest a 'compromise' with tobacco companies, allowing them to market their products using 'Jeff the Diseased Lung' as their mascot.

"Worsening droughts in the Amazon - dubbed the 'lungs of the world' - are speeding up climate change, scientists have warned. Trees are absorbing up to a tenth less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during droughts and the forests actually emit more carbon than they capture. The last dry spell in 2010 saw the forest release eight billion tonnes - as much as the annual emissions of China and Russia combined. Worsening droughts in the Amazon - dubbed the 'lungs of the world' - are speeding up climate change, scientists have warned. Pictured is an view of a river boat trapped on the Lago do Cristo Reis during one of the worst droughts ever recorded on October 21, 2005 in the Amazon region in Brazil . In an average year the basin absorbs about 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere but prolonged dry spells are due to become more common. The Oxford University study provides the first direct evidence of the rate at which individual trees in Earth's greatest rainforest 'inhale' carbon from the atmosphere during a severe dry spell. It found photosynthesis - the process by which trees convert the greenhouse gas into energy - slowed down by 10 per cent over six months. Dr Christopher Doughty said: 'Tropical rainforests have been popularly thought of as the 'lungs' of the planet. The latest findings published in Nature confirm fears that the days of the legendary rainforest curbing the impact of rising emissions could be coming to an end. A researcher is pictured here measuring tree diameters in Tambopata National Park, Peru, soon after the 2010 drought . 'Here we show for the first time during severe drought the rate at which they 'inhale' carbon through photosynthesis can decrease.' The 2005 drought in the Amazon was described as a 'once a century' event - but five years later an even worse one followed raising concerns about the region's capacity to continue soaking up carbon dioxide. The latest findings published in Nature confirm fears that the days of the legendary rainforest curbing the impact of rising emissions could be coming to an end. The 2010 drought saw the Amazon River at its lowest levels for half a century with several tributaries completely dry and more than 20 municipalities declaring a state of emergency. Both droughts were associated with unusually warm seas in the Atlantic Ocean off the Brazilian coast - the suspected result of manmade emissions - and suggesting drought years in the Amazon could become more common. Some computer models of climate change project more droughts across the region as the planet warms - and a diminishing capacity to absorb CO2. Last month, a Nasa satellite revealed the stunning link between the Sahara desert and the Amazon rainforest. For the first time it showed vast dust clouds travelling high in the atmosphere. Scientists have not only measured the volume of dust, they have also calculated how much phosphorus – remnant in Saharan sands from part of the desert's past as a lake bed – gets carried across the ocean from one of the planet's most desolate places to one of its most fertile. The data show that wind and weather pick up on average 182 million tons of dust each year and carry it past the western edge of the Sahara at longitude 15W. This volume is the equivalent of 689,290 semi trucks filled with dust. The dust then travels 1,600 miles across the Atlantic Ocean, though some drops to the surface or is flushed from the sky by rain. Near the eastern coast of South America, at longitude 35W, 132 million tons remain in the air, and 27.7 million tons – enough to fill 104,908 semi trucks – fall to the surface over the Amazon basin. About 43 million tons of dust travel farther to settle out over the Caribbean Sea, past longitude 75W. The three year study measured the growth and photosynthesis rates of trees at 13 rainforest plots of up to 500 trees across Brazil, Peru and Bolivia - comparing those affected by the strong drought of 2010 with unaffected plots. The Amazon drought of 2010 occurred right in the middle of the study but only affected some parts of Amazonia. Researchers found that while the rate of photosynthesis was constant among trees on plots unaffected by drought, rates on the six drought-affected plots dropped significantly - as compared with before the 2010 drought. There was up to a trebling in some sites in numbers of trees dying in the years after the drought - making them no longer available to absorb CO2 from the air. Dr Doughty said: 'This decreased uptake of carbon does not decrease growth rates but does mean an increase in tree deaths. 'As trees die and decompose the concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase - potentially speeding up climate change during tropical droughts.' The results support the findings of a paper published last year in Nature published last year based on aircraft data. Professor Yadvinder Malhi added: 'These plots are our canaries in the climate change coal mine. As this study demonstrates they can give us important early insight into the actual mechanisms of how these complex forests are responding to extreme climates. 'Only through painstaking monitoring, like this, can we hope to understand and realistically model and predict the two-way interactions between climate change and the biosphere.'","Trees absorb a tenth less CO2 from the atmosphere during droughts .
2010 dry spell saw forest release 8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide .
This is as much as annual emissions of China and Russia combined .

"A family has been left devastated after their pet cat was put down without their consent by a vet who thought it was a stray. Julie Neeson was worried when the cat, who was called Babies, didn't come home after being let out in Newtownabbey, Co Antrim. She went looking for the animal with daughters Tia, 13 and Kiana, 10, but a worried passer-by had already taken him to a local vets. Devastated: Kiana Neeson, 10, and her family were left devastated when their pet cat Babies was put down without their consent or knowledge. Vets presumed the animal was a stray when it was handed in without a collar or microchip . Tia and Kiana (pictured with their other cats) wrote a letter to Babies after discovering he had been put down . With no microchip and his collar already removed by the time he was brought in staff presumed Babies was a stray and gave him a lethal injection after detecting signs of illness. The family arrived the following day to be presented with his frozen body. Speaking of the loss, Mrs Neeson said: 'I am devastated, my daughters are devastated. 'When I got there they handed my cat to me and he was frozen. He had been kept in the freezer over night. 'He was frozen stiff and waiting to be disposed of. I couldn't believe it.' When Babies first went missing the family did not panic as he was so well liked by neighbours he often spent the night at their houses, she added. The vet who gave Babies the lethal injection has since apologised for the confusion. 'I'd like to express my sympathies to the cat’s family at this difficult time, and I am sorry that this decision was made without them being present,' she said in a Facebook post,' Belfast Live reports. 'This poor cat was suffering from chronic renal failure and had been for some time. Heartache: A note penned by the 10-year-old following the cat's death. Babies did not return home after being let out one evening . The animal was so well liked by neighbours he would often spend the night at their homes, said Mrs Neelson . 'The cat was presented to us as a stray by a concerned member of the public who felt sorry for him and took it upon herself to bring him to the vets.' A spokesperson for Pets At Home said: 'We completely understand the family’s response and it’s never easy to lose a beloved pet. 'Our vet is very experienced, fully qualified and was acting in the best interests of the cat. We’d like to express our sympathies to the family at this difficult time.' 'The cat was brought in and presented as a stray by a concerned and sympathetic member of the public who recognised that he was not well. 'The cat was in the end-stages of chronic renal failure. He had clearly suffered from this condition for a number of years and was unfortunately untreatable. 'He was not wearing a collar, and was scanned for a microchip but none was found. 'Unable to identify the owners and with the cat suffering, he made the difficult decision to put him down. 'We’d like to express our sympathies to the family at this difficult time.' The animal was put down by vets at a pets at home store near her home. The store has apologised for the incident since .","Julie Neeson's cat Babies did not come home after being let out at night .

"It prompted fears of a highly-calculated terror plot. But in fact, the 33-foot-long bunker built under one of Toronto's most important tourist attractions was 'just a place to hang out', according to its architect. Elton McDonald, 22, has finally unveiled himself as the man behind the mysterious tunnel which took five years to construct. And his pursuits were far from cunning. Scroll down for video . Just for fun! Construction worker Elton McDonald, 22, says he built the underground bunker to watch TV in . Fears: Investigators first thought the 33-foot-long tunnel underneath Toronto could be part of a terror plot . 'Innocent': McDonald says he and a friend spent five years constructing the wood-paneled space underground . 'It wasn't really a tunnel. I was going to expand it to have a couple of rooms,' McDonald, a construction worker, told the Toronto Sun newspaper. 'I was hoping to put in a TV. I did some barbecuing in there. It was more a place to hang out.' Police ignited a frenzy of media speculation in February by announcing the discovery of a 'sophisticated' hand-dug tunnel near a tennis stadium to be used for the Pan Am Games in July. Much of the speculation was linked to concern about a terrorist plot against the Games. McDonald said he'd begun working in construction at age 17 and considered it a fun challenge to dig the hideout with several friends. He told his family about it so they understood why he was always so dirty . The site: The bunker is underneath tennis courts where the Pan American Games will be hosted this year . McDonald says he had grand plans to add rooms to the underground 'hang out' space in Toronto . Days later, police said they had identified two men who had built the  tunnel but declined to reveal their identities since no crime had been committed. McDonald told the newspaper he'd begun working in construction at age 17 and considered it a fun challenge to dig the hideout with several friends. He told his family about the project so they would understand why he came home so dirty. When news broke about the tunnel, McDonald said he didn't speak up because he was afraid he'd be in trouble. Police tracked him down after his employer recognized some of the equipment used at the site, McDonald said. Suspicious: Police were baffled to find a rosary and poppy on the door but McDonald says it was a gift . Investigation: Police launched a large-scale investigation into the bunker when it was discovered in January . The tunnel was discovered January 14 in a suburban woodlot. Reinforced with wooden walls and ceiling supports, it had electricity supplied by a generator, a sump pump to remove water and a pulley system to remove dirt. Police found a rosary with crucifix and a poppy nailed to one of the tunnel's wooden supports. McDonald said his sister gave him the crucifix for good luck after a small cave-in, while he'd found the poppy on Remembrance Day, November 11, when war veterans are honored. Canada has been on heightened alert for terrorist activity since a gunman attacked the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa in October after fatally shooting a soldier at the nearby National War Memorial. The attack by a so-called 'lone wolf' Canadian convert to Islam came two days after another convert rammed two soldiers in Quebec with his car, killing one.","Elton McDonald, 22, says he built the tunnel to watch TV and barbecue .

"Targeted? Patrick Sensburg (above), the head of Germany's spying inquiry, claims his own encrypted mobile phone may have been hacked . The head of a German inquiry into foreign spying believes his own mobile phone may have been hacked, it has been reported. Patrick Sensburg is chairman of a committee set up last year over claims the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) had listened in to Angela Merkel's phone calls. Mr Sensburg and other political figures had been issued with encrypted mobile phones that were said to be watertight against any hacking attempt. He is reported to have sent his phone to Germany's IT security service in a lead-lined sealed container by German courier company DHL to be examined. But when it arrived at the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the package had been opened and tampered with, according to the Daily Telegraph which cited a report by Welt newspaper. The BSI is now examining the phone. If proven to be the case, it could have potentially damaging repercussions for relations between Germany and UK, which has already expressed concerns about the investigation. It was reported last month that the UK government had threatened to end its co-operation with German intelligence agencies if members of the inquiry were given access to classified information. This threat was neither confirmed or denied by the UK, but a Whitehall source said the government was 'working closely with the German government to engage with the parliamentary inquiry'. The German government has since been seeking a compromise that would only allow Mr Sensburg to see that data which he would then relay to the other members, German media reported. Any apparent breach to Mr Sensburg's security would most likely scupper what is already a fragile compromise. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden claimed in October that the U.S. security service had been listening in on the calls of up to 35 prominent allies, including France and Germany. Eavesdropping: The German Parliamentary inquiry was set up last year over claims the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) had listened in to Angela Merkel's phone calls . That lead to claims Angela Merkel's personal mobile phone was tapped and caused the German Chancellor to demand answers from the U.S. government. While American authorities never acknowledged whether spying took place, Barack Obama was forced to offer Mrs Merkel an apology. Then in December it was reported that Mrs Merkel had also fallen victim to hacking after a sophisticated computer virus was discovered on the USB drive of one of her aides. The Reign virus, which is believed to have been developed by U.S. and British spying agencies, was detected after one of Mrs Merkel's employees plugged her personal drive into a work laptop. The woman, who works in close contact with Mrs Merkel, had loaded a speech she was editing on to the drive, took it home to continue working on it, before returning to the office. It is also not known what, if any, information was taken. Reign allows users to take pictures of a computer screen, take control of the mouse, record passwords and restore deleted files.","Patrick Sensburg heads committee set up to investigate foreign spying .

"A Michelin star chef and protégé of Heston Blumenthal has been hired by Lidl as the discount supermarket chases the ‘BMW classes’. Kevin Love, who was formerly the head chef at the multi-award winning Hinds Head pub in Bray, Berkshire, will help the budget chain source gourmet ingredients. The role as ‘chef in residence at Lidl’ will see him going head to head with his former mentor, who has had a long-term partnership with the upmarket chain Waitrose. Scroll down for video . Kevin Love (left) will go head to head with his former mentor Heston Blumenthal (right) The 38-year-old star chef will also feature in the chain’s commercials, help develop ‘Deluxe’ range products with ‘a few cheffy twists’ and offer recipe and cooking tips. The move is the latest effort by Lidl to attract Middle Britain shoppers who want good food but something different – and cheaper – than the mainstream supermarkets. This has involved pushing a range of ‘Deluxe’ foods, including Stilton, Hereford fillet steaks and Mussel & Smoked Salmon Chowder, which have beaten the best of the high street in blind taste tests. Heston Blumenthal has had a long relationship with Waitrose to create luxury meals . Lidl is chasing the customers of its upmarket rivals, the so-called ‘BMW classes' It has also won over wealthy shoppers with fine French wines at budget prices that have picked up gold medals in international competitions. The company’s current adverts are based around the theme of ‘Lidl Surprises’, where ordinary people are given fine food on a market stall only to be surprised that it comes from the discount store. Its Christmas TV campaign took up the theme with diners enjoying a fabulous festive spread only to be told at the end that all the food and drink came from Lidl. The first TV advert featuring the chef shows him cooking meals in a north London gastro pub, before wowing shocked customers by revealing the cheap cost of the Lidl-sourced ingredients. His role will involve sourcing produce that will be stocked in Lidl's more than 600 stores in the UK and working on food development. In a promotional video on Lidl's website, he reveals that he will be creating new lines in the firm’s deluxe range ‘with a few cheffy twists’. The partnership with the retailer brings Mr Love full circle, for just nine years ago he was a Lidl store manager before going off to develop his skills as a chef. Inspired by his mother’s cooking his path in the world of food began washing dishes in a Wimpy bar at the age of 14 and then peeling potatoes in the kitchens of Michelin star Catalan chef Santi Santamoria in Spain. Other jobs in cafes and bars in his native Sussex followed. Heston Blumenthal was key to Lidl's Christmas campaign.  Kevin Love is to take on a similar role for Lidl's this easter . Subsequently, he saw Heston Blumenthal on TV and set his sights on working for his culinary hero. Within three months of starting at the Hinds Head he was made head chef and later won a Michelin star and three AA Rosettes. Mr Love said: ‘Lidl has a great foundation. I’m going to be working closely with buyers, suppliers and producers to see if we can take it to the next level. ‘Take a pie for instance. What other cuts of meat can we use? Can we slow cook or braise them? How about a water bath? How can make the pastry have more bite?’ Lidl head of advertising and marketing, Arnd Pickhardt, said the partnership goes will go far beyond the usual chef endorsement or product range. ‘Chef Love has joined the Lidl family full-time and will devote himself entirely to guiding the brand and customers on a journey of culinary discovery. As the partnership matures, so will Kevin’s role at Lidl,’ he said. ‘In addition to helping customers explore the possibilities inside every Lidl shop, he will be a brand champion and passionate advocate for technical simplicity.’","New face of Lidl was award-winning chef at Heston Blumenthal restaurant .

"Today show host Lisa Wilkinson has accused Education Minister Christopher Pyne of ‘apologising’ for Indonesian President Joko Widodo about how the Bali Nine duo's journey to their place of execution has been handled. A fired-up Wilkinson said there had been a ‘full blown and seemingly over the top operation’ as Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were transferred from Kerobokan prison in Bali to the Indonesian ‘death island’ of Nusakambangan on Wednesday. She also pointed out to Pyne and Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese that Bali’s police chief was ‘all smiles as he took photos with the two men condemned to death’. ‘Elite military vehicles, decoy vehicles, fighter jets, riot squad police - you would have to say right now that president Widodo, rather than listening to the Australian government’s pleas for clemency, he’s treating these men like prize catches, he’s thumbing his nose at us right now isn’t he?,’ Wilkinson asked Pyne. ‘To be fair, the Indonesian justice system and President Widodo is treating the Australian prisoners the same as all the other foreign prisoners in Indonesia,’ Pyne diplomatically replied. Scroll down for video . Today Show host Lisa Wilkinson accused the Education Minister of apologising for the way the Bali Nine duo's transfer to their place of execution has been handled . A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand upon the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan inside the plane before take off for the Australian Bali Nine kingpin's final flight to the island where he will be executed . Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before their take off from Denpasar airport for the two hour flight to 'death island' ‘No that’s not true Christopher because one of the other drug smugglers who was also going to face the firing squad left in an unmarked van to go to the same island facing the same death,’ Wilkinson retorted. Pyne: ‘I think that is much more appropriate but I think to try and characterise President Widodo as thumbing his nose at Australia is something a federal cabinet minister is going to endorse.’ ‘But you are apologising for him Christopher, with the greatest respect,’ Wilkinson said. ‘I’m certainly not doing that Lisa I am opposed to the death penalty,’ Pyne reasoned. The pictures in question emerged on Thursday of a smiling police commissioner posing with the two condemned Australian drug smugglers on the two hour flight to Nusakambangan. Australia will lodge an official complaint with Indonesia's Ambassador, Nadjib Kesoema, at their outrage and ethical displeasure with these images. One of the pictures depicts Djoko Hari Utomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, placing his hand on Chan's shoulder and smiling for the camera. Another shows his hand on the shoulder of Sukumaran who was captured gazing up at the officer. Although summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ambassador Kesoema is understood to be in Perth and cannot appear in person. Shackled and handcuffed, Andrew Chan cut a sad figure as he was escorted by four faceless Indonesian police officers across the tarmac after being taken from Korobokan prison in Bali to their final destination, Death Island . Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in central Java, Indonesia, only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside Kerobokan prison on the island of Bali . An Indonesian armoured police vehicle transporting the death-row Australian prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to Nusakambangan Prison leaving the Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Bali . Indonesian police stand guard to secure the area around Kerobokan prison in Denpasar on Bali island on March 4 . A senior official, likely to be department secretary Peter Varghese will inform the ambassador of Australia's shock at the images through a telephone call whilst also appealing again for clemency. Utomo told Fairfax Media that he was trying to raise the spirits of the Australians by urging them to be tough and brave and had no idea the photo was being taken. 'It was not a selfie moment,' he said. Complaints will also be made about the excessive use of force used in transporting the men from Bali's Kerobokan prison to the airport. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Thursday that she could not comprehend the enormous display of force by the Indonesian military. Julie Bishop described her shock at the force used to transport the condemned Australia drug smugglers . Lisa Wilkinson said the Indonesian president is 'thumbing his nose at us right now' The Australian drug smugglers have plead to Indonesia's President Joko Widodo for clemency, to no avail . 'They've never done anything that would suggest they are violent, or that they would risk anybody else's lives,' she said. When the images were captured on Wednesday, the Bali Nine duo were being transported on a two hour flight to the port town of Cilacap and transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to face a firing squad in an area known locally as 'Death Valley', a lush green clearing amid citrus orchards and banana palms. The spot is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan, which is also known as 'Death Island', and it is the place where just under seven weeks ago the Indonesian Government executed five  drug smugglers. The family of condemned Australian drug smuggler Andrew Chan, his mother Helen (centre) and brother Michael (wearing pink shorts) arrive at Yogyakarta airport on Thursday to make the five hour drive to Cilacap in central Java and take a boat to Nusakambangan island where Chan is waiting to be executed . Myuran Sukumaran's mother Raji (right) and sister Brintha (centre) on the tarmac at Yogyakarta, the closest main airport to the port town of Cilacap to which they will drive on Thursday afternoon to visit him in Batu prison on Nusakambangan island where the Bali Nine duo was transferred to under high security this week . Last place on earth: This is Nirbaya, also known as 'Death Valley', the place where Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will likely be taken for their executions and located up a winding dirt track around 3km from the prison where they are being held in isolation cells . This is the spot to which the Indonesians took five foreign drug smugglers this year, tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12-member firing squads at around 12.40am local time  on Sunday, January 18 . It is not known how the prisoners destined for execution will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan Island off southern central Java . This weather beaten hut in Nirbaya or Death Valley sits near the sport where foreign drug smugglers were executed in January and where the Australian Bali Nine duo may be taken soon and put to the firing squad . Final journey: The jungle and rainforest of Nuskambangan prison island looms over the Barracuda armoured personnel van carrying Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as they arrive off the police boat on Wednesday following their final plane flight, from Bali to Cilacap in southern Java . And this place, up a winding dirt track just 3km from where Chan and Sukumaran are being held in isolation cells, is likely to soon be their last place on earth. Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south. At around 12.40am on January 18 this year, five drug traffickers were reportedly shot by firing squads in or around this place. This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad . Indonesia executed a total of six drug traffickers on January 18, but Vienamese woman Tran Thi Bich Hanh met her fate on the mainland of central java at a place called Boyolali. The five executed at Nirbaya on Nuskambangan were Brazilian Marco Archer Moreiea, 53, who smuggled 13kg of coaine in hangliding equipment to Bali in 2004, Dutch national Ang Kiem Soei, who ran an Ecstasy factory, Namaona Denis, 48, Indonesian woman, Rani Andriani, 38, and Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, 38, a Muslim who elected to be buried on the island. The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented. Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out. They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Port of no return: Sodong port (above) on Nusakambangan Island was the dropping off point on Wednesday for the Australian Bali Nine duo before being taken by road on to the prison where they are currently being held in isolation . Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled  for each prisoner. In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth. At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner. When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution. A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place. Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.","Lisa Wilkinson grilled Education Minister on the Today Show .

"A morbidly obese woman, who lost 165lbs in order to qualify for gastric bypass surgery, nearly derailed the impact of the life-saving procedure when she allowed emergency room doctors to insert a feeding tube into her stomach for malnourishment - without consulting her weight-loss surgeon. When Angel, from Kerrville, Texas, joined TLC's obesity series My 600lbs Life, she weighed 570lbs and was consuming between 10 and 12lbs of food a day. But after realizing that her weight was forcing her to miss out on her son Andrew's life, she made the decision to travel to Houston to have weight loss specialist Dr Younan Nowzaradan perform surgery as a final attempt to save her family and her life. Following her surgery however, the 42-year-old mom began experiencing nausea and allowed her boyfriend Donnie take her to the hospital - instead of contacting her surgeon like she was instructed – where doctors inserted a feeding tube into her stomach, believing that she was ‘malnourished’. Scroll down for video . Emotional moment: Angel, from Kerrville, Texas was filled with tears as she described how her weight has spiraled out of control on the latest episode of My 600lb Life . Feeling helpless: The 42-year-old mom weighed 570lbs when she started the show and was unable to care for herself . 'I didn't have time to call Dr Nowzaradan while I was there, so I told him afterwards,' she explained. 'He was pretty upset.' She added: 'I feel like I keep getting close to getting my life back and then something happens. I just want to keep making progress and get back to living again.' Dr Nowzaradan demanded that Angel travel to see him in Houston immediately, so he could assess the amount of damage that was done by the doctors in Kerrville. 'I am hoping I didn't make the wrong decision and will regret it for the rest of my life,' Angel said. In his office, Dr Nowzaradan had her read the written instructions he had given her after her gastric bypass, which included a line about calling her surgeon if she started vomiting. While Angel said she couldn't call because she didn't have a phone on her, Donnie explained that he genuinely believed she was just sick and would be sent back home. Bad decision: Angel's weight loss surgeon, Dr Younan Nowzaradan, scolded Angel and her boyfriend Donnie for letting other doctors give her a feeding tube after her gastric bypass, essentially derailing her progress . Medical mistake: Angel experienced extreme nausea after her surgery, but instead of calling her doctor, she went to the emergency room where she was misdiagnosed as malnourished and given a feeding tube . 'You don't have to have a phone,' Dr Nowzaradan told her. 'Every hospital has a phone.' He couldn't believe that she would have another surgery without contacting him. 'What in the world is this?' Dr Nowzaradan said as he inspected the tubes that were placed in Angel's stomach. 'Why in the world does she need a feeding tube?' He added: 'She should not have allowed other doctors to do this.' Dr Nowzaradan explained that the feeding tube had essentially undone the effect of her bypass and it needed to be closed off, so she could continue to lose weight. While the procedure to rectify the damage she had done went well, it was another road block in Angel's ongoing battle to lose weight. Caregiver: Before her weight loss surgery, Angel relied on her boyfriend Donnie to do everything for her, include bathe her . Out of control: Angel said that even though she felt like an 'oversized whale', she couldn't stop eating. Donnie guessed that she consumed 10 to 12lbs of food a day . Full of love: Angel hugged her son Andrew, who she was unable to play with outside because of her size . Before meeting Dr Nowzaradan, Angel's weight was spiraling out of control. She was unable to play with Andrew, and she relied on Donnie to take care of her. 'I'm ashamed of it. It's just embarrassing,' she said. 'I see myself as an oversized whale. I just hate my body.' She noted that she 'used to feel beautiful' before she lost control of her life. Although she had grown up thin, she started to rapidly gain weight after her mother forced her to give up her first child, a baby girl, after she got pregnant when she was just 14 years old. 'My only choice was to give her up for adoption,' she told the camera. 'I just felt lost after that. That was one of the most painful experiences of my life, and I think about it all the time.' She continued: 'I turned to food for comfort, and that's when I started gaining the weight.' Disbelief: Angel sobbed during her first visit to Dr Nowzaradan's office in Houston. She couldn't believe that she let her weight spiral to 570lbs . Natural size: Angel grew up thin and didn't have a problem with her weight until she got pregnant with her first child at 14 years old . Seeking solace: After her mom forced her to give her baby girl up for adoption, she went from being thin (left) to rapidly gaining weight (right) because she turned to food during her time of grief . When she met Donnie, she weighed 405lbs, but her size didn't bother him. He was attracted to her personality and smile. After eight years together, they found out she was pregnant with Andrew. According to Donnie, Angel went into a postpartum depression when Andrew was born that she never came out of. 'She just stopped living,' he said. He went on to say that she has no idea how much she eats a day, explaining that she consumes 10 to 12lbs of food a day. Donnie had reached his limits and was debating leaving her for the sake of their son. 'Andrew is very aware of his mom's weight,' he said. 'It is really affecting him too. He doesn't get to go outside a lot because I literally cannot leave the house for very long because she is not able to care for herself.' He added: 'This isn't what I signed up for. I feel like a single dad all the time. She is here but not really. I feel like she just quit on me.' Mental health: As a part of her weight loss plan, Angel began seeing a therapist, so she could stop blaming herself for giving up her baby . No choice: Angel started to cry while she told her therapist how she was forced to put her baby up for adoption . Angel reached out to Dr Nowzaradan in order to save her family and regain life because she had hit her 'breaking point'. She feared that her son would grow up without a mom because she couldn't take charge. However, when she traveled to Houston in hopes of receiving weight loss surgery, she was ordered to lose 50lbs before they could proceed. 'I'm not going to think about it. I am doing it,' Angel told Donnie of shedding pounds. Months later, Angel lost 165lbs and was ready for surgery, but there were even more complications. Dr Nowzaradan had to stop in the midst of surgery because he discovered excessive-scar tissue from previous surgeries, which he attempted to remove. 'This surgery is the last chance to save my family, and I feel like I am losing it,' Angel later explained. Dr Nowzaradan was eventually able to give her the gastric bypass she so desperately needed, and Angel continued to make progress. After surgery she even went to one of Andrew's football games, something she was never able to do before. Making memories: Angel was finally able to go with Donnie to watch Andrew's football game after her weight loss surgery . All alone: Donnie can be seen helping Andrew with his football pads. Before Angel started losing weight, he said he felt like a single parent . Life-changing: Angel's weight loss allowed her to get out of bed and spend quality time with Donnie and Andrew for the first time in years . But the feeding tube she was later given threatened to ruin everything. 'We are dodging a bullet today,' Dr Nowzaradan said when he fixed Angel's botched surgery. After all of her struggles, Angel was still determined to lose weight and take control of her life. In addition to following her diet and becoming more active, she started seeing a therapist to learn why she is 'sad all of the time'. During one of her sessions Angel discussed how traumatic it was for her to give her first child up for adoption. Her therapist helped her realize that she had no choice and she can't keep blaming herself what happened in the past. Angel continued to get better both mentally and physically. She started helping around the house and going to all of Andrew's games. Making progress: A year after she started chronicling her journey for My 600lbs Life, Angel was excited to learn that she weighed 261lbs . Before and After: Angel lost half her body weight and returned to a size she hadn't seen since high school . For the first time in years, Angel was happy to go shopping for new clothes because she knew they would now fit her body . 'I don't want to miss a single thing from here on out,' she said. Donnie noted: 'Andrew has two full-time parents now, and he loves every minute.' She added: 'When I wake up, and it's not to eat. It's to get Andrew ready for school. I am back to normal.' A year after she started chronicling her journey on My 600lbs Life, Angel had lost 309lbs - more than half of her body weight. At 261lbs, as weight she hasn't seen since high school, she is now contributing around the house, spending quality time with her son and for the first time in years, she has even gone shopping for new clothes. 'This past year has been a roller coast ride, but it is all worth it because I am not just doing it for myself,' she said of her progress. 'I am doing it for my family.'","Angel, from Kerrville, Texas, was featured in the most recent episode of TLC reality series My 600lb Life .

"A Delta flight went off the runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Thursday morning, stopping just short of Flushing Bay. FDNY rushed to the scene as Delta Flight 1086, an MD-88 arriving from Atlanta, skidded off runway 13, was leaking fuel and had a broken wing after striking a fence during blizzard conditions. The airport initially reported that the plane had caught fire, though there were no visible signs from the scene. The plane was immediately evacuated, and all 127 passengers and five crew members were safely removed within 30 minutes of the plane's landing, walking out on the broken wing and going down a slide. LaGuardia was shut down soon after the incident as the plane was leaking 300 gallons of fuel at a rate of a gallon a minute, with all incoming flights being diverted and outgoing flights being grounded. The fuel leak was quickly contained. Scroll down for videos . Scene: A Delta flight slid off the runway at LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Thursday morning .

CNN reports that only minor injuries had been sustained, with the FDNY saying while numerous individuals were being treated only three were transported to a hospital. It has been reported that 24 people were injured in total. The transcript from the tower shows that the flight was given the all clear to land on the runway and told that the breaking action had been reported as 'good.' Once the plane hit the runway it did not respond to the tower, and as soon as the air traffic controllers realized what happened they immediately announced the airport was closed. 'Customers deplaned via aircraft slides and have moved to the terminal on buses,' Delta said in a statement. 'Our priority is ensuring our customers and crew members are safe. Delta will work with all authorities and stakeholders to look into what happened in this incident.' The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported that two planes that landed just before the Delta flight reported good breaking on the runway, and that the plane skid roughly 5,000 feet down the runway. 'I think the pilot did everything he could to slow the aircraft down,' said Port Authority head Patrick J. Foye during a news conference. I'm not even sure what went through my mind because you're not even sure what's happening,' said passenger Mark Clafter. 'And then it wasn't until the plane came to a stop that all of the sudden you think, 'Holy cow! We just skidded off the runway.""' He added that through it all,, 'no one was screaming, no one was freaking out, and when we came to a dead stop people were actually really calm.' He said that when they stopped all power went out and the pilot had no way of speaking to the passengers, but even then no one panicked.

New York Giants tight end Larry Donnell was also on the plane and shared a photo and video on Instagram as he evacuated on the runway, joking; 'Look at this sh*t!

He later released a statement saying; 'I feel fine physically and hopefully all the other passengers did not have any significant injuries We were all shocked and alarmed when the plane started to skid, but most importantly, as far as I know, all of the passengers and flight crew were able to exit the plane safely.' A woman named Vanessa also shared a photo as she left the plane, writing; '#survive #crashlanding #noinjuries.' Now some are questioning whether the airport should have even been open during these snowy and icy conditions.

"The family of a young father who is missing with his infant on today claimed that it is not the first time he has taken the child on his own. Kieran Carroll, 22, of Luton, Bedfordshire, has 'left' with his eight-month-old son Louis before, a source close to his family told MailOnline this afternoon. It comes as police renewed their appeal for Mr Carroll to get in contact after he posted two messages on Facebook saying both he and his son were 'fine'. Missing: CCTV footage released yesterday by Bedfordshire Police (left) shows the last sighting of Kieran Carroll, 22, from Luton, who has gone missing with his eight-month-old son Louis (right, together) Taunt: This comment, posted in response to a police appeal, is believed to have come from one of three accounts belonging to Mr Carroll. Police said they are now trying to verify the message . In response: Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post yesterday afternoon (seen above) Speaking today, the family source told MailOnline that they did not know what had 'gone on' but said 'it isn't the first he's left with his son.' The source added that they knew both father and son were 'fine'. It is understood the child was in his father's care at the time they were last seen. It is understood that Mr Carroll attended Bedford College, Bedfordshire, and formerly lived with his girlfriend, Louis' mother, at a home in Luton. The 20-year-old woman is believed to have a three-year-old son from a previous relationship. Yesterday afternoon, police searching for Mr Carroll released CCTV footage showing him pushing a pram as he left a hotel in the town at about 2pm. He has not been seen since. When the image was shared on Facebook by Bedfordshire Police, a profile understood to belong to Mr Carroll posted: 'I’m fine, so is my child - go look for some killers'. The force also published a photo of Louis on Facebook, along with new details on the search. The taunting response came from one of three accounts believed to belong to Mr Carroll, police said. Later last night, the same 'Kieran Carroll' profile commented again, saying, 'If any one is commenting and don't no me or what's really going on... stay out of my life you don't no me.' Concerns: Bedfordshire Police also released this photograph of baby Louis, whom they are trying to trace . Detective Inspector Quinn replied to the Facebook post yesterday afternoon, saying: 'Kieran – Thank you for posting on our Facebook page. ‘We are pleased to hear that you and Louis are safe. It is not the role of the police to decide on child custody matters. The baby's great-grandmother today appealed for Mr Carroll to bring Louis back home safely. Vivien Jakob-Grant, 65, told ITV Anglia: 'I would rather Louis be back home where he should be. I want him to be back home in one piece. 'I don't think his father would have hurt him because he doesn't look the kind of person who would do that - but I want him to be back home. 'I would just like him to take Louis back home where he should be.' ‘All we need to do is see you and Louis in person to check you are safe and well. Please call us on 101 so we can arrange to meet you. We cannot close this case until we see you.' Police are now trying to verify the Facebook comments believed to have been posted by Mr Carroll. Today, officers renewed their appeal, asking Mr Carroll to contact them directly. Detective Inspector Sean Quinn said this afternoon: 'We don’t believe that there are any issues with Kieran providing care for Louis but we do still need Kieran to get in touch with us. 'He is not in any trouble for taking Louis but I would still like to speak to him. We cannot close the case until the police have seen Louis. 'Louis’s mother is understandably worried and missing her son so again I’d urge Kieran, or anyone who knows where Kieran is, to call us on 101.' The posts on the Bedfordshire Police Facebook page prompted a number of comments from Mr Carroll's friends and family, defending his actions. Search: Fears are growing because police say the disappearance of Mr Carroll (above) is ‘completely out of character’, and because they believe he does not have any supplies for the baby . One commenter on the Facebook page, Chantelle Louise White, said: ‘You lot make out that he ant fine I know him for years and he won't do nuttin to he's son… He's looked after my son when he was the sane age! [sic]’ And Mr Carroll's sister, Alix Carroll, 24, said: 'My brother is an amazing father - he has his boy more than the mother does. A close friend of Mr Carroll last night claimed the father and Louis were ‘safe’. She said he was not planning to contact police 'yet' because he does not want to lose contact with Louis. Speaking last night, the woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I just spoke to him on the phone and I heard his child giggling in the background. 'He is just trying to do the right thing but he has done it the wrong way. I have told him that. He is trying to take back his child from his mother. 'Kieran is doing the right thing by taking the child out of this situation and he is not going to the police just yet. I am trying to convince him but I can't force him to do it. 'He can't bear the fact that tomorrow he won't be able to see his child again because social services will get involved.’ 'He's scared he's going to lose him - it's no different to if it was the other way round. 'Never in a million years would he harm a hair on his body. He will be safe - I bet my life on it.' Posting on Facebook, she added that she didn't know where her brother was, but that 'Louie is safe and there both okay [sic].' Earlier, police described the father’s disappearance as ‘completely out of character’ and said there are concerns because they believe Mr Carroll does not have any supplies for the baby. Mr Quinn said: 'This type of disappearance is very out of character for Kieran and we are becoming increasingly concerned. 'We just want Kieran to contact us to let us know that him and Louis are safe. 'If you have seen Kieran, or have any information about where he and Louis may be, please contact us immediately.' Mr Carroll is described as a white man of medium build, with short brown hair. He is believed to be wearing black trousers, and a grey hooded top, a bobble hat, as seen in the CCTV image. He also has tattoos on his arms. The security image shows Mr Carroll pushing a pram, but police said he later disposed of the pram at a friend's house and left carrying his son in his arms. The baby boy is believed to be wearing a blue cardigan with a picture of a ship on it. Searches for the young father are concentrating on the local area around his home of Luton. Anyone who may have seen Mr Carroll and his son, or has any information on their whereabouts, is urged to contact Mr Quinn on 101.","Kieran Carroll, 22, was reported missing along with his baby son Louis .

"A Singapore court has sentenced two German men to three strokes of the cane for spray-painting a metro train in the city-state notorious for its hardline rules on vandalism. Andreas Von Knorre, 22, and Elton Hinz, 21, were sentenced to caning and nine months in prison after pleading guilty to vandalism and trespassing. Both men, handcuffed and dressed in prison uniform, requested to speak directly to the judge before he handed down the sentence. Andreas Von Knorre arrives at court in a police car last year prior to his sentencing yesterday to three strokes of the cane . 'This is the darkest episode of my entire life,' said Von Knorre. 'I want to apologise to the state of Singapore for the stupid act...I've learned my lesson and will never do it again.' Hinz added: 'I promise I will never do it again. I want to apologise to you, and my family for the shame and situation I've put them into.' Both were dressed in a white T-shirt and brown trousers with the word 'Prisoner' down the sides and on the back. They spoke to the court in English. 'The imprisonment sentence in this case will be a total of nine months... and the mandatory minimum of three strokes of the cane,' District Judge Liew Thiam Leng said. 'Overall, the court is of the view that the circumstances and facts of this case will justify the proposed sentence given by the prosecution,' he added. Caning is a punishment dating back to British colonial rule in Singapore and involves being flogged with a rattan stick which often leaves permanent scars. The men were sentenced to four months in jail for breaking into a suburban train depot operated by state-linked SMRT in November 2014 and five months and three strokes of the cane for vandalising a carriage with spray paint. Both men fled Singapore after the incident but were caught in neighbouring Malaysia en route to Australia, where they were working, and extradited. The hearing in the packed courtroom, filled with German and other international journalists, was delayed for around two hours because an interpreter was not available. State prosecutors said Von Knorre and Hinz, who are friends, arrived in Singapore from Australia on November 4, 2014 and stayed at a hotel. A policewoman sits next to Elton Hinz, one of the two German nationals arrested in Singapore for vandalism . In the wee hours of November 7, they first sneaked into the train depot through a drainage system and by scaling a wall. They surveyed the area for a short while before leaving. In the wee hours of November 8, the duo again sneaked into the depot where they proceeded to spray paint graffiti measuring 1.8 metres (1.97 yards) in height and 10 metres in length on a train carriage. In written submissions to the court, state prosecutor Timotheus Koh said 'these are not offences committed by rash and impressionable persons'. 'The evidence indicates that the offences were committed after thorough, meticulous, deliberate and elaborate planning,' he said. Koh added that a 'self-timed' photograph the two men had taken in front of the train before vandalising it 'was meant to serve as a trophy to gain notoriety'. The total cleaning cost incurred by state-linked metro operator due to the vandalism was Sg$13,650 ($9,970), according to court documents. Singapore, a leading Asian financial hub, is known for its tough stance on crime. Its vandalism laws became global news in 1994 when an American teenager, Michael Fay, was caned for damaging cars and public property despite an appeal for clemency from the punishment by then President Bill Clinton. In 2010 Swiss expatriate Oliver Fricker was sentenced to seven months in jail and three strokes of the cane after he used spray paint to vandalise a train at a depot.","Singapore court sentences two German men to three strokes of the cane .

"Reseachers believe that people with a history of gout have their risk of developing Alzheimer's cut by a quarter . People with a history of gout have their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease reduced by a quarter, a new study has found. The painful joint condition, known as the disease of kings due to Henry VIII famously suffering from it, appears to have a protective effect on the brain, researchers have said. They believe this is possibly thanks to the excess uric acid that is built up during a gout attack. The study was carried out in the United States by the Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University Medical Centre, but analysed people in the UK by looking at The Health Improvement Network (THIN), an electronic database from GP's surgeries around the country. They looked at 3.7million people aged 40 and over but excluded anyone already diagnosed with gout or dementia. Analysis was carried out of Alzheimer's disease amongst adults with gout compared with up to five without it. Overall, the researchers identified 309 new cases of Alzheimer's disease among 59,224 patients with gout. And in their comparison group over a five-year follow-up period, they found 1,942 cases of Alzheimer's among 238,805 patients. They concluded this shows there was a 24 per cent lower risk of Alzheimer's among people with a history of gout, after taking into account age, sex, body mass index, socio-economic status, lifestyle factors, prior heart conditions and use of heart drugs. The report concluded: 'Our findings provide the first population-based evidence for the potential protective effect of gout on the risk of Alzheimer's disease and support the purported neuroprotective role of uric acid. 'If confirmed by future studies, a therapeutic investigation that has been employed to prevent progression of Parkinson’s disease may be warranted for this relatively common and devastating condition.' The U.S. researchers found there was a 24 per cent lower risk of Alzheimer's among people with a history of gout (file picture) Last year it emerged that the number of people suffering from gout is on the rise, with hospital admissions for the painful condition rising by a fifth over the last five years in England. Associated with a diet rich in purines such as red meat, seafood and beer, the most common symptom is a sudden and severe pain in the joint along with swelling and redness. Men are most commonly affected, and other factors that increase a person’s risk include their age, being overweight or obese or having high blood pressure or diabetes. The full report is published online in the Annals Of The Rheumatic Diseases. Gout is a type of arthritis, which causes sudden and severe pain in joints, along with swelling and redness. It usually affects the joint of the big toe but it can develop in any joint. The condition is caused when crystals of sodium urate form inside and around the joint causing them to swell. It is often associated with a diet rich in food containing purines, such as red meat, seafood and beer. Men are most commonly affected, and other factors that increase a person’s risk include their age, being overweight or obese or having high blood pressure or diabetes. It is often referred to as the disease of kings due to Henry VIII famously suffering from it.","Researchers say gout sufferers reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease by 24% .

"Who likes short shorts? Well it seems Today show host Karl Stefanovic does, as he appeared on the breakfast show this morning bearing his pins in a pair of tiny black shorts. The 40-year-old gold Logie winner, who was taking part in a segment on how to be a good morning person, is known for being one of Australia's biggest jokers and he certainly got into the spirit of the exercise routines, displaying his sporty physique in a range of questionable poses. Scroll down for video . Karl Stefanovic donned a pair of tiny shorts on Thursday's Today show . The loveable rogue, who was joined on set by co-host Lisa Wilkinson and fitness instructor Michael Ryan, turned all of Australia into morning people this morning, keeping them entertained as he twisted and stretched in his hotpants. Lisa Wilkinson could barely contain herself as she laughed through the opening half of the segment, claiming she didn't know why all the floor staff were in stitches. As the fitness trainer demonstrated the best exercises for a healthy morning routine, Karl, who was wearing a pair of Birkenstocks with socks, stretched out his legs. apparently not too concerned about his tiny shorts showing off too much skin. The 40-year-old took part in a segment abut early fitness routines . The joker got some strange looks from co-host Laura Wilkinson and trainer Michael Ryan regarding his Birkenstocks, which he teamed with a pair of black socks . During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background. Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire. 'That's not pretty, I think we should stand up guys because it's not good TV at this point in time,' the fitness guru said. 'He's like a dog about to walk up on a tree.' Karl did little to protect his modesty during the exercise segment . The trainer looked on in confusion as Karl spread his legs in his tiny hotpants . However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display. 'What? If you don't like it look away,' he jokingly said. That's when things took an unsightly turn, as the trainer introduced the lateral lunge. There was no escaping this move for Karl and he conceded to defeat as he put his hands down to cover his modesty. Twitter users loved Karl's exercise routine, with one commenter claiming she his workout made her want to workout all day long. Another user commented on Karl's disposition during the whole segment, claiming he demonstrated the Australian version of blue steel. However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display . In November, the Today show co-host shocked viewers when he revealed that he had been wearing the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air for a year, to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry. Stefanovic said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked. 'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t,' he told Fairfax Media. 'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them. 'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test).' During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background . Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire . Stefanovic's experiment  sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post. Karl, whose funny streak has seen him become one of the biggest names on television, admitted on Wednesday that he once got into some trouble on the Gold Coast. Speaking on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show with hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson, he was asked if he'd ever been in trouble with the law. 'Yeah I got locked up on the Gold Coast once,' he replied, with a shocked Jackie quickly asking what he'd done to land himself in jail. 'I was at Billy’s nightclub…and I went out to the foyer, and there was a big life size poster of [Australian sportsman and former ironman] Trevor Hendy – and I thought it would be a good idea to take that off the wall and run outside with it.' Karl explained where it all went wrong and said: 'Well I was so drunk I ran all the way around the block to the waiting police!.'","Today show host Karl Stefanovic donned a pair of tiny shorts on TV .

"George Osborne is planning to lift the burden of National Insurance on millions of workers in his final Budget before the General Election, senior Labour figures believe. Shadow Cabinet ministers suspect the Chancellor will seek to make a ‘game-changing’ tax announcement later this month that could be funded by scaling back tax relief to wealthy pensioners. Labour has been surprised by the Tories’ muted criticism of its plans, announced last week, to use tax reforms to fund a proposed cut in tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000 a year. Shadow Cabinet ministers suspect Chancellor George Osbrone (pictured) will seek to make a ‘game-changing’ tax announcement later this month that could be funded by scaling back tax relief to pensioners . The party said it would cut the amount people can pay into a pension and get tax relief on over their lifetime from £1.25million to £1million, and reduce the amount that can be paid in to a pension with tax relief each year from £40,000 to £30,000. Mr Osborne has already reduced the lifetime allowance, which used to be £1.5million, arguing that it unfairly benefited the most wealthy. A Labour source said a cut to £1million would fund a significant reduction in the threshold for employees’ National Insurance contributions. Workers currently pay National Insurance on earnings above £153 a week, or £7,956 a year, at a rate of 12 per cent, but it kicks in at a far lower level than the income tax threshold, which will increase to £10,600 in April. Cutting National Insurance would ensure that 1.2million workers who earn too little to gain from the increase in the personal allowance – many of them women with part-time jobs – would benefit. Tory sources insisted senior members of the Coalition had not yet met to agree measures ahead of the Budget on March 18. The Chancellor yesterday hailed a report from economists saying living standards in Britain will finally return to pre-recession levels. Mr Osborne said the verdict from the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies had ‘put to bed’ several Labour myths, saying incomes had been restored to pre-crisis levels, the wealthiest have paid the most towards deficit reduction and inequality in society has been reduced. Cathy Jamieson (pictured) Labour’s shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘We need a recovery that reaches kitchen tables across Britain, not one which has left working people worse off' He said the findings showed Britain had ‘reached a major milestone in the recovery, but it’s not the end of the journey’. ‘We’ve got to secure a national recovery and mustn’t abandon the progress we have made at risk by abandoning the plan that has got us this far,’ he told BBC Radio 4. He said families had ‘paid a very heavy price for the mistakes that led to the great recession’ under Labour. ‘But the picture you hear, particularly from my political opponents, of the British economy is not one reflected in this independent report - indeed quite the opposite. ‘What they show is that Britain is growing, that incomes are rising, that the richest have made the biggest contribution, inequality has fallen ... Britain is fundamentally in a better position than it was five years ago. ‘If you look at the rate of progress in the report today, if you look at incomes, they should be higher in 2015/16 than they were in 2010/11, so on that measure as well we will have made progress.’ Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘We need a recovery that reaches kitchen tables across Britain, not one which has left working people worse off.’","George Osborne may make 'game-changing' tax announcement soon .

"More than 160 people were forced to exit a plane using its emergency slides after the cabin filled with smoke. Six crew members and 158 passengers were rescued from the American Airlines flight at Denver International Airport around midday yesterday. They had flown on Flight 445 from Charlotte, North Carolina, and had been taxiing to the gate for less than a minute when the captain ordered that the chutes be activated. Scroll down for video . More than 160 people were forced to exit American Airlines Flight 445 using its emergency slides after the cabin filled with smoke at Denver International Airport around midday on Wednesday . A bus took the passengers to the terminal, where they waited for two hours for their baggage. One minor injury was reported. It is thought the person slipped on ice. Passenger Andy Long said he noticed a smell like an emergency brake being left on in a running car and then saw the cabin fill with a light haze. He said: 'That's when they said ""Everybody get out, get out, get out. Don't take your stuff.""' 'There was probably an appropriate amount of people being generally frustrated because their days got rained on.' He wrote on Instagram after the incident that he can now tick using an emergency plane exit off his bucket list. Another passenger, Lindsay Geisler, said that passengers waited for 20 minutes for a bus. She added: 'It's been great to see how people rally together and help out one another when you get put into a situation like this.'

"A dog that was tied to railroad tracks and repeatedly shot is expected to make a full recovery after having her injured leg amputated. Police in Florida stopped an oncoming train to rescue a dog that had been shot three times and lashed to the railway tracks with a belt. Officers received three calls around 523pm Wednesday from people reporting hearing gunshots. Then they heard a dog whimpering while canvassing the neighborhood, and followed the sound to nearby train tracks. Horrific: Police arrived at the scene to discover the dog (pictured) had been shot three times and tied to the railway tracks with a belt . Survivor: The young pit bull mix, dubbed Cabela, suffered injuries were so severe her front-right leg (right) will have to be amputated . On the mend: Cabela, pictured here resting at Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, is said to be stable and in good spirits . They discovered the blood-spattered pup, nicknamed Cabela, had been shot twice in the neck and once in the shoulder. Her injuries were so severe that the dog's front right leg needs to be amputated in the next few days. Authorities are now asking for the public's help to find the thug who mercilessly left the animal for dead in the Sulphur Springs area. Officers freed the one to two-year-old female from the tracks and immediately took it to they Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, where it remains in a stable condition. 'It's very calm and relaxed and just in recovery mode at this point,' said Officer Derek Lang, a police spokesman. A staffer who answered the phone at the clinic Thursday evening told Daily Mail Cabela is in stable condition and 'in good spirits.' New life: Once Cabela fully recovers, she will be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption . She is currently under the care of Dr Jamie Davidson, who says Cabela is sweet with a good temperament, despite what she's gone through. Police have said they do not know who tied Cabela to the track and asked the public for any information to track down the culprit or the dog's owner. Once Cabela fully recovers, she will be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption.

"Early humans are widely regarded as having been voracious hunters whose appetite for meat contributed to the extinction of many of the large mammals that once roamed the planet. However, new research by paleontologists has suggested that our human ancestors may have started out as scavengers rather than the efficient killing machines they are often portrayed as. The findings could help to explain how early humans made the significant shift in their diet to consume meat and became one of the top predators on the planet. Scroll down for video . Homo erectus, pictured in the reconstruction above, needed around 2200 calories a day to survive and could have easily obtained this by scavenging meat left on the carcasses by predatory big cats in Africa at the time . Dr Briana Pobiner, a palaeoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, studied the meat left behind on modern lion kills to estimate whether early humans could have sustained themselves by picking the bones left behind by predators. She estimates that early humans like Homo erectus could have obtained enough meat to provide an entire days worth of energy from the scraps left behind by prehistoric predators. She told Mail Online: 'Early humans would have scavenged carcasses of animals that ranged in size from medium sized animals like wildebeest all the way up to huge extinct elephants, and animals that lived in a range of different habitats from more open grasslands to closed woodlands. 'Probably anything that wasn’t too rotten was fair game.' Lions, like the two eating a zebra kill above, leave large amounts of their kills untouched, meaning there would have been plenty of meat for early humans to scavenge from carcasses left by prehistoric feline predators . She added that early humans probably survived though a combination of both hunting and scavenging. She said: 'I think it was both – probably a combination of scavenging from larger animals and hunting smaller animals. 'One major energetic advantage of scavenging is that you have a really high success rate in the sense that unless a carcass is absolutely picked clean, like what happens after vultures have gotten to it, you’re virtually guaranteed to get some meat and marrow from what’s left. 'With hunting, you can expend a lot of energy and come up empty-handed.' Dr Pobiner found that modern predators leave large amounts of meat on their kills (as shown above) and believes that prehistoric carnivores could have left even more to be  picked clean by early humans . Speaking in a video on the Smithsonian website, she added: 'I've found in some of the fossils I studied that early humans got to these carcasses first and were able to eat the best parts of the animals. 'Sometimes carnivores got their first and early humans probably only got scraps. It has really big implications for a lot of other major changes that happened in human evolutionary history. 'The evolution in meat eating has been linked to an increase in brain size, its been linked to an increase in home range size and maybe the expansion out of Africa. 'Competing with big carnivores you needed sophisticated interaction, communication and other social skills that are another hallmark of being human.' In research published in the Journal of Human Evolution, Dr Pobiner examined the carcasses of carnivore kills on the modern African savanna in Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy. She looked at how much meat was consumed by lions and leopards before measuring what was left for scavengers. She also watched how much meat other large meat eaters like hyenas and jackals left behind once they were finished with a carcass. Dr Briana Pobiner (above) claims to have found evidence that humans butchered carcasses after large predators had eaten meat from the bones first . Speaking to Popular Archaeology she said: 'The site is a great analogue for the kinds of African savanna environments where hominins are thought to have lived. 'This may have been very much like past carnivore communities during the time our ancestors were starting to eat meat from larger animals, when we have evidence that felids — ancient lions, leopards, and three species of sabertoothed cats — lived alongside our ancestors and may have been the dominant kinds of carnivores at this time.' Dr Pobiner found that in modern Africa even a 'defleshed' wildebeest hindlimb killed by a lion could still yield around one kilogram of meat while a zebra hind limb could have two kilograms of flesh still left on it. She estimates that an entire wildebeest or zebra carcass could yield 5kg and 15 kg of meat respectively even after a predator had eaten. This means a wildebeest carcass could provide 2200 calories and a zebra carcass could provide 6080 calories - enough for a small family of Homo erectus. Dr Pobiner said: 'This is enough for the entire daily caloric requirements of at least one Homo erectus/ergaster male, estimated to require approximately 2090-2290 calories per day.' Dr Pobiner says there is also evidence within the fossil record that suggests predators had eaten carcasses before early humans arrived to butcher the animals. Hyenas are the main scavengers of lion kills on the African Savannah but there are few examples of them in the fossil record in areas where  early humans have been discovered and they could have scavenged instead . 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.8 million years ago - The first species in the Homo family appeared . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.9 million years ago - Homo erectus begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . She said that at around the time Homo erectus were alive there were also few species of bone-crunching carnivores like hyenas in Africa. It means that early humans could have instead filled this niche. She said: 'This lack of bone-crunching hyenids would have meant that as early Homo individuals began incorporating more carcass foods into their diets they would have had more access to within-bone resources than is available in many present-day African savanna ecosystems.' She added that sabretooth cats that lived at the time would have been less efficient than modern predatory cats at removing flesh from a carcass. She said: 'The fossil record of modern lions and leopards goes back to about 2 million years, their dietary adaptations would probably have been similar to the living species today. 'Where the difference comes in is with the three species (three genera, actually) of sabertoothed cats that were around when hominins first started eating meat. 'They would have likely left even more meat on carcasses, because their teeth are even more adapted to slicing flesh.' Dr Pobiner said her findings had helped to dispell the idea that early humans would have struggled to find enough meat to survive by scavenging the meat left by larger predators. She said: 'We tend to think of scavenging as second-rate to hunting, somehow a lesser form of acquiring resources from animal carcasses, that scavengers are lower on the hierarchy and only left with piddly scraps. 'This stems from the earliest interpretations, dating back to 1925, of ancient humans as carnivorous, predatory killers based on associated broken animal fossils construed as being used as weapons.’ She believes, however, that more research is needed to understand whether  scavenging provided a dietary stepping stone as our ancestors moved towards eating more meat. Writing in the Journal of Human Evolution, Dr Pobiner said: 'This study supports the hypothesis that passive scavenging from abandoned larger felid kills could have a been a high-yield, though potentially dangerous, strategy for early hominins even without considering within bone nutrients.'","Palaeontologists studied flesh left behind on big cat kills in modern Africa .

"A group of children in Yemen have attempted to burn a 10-year-old boy to death after first locking him in a cage in a shocking imitation of the Islamic State's murder of a Jordanian pilot. As many as seven boys are believed to have attacked the as-yet unnamed victim in Al Dahthath village in the country's northern Ibb province. The defenceless child was then locked in a wooden cage and had petrol poured over his body before being set alight. Thankfully a group of locals spotted the attack and managed to save the boy's life, although he was still left with horrific burn injuries on his legs. Horror: The defenceless child was  locked in a wooden cage and had petrol poured over his body before being set alight. Thankfully a group of locals spotted the attack and managed to save the boy's life . Gruesome: The attack is understood to have been a sickening imitation of the brutal murder of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kasasbeh, who was burnt alive by ISIS earlier this year . Local journalist Mohammad Mouzahem was told about the attack and posted details of it on his Facebook page, according to Gulf News. The boys are understood to have been inspired by murders committed by ISIS after using mobile phone apps such as WhatsApp to share gruesome videos of the terror group's atrocities, despite living in a remote village where electricity supplies are unreliable. During the attack, the boys are said to have assumed different terrorist roles, with the 'leader' sitting in a chair and giving orders to his friends. After being set alight, the boys cries were overheard by local residents who rushed to save him. 'The villagers took him to a local hospital where he received treatment for burns to one of his legs,' Mr Mouzahem was quoted as saying. Shame: The chilling footage, entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', shows the caged airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel as a trail of petrol leading up to him is seen being set alight . The attack is understood to have been a sickening imitation of the brutal murder of Jordanian pilot Mu'ath al-Kasasbeh, who was burnt alive by ISIS earlier this year. The chilling footage, entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', shows the caged airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars is seen being set alight. Flames are seen quickly spreading across the dirt to the cage, where they completely engulf the helpless pilot in images that are far too distressing to publish. Extremists pour debris, including broken masonry, over the cage, which is then flattened by a bulldozer. The horrific murder led to Jordan immediately executing two ISIS prisoners and carrying out an unprecedented number of attacks on the terror group in Syria. Lined up on the beach: The group of young boys in Yemen are forced to their knees and stare down at the sand whilst they await their mock execution . Chilling: The video bares a striking resemblance to ISIS' real murder video of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya and suggests the young boys have been studying the footage intently . Sickening: The video in Yemen shows five young boys, aged around 10-years-old and wearing only trousers, being led to a beach by five teenagers . The real thing: Each boy appears deep in character, honed from studying the authentic Coptic murder video . News of the attack on the 10-year-old boy in Yemen came just weeks after video emerged showing a group of young Yemeni boys reenacting the brutal murder of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by Islamic State militants in Libya. The grainy mobile phone footage was reportedly filmed somewhere on the Gulf coast in Yemen. It shows five young boys, possibly aged around 10-years-old, wearing only trousers, being led to a beach by five teenage boys. The teenage boys are fully dressed and their faces are covered by scarfs to imitate the masked murderers from the sickening Islamic State execution video. On the way to the beach, the older boys each pick up a stick, mimicking the collecting of knives by the executioners in the beheading video of 21 Syrian soldiers released in November 2014. Lined up on the beach, the young boys are forced to their knees and stare down at the sand whilst they await their mock execution. Each boy appears deep in character, honed from studying the terror group's depraved videos. An Egyptian couple horrified guests at their wedding by hiring fake jihadis to  hijack the ceremony and force them in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a Jordanian pilot. The marriage ceremony was held in Menoufia, north of Cairo and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point. The only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend 'attack' in advance were the groom, his best men and wedding photographer Ahmed Kassem - although the bride is said to have been told to expect something 'different' from the ceremony. Hijacked: The marriage ceremony was held in Menoufia, north of Cairo, and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point . Trapped: The fake jihadis took control of the ceremony and force the bride and groom in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a Jordanian pilot . It is unclear from the video whether the bride and groom are Muslim or Christian. Video footage of the ceremony shows one of the groom's knife-wielding best men wearing a black balaclava and  religious song - known as a nasheed - that has previously featured prominently in genuine Islamic State propaganda videos. Having stormed the stage, the men force the couple to climb in to a cage in a chilling imitation of the ISIS video that showed Jordanian pilot Mu'ath Al Kassasbeh being burnt alive earlier this year. The only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend 'attack' in advance were the as yet unnamed groom, his best men and wedding photographer Ahmed Kassem. The bride was not aware . Once inside the cage the couple stand up and dance while guests clap and cheer them on. Not everybody was enamoured by the proceedings, however, with the Youm7 newspaper reporting that several of the wedding guests mistakenly thought it was a genuine terrorist attack. It is believed that even the bride was unaware at what the groom had planned, and that the only people aware of the 'attack' in advance were the best men playing the roles of jihadis, and the photographer, who had been ordered to make sure everything was caught on camera.","Up to seven boys locked the helpless 10-year-old victim in a wooden cage .

"While Hillary Clinton was using a private email address hosted on her own home-based computer server to conduct State Department business, her agency forced out an ambassador who was doing the same thing overseas. Retired Air Force General Scott Gration was US ambassador to Kenya for 13 months between 2011 and 2012, departing after a scathing performance report blasted his leadership style and determined that he created security risks by running his own one-person IT department. The report determined that Gration 'assumed charge of the mission’s information management operations,' in Nairobi, and 'ordered a commercial Internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the Department email system.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND GRATION'S PERFORMANCE REPORT . OUSTED: Scott Gration (left) was special envoy to Sudan before he spent 13 months as ambassador to Kenya; he was forced out after an inspector general report found problems with his performance – including the use of unauthorized commercial email services to conduct government business outside of secure channels . EMAIL-GATE: Hillary Clinton never used an official government email address as secretary of state, relying on a private server at the same time her agency was forcing Gration out for, among other things, doing the same . He also tried to legitimize his actions by writing new policy and distributing it to the embassy staff, saying the use of 'commercial email' for government business was acceptable. Gration, the State Department's Office of Inspector General wrote, 'continued to use commercial email for official government business' even when investigators were digging into his conduct. The report noted that he seldom logged on to his official State Department email account; The New York Times later reported that he 'preferred to use Gmail for official business.' Clinton, the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 2016, came under fire this week for using a private email account – not a State Department 'state.gov' address – to conduct government business. Her aides, and Obama administration colleagues – including White House personnel – reached her at 'hdr22@clintonemail.com' for the four years she was America's top diplomat. The revelation has led to accusations that the former secretary failed to turn over all her communications for archiving, as the Federal Records Act requires. Additional questions have swirled around potential national security risks posed by having sensitive material flowing through unsecure channels. Scott Gration lasted just 13 months as an ambassador before his management style and data security breaches ended his State Dept. career . Clinton helmed the State Department through the entirety of Gration's tenure as ambassador. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment about parallels between her case and Gration's. But the 2012 IG report spelled out a policy that it appears Clinton herself failed to follow. 'It is the department's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,' the report read. 'The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing, and spoofing of email accounts, as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information.' 'The use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions,' the inspector general added. 'Conducting official business on non-department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies.' SECURE? America's embassy in Nairobi, Kenya where Gration had a commercial internet line installed in his office bathroom so he could communicate out of reach of Washington . Clinton's emails were never publicly leaked, but some messages sent to her by a close adviser were. The infamous Romanian hacker who used the nom-de-hack 'Guccifer' was sentenced to four years in prison for, among other things, breaching the email account of Sidney Blumenthal, a former Bill Clinton aide who later joined Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Some of the messages consisted of intelligence reports, sent in late 2012 to Clinton's private address, and covered matters in Libya – including the aftermath of the September 11, 2012 terror attack in Benghazi. Among the recommendations at the close of the report that ended Gration's career, the IG urged: 'Embassy Nairobi should cease using commercial email to process Department information and use authorized Department automated information systems for conducting official business.'

"A ring crafted more than 1,000 years ago confirms highlights the contact between the Vikings and the Islamic world. Discovered inside a ninth century woman’s grave in Sweden, the stone inset into the ring bears an inscription that says ‘for Allah’ or ‘to Allah’. While it is already known that the Vikings acquired glass in far flung lands, the artefact bolsters the  theory that the seafaring civilisation did business with Islamic traders. A ring (pictured) made over 1,000 years ago has confirmed contact between the Vikings and the Islamic world because it was unearthed in Sweden but bears an ancient Arabic inscription that asys 'for Allah' or 'to Allah' The ring was discovered during excavations of a Viking trading centre in Birka, Sweden, in the late 1800s, Science News reported. Since then, it has been thought that stone in the ring is violet amethyst, but now experts have revealed it is coloured glass – an exotic material at the time. Researchers at Stockholm University used a scanning electron microscope to determine the material and to clearly reveal ancient Arabic writing called Kufic writing, that reads ‘for Allah or ‘to Allah.’ It is known that Scandinavians traded glass objects from Egypt and Mesopotamia up to 3,400 years ago, so it is entirely possible that the Vikings fetched glass goods from the region instead of waiting for them to make their way north via trade networks. Ancient texts also mention trades taking place between the Vikings and members of the Islamic civilisation, which stretched from the Mediterranean to West Asia, but archaeological evidence is rare. The ring was discovered during excavations of a Viking trading centre in Birka, Sweden (shown by the red marker) which lies west of Stockholm, in the late 1800s but has now been examined under a scanning electron microscope to determine the stone is exotic glass, rather than an amythest . Ancient texts mention trades taking place between the Vikings and members of the Islamic civilisation, which stretched from the Mediterranean to West Asia, but archaeological evidence is rare. An illustration of Vikings unloading goods from a longboat is shown . The study, published in the journal Scanning, says: ‘The ring may… constitute material evidence for direct interactions between Viking Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world. ‘Being the only ring with an Arabic inscription found at a Scandinavian archaeological site, it is a unique object among Swedish Viking Age material.’ Further analysis of the ring showed that it was rarely worn. The inner ring still shows signs of where the silver was filed by a craftsman, meaning that it was probably sold as new before it became a treasured possession of a Viking woman. ‘The ring has been cast in a high-grade silver alloy (94.5/5.5 Ag/Cu) and retains the post-casting marks from the filing done to remove flash and mould lines,’ according to the study. ‘Thus, the ring has rarely been worn, and likely passed from the silversmith to the woman buried at Birka with few owners in between.’ Last year, a Viking sword was discovered in a field in Norway by aman scanning the area with a metal detector. This led experts from the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology to excavate the site. They found a grave dating to 950AD that contained the remains of a shield buried with a Viking warrior, as well as a sword bearing an inscription. The boss from a Viking shield (pictured) was recently found to contain Islamic coins in a leather purse. This evidence strengthens the theory that the Vikings traded with Islamic civilisations, or came into contact with the culture in Spain . Incredibly, the shield boss - the round part at the centre of a shield - concealed a leather purse with Islamic coins inside. This evidence strengthens the theory that the Vikings traded with Islamic civilisations, or came into contact with the culture in Spain. Archaeologist Ingrid Ystgaard told ThorNews: ‘We have not managed to find out who owned the sword, but we know that he was a well-travelled man.’ ‘The shield boss has a clear cut mark by an axe or a sword,’ she said, before adding that it is not known if the man died in battle.","Ninth century ring was discovered in a Viking grave in Sweden .

"All is in readiness for arguably the biggest day in Australian horse-racing, with almost $6 million up for grabs across Sydney and Melbourne on Saturday. Super Saturday rivals the Melbourne Cup for the sport's grand occasions .. and this may just be the pipe-opener for even bigger days ahead this Autumn, including Nicole Richie's role as international ambassador for the Golden Slipper. But before her arrival, the world's three fastest horses, all Australian, will race for the $1 million prize at Flemington on what is dubbed 'Super Saturday'. The young bucks and fabulous fillies, however, will be on show on course and around it too, with Ladies Day at Rosehill. The best horses have been put through their paces at trackwork this week ahead of going on show on Super Saturday across Melbourne and Sydney . The battle to be the world's best. Lankan Rupee enjoys a hose down after his trackwork session at Caulfield ahead of lining up in the Group One Newmarket Handicap at Flemington's 'Super Saturday' meeting . The ATC International Ambassador, Nicole Richie, is scheduled to arrive in Sydney next week for day two of the Golden Slipper Carnival . The world’s highest-rated sprinters, Lankan Rupee from the Mick Price stable and Terravista, trained by Joe Pride, are at the top of betting for the $1 million Group 1 Lexus Newmarket Handicap. Lankan Rupee has returned in stellar form, fresh from a triumphant first-up run in the Black Caviar Lightning on February 21. He will have to lump top weight of 58.5kg as he aims to become only the fifth horse to record consecutive Newmarket wins, after saluting last March. A winner of 11 of 21 career starts, Lankan Rupee will have to equal Hay List’s metric weight-carrying record if he is to muster a sixth career Group 1. To do that he will have to overcome Terravista, who is ridden by the in-form Hugh Bowman. Joe Pride's star sprinter was a very impressive winner of the Group 1 Darley Classic over the Newmarket course and distance during the Melbourne Cup Carnival. To his great advantage, he has two kilos less than Lankan Rupee, in trying to beat history by becoming the first horse since 1917 to taste first-up success in the Newmarket. And if they don't salute, waiting in the wings to claim the title of world's best is another star, Chautauqua, who will carry 55.5kg. The impressive grey has not yet won a Group 1 in 11 starts, but has saluted twice in Group 2 events. Trained by the Hawkes triumvirate, the four-year-old was beaten less than a neck by Terravista and finished ahead of Lankan Rupee in the Darley Classic. 'This year’s Newmarket is shaping as one of the most exciting renewals in history with the world’s three highest-rated sprinters, Lankan Rupee, Terravista and Chautauqua, all expected to take their place on Super Saturday,' Racing Victoria handicapper Neil Jennings said.

Lankan Rupee will take of Terravista and up-and-coming sprinters Chautauqua and Brazen Beau in the million dollar sprint down the Flemington straight on Saturday. Up for grabs is title of world's best sprinter . Jockey Craig Williams appears happy with his mount in the $1 million Australian Cup. But Protectionist, the reigning Melbourne Cup champ will need to overcome favourite Happy Trails, among others, to make history at Flemington on Super Saturday . Leading jockey Craig Williams leads 2014 Melbourne Cup winner Protectionist out of his stalls ahead of his run in the $1 million Australian Cup . Craig Williams will take the ride on the Kris Lee-trained Protectionist, who is aiming to equal the likes of Makybe Diva and Fiorente as horses to have claimed the elusive Melbourne Cup and Australian Cup double . And there's no knock on the Chris Waller trained Brazen Beau either, carrying the lighweight 52kg and with star jockey Joao Moreira in the saddle, he will be primed for the 1200m event, off the back of a second to Lankan Rupee. The Kris Lees-trained Protectionist has drawn barrier three as he looks to emulate the deeds of 2013 Melbourne Cup winner Fiorente, by claiming the $1 million Australian Cup in his following preparation. 16 horses accepted for the $1 million 2000 metre Group 1, which will be one of the highlights of Flemington’s ‘Super Saturday’. Craig Williams will take the ride on the former German runner and Lees will be hoping for a better run than the sixth the Melbourne Cup winner managed when resuming as a $2.90 favourite in the Group 2 Peter Young Stakes at Caulfield. The ageless Red Cadeaux, who is a three-time runner up in the Melbourne Cup, will be ridden by Bowman but has fared poorly, drawing barrier 14 in a 16-horse field. The nine-year-old, who has a remarkable record in the race that stops a nation, is yet to win in Australia in four attempts. Over in Sydney's west, they will kick off The Golden Slipper Carnival with Ladies Day. They've been spruiking the event as 'The New Breed' and will culminate with the arrival of their ATC's international ambassador, Nicole Richie, next week. 'It starts three weeks of spectacular racing and entertainment at Rosehill Gardens – including Australia’s biggest day of Group 1 racing, Golden Slipper Day,' said the ATC statement. John Thompson's glamour three year old filly First Seal headlines a stellar cast of girls in the Group 1 Coolmore Classic, which is worth $600,000. But she will have to overcome the likes of Group 1 winners in Dear Demi and Diamond Drille. Hartnell was expected to take on Protectionist in the Australian Cup but has been reserved for an easier mission in the Group 3 Sky High Stakes in Sydney.

The New Breed Bar will be opened for the first time on Saturda, featuring 'entertainment and a modern setting for the young and young at heart' And the ATC will stage its final two major lead up races to the $3.5 million Golden Slipper, which will be run next Saturday, as the countdown continues to the world’s richest race for two year olds. ATC Ambassador and Home and Away star Erika Heynatz will play a leading role on the day and feature at the Ladies Long Lunch. The New Breed Bar, focusing on the new racegoer, will be opened for the first time. Australian Turf Club Chief Operating Officer Tony Partridge said the first day of the Golden Slipper Carnival promises wall-to-wall action and entertainment. 'Ladies Day is all about the girls, and with our great Ambassador Erika Heynatz and all of the treats for the ladies on course, along with one of the best fillies in Australia in First Seal on the track, what a start for racing fans,'’ Mr Partridge said. This is just the start, after Golden Slipper Day, focus will turn to the multi-million dollar double weekend of racing at Royal Randwick, known as 'The Championships'. One of the features will be what they have dubbed 'Little Sydney', including 'extraordinary food and wine, offering racegoers a gourmet experience designed by celebrity chefs from China Doll, Chiswick and Icebergs'. The 'world-class playground' inside Royal Randwick does not come cheap though - tickets are $450 each and despite the cost, they're going quicker than Lankan Rupee and Terravista.","Australia's Autumn Racing Carnival is among the richest in the world .

'Girls shouldn't have to do what you did to get on in the world, not a good example!', tweeted another. Several social media users were quick to jump to Ms Gillard's defence, labelling the comments 'bitter' and 'angry', and one Twitter user claimed the former prime minister was 'a far better person than you will ever be'. 'Winning smile. Breaking glass ceilings in Australia for women and redheads,' tweeted one user, while another wrote, 'Congratulations. You are a great role model for all young females!' Ms Gillard tweeted the photo as part of  A World At School's project 'Up for School', an international campaign to achieve the Millennium Goal of seeing all children in school. The project cites a statistic of 58 million children still out of school, and ahead of International Women's Day on March 8, Ms Gillard, who has long been outspoken about the disadvantages women face.

Ms Gillard, who is well-known for her 'misogyny' speech, spoke at the NAB Women’s Agenda Leadership Awards ceremony about the importance of encouraging girls in education and women into leadership positions. 'It is a universal truism in development, when you speak to people in the global development community, that if you want to change the society, educate a girl,' Ms Gillard said. 'If you educate a girl, then she will have the empowerment and the economic freedoms, which come with that education, when she moves into the labour market, and more choices about how and when to have her children, she will choose to have less children, and have them later in her life,' reported Business Insider.

"Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation have today decided to stop all forms of security coordination with Israel - a step that could lead to an escalation of tensions. Three members of the Palestinian Central Council (PCC), the second highest Palestinian decision-making body, said the decision was taken during a two-day meeting that ended today. 'The council decided to cease all forms of security coordination with Israel,' a PLO official said. Decision: It is not clear if Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will implement today's resolution by the PLO's Central Council . A statement issued by the 110-member PCC read: 'Security coordination in all its forms with the authority of the Israeli occupation will be stopped in the light of its (Israel's) non-compliance with the agreements signed between the two sides.' It said Israel 'should shoulder all its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people in the occupied state of Palestine as an occupation authority according to international law'. The decision is certain to provoke Israel, which sees security coordination as vital to maintain calm in the West Bank. Palestinian security forces also require Israeli permission to send patrols into some areas of the West Bank to preserve law and order. It is not clear if Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will implement the resolution by the PCC. Set up under the 1993 Oslo autonomy accords which founded the Palestinian Authority, the coordination involves the sharing of intelligence and is considered crucial for Israel to keep tabs on Islamist movement Hamas and its West Bank members. Israeli officials had no immediate comment on the PCC move. The PCC statement also said the United Nations Security Council should 'determine a deadline to end the Israeli occupation and ensure that the state of Palestine is enabled to practice its sovereignty on its land occupied since 1967, including its capital east Jerusalem'. A partial view of the Israeli settlement of Qadumim (bottom) and the Palestinian village of Jit (above R), in the Israeli-occupied West Bank near Nablus . It added: 'The concept of a Jewish state is rejected and also of a (Palestinian) state with provisional borders is rejected. 'Any formula that will keep an Israeli military or settler presence on any part of the land of the state of Palestine is rejected.' The Palestinians submitted a UN Security Council resolution in December - which was voted down - calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank within two years. In January, President Abbas sought membership in the International Criminal Court, paving the way for possible war crimes charges against Israel. In response, Israel withheld tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority. Activists in Abbas' Fatah movement countered by enforcing a boycott of goods made by Israeli food companies. Despite the tensions, security coordination between Abbas' forces and Israeli troops has continued in the West Bank.","Palestinian leaders today decided to stop security coordination with Israel .

"Jesinta Campbell has defended comments she made about the imminent executions of the Bali Nine duo after she was accused of supporting Indonesia's death penalty laws. Campbell appeared on Channel Nine's Today breakfast show on Thursday, where she  was asked about her views on the fate of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. The 23-year-old copped a backlash after she said: 'Indonesia has these rules and if you break them these are the consequences'. But on Friday Campbell hit back at her detractors, saying 'I'm receiving more support than hate' and clarifying that she personally does not agree with the death penalty. Scroll down for video . 'That's the law': Appearing on Channel Nine's Today show on Thursday, model Jesinta Campbell was asked about her views on the imminent executions of Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . The 23-year-old defended comments she made about the imminent executions of the Bali Nine duo . On Thursday's The Grill segment, the model and TV presenter said the laws in Indonesia regarding drugs are widely known. 'It's so sad. I mean, watching all the footage play out on the news... it breaks your heart because you can't help but feel for their families and they are two humans at the end of the day,' she said. 'But, like a lot of Australians believe, at the end of the day unfortunately, Indonesia has these rules and if you break them these are the consequences. 'It's so sad, I do not agree with the death penalty, but that's their law.' Some viewers criticised her stance and accused her of supporting more extreme execution methods. 'So I guess you agree with all other atrocities committed by authority figures because ""It's the law""? Stoning ok too?' Chandy Shah asked Campbell on Twitter. Jestina hit back by saying: 'I was asked to share my opinion on this 1 particular case. I wasn't asked about stoning don't try to parcel it all together.' Cambell replied to another Twitter user saying: 'I said nothing abt respecting their laws or that I agreed with them. In fact I said I don't stand for the death penalty.' Campbell hit back at her detractors, saying 'I'm receiving more support than hate' On Thursday's The Grill segment, the model and TV presenter said the laws in Indonesia regarding drugs are widely known . The 23-year-old copped a backlash after she said: 'Indonesia has these rules and if you break them these are the consequences' Jesinta is a regular on Today, offering her opinions on everything from serious current affairs to light-hearted topics. The likely area on Death Island where Chan and Sukumaran will take their final breaths is called, Nirbaya. Found in the island's remote centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons. On Wednesday, Black Sabbath rocker, Tony Iommi, wrote a letter to Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair. The lead guitarist wrote a letter to President Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair. 'I appeal to you, as a forgiving man, to take note of their transformation,' Tony Iommi wrote in a letter to President Joko Widodo about the two Australian drug smugglers on death row. 'They are now reformed men who are making a positive difference to the lives of their fellow prisoners. 'For this reason, I would ask that you stop the execution of Andrew and Myuran. 'Please allow them to serve out life sentences where they contribute to the well-being of Indonesia and make good for the error of their previous ways.' Controversial topic: Chan and Sukumaran have since been moved from Kerobokan Prison after 10 years on death row, to Nusakambangan, or 'Death Island', where they will be executed by firing squad . Making the journey: The likely area on Death Island where Chan and Sukumaran will take their final breaths is called, Nirbaya . This comes as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop used parliament to directly plead with the Indonesian president. Ms Bishop told parliament on Wednesday that Indonesian authorities were preparing for the execution of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. 'On behalf of the parliament, I respectfully ask of the Indonesian president that he spare the lives of these two Australian citizens,' Ms Bishop said. She said she had spoken with the two families on Wednesday morning. 'As you can imagine they are devastated but they are just living day by day,' she said. A plea for clemency was rejected in January but since then the government has been seeking a permanent stay of execution. Ms Bishop said there were grounds for clemency and the government believed there were still legal avenues open to the pair. 'The grounds are that both men have shown immense remorse for their grave crimes and... have undergone an extraordinary rehabilitation'. Social justice: On Wednesday, Black Sabbath rocker, Tony Iommi, wrote a letter to Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo to ask for clemency for the Australian pair . In the Senate, Attorney-General George Brandis said the government had made at least 22 representations to Indonesian officials since January in a bid to save the two men. That included letters and phone calls from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Ms Bishop and the Australian Federal Police. ASIO chief Duncan Lewis and Attorney-General Department secretary Chris Moraitis had also been sent to Indonesia to plead for the pair. However the Indonesian ambassador has defended his government in a letter responding to a Senate attempt to save the Bali Nine duo. Nadjib Riphat Kesoema said the decision not to pardon the pair was very difficult for President Joko Widodo on both a personal and humanitarian level. However, the drug problem had 'blossomed into a national emergency' and required strong law enforcement. 'Most tragically, drugs and their traffickers and producers have denied too many people including children of their right to life,' he wrote. Mr Kesoema said both cases had been granted due process of law and all legal avenues had been pursued. He defended the court's decision to impose the death penalty and said separation of powers meant the government could not meddle in judicial processes. The upper house had argued the sentences should be commuted to a prison term due to the pair's genuine remorse and rehabilitation. Chan and Sukumaran were transferred to Nusakambangan island on Wednesday to await their execution.","Jesinta Campbell spoke about the imminent executions of Bali Nine duo .

"Decades ago I found myself working with a young woman with autism. I had done my reading of the autism texts of the time, and was singularly surprised when nothing I had read matched up to the person I was sat next to. There was no flapping, she had no interest in my earrings or buttons, and she certainly wasn't even lining anything up. We know so much more about autism now but the idea that all people with autism are disordered, impaired, or somehow 'lesser' is one that still needs to be challenged. Scroll down for video . People with autism (such as the rock singer Courtney Love) are often unfairly stigmatised, says Luke Beardon, a senior lecturer in autism, who has studied the subject for more than two decades . Having worked closely with people with autism for more than 20 years, I have had the pleasure of meeting many hugely intelligent, insightful, kind, caring, loyal, skilled autistic individuals. This includes two of my best doctoral students who both graduated successfully and are now prominent in their respective fields. Some of the strongest marriages I have encountered are between people with autism, and I have also met multi-millionaire entrepreneurs who have been identified as autistic. WHY IS THERE SUCH A STIGMA SURROUNDING AUTISM? So, the question remains, why is it that autism continues to be seen as a disorder, with terms such as 'impaired functioning' still so rife within the literature and current diagnostic manuals? Why is it that one needs to present as a 'problem' before being in a position to be identified as autistic? Even the term 'diagnosis' brings along its own associations with 'illness' or 'disease'. Surely, this gives out the wrong message to all involved – parents, individuals, and the public. For years, I have been suggesting 'identification' as a more appropriate term, which counters the pejorative language so often heard in reference to autism. Without doubt being autistic in a world populated in the main by people who are not can cause huge issues for the individual and their family. But this is not the same as suggesting that the problems are caused by being autistic. The very fact that there are plenty of autistic individuals who are hugely successful demonstrates that being autistic does not preclude anything at all. Actors Dan Ackroyd and Daryl Hannah, and singer Courtney Love are to name but a few, while others have retrospectively identified other potential big names such as Stanley Kubrick. THE CURSE OF BAD PROGNOSES . Some research has shown poor outcomes for people with autism but there have been fewer evaluations using real-world measures such as employability, self-sufficiency and social support. Some of the ways we measure ability may also be problematic – take memory and learning, for example. The task support hypothesis – the idea that situations can be created for individuals with autism that capitalise on their areas of strength – can lead to situations where the ability to remember is increased. James Durbin, who finished fourth on the tenth season of American Idol, was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome shortly after his father died, when he was nine. The actress Daryl Hannah (right) has autism . The sad fact is that there are still schools of thought that deny the fact that people with autism can lead very successful lives. Comments such as 'she will never be able to have children', or 'he will never go to university' are still way too prevalent. Parents of newly identified children are still sometimes told what the future will hold, despite the fact that no one has a crystal ball. Perhaps many of the problems stem from being in a poorly understood minority group, rather than directly from being autistic? MOVING FORWARD . Nonetheless, things are changing for the better, however slowly. The National Autistic Society, for example, promotes employment for people with autism. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is working to ensure a level playing field in the workplace, although there is some way to go before this is fully realised. 'Some of the strongest marriages I have encountered are between people with autism, and I have also met multi-millionaire entrepreneurs who have been identified as autistic,' says Dr Beardon . At the Autism Centre at Sheffield Hallam University we've been working to further these initial advances; to continue to promote a more accepting view of autism and to encourage society to recognise the potential of autistic individuals. One of the courses we run in collaboration with the National Autistic Society has welcomed a plethora of autistic speakers, guest lecturers and autistic students who share insight and expertise. So, have perceptions changed over the years? Well, for absolute certainty I can say that mine have. I no longer assume that all publications are correct, and recognise that all autistic people are individuals. I have learnt to challenge the notion of impairment and disorder, while still recognising the huge challenges faced by individuals and families. I have begun to recognise the damage that can be done by ignorance and misinformation. And I have learnt that changing perceptions through a better understanding of autism can significantly improve lives, and the best way to develop an understanding of autism is to listen to those who are autistic, their families and friends. In terms of general perception – well, society is certainly moving slowly in the right direction, with more and more autistic people self-advocating and promoting their strengths, but there is an awful long way to go.

"A millionaire accused of making child pornography with two teenage girls has said that he thought the alleged victims were of-age women who worked at a strip club. Burton Gersh, 69, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, is accused of producing hundreds of sexually explicit photos of two girls, aged 16 and 17, in his lavish mansion beginning in 2010. He asked a federal judge to allow a 'mistake-of-age defense' in his pending trial in which he faces pornography charges. Burton Gersh (pictured above) is accused of producing hundreds of sexually explicit photos of two girls, aged 16 and 17, in his lavish mansion beginning in the fall of 2010 with accomplice Les Sidweber . The former seafood wholesaler also requested in a motion filed in federal court that jurors know the girls engaged in prostitution, according to USA Today. A federal prosecutor is reportedly fighting both requests. 'The alleged victims appeared to be over the age of 18 and both were strippers in a club in Philadelphia, presumably fooling a legitimate business about their age,' the motion from Gersh's attorney, Michael Engle, said. The motion adds that Gersh 'may not have reasonably been able to ascertain the alleged victims' ages because of their misrepresentations, physical appearance and stated occupation'. 'At least one' of the girls was given a release form to sign before the photo school, the motion said. Signing the motion would indicate 'that she was 18 years of age or older'. Gersh and his accomplice, photographer Les Sidweber, 73, were arrested and have been in federal custody since November 3. Their trial is set for May 19. One of the girls was allegedly approached while walking out of her school in her school uniform and encouraged to go to one of the defendant's houses for a modeling shoot. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Louis Lappen told CBS Philadelphia in November. One of the victims said that she was approached while walking out of school in her school uniform and encouraged to go to one of the defendant's houses for a modeling shoot. Illicit pictures show characteristics of Gersh's home, pictured above, investigators said . The criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court claims that Gersh and Sidweber paid for the two Pennsylvania girls to come to their homes, strip naked and perform sex acts on one another and on Gersh. 'Once these men earned the trust of these victims, they exploited them on multiple occasions,' Lappen said. The illicit pictures show identifiable characteristics of Gersh's home, including one with a backyard gazebo that featured a sign 'Welcome to the Gershs', investigators told CBS Philadelphia. The defense claims that knowledge of the ages of the girls is crucial if Gersh is found guilty of 'purposefully' producing the child porgography. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan, however, said the mistake-of-age defense should not be taken into account. 'Knowledge that the victim was under the age of 18 is not an element of the crime,' Morgan said in a motion. She also said that allowing testimony on the victims' sexual experiences would be irrelevant and 'can only be used to cast aspersions on the character of the victims'. Gersh and Sidweber face 15 years in prison if convicted.","Burton Gersh, 69, and accomplice, photographer Les Sidweber, 73, were arrested in November on pornography charges dating back to fall 2010 .

"Boris Johnson has revealed the eccentric life of his grandmother, who turned her back on high society to live without electricity or running water and cook in a cow shed. The Mayor of London spoke with pride of his resilient judo-loving gran, who spent years in the depths of Exmoor National Park in Devon. His paternal grandmother Irene, who was also known as Buster, shunned the glamour of London to move to the countryside with her husband to start a simple life. Boris Johnson has revealed the eccentric life of his grandmother Irene (pictured with her dogs), who turned her back on high society to live without electricity or running water and cook in a cow shed . Close family: The Mayor of London spoke with pride of his late grandmother in a foreword for her book . Boris Johnson's family pictured in the garden of their Exmoor home in 1960's. From left Johnny, Birdie, Stanley, Buster and Peter with Hilary in the front . Mrs Johnson and her husband Johnny swapped a blissful life of domestic servants and bridge parties for a remote existence at a farm, West Nethercote. Boris, writing a foreword in a book about his grandmother's life, said Mrs Johnson cooked in cheap pots in a kitchen which used to be a cow shed - but still served him dishes which have stayed with him all his life. She wrote the book before her death in 1987, but it is only being published now. The Mayor of London wrote: 'She had no collection of fancy saucepans, no Sabatier knives - and yet she produced dishes whose tastes and smells I can remember today, almost half a century later, with Proust-like rapture. 'I am not sure that she was ever really taught to cook. She was born in the Pavillon du Barry at Versailles; she went to Cheltenham Ladies College; she read Russian and got half a blue for judo at Oxford. 'No, I don't think cooking featured much on her early curriculum. It would be fair to say that her kitchen - a converted cow-byre - was not exactly a chef's paradise. 'When the concrete floor needed cleaning, Granny would get a handful of wet tea leaves, hurl them into the dusty corners, and sweep up the gloop with a broom.' Mrs Johnson wrote the book before her death in 1987. It is called Alas Poor Johnny, after her husband Johnny (pictured) Johnny - a warm and friendly man - is said to have had a strong influence on Boris' unique sense of humour . Boris, who is running to become an MP in the upcoming General Election, reveals some of his earliest memories of life on the Exmoor plains with his beloved grandmother, who lived in the West Country until her death. The book, Alas Poor Johnny, is named after Buster's husband Johnny - a warm and friendly man said to have influenced Boris' unique sense of humour. A spokesman for publishers Troubador said: 'In 1951, Buster Johnson moved from Surrey to Exmoor with her husband Johnny, four children, two dogs and a van load of pigs and poultry. 'Alas Poor Johnny, written some 10 years later, is her account of their life there, and of farming on Exmoor in the fifties, told with a strong sense of drama and of the absurd. 'Above all, her life is filled by the animals, taking the place of absent friends in her affections. 'There's also a small but strong supporting cast, including busybody Mrs Stevens at the next door farm; Arthur the ex-cowman who moves with them from Surrey; SRN Tommie, the butt of an aggressive ram - and Alby the rabbit catcher, who plays the mouth organ and thrills the children.' The first half of the book details Buster's move from the gentility of the home counties to the wilds of Exmoor. The book details Mrs Johnson's move from the gentility of the home counties to the wilds of Exmoor (pictured) Johnny had become tired of life in his grandson's beloved capital city and, having served as a Coastal Commander pilot at Braunton in Devon, had fallen in love with the mysterious hills that rise from the North Devon shoreline. Far from their idyllic life in Surrey, Exmoor provided no electricity, no running water and no indoor toilet. In a postscript for the book, Boris' aunt Birdie, who decided to publish her mother's book, said: 'As my mother hoped, over the years Nethercote has remained a constant in the lives of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, wherever we are. 'It is a place which, for those who have spent time there, becomes ingrained in our DNA. It may sometimes, as she experienced, be hard to live there; but it is always hard to leave.' Alas Poor Johnny is available as both a paperback (£7.99) and as an ebook.","Boris Johnson's grandmother moved to the countryside to live a simple life .

"It is a pioneer of 'affordable luxury'. But the expected price tag on one of Apple's new Watches is far from wallet-friendly. At $10,000, the 18-carat gold, sapphire and crystal Apple Watch Edition being launched on Monday would be the firm's most expensive product since the $10,000 Lisa computer in 1983, developed by Steve Jobs, which was poorly received. It is the first new innovation to come from Apple since Jobs died in 2011, and will be unveiled by chief executive Tim Cook on Monday.

Wearables: Analysts say the shift into wearables will be a major breakthrough for the firm targeting China . In October, a prototype of the Edition Watch even appeared at Paris Fashion Week. However, some have speculated that without a solid grounding in the high-end retail market, the Apple Edition Watch could suffer the same flaws as most iPhones, which cease to efficiently function after a few years. But according to Thomaï Serdari, Luxury Brand Strategist and Lecturer at Sotheby’s Institute of Art in New York, the details of the Edition model that have been released look promising. She told DailyMail.com: 'Apple produces good design, and I hate to say it but good design is priceless. 'From what I have seen, the gold watch has a very elegant profile. The very slight curve shows that the design has been very well studied to fit on your wrist. I am curious to see how it actually feels. 'I wouldn't be surprised if customers have the option of keeping the strap and the casing but updating the software, which would create loyalty and longevity.' Serdari, who also lectures on product and fashion design at NYU, notes that Apple is following the classic launch strategy of designer brands like Chanel, which uses pricing to carve a position in the market. 'Chanel targets a broad market and in order to maintain the air of luxury increases the prices often very steeply. Shoe-in: Apple poached Burberry's CEO Angela Ahrendts to help make a play for the fashion world . Fashionable: Yves Saint Laurent's Paul Deneve (left) and designer Mark Newson (right) also worked on it . 'If the watch is $10,000, it would be a great way for Apple to differentiate itself from the gadget-based market, which is highly competitive. 'In my opinion, Apple is very well positioned to make the transition to move up.' If successful, the Edition Watch could act as a springboard for Apple to rocket into its bulls-eye: China. Tim Cook has repeatedly remarked that he predicts China to eventually overtake America as their biggest market. The popularity of the iPhone 6 drove the firm's market share in China to a record high, reaching 25.4 per cent by January 2015 - clouding out Samsung as the country's second-largest seller. However, Xiaomi - widely dubbed 'the Apple of China' - remains firm with 27.6 per cent of the market. Venturing into watches and potentially other wearables, with Ahrendts at the helm, could be the leap that clinches it. Dawson said: 'They could really move into anything - necklaces, bracelets, brooches... It's not clear how those might feature a screen to function in the way that a watch does. But Apple is certainly in a position to try.'","Apple Watch Edition is set to be priced at $10,000 on Monday's launch .

"An Oscar-nominated film will still be released in the UK today despite its disturbing similarities to the Alps air disaster - to the disgust of cinema-goers near to the home of one of the three British victims. Argentinian film Wild Tales features a mass killer who locks himself in the cockpit of a passenger jet and crashes it in to the ground to murder everyone on board. In terrifying scenes the fictional passengers panic and one tries to smash his way through a door to get to the controls in chillingly similar circumstances to the ill-fated Germanwings Airbus A320 flight. The fictional killer invites his enemies on to the flight, including a lover who jilted him and a colleague who was hard on him at work, so he can kill them. Despite protests the highly-acclaimed movie will be shown in British cinemas from today, however, it was released in Spain and Germany last year although it is not known if Andreas Lubitz had seen it. Similarities: Fans have raised questions over the release of Argentinian film Wild Tales, which features a mass killer who crashes a plane, centre, into the ground . Terror: One of the passengers tries to smash his way through the plane's cockpit door after it was locked from the inside - just like what prosecutors believe Andreas Lubitz had done . Terror: The passengers, which includes the killer's former girlfriend and boss, panic as they realise the plane is going down . On Tuesday he locked the captain out of the Airbus A320's cockpit  before setting the airliner's controls to descend into a rocky valley, obliterating the plane and killing all 150  on board. Reports in Germany this morning suggest the locked-out pilot may have resorted to using an axe in a desperate bid to get through the armoured door as the plane hurtled towards the ground. Prosecutors said the screams of passengers aware of their fate could be heard in the final seconds. Lubitz was said to have been depressed for years, which he may have kept secret from his employers, and may have had a breakdown before crashing his plane from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. Movie fans say what happened  with the Germanwings plane has terrifying similarities with the Wild Tales movie, and have asked whether it should be pulled off the big screen. It is a set of six short stories, meant to be black comedies, but the first 15-minute section where a pilot crashes a plane to kill everyone on board has taken on a new meaning. In it two passengers on board chat and discover they know a man named Pasternak - a woman who used to be his lover and a former colleague who was tough on him at work. Release: The film's distributor in Britain has said that it will not be delayed or banned despite the Alps disaster . It then emerges that everyone on the flight is connected to him and the trapped passengers then try to break in to the cockpit as the plane hurtles downwards. Pasternak crashes the plane into his parents' house, to kill them, himself and everyone on board. Twitter users had noted the similarities between the film, and the horrific events of Tuesday. Sarp Yelkencioğlu ‏wrote: 'The similarities between the #GermanWings crash & the scene in Damian Szifron's movie, 'Wild Tales' is mind boggling!' Andrea Newell tweeted: 'An awful morbid coincidence...the first story of the film 'Wild Tales' and the Germanwings aircraft crash. So sad'. Steve Summers ‏wrote: 'I wonder if the Oscar nominated 'Wild Tales' will be pulled from UK cinemas given the sad unfolding events in the #Germanwings tragedy'. But it was cinema-goers in Birmingham - only half an hour away from Wolverhampton, where Martyn Matthews, one of the three British victims, lived with his family - who were left disgusted with the decision to go ahead with the release. Slipped through the net: Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had suffered from depression and ‘burnout’ which had held up his career . Search: Teams working in the difficult Alpine terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings . Receptionist Josie Callow, 28, from Birmingham, said: 'You would think there would be common sense and they could delay it for the sake of the families and people affected by the shock of such a tragic accident. 'But they probably care about making money from the release and people would have already booked to see it so that is much more important to people than bereaved family's feelings.' Her words were echoed by Abdul Rajid, 33, a cleaner from Smethwick, West Midlands. 'I heard about it and think it is disgusting if anyone goes to see it after the crash,' he told MailOnline. 'The fact that it mirrors it so closely means they surely should have waited just a little bit before releasing it here because even though it isn't on purpose, it is going to get criticised for not being sensitive at all.' Retired teacher Jeff Baxter, 67, from Birmingham, added: 'To release it in the UK so close to the incident when a few people from this country died is very insensitive. 'Surely they could have delayed it for a few days or even weeks and then no-one would have noticed?' But student Thomas Harris, 23, who is originally from Surrey, was more cynical. 'Maybe they haven't changed the release date because the publicity helps, they say there is no such thing as bad press,' he said. 'But I do think it is very distasteful, especially to the families involved, it isn't something you want to be seeing advertised at such a horrible time personally.' But distributor Artificial Eye told MailOnline it will still be shown in a number of cinemas across Britain from today. It is already out in the United States.","Film fans raise chilling similarity between Wild Tales and Alps disaster .

"The air passengers of the future will be able to see the sights of the world without even stepping off the plane. Airbus has filed for a US Patent for a new smart aircraft which is set to revolutionise the travel industry, with sweeping windows and interactive glass so passengers can learn about the sights they see below. The patent, filed on March 19, features touchscreen windows for passengers so they can tap key attractions as they fly overhead and find out what they are. Scroll down for video . Airbus have filed for a patent for interactive windows, so guests can select landmarks, such as the London Eye, and learn more about how it built . Airbus hope their plans with provide a 'method for interactive visualization of information in an aircraft cabin' According to Skift, The high-tech windows are described as  a 'method for interactive visualization of information in an aircraft cabin.' The vision is to create an aircraft with plenty of light and opportunity for enjoying the skies. Images released by Airbus show the planes will be kitted out with seemingly transparent walls, which will in turn be fitted with touchscreen technology. Passengers will have plenty of room to stretch out while enjoying the views, with chairs that allow for greater recline and leg space. Great view! Find out exactly what you are looking at, as you soar over cities on your travels . Plans include increased space, and window sizes for passengers to enjoy their flight . The patent comes after Airbus shared plans for a concept plane with panoramic windows stretching up onto the roof of the aircraft. The concept cabin would be a bionic structure that 'mimics' the efficiency of bird bone, claim Airbus. It would provide strength where needed, and also allows for an 'intelligent' cabin wall membrane which controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers open, panoramic views. The plane of the future would also replace first, business and economy cabins with zones for relaxation in the front, work in the back, and a fully-stocked bar for socialising. And the aircraft's walls would change according to light conditions, with holographic pop-up gaming displays and in-flight entertainment powered by the heat of passengers' bodies.

"It seemed like the ultimate feel-good story, a health fanatic who managed to ward off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis simply through eating well and using a natural and holistic approach to life. Australian blogger Belle Gibson shot to stardom on social media and gave hope to cancer sufferers worldwide after she revealed that she had prolonged her life despite shunning conventional medical treatment and relying on her own 'whole life' concept. Now, however, friends close to the mum-of-one have said that she may have fled overseas to avoid confronting claims that her remarkable cancer survival story is not all it seems. Scroll down for video . Doubts cast: Belle Gibson, 26, is the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry recipe and health app. Questions are now being asked about whether she has 'misled' followers over both charity donations and her health . Huge hit: The Whole Pantry app and cookbook, which Ms Gibson claimed helped her in her fight against terminal cancer has proved a success with 300,000 apps downloaded . With a huge following online, Melbourne-based Gibson, 26, last year launched 'The Whole Pantry', a healthy eating app and book inspired by the recipes and regime that the health guru claimed she followed. Doubts over Ms Gibson's cancer survival story surfaced after it was revealed she failed to donate up to £151,000 in profits from the  health and lifestyle app to charity. The blogger has also admitted that she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. Friends say information surrounding Ms Gibson's original diagnosis has mysteriously begun to be 'erased' in recent days but previously her story has been well documented. She has stated that her health problems began when she was 20, when she experienced problems with her sight, memory and walking. A stroke followed and Ms Gibson was told that she had 'malignant brain cancer' with just four months to live. Two months into a gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy routine, Ms Gibson said one specific incident prompted a treatment 'epiphany'. After passing out in the grounds of a Melbourne hospital, she claims she awoke determined that she would attack the disease without the help of conventional medicine. Against the advice of doctors, Ms Gibson said she turned to alternative treatments including  herbalism, craniosacral therapy and meditation. In addition to her vegetarian diet, she also gave up eating dairy, gluten, refined sugars, GMO foods and preservatives. She says that doctors advised her that she may never have children but her son, Oliver, known as Ollie, was born in 2010. A miscarriage at five months during her second pregnancy in 2012 prompted her to share her story online. Friends say Ms Gibson, who enjoys international travel and designer clothes, may now have fled to the US amid claims she hasn't been entirely honest . Using the Twitter handle @Healing_Belle, she quickly amassed followers from across the globe and launched her glossy cookbook and healthy eating app in 2014. At the time, she had, she said, been 'stable for two years now with no growth of the cancer'. The Whole Pantry app, which costs £2.39, has been downloaded over 300,000 times and proved so popular that she was flown out to Silicon Valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the new Apple Watch. In July 2014, the blogger then broke the news via Instagram, on which she has 200,000 followers,  that the cancer had returned, saying: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer.' Around 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up her initial post, revealing she was undergoing 'German integrative oncology protocol'. The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges £2.29 for the app . Ms Gibson's success might have continued unabated were it not for doubts raised about significant amounts of money raised through sales of the app that were destined for charity. The health guru has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business' profits were being donated, last year claiming that £151,000 had been raised. It was revealed on Monday, however, that Ms Gibson had failed to donate that sum. In a post to their Facebook page, the Whole Pantry clarified they were a 'for-profit' company and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry. 'We have, like all start ups, struggled with managing all facets of a new business, biting off more than we could chew, juggling internal and external priorities with little staff. 'We have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external Business Manager and Accounts team, an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses. 'They have been working over our finances for the last five months, and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight. We were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward,' the post read in part. Only £3,500 has actually reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated. There were also revelations that neither the business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises, a situation that could lead to huge fines and potential jail time. Ms Gibson also this week admitted that she may have been  'wrong' about the extent of her terminal cancer. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong... (I felt) confused, bordering on humiliated', Ms Gibson told The Australian. She revealed a medical team from Germany had examined her using 'magnetic' therapy and believes this investigation led to her misdiagnosis, although she declined to name the medical team. However, since then friends have come forward saying they had long held suspicions about holes in Ms Gibson's story for a long time, and revealed that whenever they tried to raise it with her they were shut down. 'I was told last night that she booked a business class Flight to the US and that’s why she hasn't been responding. She’s been on a plane for the last 20 hours,' a friend, who did not wish to be named, told the Daily Mail Australia. Silicon Valley hit: Ms Gibson has also released a cookbook version of the creations that appear in the app following the success her online ventures . Missing money: There have been revelations that The Whole Pantry business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises . The same friend, a fellow social media personality with a large online following, said she first met Ms Gibson at a gala in early 2014 and the pair clicked. But they had held suspicions in recent months, like many in the same friendship group, that the young entrepreneur may have been dishonest with them. 'She claims that she was having treatment (chemotherapy) when she was pregnant with Ollie but no doctor would treat someone like that when they were pregnant,' the friend said. As soon as articles began to surface this week casting doubt on Ms Gibson's story, it has been suggested that thousands of photos and social media posts which directly referenced her cancer have been deleted. Friends have now said they had trouble reconciling her stories, and that Ms Gibson was cagey when they offered help or asked about her medical conditions. 'It doesn't make sense, no doctor would let you travel the world and she just goes away at the drop of a hat', the same friend revealed. 'All she wears is designer clothes and travels the world which doesn't make sense for someone who should be setting up life for their child before they die.' 'There’s people that have invested their money and time…a lot of people I know have held fundraisers and supported her.' High profile on cancer: Ms Gibson has appeared across a number of networks (pictured on Sunrise in Australia) speaking about her approach to healing . Success: Last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new Apple Watch after it was downloaded 300,000 times . Failure: Apparently only £3,500 of a projected £151,000 has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated . Another woman who almost entered into business with Ms Gibson said she was particularly devastated when Ms Gibson announced she was riddled with cancer mid-last year on social media, before telling her closest friends. 'That is exactly when we had our main falling out, she said I wasn't being supportive and I said she hadn't told me personally,' the entrepreneur told Daily Mail Australia. This friend, who was very close to Ms Gibson, said the young mum was standoffish when she offered to visit medical appointments with her for support. 'She’d always just change the topic and wouldn't let you broach the topic.' The same friend claims Ms Gibson was dishonest about her age, and her illnesses, and even cast doubt on whether she ever had cancer at all. She also confirmed that it was her understanding Ms Gibson had 'fled' to The States. These revelations come amid reports by the Herald Sun that police visited Ms Gibson's home in Elwood, Melbourne overnight. The woman's partner apparently let officers into the property, and that Ms Gibson was not there at the time. Penguin, the publisher of Ms Gibson's book which was launched off the back of her app's success said they did not see it necessary to seek confirmation on the entrepreneur's medical history or age during their dealings with her. 'Penguin did not seek or receive documentary evidence of Belle's medical condition or birth date prior to publication,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'We did not feel this was necessary as The Whole Pantry is a collection of food recipes, which Penguin has published in good faith. 'We are concerned about the questions raised in recent days - we'll discuss them with Belle as ultimately only she can answer the questions,' the spokesperson added.","Belle Gibson, 26, has  huge online following and started The Whole Pantry, a health and recipe app, which features on Apple's new Watch .

"MP for North West Leicestershire Andrew Bridgen . Teachers should be forced to sit A-level exams along with their pupils, an MP has suggested. Andrew Bridgen wants the Conservative Party to put the proposal in its manifesto and has discussed the issue with Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. Teaching unions have previously cautioned against the move, but Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said the change was a logical way to drive-up educational standards. He said: 'My idea would be to have the teacher sit the exam themselves, along with the students. 'After all, how can they be expected to pass on their knowledge to students to allow them to succeed in the exam, if they themselves could not? 'This would help improve teaching standards because if a teacher did poorly, this could be looked into and their skills improved upon.' His comments came as it emerged that Michael Gove still plays a leading role in shaping the Government's education policy, according to the Schools Minister. David Laws said the Conservative Chief Whip, who was moved from the Department of Education in last summer's cabinet reshuffle, joins Number 10 and the Treasury in dictating policy rather than education secretary Nicky Morgan. Ms Morgan has previously denied reports Mr Gove was 'back seat driving' as 'nonsense' but Mr Laws, her Liberal Democrat deputy, appeared to undermine her picture of a united front. He told the Independent: 'While Nicky Morgan's instincts are moderate, the people who control education policy in the Conservative Party are still Michael Gove, David Cameron and George Osborne. The Tory MP thinks teachers should sit the exams alongside their pupils to improve standards (file picture) 'The face and language may have changed but the Tory policies haven't.' Last month the Labour Party said that headteachers would receive business and leadership coaching under plans aimed at raising standards and improving management of multi-million pound school budgets. Morgan claimed recently that teachers are ‘working far too hard, for far too long’ and has promised to slash their workload. The Education Secretary lined up with Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg to propose ways to lighten the burden on school staff. This includes not making alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in ‘exceptional circumstances’.","MP mooted plans with Education Secretary and wants details in manifesto .

"A family butcher in the Scottish borders has come up with a new way to eat Creme Eggs - inside a Scotch egg. Greig Foston and Benjamin Webb say their snack contains 1,000 calories - and is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli-flavoured pork. Foston's Fine Meats in the village of Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland, is now even planning to sell mini egg sausages to add to shop's Easter offering. Foston's Fine Meats has created an unusual offering for Easter; their deluxe Creme Egg Scotch egg . Butcher Greig Foston has outdone the battered Mars Bar by creating the 1,000 calorie egg . And for for just £1.85 you too could could enjoy the  Cadbury's Creme Egg surrounded by chilli flavoured sausage meat and covered in breadcrumbs. Butcher Greig Foston explained: 'We always try to think up something new and exciting for the time of year - we try to get our thinking caps on.' The 36-year-old continued: 'We came up with the sweet chilli in the sausage meat and the egg in the middle.' Asked what people think of his latest culinary creation Mr Foston said:'It's pretty spilt.' However locals seem keen to try something new. 'We made up a batch at the weekend,' he said, 'just to see what demand was like, and it sold out pretty quickly.' He said around 75 per cent of the school children who come to the shop gave it the thumbs-up. Butcher Greig Foston who has created a deluxe 'creme egg scotch egg' for Easter at Fostons Fine Meats pictured with co-creator Benjamin Webb and colleague Ruth McIntosh. The egg is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli-flavoured pork . But the madcap meat-sellers are not resting on their laurels, and are working on a smaller version using a Mini Egg. Mr Foston said: 'We've got another idea - Mini Egg sausages. Pork sausage with whole Mini Eggs - the little ones coated in sugar. 'That would work well, I think, with plain sausage meat, and letting the chocolate melt inside the sugar casings of the egg,' he continued. He said a cracked black pepper and strawberry sausage produced to mark Wimbledon was also a great success. If you don't have the time to make chocolate from scratch, you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs. Once your chocolate is melted, it will need to be tempered. The cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along, just pop your chocolate into the freezer (no longer than 30 seconds). Place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it. Keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process. Stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature. Bittersweet/ dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28C-29C;  milk chocolate should reach 27C-28C; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26C-27C. Once the first batch has melted, add more chocolate to your bowl, stirring as you go along. As soon as the correct temperature is reached, start building your Easter egg layers. Spoon some chocolate into a mould (you can get them from Lakeland, Denny Craft Moulds or Party Delights) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould. You can make it as thick as you like, building each layer as the previous one cools. Once the final layer has been built, leave aside to cool and harden before decorating.","Bizarre snack is on offer at  Foston's Fine Meats in Duns, Berwickshire .

"All bets are off for Britons from the moment they check-in for a holiday as beach body diets go by the wayside in favour of calorific indulgence at the airport and on the plane. New research has revealed that Britons consume an average of 3,402 calories between their arrival at the airport and landing at their destination, well above the NHS's recommended daily intake. Britons overindulge more than holidaymakers from Spain, Italy, France and Germany, who were also polled, saying their holiday began long before their arrival at their chosen destination. Britons eat and drink an average of 3,402 calories at the airport and on the plane when they go on holiday . A Burger King at London Heathrow, one of more than 60 food outlets at the airport . The survey of 2,607 adults who had flown away for a holiday in the past 12 months shows the average Briton consumes between 900 and 1,400 more than health professionals say they should. The results, collated by UK flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk, showed that the average Briton will consume 1,963 calories during this brief period in food and an additional 1,439 calories in alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks - a total of 3,402. Asked whether they felt they were over-indulging at the airport and in flight, a resounding 79 per cent said 'yes', with 53 per cent of respondents saying they were 'getting into the holiday spirit' and 28 per cent saying they 'no longer needing to diet for the holiday'. Germans come closest to Brits for pre-and-during flight consumption with a total of 3,107 calories, followed by travellers from Spain (2,350 calories), Italy (2,311 calories) and French (1,269 calories). Escalators lead up to the cafes, restaurants and bars at London Gatwick airport, a facility where travellers like to 'get into the holiday spirit' 'These numbers are astonishing, particularly when you consider the average male should consume 2,500 calories per day and the average female just 2,000,' said  Jetcost.co.uk co-founder Antoine Michelat. 'Women are almost doubling their calorie intake within a matter of hours.' Despite reaching for high-calorie treats during this brief period of their trip, Brits often save their pennies at the airport and on budget carriers that sell food. About a third of those polled (34 per cent) said they brought their own food from home with 68 per cent saying price from their main motivation, 45 per cent just want to be prepared, 42 per cent were eager not to eat into their holiday budget and 17 per cent had dietary requirements. Sandwiches (37 per cent), crisps (31 per cent) and sweets/chocolates (25 per cent) were the most popular items taken to the airport by holiday makers, not the healthiest of options. While many choose to buy food on board, 34 per cent of Brits bring their own food from home . 'We'd never recommend that anyone consume this many calories per day, let alone within such a short period of time,' added Michelat. 'Yes, we all like to have a blow out every now and then, but eating this much in one go is very bad for your waistline! This can be damaging for your health in many ways, particularly with regards to weight gain and conditions caused by weight gain. 'If you find yourself getting too carried away with food and drink, why not prepare your own food at home and limit yourself to that? If you're on a plane, there's a good chance that you're heading off on your holidays and you're about to have a period of time where you're going to overindulge for the duration, but try to think of the long term effects.'","Brits consume an average of 3,402 calories between check-in and landing .

Choose wholegrain breakfast cereals, but not those coated with sugar or honey . Source: NHS Choices . A bowl of Bran Flakes plus a glass of orange juice will account for half your recommended daily amount of sugar. Our everyday diets are packed with ‘stealth’ sugar, sending our intake far above the recommended limits, which according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), should be no more than 12 teaspoons a day. Raisins are very sugary, as are flavoured fat-free yoghurts. And one tablespoon of ketchup can contain as much as one teaspoon of sugar. Some bottled juices and smoothies have as much as 47g of sugar, a lot to consume in just one sitting. Like ketchup, tomato-based pasta sauces and soups also have sugar added to them to balance out the acidity of tomatoes. While cereal and granola bars may have a reputation for being healthy, they too are usually much sweeter than they need to be. Sugar is also found in surprisingly large amounts in many savoury foods such as sauces and ready meals. In fact, sugar highly likely to be a much bigger part of your diet than you realise. Surprisingly, ‘healthier’ reduced-fat foods can actually contain more sugar than their full fat counterparts, as stripping out fats from processed foods makes them less appealing to our tastebuds. To combat the lack of flavour, manufacturers increase the levels of sugar in the food. In an investigation for MailOnline, nutritionist Angela Dowden said:' UK guidelines recommend that ‘added’ sugars — those used to sweeten food, fizzy drinks, honeys, syrups and fruit juices — shouldn’t make up more than 10 per cent of the total energy we get from food. 'This is around 50g of sugar a day, equivalent to ten cubes of sugar for adults and older children, and nine for five to ten-year-olds. Think you're having a healthy breakfast? Think again. Even bran flakes contain stealth sugars (Picture posed by model) Tomato based sauces such as Dolmio (left) and tomato ketchup (right) have added sugars to balance acidity . But when even a 'healthy salad contains two cubes of sugar, are we fighting a losing battle? 'Remember, we’re talking about sugar added as a sweetener,' she continued. 'The sugars in milk, vegetables and pieces of fruit (as opposed to fruit juice), including dried fruit, do not wreak as much havoc.' A report by WHO revealed the current average intake of free sugars in North and Central America is 95g a day (19 teaspoons) rising to 130g (26 teaspoons) a day in South America. There are 3.5 cubes of sugar in Tropicana's smooth orange juice (left) and half a cube in Naked's Green Machine juice (right) Muller Light Strawberry yogurt (left) contains 2.5 cubes of sugar whilst a box of raisins contains two (right) Meanwhile, in Western Europe the average is 101g (20 teaspoons), Dr Francesco Branca, director of the WHO's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, said. In Europe, the energy intake from sugar ranges from around seven to eight per cent in Hungary and Norway to 16 to 17 per cent in countries like Spain and the UK. 'The two most common forms of unhealthy added sugars are table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup, a liquid sweetener made from maize.' 'Both are added to countless foods, turning up in everything from fizzy drinks to chicken korma,' Ms Dowden said. Jordans Frusli Bar, Bluberry - Two cubes . Along with the undisputed benefits of wholegrains, you get 2tsp of sugar. Some comes from the fruits and some is added to boost taste. Volvic touch of fruit lemon and lime (1.5l) - 16.5 cubes . This flavoured water may look healthy, but the high sugar content makes it equivalent to sugary pop. Tesco Chicken korma and pilau rice (550g) - Three cubes . Sweeter, creamier sauces contain added sugar, and often in quite high quantities. Naked Juices Green Machine (150ml) - Half a cube . While the sugars in this green juice from fruits, one cube of sugar (53g) is a 150ml bottle is still a lot of is still a lot to consume. There’s more sugar here than there is in a regular bag of Skittles (46g) Innocent Mangoes and Passion Fruits smoothie - Six cubes . Some of the fruit in smoothies is whole fruit that’s crushed, and so it still contains fibre. This isn’t as bad for you as pure juice, which counts as added sugar. One tablespoon ketchup - One cube . Sugar is added to ketchup to achieve that characteristic taste, though some comes from the tomatoes. BBQ Pringles (190g) – One and a half cubes . The sugar turns up in the BBQ ‘ flavour’, which is largely sugar. Apple – Two and a half cubes . Though apples contain a surprisingly high amount of sugar, it’s ‘good’ sugar, encased in fibre. Muller Light Strawberry - Two and a half cubes . Many low-fat foods contain high amounts of sugar to compensate for the lack of taste and texture. New Covent Garden Plum Tomato and Mascarpone Soup (600g) - Six cubes . Sugar is added to this soup, but much of it comes from the high concentration of tomatoes, which means it is classed as ‘good’ naturally occurring sugar. Waitrose Love Life Crayfish & Mango Salad - Two cubes . A reminder to watch out for sugar in salads — this one has a Thai dressing packed with sugar, plus some less damaging sugar in the mango. Sun-Maid Raisins – Two cubes . Not the unhealthier ‘bad’ sugar found in sweets, but it can quickly add up if you have anything more than the smallest serving. Dolmio Bolognese Original Sauce (500g jar) Six and a half cubes . Most tomato pasta sauces contain added sugars to boost the taste, though some will also occur naturally in the tomatoes. Tropicana Smooth Orange Juice (200ml) – Three and a half cubes . Though sugar in the whole fruit counts as ‘good’ sugar, juicing removes the fibre, so it is classified as the more harmful ‘added sugar’. Semi skimmed milk (200ml) – Two cubes . Milk sugar doesn’t count as the harmful added kind because it is released slowly in the body. Bran Flakes (30g with milk, 125ml) - Two and a half cubes . Bran Flakes are 22 per cent sugar, but here milk adds half a cube. One sugar cube equals one teaspoon of sugar.","World Health Organisation recommends no more than 12 teaspoons a day .

"The report into the decades of sexual abuse carried out by Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall at the BBC is due to be published in May. Dame Janet Smith's review has interviewed more than 475 witnesses and 'been in contact' with 775 as part of the investigation, which was established in October 2012. In a statement released today she said that a timeline for publication with the Corporation is being discussed and this is expected for the second half of May. A report into the campaign of sexual abuse carried out by Jimmy Savile (left) and Stuart Hall (right) while working at the BBC is due to be published in the 'second half of May' More than 100 witnesses have come forward with information about Hall, who was jailed for two and a half years last year, and 375 people have given evidence about Savile. The statement published online said: 'The review is discussing a timeline for delivery and arrangements for publication of the report with the BBC. 'Publication is currently expected in the second half of May 2015. As soon as a date for publication is known, a further update will be provided.' The latest update on the review's work says it has 'been in contact' with 775 people as part of the investigation. It said: 'The review has now finished taking evidence and it will not be accepting any new evidence.' It has been reported that the Dame Janet Smith review is expected to uncover hundreds of victims and reveal a culture of ignorance which 'protected' Savile. The review conducted by Dame Janet Smith (pictured) has interviewed more than 475 witnesses and 'been in contact' with 775 . Another report published last month said NHS hospitals had still not fully learned the lessons of the Savile sex abuse scandal and he was given 'endorsement from the very highest level of society'. The then-prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, had appointed him in an official fundraising role at Stoke Mandeville Hospital where he raped or assaulted at least 63 patients, staff and visitors. Savile was given open access to the Buckinghamshire hospital while volunteering as a porter from 1969. While tales of his behaviour were widespread by the early 1970s, senior staff were never told of his 'wicked' crimes -many of them against desperately ill children. Barrister Kate Lampard, whose review of Savile's offending across NHS institutions made a series of recommendations, said the access he was given offered him the 'opportunity to commit sexual abuses on a grand scale for nearly 50 years'. Hall, known for being the face of It's a Knockout, was convicted by  at Preston Crown Court of indecently assaulting a girl under the age of 16 and earlier pleading guilty to another indecent assault on the same girl when she was 13. He was already serving a 30-month jail term after he pleaded guilty in 2013 to indecently assaulting 13 other young girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period. Members of the review visited the court during Hall's trial and also visited the Shepherds Bush Empire Theatre, which was owned by the BBC, and Television Centre.","Dame Janet Smith's review into abuse is expected 'in second half of May'

"More pictures have emerged of Islamic State terrorists destroying sites of cultural significance, the latest showing Sufi shrines in Libya being levelled. The Tripoli arm of the group posted pictures of a convoy of pick-up trucks, followed by an image of a man attacking a shrine with a sledgehammer. Further pictures show the building being pushed over by a digger, the shrine having been reduced to a pile of rubble. More pictures have emerged of Islamic State terrorists destroying sites of cultural significance, the latest showing Sufi shrines in Libya being levelled . Mindless: Isis fanatics used a digger to level the shrine in Libya . The fanatics have caused outrage by destroying several ancient relics and sites in Iraq recently, as well as books and rare manuscripts . Isis posted pictures of the destruction in Libya on Twitter, explaining that the vandalism was carried out by its 'police' News of the destruction was tweeted by Conflict News, which posted the images with the message ‘#ISIS in Tripoli province posts photos of its ""police"" demolishing Sufi shrines’. The fanatics have caused outrage by destroying several ancient relics and sites in Iraq recently, as well as books and rare manuscripts. On Monday Iraq’s government began investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Khorsabad in northern Iraq had been attacked by the so-called Islamic State. Adel Shirshab, the country's tourism and antiquities minister, said there are concerns the militants had removed artefacts and blown up the site, located nine miles north-east of Mosul. The site before it was reduced to rubble by the extremists . The terrorists began by opening up a huge hole in the shrine . The image appears to show the 'police' en route to the shrine . Saeed Mamuzini, a Kurdish official from Mosul, said militants had already begun demolishing the Khorsabad site on Sunday, citing multiple witnesses. On Friday, the group razed 3,000-year-old Nimrud and on Saturday, they bulldozed 2,000-year old Hatra - both Unesco world heritage sites. UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has called the destruction a 'war crime'. A statement by his spokesman on Sunday night said Mr Ban was 'outraged by the continuing destruction of cultural heritage in Iraq' by ISIS. Khorsabad was constructed as a new capital of Assyria by King Sargon II shortly after he came to power in 721BC and abandoned after his death in 705BC. ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul using power drills and sledge hammers to destroy artefacts . It features a city wall with a stone foundation and seven gates. Since it was a single-era capital, few objects linked to Sargon II himself were found. However, the site is renowned for shedding light on Assyrian art and architecture. The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls are now displayed in museums in Baghdad, Paris, London and Chicago. ISIS currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Iraq's minister of tourism and antiquities said the government was investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Hatra in north west Iraq is being demolished by militants from the Islamic State group . Officials in the northern city of Mosul confirmed militants with the terror group have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. A file photo shows the temple to the Shamash sun god in Hatra . The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls at Khorsabad are now displayed in museums around the world including these Assyrian winged bulls now housed in the British Museum in London . Other statues of winged bulls from Khorsabad can be found in the Louvre museum in Paris . The Sunni extremist group has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. On Sunday, officials reported that the jihadists had begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. It comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. A video released last week also showed them smashing artefacts in the Mosul museum. In January, the group also burned hundreds of books from the Mosul library and Mosul University, including many rare manuscripts. At a press conference earlier yesterday, Mr Shirshab said they have called for an extraordinary session of the UN Security Council to address the crisis in Iraq. 'The world should bear the responsibility and put an end to the atrocities of the militants, otherwise I think the terrorist groups will continue with their violent acts,' he said.","Isis has posted pictures of its 'police' demolishing shrines in Libya .

"Don Woodland is a heartbroken man with a heartbreaking duty to perform – to help Stuart Diver bury his second wife – a man he considers ‘closer than a brother’. The retired Salvation Army chaplain forged an unbreakable bond with Stuart and his family in the days after his entrapment and rescue from under the Thredbo rubble, he told Daily Mail Australia that his good mate 'has a big hill to climb'. 'I have talked to him a few times on the phone (since Rosanna's death), he has another big hill to climb but Stuart is Stuart, he lives from one day to the next, that's just him and that's he copes with that,' Mr Woodland said. He conducted Sally’s funeral in 1997 and will do the same for Rosanna on Friday at a private ceremony. A short statement has been released on behalf of Stuart and family members. It reads: 'Stuart Diver and his extended family have requested privacy and respect for their loss at this time'. Scroll down for video . Close friends, Stuart Diver (left) and Don Woodland (right) catch up in the months after he was rescued from the Thredbo rubble.

Stuart Diver and his late wife Rosanna, who died on Saturday after a long battle with cancer. A short statement has been released on behalf of Stuart and family members. It reads: 'Stuart Diver and his extended family have requested privacy and respect for their loss at this time' Rosanna Cossettini arrives on April 13, 2002, for her wedding day at Coolringdon, near Cooma in New South Wales, where she married Stuart Diver. They were due to celebrate a 13th wedding anniversary in just over a fortnight . The Thredbo disaster of 1997 killed Stuart's then wife Sally and 17 others, he only emerged from his dark, private hell after almost three days . It will be tough, to say the least, for someone who has worked through the worst of tragedies in almost 50 years as a Salvation Army officer. ‘I am finding it very difficult to cope. But we’ll do our best to help,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Woodland said Stuart was in very good hands, as the Diver family has once again surrounded him amid the tragedy and were providing vital support to him and young daughter, Alessia. 'All the family are around him. Euan his brother, his parents Steve and Annette, they are a close family and very, very strong,' he said. 'I can't foretell, by any means, how he will deal with this (after) but the whole family is a great family, they are very, very strong in their personalities and their characters. 'They are all strong, they have been mountain climbing when the boys were young, and it was the whole strength of the family that made Stuart the person he is. 'They are lovely people and my wife looked after (Stuart's mother) Annette while they were in Canberra.' The Thredbo disaster of 1997 killed Stuart's then wife Sally and 17 others. He only emerged from his dark, private hell after almost three days. Stuart Diver and Rosanna Cossettini married on April 13, 2002 in a ceremony in the Snowy Mountains when she was 27 and he was 32. In a heartbreaking turn of events, Rosanna was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer just three weeks after their nuptials but went into remission. Sadly, the cancer had returned by July, 2013. She passed away on Saturday aged 40. The miracle moment: Stuart Diver is pulled from the rubble of the Thredbo ski village after surviving almost three days under the rubble. The landslide killed 18 people including his first wife Sally. He survived despite suffering hypothermia and blood poisoning in the below freezing conditions . Sally and Stuart pictured on their wedding day. Stuart Diver told of his deep despair after losing his wife in the disaster, but as time past he also believed Sally would have wanted him to get on with his life and be happy . Stuart Diver at the release of his book 'Survival'. He also wrote that 'I had always believed that if it was right in your heart, then it was right,' he wrote of finding love after Sally's tragic passing. With Rosanna, I found myself loving again' Stuart remains an ardent supporter of the Salvation Army, as a result of their friendship, and has actively promoted the charity. Don Woodland has never lost contact with his good friend Stuart and believes the survival instincts and strength he displayed to get through more than 65 harrowing hours under the rubble of the Thredbo's Bimbadeen and Carinya Lodges, will help him through the sorrow of losing Rosanna to cancer. ‘I was at Thredbo and went through that with him and I was sent back to Canberra when he was brought in by helicopter,' he said. 'We looked after the family for the week and after that too. 'I visited Stuart constantly and was aksed to conduct Sally’s funeral after that, there has been a real bond between our families, (which) still exists today. 'It was unbelievable news (Rosanna's death), even though I did know a week or two ago, that things were becoming quite serious.' Stuart Diver has been a much sought after guest speaker in the years since the Thredbo disaster. He credited Rosanna with helping him heal from the trauma and grief of Sally's death . Paramedic Paul Featherstone (centre) is credited for helping keep Stuart Diver (left) alive during the many hours he was stuck under the Thredbo village rubble, he recalled the words he spoke with the sole survivor to keep his spirits up, 'stick with me and we'll see those mountains again'. Over a 41-year career, Featherstone treated victims at the Bali bombings, Thredbo landslide, Waterfall rail disaster and Beaconsfield mine rescue . Don Woodland has spent almost 50 years working for the Salvation Army and will preside over Rosanna Diver's funeral on Friday . Mr Woodland also did the honours for the wedding of Stuart's brother Euan and his wife Suzy. 'I didn’t get to talk much to Rosanna herself, I kept more in contact with Stuart right through the whole process,' he added. 'I am just finding it difficult to cope with it. We will do our best to help and flying down there on Friday morning – it will be a private family ceremony. 'I don't have to tell you how hard (it is) when you're dealing with someone who is closer than a brother.' Lieutenant-Colonel Woodland retired more than 14 years ago, he has forged ahead through most of Australia’s post war-time tragedies, Cyclone Tracy, the Granville rail disaster, the Strathfield and Port Arthur massacres, was there after the Bali bombings and, of course, Thredbo.","Close friend and chaplain Don Woodland presided over first wife's Sally's funeral and will do the same for Rosanna .

"The morning after she so memorably sashayed through Westminster Abbey clad in a cream silk dress that showcased her famous derrière, the world seemed to be Pippa Middleton's oyster. Not only had the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister come dangerously close to upstaging her older sibling, her obvious lust for life and ever-ready smile swiftly won her admirers from across the social spectrum. But almost four years on from the Royal Wedding of April 2011, things are looking very different for 31-year-old Miss Middleton. Scroll down for video . Nothing to celebrate: Pippa Middleton has reportedly failed to agree a deal with broadcaster NBC . Panned: Pippa's party guide Celebrate! failed to wow the critics - or the book-buying public . Her party book Celebrate!, launched with much fanfare in October 2012, bombed, with its author ridiculed for her penchant for stating the obvious and her breathless prose. Writing in the Daily Mail at the time, reviewer Jan Moir pointed to her less than original ideas (pumpkins at Halloween anyone?) and her lack of any obvious qualifications beyond penning the blog on her parents' Party Pieces website. 'From the moment she appeared in butter satin at her sister’s wedding, Pippa has struck absolutely no one as the kind of girl you would always find in the kitchen at parties,' continued Moir. 'And would she really have gained a lucrative publishing contract to write about something she calls ""simple, creative entertaining"" if her sister were not married to a member of the Royal Family?' It wasn't the first time that the question had been asked and it certainly wouldn't the last. Next came news of a column for Waitrose Kitchen, which launched in April 2013 although not before a storm of criticism had broken over both magazine and writer's heads. Established chefs were appalled that a woman with no obvious cooking experience had been hired and accused Waitrose of publicity seeking, while Pippa was once again charged with capitalising on her royal connections. At the time, editor William Sitwell hit back, arguing that Pippa 'will be an excellent contributor to the magazine, bringing with her a wealth of experience of entertaining, gained in part from working at her family's party business.' Critics disagreed and pointed to the 31-year-old's lack of kitchen experience and talent for stating the obvious, with lines such as 'Regardless of how tired I might be, the moment Friday lunchtime arrives I get that contagious pre-weekend excitement' widely mocked. Nevertheless, the Pippa bandwagon rolled on, with the Duchess of Cambridge's sister adding a Telegraph column and the role of contributing editor at Vanity Fair to her CV. Then it all began to go wrong. First, in March 2013, she was dropped by her literary agent David Godwin who had helped her launch Celebrate! Royal relations: Pippa, left, at the 2011 Royal Wedding and right, at the 2013 christening of Prince George . Speaking after the news broke, he said: 'I am very sorry it has happened, but yes, it is true: I no longer represent Pippa and I wish her every good luck.' Then, with lacklustre sales uppermost in publisher's minds, plans for a follow up to Celebrate! were quietly shelved. In January 2014, her US publisher Viking dropped her altogether having sold just 18,000 copies of the book, with a source telling the Sunday Times that 'Pippa's Celebrate sales are nothing to celebrate. 'She was a superstar after the wedding, and everybody thought it would be a success. Even Sarah Ferguson sold more books when she started her writing career.' Just six months later, in June last year, her Telegraph column, only six articles old, was axed after the paper discovered that its readers 'just weren't into it'. A source, speaking at the time, added: 'There was a lot of negative mail coming in after each column and there were too many off-limit subjects for her. They ran out of ideas.' Her Vanity Fair column, meanwhile, was laughed at, with the 31-year-old once again accused of trading on her royal connections and of stating the obvious. Passion: Pippa's most recent column for Vanity Fair focused on the best places to ski . Problems: Brother James, seen at the Invictus Games, has also been accused of trading on his royal relations . One particularly memorable line in a piece on Royal Ascot written in June 2014 read: 'Car Park 7 (which is reserved for Royal Enclosure members) is also a lovely spot to soak up the atmosphere and watch people, their hats, and general activity pass by.' Her most recent column focused on where to ski, with Courchevel, St. Moritz and royal favourite Verbier all coming highly recommended. But while Pippa's foray into travel writing went relatively smoothly, her attempt to move into TV is apparently over before it even began. Wooed by US broadcaster NBC after an interview conducted by host Matt Lauer proved a ratings winner, attempts to turn her brand of Middleton magic into something more substantial hit the buffers when she apparently 'failed to convince' in pilot scenes. According to reports over the weekend, talks  over a £400,000 contract have 'stalled' with sources describing a  scene featuring Wild West dancing as 'cringe-worthy'. Not that you would know it from her December 2014 column for the Spectator. Excitedly describing her visit to Wyoming, Pippa gushed about her experience of line-dancing and talked of the 'stunning' mountain scenery. 'Not convincing': Pippa was a ratings hit when she appeared on NBC but contract talks have stalled . 'Wyoming is real cowboy country,' she continued. 'Everyone wore cowboy boots and the men had big, non-ironic moustaches that curled upwards.' Not one to claim the laurels undeserved, she cheerfully admitted to being less than brilliant and worried she might have scuppered her chances of appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. 'It’s easy to get carried away with the whole free-riding atmosphere. My dance partner was about 80, and I did my best to keep up,' she continued. 'But it turns out I have two left feet, at least as far as moving to rhythm is concerned.' NBC apparently agreed. And yet, sources say that the breakdown of talks isn't only because of Pippa's 'two left feet'. Indeed, as the more charitably minded have pointed out, she has plenty going for her in the UK - a factor that has made her reluctant to relocate to New York. That she is so attached to London has more than a little to do with the increasingly busy role she has taken on at the British Heart Foundation, a charity which she has long championed. Taking priority: Pippa has taken on an increasingly busy role at the British Heart Foundation . Love: Boyfriend Nico lives in Geneva and friends say Pippa was reluctant to put more distance between them . Then there's boyfriend Nico Jackson, 36, who has been part of her life since 2012, but lives in Geneva - friends say she was reluctant to make the distance between them even larger. More reasons to stay include her job editing The Party Times, the online magazine belonging to her parents' company Party Pieces, and her continuing work for the Spectator and Waitrose Kitchen. Next month, Pippa will become an aunt for the second time when her sister gives birth to a brother or sister for Prince George. In June, she has another big engagement coming up, leading the London to Brighton charity bike ride as part of her work for the British Heart Foundation. Indeed, it seems there's no shortage of things to keep Pippa, whose company recently posted a healthy £220,000 profit, busy. She might have lost a column  and a £400,000 deal with NBC but while she is no longer the fresh-faced ingenue who burst onto the scene so memorably in 2011, the younger Middleton sister clearly isn't beaten yet.","Pippa Middleton was seen as a breath of fresh air when she first appeared .

"Nick Clegg was left fuming when an award-winning TV journalist called him a ‘lying two-faced swine’ in front of an audience of children. The incident occurred when Sky News foreign editor Sam Kiley played the part of the Lib Dem leader in a warm-up for an election programme at Sky’s Westminster studio. Sitting in the host’s chair, Kiley, 50, said: ‘Right, kids, I’m Nick Clegg – ask me a question.’ Nick Clegg was left fuming when Sky News journalist Sam Kiley (left) called him a ‘lying two-faced swine’ A girl in the audience, made up of children aged ten to 12, asked: ‘Why did you not keep your pledge on tuition fees?’ Kiley replied: ‘That’s because I’m a lying, two-faced swine,’ prompting gales of laughter from the children. But the newsman – who has survived several brushes with death over his 25-year career as a foreign reporter – had no idea that Clegg was standing behind a nearby camera and heard the jibe. He muttered sarcastically: ‘Thanks, Sam.’ One witness said: ‘Clegg looked thunderous but the children thought it was hilarious. And so did the adults who were there.’ A Sky insider said: ‘It was really unfortunate and Sam was horrified. He said it as a joke and didn’t mean it. Clegg shouldn’t have been allowed in while the warm-up was on. He looked very cheesed off.’","Sky News foreign editor called Nick Clegg a 'lying, two-faced swine'

"Killer on the loose: Saad Al-Hilli and his wife Iqbal from Surrey were murdered in France in 2012 . Detectives investigating the murders of four people including members of a British family in the French Alps have ruled out a mystery biker seen close to the scene, it emerged today. It was on September 5, 2012 that Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his wife, Iqbal, 47, died alongside her mother and a French cyclist. The Al-Hillis' daughters, Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, four, survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France. The motorcyclist wearing a highly distinctive helmet was spotted nearby, and many felt certain that he would unlock the mystery of what really happened. But now it has emerged that he was ‘positively identified’ last month, and has now been ‘ruled out as the murderer’. A legal source close to police in Chambery, who interviewed the unidentified man, said: ‘He was seen on a nearby road within minutes of the murders, but it took many months to track him down.’ The man is from Lyon, eastern France, and was paragliding in the Alps during particular warm weather. ‘He is no longer considered suspicious, but may be re-interviewed over what he may have seen around the area,’ said the source. It was in 2013 that the police finally issued a photo-fit image of the motorcyclist, and this is thought to have helped identify him. The latest development is a huge setback for Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor leading the enquiry, who has already admitted that those responsible may never be caught. Conceding that the enquiry could go on for years to come, Mr Maillaud said last year: ‘We have tried everything possible, but perhaps we’re in the presence of the perfect crime.’ Murders: The Al-Hillis died alongside Mrs Al-Hilli's mother and a French cyclist, while their two young daughters survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France . Mrs Al-Hilli died next to her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, while local cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was killed by a hail of bullets before being dragged along the ground and crushed by a car. Not a suspect: A forensic drawing shows the motorcyclist who has now been ruled out . There have been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey. Zaid Al-Hilli was arrested in 2013 under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because he has a watertight alibi. Eric Devouassoux, a 49-year-old old former policeman from the Annecy area, also spent four days in custody over the killings in February. The gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking, but there has been no legal action linked to the four murders.

"Colin and Karen McArthur are facing a £500 damages claim for discrimination after refusing to bake a cake supporting gay marriage . A court ruling over a Christian bakery which refused to make a pro-gay marriage cake could lead to Muslim printers being forced to reproduce cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it has been claimed. Colin and Karen McArthur, owners of Ashers Baking Company, in Northern Ireland, are facing a discrimination claim after they refused to bake a cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie under the slogan 'support gay marriage.' But now a leading lawyer has warned that if the case is successful it could set a dangerous legal precedent and undermine freedom of conscience. Aidan O'Neill QC said the case could mean atheist web designers being forced to build a website saying God created the world in six days, or lesbian t-shirt makers being compelled to print shirts saying gay marriage is an 'abomination'. Mr O'Neill posed the hypothetical scenarios in a legal opinion penned ahead of a hearing at Belfast County Court later this month. The case began in May last year after LGBT activist Gareth Lee placed an order for a novelty cake featuring Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie. The design called for the puppets, who are often likened to a gay married couple, arm in arm under the slogan 'support gay marriage'. While the bakery initially took the order and a deposit, Mr Lee was later told they would be unable to comply on religious grounds, and he was refunded his money. Aidan O'Neill QC, a prominent human rights lawyer, has said the case could set a dangerous precedent that could lead to Muslim printers being forced to reproduce Mohammed cartoons (pictured, the cake design) Despite being able to find another baker who completed his request on time and at no extra cost, Mr Lee argues that he has been discriminated against. He is now seeking £500 in damages in a case which has the backing of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Mr O'Neill has published his legal opinion ahead of the hearing, saying that Mr and Mrs McArthur are 'committed Christians', and that their beliefs should also be protected by discrimination laws. He argues that, by being forced to make the cake the couple would be forced to promote a view they do not hold, which goes against their right to freedom of expression. Mr O'Neill argues that Mr and Mrs McArthur are 'committed Christians' and that their right to freedom of expression is also protected under human rights laws (pictured, the couple's bakery) He added: 'This freedom not to be forced or required to express support for a particular opinion or political position was, indeed, the very one which Sir Thomas More strove to uphold in declining to sign the Act of Supremacy declaring Henry VIII to be the Supreme Head of the Church of England.' Colin Hart, director of the Christian Institute which commissioned Mr O'Neill, said: 'The strength and clarity of the advice from Mr O’Neill, who has a national reputation for his human rights expertise, should set off the alarm bells in this Government quango. 'It spells out the very real dangers and far-reaching implications for freedom of speech, but the equality watchdog seems determined to force people to use their creative skills to promote a political cause they fundamentally disagree with. 'This family run bakers serve gay customers all the time but they didn’t want to promote gay marriage.'","Christian bakers being taken to court after refusing to make 'gay cake'

I understand that you are standing as a leader determined to change things for the better, and so I believe granting clemency would be a major step forward in this pursuit of betterment. I appreciate that heroin can be damaging on many levels, but I believe that this is a much deeper issue that cannot be changed or altered by simply taking away the lives of people. Again, I respectfully ask that you make a real difference and overturn these sentences. In hope and peace, .

"Hillary Clinton used her iPad as well as a BlackBerry handset while she was secretary of state, despite claims she used her own private email server so she would only have to carry one electronic device. Mrs Clinton, who is a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, is expected to announce her latest run for the White House next month. However, the State Department has released four emails to the Associated Press which appear to show Mrs Clinton mixing personal and professional emails as well as sending correspondence from her iPad. Scroll down for video . Hillary Clinton, pictured in 2011, used her own personal email server while conducting official business . Mrs Clinton responded to some work-related emails with answers to questions relating to her domestic life . Mrs Clinton, right, admitted that she probably should have used two email devices and an official account . Mrs Clinton has faced criticism over her decision to use her own personal 'clintonmail' email address which was run from a server housed at her New York home. Critics claim that Mrs Clinton used the personal email account so her correspondence could not be subject to the same scrutiny as someone using an authorised government account subject to the Freedom of Information Act. On one occasion, Mrs Clinton's adviser Huma Abedin at the State Department emailed the secretary of state an AP story concerning a drone strike in Pakistan. Mrs Clinton replied with questions about interior home decorations and later apologised for the mistake. She also asked Ms Abedin whether she was receiving any emails sent from her iPad using her clintonmail address. In one of the email exchanges, Mrs Clinton expressed her concern over the leak of classified information to the media. She wrote: 'I think this is both dishonorable and dangerous and want to find way to say it. Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill said during her time as secretary of state Mrs Clinton primarily used her iPad to read news clippings. During some of the emails, Mrs Clinton replied to official mesages with questions about personal items . Mrs Clinton, pictured, is expected to announce her latest bid to run for president next month . Earlier, Mrs Clinton said she used her own personal account instead of a government one as it was more convenient. Mrs Clinton became secretary of state in 2009 - a year before the iPad was launched. At the time she used a BlackBerry as a mobile email device. She said: 'Looking back, it would have been probably, you know, smarter to have used two devices.' Already, Mrs Clinton has admitted to exchanging some 60,000 emails during her four years as part of President Obama's administration. Around half of these emails related to personal business, such as the death of her mother, he daughter's wedding and her own yoga routine. Many of these emails have been deleted. Although Mrs Clinton said she did not send any classified material over her personal network and the security of the system was not breached. However, Republican Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said Mrs Clinton's use of a personal email account has allowed her to 'clean' her email server and delete correspondence to the attacks. Clinton's attorney said she had turned over to the State Department all work-related emails sent or received during her tenure and it would make no sense to turn over her server, since 'no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server'.","Hillary Clinton used her iPad to communicate with state department staff .

"Pope Francis has said the hardest thing about his job is not being able to pop out for a pizza without being recognised . Pope Francis has said that he will only continue as pontiff for 'another two or three years', adding: 'I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time.' As he completed his second year in the Catholic Church's top job, Francis said that he had 'a vague sensation' he would not reign as pope for long. He told the Mexican broadcaster Televisa that he had the feeling his reign would be brief and perhaps only two or three years, suggesting it was like the psychology of a gambler who convinces himself he'll lose so he won't be disappointed if he wins. He added: 'It is a somewhat vague sensation. But I feel that the Lord has placed me here for a short time, and nothing more.' The mysterious premonition will inevitably spark concerns about Francis' health. Francis is missing part of one lung after a childhood illness and suffers from sciatica. Last year he said that he believed he had only a few years to live. He said: 'I know this is going to last a short time, two or three years and then... to the house of the Father.' As he enters the beginning of his third year as pope, Francis sounded weary of the weight that comes with the job. He said that he didn't mind being pope, but that it had been hard work to change his habit of moving around at will. He said: 'The only thing I would like is to go out one day, without being recognised, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza.' Francis also confirmed that he would consider retiring if he felt he could no longer perform his duties, but rejected the idea of an age limit. Pope Francis has his confession heard during a Penitence Mass at St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican today . Pope Francis gives confession during the penitential celebration today . His predecessor Pope Benedict XVI resigned in February 2013. Francis said 'Benedict should not be considered an exception, but an institution.' Also on Friday, Pope Francis marked the second anniversary of his election by declaring a jubilee year that will be interpreted as a powerful signal of his commitment to reforming the Church. The extraordinary holy year, dedicated to the theme of mercy, has been called to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a groundbreaking Vatican council that transformed how the Church related to the modern world, most notably ending the obligation for religious services to be conducted in Latin.

"Her father has been nicknamed Air Miles Andy. And judging by her nine foreign jaunts since Christmas, it seems Princess Beatrice is keen to follow in his extremely well-trodden footsteps. Despite insisting she is ‘exploring her career options’, the unemployed 26-year-old has found time to jet away for luxury ski trips, sun herself on a Caribbean yacht and party with her friends in Greece. Scroll down for video . Winter getaways: Princess Beatrice was spotted in St Barts at New Year's (left) and later that month (right) Her string of holidays culminated in a flight to New York earlier this week to celebrate her sister Eugenie’s 25th birthday. Although Beatrice receives no public funding, her jet-set lifestyle is sure to attract criticism at a time when the Queen is keen to promote royal thriftiness. It also is likely to raise eyebrows given that she has not had a job since before Christmas. During the New York trip Beatrice, Eugenie and their mother the Duchess of York popped up via video link before an audience at St James’s Palace. Her father Prince Andrew, who was carrying out a public engagement at the palace, got his guests to sing Happy Birthday. It was Beatrice’s third US jaunt this year alone. She had already been spotted in New York in January before hitting the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, the following month. Ski trips: Beatrice, far left in white, Prince Harry, centre, and Eugenie, right in blue, in Verbier in February . At the time palace aides said she was in the US preparing to embark on a finance course. But sources said the course lasted ‘barely a matter of days’. By early this month it was time for another holiday – a long weekend with friends in Greece. Beatrice’s ‘job hunt’ began after she quit a £19,500-a-year post at Sony Entertainment Pictures amid claims she was targeted by a North Korean cyber-attack on the firm. She has since soaked up the sun with boyfriend Dave Clark on two trips to Caribbean island St Barts, at one point staying on tycoon Lakshmi Mittal’s yacht. She also squeezed in three trips to her parents’ £13million chalet in Verbier, Switzerland. Buckingham Palace said she was ‘continuing to pursue a career in the business sector’.

"It's the TV show that's taken the nation by storm, as much for its action packed fight scenes and historical storytelling, as its hunky lead actors including former Calvin Klein model Travis Fimmel. But while audiences are swooning over History channel's shirtless, shield-wielding stars, the Australian model-turned-actor says he doesn't think the show's sexiness has been crucial to its success. The actor instead credits the TV series' loyal following to good quality scripts, story lines and lovable characters. Scroll down for video . Australian Travis confesses that before filming Vikings he knew little about the true history, but thanks to the 'informative' and detailed scripts written by Michael Hirst, he has learned a lot more about European history . Travis first shot to fame in 2002 as the face of Calvin Klein's famous men's underwear range. His billboard posters were said to have caused traffic pile-ups in America, while the then 23-year-old became the first male model to be signed exclusively by Calvin Klein for an entire year, earning him a six-figure sum . Talking to MailOnline, Travis, who shot to fame as the face of Calvin Klein's lauded men's underwear range in 2002, said it was both the pilot episode and historically accurate scripts that first piqued his interest in Vikings. He said: '[Writer] Michael Hirst is a very talented guy and I wanted to work with him. 'I didn’t know that much about it, I knew as much as anybody else that the Vikings raped and pillaged, but Michael’s writing, you can’t help but learn from it.' The star did admit however, that historical fact alone isn't always enough to capture the  full attention of today's audience. Former Australian model Travis Fimmel has won over viewers as legendary viking leader Ragnar Lothbrok, the star of History channel's action-packed historical drama series Vikings, which is now in its third series . Despite claiming to not care for the sexier elements of the show, Travis has won himself a legion of loyal admirers for his portrayal of farm-hand turned viking warrior king Ragnar Lothbrok . From the non-stop raunch of Game of Thrones to the topless Aidan Turner scenes in BBC's new period drama remake of Poldark, there's no denying today's batch of historically based shows are reeling in viewers by upping the sex factor. But Travis, who plays Ragnar Lothbrok, the main character in the action-packed  programme, insists there's more to Vikings than just bare brawn. He said: 'I guess for some people maybe it has to [be sexy], but we’re making an adventure out of it and it's exciting for the audience - and it’s very informative. On-screen brothers Travis (pictured right) and Clive Standen (pictured left as Vikings character Rollo) have helped to revolutionise the reputation of historical television shows and period dramas . Once thought to be slow and staid, there's now a new breed of period drama packed with action, violence, drama, sex and heartthrobs, breathing new life into the telling of stories steeped in true historical fact . 'It’s hard to make people want to learn I guess, but Michael’s done a great job of making a good story out it and the family saga.' Previously known for his long hair, perfectly groomed appearance, six-pack and bulging underpants, the actor even told us he's past caring what he looks like onscreen. 'I don’t give a s*** about that. We’ve got a whole team to make us look good.' Once known for his six-pack and bulging Calvin Klein underpants, Travis Fimmel says he no longer cares what he looks like onscreen, championing the brilliant Vikings script over the show's flesh flashing . For Travis, the real challenge of his role, which is based on the life of historical figure and renowned viking Ragnar Lothbrok, a ruler named in sagas and Old Norse poetry, was endearing his ruthless character to the viewers. He said: 'I sort of respect him you know, a person who started in the farm and became a king, and a well known figure in history, it’s pretty amazing what Ragnar achieved. 'But we do some heinous things, so it’s a lot of work to make the audience still follow you even though you have done some pretty horrible stuff.' New series Outlander begins next month, set in Scotland after the Second World War and based on the best-selling books by American writer Diana Gabaldon. While early reviews suggest there will be far less nudity than Game Of Thrones, it's set to feature plenty of drama and some stirring romance . But while Vikings is currently airing its second series on History channel, there's yet another new drama spicing up the history pages. Outlander launches 26 March on Nextflix rival service Amazon Prime Instant Video, taking its cue from Game Of Thrones by mixing action and epic fantasy with brooding characters and sexual tension. Can it rival the current offering? Between's Adian Turner's naked Poldark scenes, the bulging biceps of Vikings and the soon to start fifth season of HBO's Game Of Thrones, there's a lot of hot history to contend with! Vikings, Series 2 is on HISTORY tomorrow at 10pm . BBC's new TV period drama Poldark, a remake of the 1970s hit television show, has been accused of flaunting male lead Aidan Turner in topless promotional shots and nude scenes to lure in more viewers . HBO's medieval fantasy epic Game Of Thrones features adult scenes plus both partial and full-frontal nudity in almost every episode, making it one of the raunchiest box-sets on Sky . Roast boar might have been the Vikings' party food of choice but venison was almost as popular, as Jesper's delicious recipe proves. Here's how cooking like a Viking is done: . VENISON WITH MEAD AND MUSHROOMS . One venison filet . Four slices of mature ham or good bacon . 250g butter . Handful of fresh mushrooms . 300ml cream . 200ml mead . Check the fillet for tendons and remove. Cut the meat into four pieces and wrap each one in a slice of ham, fixing it in place with a tooth pick. Clean the mushrooms and slice or chop them. Next, brown 50g butter in a frying pan, then add the meat and cook to medium. Remove from the pan and cover with a paper towel and leave to rest while you make the gravy. Place 100g of butter in your pan and let it brown. Fry your mushroom until they take on some colour. Next, add the mead and let it reduce by a third before adding the cream. Reduce again by two thirds, before removing the pan from the heat and stirring in the rest of the butter. Serve the meat in the pan and grin along with the Norse gods as you enjoy it. BAKED BABY BEETROOTS . 1kg baby beetroots . 100g butter . 100g honey . Peel the beetroots and dry them. Melt the butter and honey in a frying pan, then add the beetroots, covering them completely in the mixture. Bake the beetroots for approximately 45 minutes at 175 degrees. Check and turn the beetroots regularly. SWEETHEART CABBAGE SALAD . 400g sweetheart cabbage . Eight baby leeks or  one large one . One pear . A dash of apple cider vinegar . Small handful of blackberries and blueberries . 3tbsp rapeseed oil . Sprinkling of chopped parsley . Salt and pepper to taste . Cut the sweetheart cabbage into 5mm slices and place in a large serving bowl. Cut the pear into thin slices, add the parsley and drizzle both with apple cider vinegar before throwing all of it over the cabbage with the blackberries and blueberries. Fry the leek in rapeseed oil with a pinch of salt until the edges turn brown and add to the salad as a topping . All dishes serve four .

"The husband of a woman who was allegedly stabbed to death by his best friend has described the moment he found his friend standing over his wife, holding a knife. Jonathan Broyhill  is accused of stabbing 29-year-old Jamie Hahn to death in her North Raleigh home in Carolina, and then turning the knife on his friend Nation Hahn as he tried to help his wife. Mr Hahn told a court in North Carolina that he ran down the stairs after he heard his wife scream, only to see Broyhill 'standing over her with a knife.' Widower Nation Hahn has described the moment he found his wife injured in their home, with his best friend Jonathan Broyhill, standing over her with a knife. He claims Broyhill slashed him as he tried to help her . The 33-year-old allegedly slashed Mr Hahn as he tried to help his wife, leaving him with minor injuries. He has been charged with first degree murder, attempted murder and felony assault. The court had previously heard that Jamie Hahn was a political strategist who worked for Sky Blue Strategies and employed Broyhill - best man to her husband at their wedding - to do accounting work, ABC news reported. Broyhill was in charge of campaign financing and providing reports to the Financial Elections Commission, but was accused of embezzling almost $50,000. The court heard that Mrs Hahn had started asking questions about the financial irregularities shortly before the attack. Mr Hahn said he did not think his wife knew about the alleged embezzling but said she was frustrated about the financial problems and concerned these had not been resolved. Broyhill had allegedly been avoiding speaking to her. Mr Hahn, a well-known strategist in North Carolina political circles, told the court that on 22 April 2013 he heard his wife scream and came running down the stairs. Jonathan Broyhill (left) is accused of murdering Jamie Hahn (right) and trying to murder her husband (far right) He said: 'I sort of rounded the corner of the stairs, and my eyes immediately went ... [to where] there was blood on the floor, and I could see Jamie's legs sticking out from behind.' Mr Hahn, 28, described seeing Broyhill in the kitchen standing over his wife with a knife and claims he slashed him as he went to try and console her. He said she had earlier shouted out his name and then Broyhill's and said: 'He's trying to kill me.' The couple were both taken to hospital but Mrs Hahn died two days later of her injuries.  She had been stabbed nearly a dozen times, leaving her with a severed artery and her liver severely lacerated, the News Observer reported. Mr Hahn described Broyhill as looking 'stone faced' during the attack - in sharp contrast to the smiling man who had given him a hug when he came through the door earlier. Mr Hahn told the court during his best man's trial that he came down the stairs when he heard his wife scream and saw Broyhill standing over her with a knife as she lay on the floor in the kitchen . Lawyers defending Broyhill said his mental state was unraveling in the run up to the attack, which saw him falsely claim he had pancreatic cancer and was suffering from MS. They admitted he had stabbed Hahn, but said he only meant to injure himself. Caroline Elliot, defending, said: 'Jon was determined to take his own life. 'He had no motive to kill those he loved. Something snapped.' Friends have previously told how the Hahns had asked the Reverend Nancy Petty to pray for Broyhill during his cancer struggle, according to members of the Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh. Facebook pictures show the trio were firm friends, having shared several holidays abroad together . Mr and Mrs Hahn graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and married in 2009, she was murdered four years later . He was also said to be a regular visitor to their home and had dinner with them every week. Facebook pictures show the three had a close relationship - enjoying watching sports games at home and traveling abroad to share holidays. Mr and Mrs Hahn graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and were married in 2009. Mr Hahn and Broyhill were believed to be close friends, having met during a church trip in 2000. Yesterday a Superior Court judge dismissed a juror from the trial who had been overheard talking about discussing the case with his wife. He rejected calls for a mistrial. The case continues.","Jonathan Broyhill is accused of stabbing Jamie Hahn to death in Carolina .

"Vogue's style editor-at-large Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis came under fire on Saturday after posting a photo on Instagram of what appears to be a homeless woman in Paris reading the famed magazine. 'Paris is full of surprises....and @voguemagazine readers even in unexpected corners!' the caption of  the German princess's photo, which has since been deleted, read. Von Thurn und Taxis, who has been with the magazine since 2012, received a slew of criticism from followers claiming the photo was 'cruel' and 'tasteless'. Scroll down for video . Vogue's style editor-at-large Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis posted this photo on Instagram, with the caption, 'Paris is full of surprises....and @vouguemagazine readers even in unexpected corners!' Many commenters criticized von Thurn und Taxis for posting the picture. Some claimed the photo was 'cruel' and 'tasteless' The editor, who was in Paris for fashion week, responded to the commenters, asking 'Why cruel? The person to me is as dignified as anyone else!' Style website Fashionista claimed the photo, like von Thurn und Taxis's other content, was 'out of touch'. 'The things she writes, both in Vogue and on social media, often straddle the line between entertaining/aspirational and disturbingly out of touch. On Saturday she crossed that line,' the website wrote. Some commenters supported the 32-year-old editor, but the post disappeared from her feed about five hours after it was posted, according to CNN. The German princess is the daughter of Countess Gloria von Schönburg-Glauchau, known as 'Princess TNT, the dynamite socialite' and Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Her brother Albert, 31, who succeeded their father in 1990 as Albert II, Prince of Thurn and Taxis, has a net worth of more than £1billion and races in a German auto-racing league. The princess was educated at Sevenoaks in Kent and has a bachelor's degree from the American University of Paris. Von Thurn und Taxis was in Paris for Fashion week when she posted the photo. On the left she can be seen at the Christian Dior show with Noor Fares and Olympia Scarry. On the right she is pictured at the Christian Dior - Party At les Bains Douches on Thursday. Her blog 'The Princess Diaries', which appeared in Finch's Quarterly Review, contrasted the difficulties faced by royalty with more 'normal issues'. The family's wealth originated from their postal system empire which can be traced back to around 1290 when two early ancestors operated courier services in the Italian city-states. But the  family's important postal activities began with Franz von Taxis, who served as postmaster to the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian I from 1489 and to Philip I of Spain from 1504. The Prussian empire originally bought out the Thurn and Taxis monopoly in 1867 and used it as the basis for a new German national post. A member of the family is believed to have invented the taximeter, which is why taxicabs came to bear his name. The House of Thurn and Taxis held the rank of royalty in the German Empire until 1918.","Style editor Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis posted the photo on Saturday .

"David Cameron last night agreed to a single TV debate during the election campaign. The Prime Minister is expected to attend a seven-way session at the start of April, to be shown on ITV. The deal includes three other political programmes during the campaign in which some of the party leaders will take questions from the public or television interviewers. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister has agreed to one seven-way debate hosted by ITV on April 2. He will also appear on a number of election specials – but without going head to head against Ed Miliband . Crucially, the BBC, Sky, ITV and Channel 4 appear to have blinked first and dropped their demand for a head-to-head clash between the PM and Ed Miliband. And they have backed down from their apparent threat to ‘empty chair’ the PM by holding debates with other leaders which he refused to attend. Labour appeared to deny the validity of the new proposal, insisting it still wanted three debates as originally proposed and accusing the PM of ‘running scared’ of a one-to-one with Mr Miliband. But, in an attempt to nail down the latest agreement, Mr Cameron said the other parties should accept it. ‘An offer’s been made, a deal’s been accepted, now the other parties must make clear that they accept this deal too, otherwise they will have to bear the responsibility,’ he said. ‘That’s what happened: a new offer put forward by the broadcasters, led by the BBC, to me, I accepted it, in full, on Saturday. So, I’m helping to make this debate go ahead. The other parties have got to stop running away from this and agree to the debate the broadcasters have now suggested.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg would only face Mr Cameron in one seven-way debate . The latest proposal is thought to have been presented to the parties over the weekend. According to Tory sources, it includes four potential shows, the first in just nine days’ time on March 26. It will be a Channel 4 and Sky joint production hosted by Jeremy Paxman and featuring the PM and Mr Miliband, one after the other, facing questions from the host and a studio audience. The second show will be the only debate and will involve seven party leaders, with the addition of Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Green leader Natalie Bennett, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP and the Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. It will be broadcast by ITV on April 2. On April 16 the BBC is proposing a ‘challengers’ debate featuring the Greens, SNP, Ukip and Plaid. A week before polling day, on April 30, the BBC will host a 90-minute Question Time-style show with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing one after the other to face questions from a TV audience. This is a better deal for the Lib Dems, who complained that a head-to-head between the other two leaders would prevent them from defending their record in government. A Labour spokesman said: ‘No one should be fooled: David Cameron is still running scared of a head-to-head televised debate with Ed Miliband.’ n Mr Cameron poked fun at Ed Miliband for posing for TV cameras in a pokey kitchen that turned out to be one of two in his £2.5million London home. ‘I am not saying this to make a point but you shouldn’t pretend to be something you are not,’ the Prime Minister said. Showing off the open-plan kitchen he and wife Samantha had installed in Downing Street, he added: ‘We are lucky, we both work, we were able to spend our own money on this. ‘To me, the kitchen is where you spend all your time. It needs a sofa you can slump on, a table you can sit at, a kitchen you can cook in, a place children can do their homework.’ Under the broadcasters' latest proposal, the Tory, Lib Dem and Labour leaders would appear on Question Time hosted by David Dimbleby (left). David Cameron and Ed Miliband would be interviewed one after the other in a Channel 4/Sky special hosted by Jeremy Paxman (right)","Prime Minister has agreed to one seven-way debate hosted by ITV .

"He has long been a familiar face trackside on the Formula One circuit, sharing the triumphs and disappointments of his two times world champion brother. But it seems the real star of the Hamilton family is Lewis's lesser known sibling, Nicolas. The 22-year-old, who has a form of cerebral palsy, will make his debut in the British Touring Car Championship in June - making him the first ever disabled driver to compete in the series. Scroll down for video . Nicolas Hamilton, the younger brother of Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, is to compete in this season's British Touring Car Championship . Nicolas (pictured at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix) has long been a familiar face on the Formula 1 circuit, sharing his two-time world champion brother's triumphs and disappointments . Nicolas Hamilton, pictured with his older brother Lewis at the Indian Grand Prix in 2013. The 22-year-old, who has a form of cerebral palsy, will make his debut in the British Touring Car Championship in June - making him the first ever disabled driver to compete in the series . Hamilton suffers from spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, which affects the nerves and fibres controlling his legs, arms and hands, causing difficulty walking and pain. At times he needs a wheelchair. But he is set to take part in five of the 10 rounds at Croft, Snetterton, Rockingham, Silverstone and the final meeting of the championship at Brands Hatch. 'Whilst I'm aiming to improve as a driver, I'm also hoping to inspire others to strive for their own personal goals, whatever their situation in life,' said Hamilton. 'Anyone can exceed expectations in one way or another and I hope to prove that when I race alongside, not just able-bodied drivers, but the best Touring Car drivers in the UK.' Nicolas and his brother Lewis have a close relationship and both men were encouraged in their passion for the sport as children by their father, Anthony. Nicolas was trackside for both his elder brother's Formula One world championship triumphs in Brazil in 2008 and last year in Abu Dhabi.

Nicolas suffers from spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy, which affects the nerves and fibres controlling his legs, arms and hands . Lewis Hamilton celebrates his maiden F1 championship with Nicolas and dad Anthony in 2008 . And when he himself made his racing debut in 2011, as he took his place on the grid at Brands Hatch, he was watched proudly by Lewis who had made a 13,000 mile round trip from preparations for the Malaysian Grand Prix to support his younger brother. At the time he said: 'Lewis is seven years older and had competed in the UK Karting Championship since he was eight. 'From the time I was born, my parents took me every weekend with them to watch him race around the UK and Europe.' 'I became a real racing nerd - I knew all the drivers and talked about karting all the time. I wanted to have a go, but when I got into a kart the noise scared me. I was also worried that I wouldn't be able to control the brake with my foot. 'My father encouraged me, but when I drove a kart for the first time in an empty car park, I hit a high kerb and went over a drop into 6in of water. Lewis Hamilton tweeted his pride for his brother after he made the announcement on his official Facebook . Cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination. Specifically, cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles. The condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before, during or shortly after birth. About one in 400 British children is thought to have Cerebral Palsy. The more premature the baby, the higher the risk and, according to the charity Scope, around 1,800 children are diagnosed every year. The symptoms of CP vary between individuals, but include muscle stiffness or floppiness, muscle weakness, random and uncontrolled body movements, balance and co-ordination problems. Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties, although intelligence is often unaffected. Some have problems walking while others are profoundly disabled and require lifelong care. Those with cerebral palsy often have other related conditions or problems, including epilepsy, learning difficulties, visual and hearing impairment, difficulties speaking or understanding other people speak, and delayed growth. 'I decided that was the end of it, especially when the engine started smoking. But Dad said that if you fall off a horse, you should get back on straight away.' Mr Hamilton, 53, added: 'We tried to give Nic as normal a life as possible, and when I say that, I mean independent and tough because that's what real life is. 'He is a determined young man and deserves every opportunity. We trust that he will do whatever it takes to keep himself safe.' Nicolas was born prematurely at 31 weeks weighing just 4lb 4oz. As he grew he found it impossible to walk. When he reached four, he had a major operation to release the tendons in his ankles, knees and groin. Eight weeks later, the plaster was removed and he began walking with the aid of a miniature frame, and at the age of 15, he ventured back into a kart. He says: 'By that time I didn't need much persuading. I developed my leg muscles by walking as much as I could unaided, which wasn't so easy.' He is said to train hard in the gym to strengthen his arm, hand and leg muscles to make sure that he minimises the disadvantage of his disability when driving. He has been granted a guest entry by British Touring Car boss Alan Gow and will take to the wheel of an AmD Tuning Audi S3. Shaun Hollamby, team principal of AmD Tuning, said: 'BTCC is a fiercely competitive series with hard wheel-to-wheel racing action on track and we have developed Nicolas's 2015 program to ensure he enters the Championship with a level of preparation. 'We have a number of test sessions over the coming months, which will enable Nicolas to acclimatise to the car. 'Having observed Nicolas's racing in the Renault Clio Cup and the ETCC, we know he is quick learner and a strong competitor, and we're looking forward to working with him this season.'","Nicolas Hamilton lives with the neurological condition cerebral palsy .

"Airport parking in the UK is officially the most expensive in the world. Five of the airports servicing London - London City, Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted - and also Edinburgh and Manchester airports feature in the top ten most expensive airports for parking across the globe, with London City Airport topping the leaderboard at £315 per week. In many cases that may be more than the total price of the holiday booked. London City Airport's proximity in the heart of London means the site urges travellers to use public transport if possible - it's worth considering when parking can be as much as £315 per week . How the airports around the world ranked where it came to car parking . Even when booked in advance, a week's parking at London City is twice the price of New York's JFK Airport - and nearly three times the cost of parking at Tokyo International Airport, research by Justpark.com has discovered. Parking rip-offs are not only suffered by holidaymakers leaving their cars at the airport while travelling abroad. Those collecting friends and family from airports are also charged extortionate amounts for short-term parking, paying £15 for 1-2 hours at London City and £12 at Heathrow. Following London City int he rankings is London Heathrow, where it costs an average of £167 a week to park. The UK dominance is broken as Sydney enters in third spot - parking there for seven days costs around £138. Parking at Heathrow Airport was found to be the second most expensive in the world at £167 per week . Anthony Eskinazi, founder of JustPark, said: 'We've long known that airport parking is overpriced across the country, but all the same these new revelations are remarkable. 'Finding that seven of the world's ten most expensive airports are here in the UK shows the extent of the problem we are facing.' You could...

Spend seven nights, all-inclusive at the four-star Elounda Residence in Greece, flying from Gatwick on May 5. Price - £224 per person, flights and hotel. Stay at the five-star Grand Yazici Mares Hotel in Icmeler, Turkey, all-inclusive, flying out of Stansted on April 15. Price - £197 per person, flights and hotel. Spend seven nights, all-inclusive at the four star Beach Albatross, in Agadir, Morocco, flying from Gatwick on April 21. Price - £314 per person, flights and hotel. He added: 'When people are paying more for their airport parking than their flights, something needs to change. We want to redress this balance and make airport parking more affordable.' The high cost of airport parking in the UK has led holiday-makers to seek alternative, more affordable options. Over 600,000 drivers use the app and website JustPark to find and book parking spaces on local residential driveways, rather than paying airport prices. More than 200 Heathrow homeowners are renting out their driveways for as little as £21.50 per week through JustPark, giving holidaymakers an 85 per cent saving on official airport parking and putting money back into local people's pockets. A spokesperson for London City Airport (LCY) told MailOnline Travel:  'LCY is unique in its close proximity to central London and limited space for parking. 'We encourage passengers to travel via public transport, using the airport's own DLR station, and 70 per cent do so. 'For those who do choose to drive, we offer free drop-off and parking savings of up to 40 per cent by booking online in advance.' A spokesperson for London City Airport has urged passengers to use public transport to the site . And Sean Hagger, commercial director at Holiday Extras, told MailOnline Travel how it is important for holidaymakers to book their car parking as early as possible. 'The figures given are rather misleading, he said. Here are car parking facilities available outside of the airport, that may be more attractive in price...

Gatwick: https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/redhill/gatwick-airport/ . Stansted: https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/stansted/stansted-airport/ . 'If you turn up on the day to park your car for a week or two at an airport designed for business travellers, as London City is, then you will be charged for the privilege. 'The reality is that very few holiday travellers do this; I'm pleased to say that Brits tend to have more foresight. 'It pays to book ahead – even just a couple of days. Looking on our website I can see that booking a week's Meet & Greet parking at London City, starting this Sunday, would cost £105 per week. 'Likewise, parking at London Heathrow for a week from March 6 at Terminal 2's official long-stay car park would cost £75.80. This price drops as low as £52.95 if you use other long-term parking options. 'If you're just a tiny bit organised, you can save hundreds of pounds.'","Costs an average of £315 per week to park your car at London City Airport .

"Many of the planets discovered elsewhere in our galaxy are not like Earth, but rather more like Jupiter. Such gas giants, as far as we know, are not hospitable to life, but now it has been suggested that the moons of these planets could be habitable. If confirmed, it would suggest these locations could be the predominant sources for life in the universe, not worlds like our own Earth. The idea was discussed by Dr Sarah Ballard of the University of Washington in Seattle, on the Public Radio International's (PRI) show The Takeaway. Scroll down for audio . Dr Sarah Ballard of the University of Washington was speaking to PRI. She said exomoons could be the 'predominant sites of life in the universe'. Shown is an illustration of Upsilon Andromedae d, the large world in the distance, orbiting the gas giant in the foreground, which could have habitable moons . She explained how Jupiter-sized planets in the habitable zones of stars - where conditions are ideal for water, and perhaps life - are more common than single rocky worlds like Earth. Hot exomoons . Too close to a star and an exomoon may have an average temperature above the boiling point of water, making it highly unsuitable for any form of life. Habitable exomoons . Exoplanets orbiting in a system’s habitable zone (where liquid water can persist on a planet’s surface) still need sufficient gravity to trap an atmosphere that regulates their temperature. If these conditions are met, however, the prospects for life are promising. Snowball exomoons . Moons formed in the outer reaches of an alien solar system are likely to be dominated by ice. They will remain deep-frozen unless heated by tides from their parent planet - again these are unlikely to be habitats for life. Transient exomoons . Moons of planets with elliptical orbits might be habitable for most of their planet’s year, but can experience hot or snowball periods as they venture too close to their star, or too far from its life-giving heat. Source: All About Space magazine . ‘If even some of these Jupiter-sized planets have moons, they might be the predominant sites of life in the universe,’ she said. In particular, she focused on the world of Upsilon Andromedae d, a gas giant exoplanet about 10 times the mass of Jupiter, located 44 light-years from Earth. While the planet itself is not thought to be habitable, it is possible that a moon in its orbit - known as an exomoon - could be. And if you were to step on the surface of the moon, you would see ‘beautiful tumultuous clouds on the Jovian planet’ and ‘incredibly complex cloud activity,’ according to Dr Ballard. So far, no exomoons have been discovered, but given that six of the eight planets in our solar system have moons, most astronomers regard it as an inevitability rather than a possibility that one will be found. It might be possible to find one in data collected by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope, or it may be necessary to wait for a more powerful planet-hunter to come online, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), due to launch in 2017. Finding exomoons is a bit of a problem though, as their mass and size is so much less than their host planet. One technique to find them that may prove successful is gravitational microlensing, which uses a foreground star to magnify a more distant one. The chance alignment can reveal exoplanets around a star, and could possibly even be used to spot a moon in orbit.

It might be possible to find one in data collected by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope (illustration shown) And we are able to rule certain planets out - ones that are too close to their host star, like Mercury and Venus in our own solar system, are unable to cling on to natural satellites. But finding out if moons are common in our galaxy will be key for the search for life, and could signal a change in goals for planet-hunters in the near future. ‘The fact we reside on a single rocky hunk of rock, orbiting without a big brother planet, might be relatively unusual,’ added Dr Ballard.

"Two third grade pupils have been suspended after cracking the school's computer network to find sexually explicit images and sharing them with classmates. A nine-year-old girl, who attends Sunnycrest Elementary School in Lake Stevens, Washington, was using a school computer during class, when she was able to access the porn. She then circulated the images among her classmates before teachers became aware of the situation. The students have been suspended from Sunnycrest Elementary School, pictured, after finding sexually explicit images on a school computer . The incident only emerged when an email was sent to parents promising that a full investigation into the incident would take place. The girl and another student have now been suspended from the school, with Lake Stevens School District promising a probe into how the student was able to find the pictures despite filters being in place. But some parents have reacted angrily after learning their children had seen the explicit images. Austin Maxwell, whose eight-year-old stepdaughter attends the school, told K5 that she was upset after seeing the pictures and that he was shocked a child was able to find such content on a school computers. He said: 'We never in he world would have thought she was accessing what she was accessing on the school's equipment.' The third grade student was said to find the explicit images after circumnavigating the school's computer network which filters adult content . The email sent to parents by district officials said that all student computer use at the school is being suspended until a full investigation takes place. It read: 'Once staff members became aware of the situation, Information Technology technicians were immediately notified and all student computer use at Sunnycrest is suspended until our investigation is complete. 'To ensure that all images have been removed, our technicians have deleted content from all Sunnycrest third-grade students' computer accounts. 'In addition, all students will be once again reminded about digital citizenship and the importance of notifying an adult right away when encountering inappropriate content.

"A bereft father who had to identify his 15-year-old son following the Hillsborough disaster was told by a police sergeant: 'One consolation, your son had not been drinking', it emerged today. Francis Tyrrell said he was left 'flabbergasted' after being 'spoken to like criminals' when he and his family went to identify his son Kevin in the wake of the April 1989 tragedy. Giving evidence at the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the FA Cup semi-final, Mr Tyrrell told the hearing how he had been 'treated like muck' at the makeshift mortuary which had been set up in the club gymnasium. He said: 'There was no consolation that our son hadn't had a drink when he was standing in them pens probably frightened to death and crying for his mother. Francis Tyrrell told the inquest into the deaths of 96 fans at Hillsborough how he was 'treated like muck' when he went to identify his 15-year-old son (pictured) in the aftermath of the 1989 disaster . 'And it's no consolation to us that it's took us 26 years to try and get justice for him and the other 95. No consolation.' He added: 'We were just flabbergasted the way they were talking to us ... like criminals.' Mr Tyrrell told how he and his wife Margaret and his brother Gerard initially went to Northern General Hospital in Sheffield to look for their son after he did not return home from the match. He told the coroner how the helpful atmosphere at the hospital had been in stark contrast to Hillsborough, where the temporary mortuary had no separation of men, women and children. Mr Tyrrell also told the hearing how he was made to rifle through various photographs of those who had been killed, despite police knowing that his son was among the dead. He told him how, after identifying his son, an officer said to him: 'It is (him). We've got his bus ticket with his name and address on.' When Mr Tyrrell asked why he had not been told this before having to go through the 'unecessary process', the officer allegedly replied: 'We hadn't time to tell people, we've been too busy'. He claims he was also told not to touch his son because 'he belongs to us now, he belongs to the coroner'. He told the hearing how he had been left 'flabbergasted' after being 'spoken to like criminals'. Pictured: Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster . Describing the conversation about the alcohol, Mr Tyrrell told how a sergeant asked the family several questions about Kevin before the subject of alcohol was raised. He said: 'When he had finished asking all these questions he just turned around and he said ""one consolation, your son had not been drinking"". 'And we just sort of looked at him. I was that flabberagasted. I said ""he doesn't drink"".' A man standing nearby flipped over a table and told the officer: 'What the hell has that got to do with him dying?', he told the inquest. Mr Tyrrell said: 'I said to my brother ""we are getting out of here because they are trying to set us up here"". 'We have done nothing wrong and yet we are getting treated like muck, basically.' He also told how a man queuing to identify a family member in front of him asked officers how long it would take, as he had been waiting three hours. According to Mr Tyrrell, the policeman replied: 'I don't know what you are moaning about three hours, I have been here all day.' Mr Tyrrell wrote a letter of complaint to South Yorkshire Police in February 1990 through his solicitors about the arrangements at the gymnasium. In the letter, he said that he should have been spared the 'unnecessary process' and 'traumatic experience' of viewing all the photographs of the deceased, because officers knew his son was dead. The hearing heard how he received an apology in which the police acknowledged they had failed to reach the standard 'manifestly required by the circumstances'. The inquest continues.

"The Married at First Sight star who looked like she was about to become a runaway bride on the reality show's season two premiere has revealed that she did indeed marry the groom she initially refused to say ‘I do’ after deciding he wasn’t attractive enough. Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, spoke with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on Friday morning’s episode of the Today show about her look of displeasure when she first walked down the aisle – and confessed why she was really hesitant to say 'I do' to her now-husband Ryan Ranellone. 'I put so much pressure on my intuition,' the 30-year-old sales rep explained. 'I thought I was going to know that this guy is my soulmate and we were going to have that connection and those sparks.' Scroll down for video . All smiles: Jaclyn Methuen revealed on Friday's Today show that she did end up marrying Ryan Ranellone on season two of Married at First Sight - even though she said she was unimpressed by his physical appearance . Full of delusion: The 30-year-old told Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb that her look of displeasure when she saw her now-husband for the first time was the result of thinking it would be love at first sight . On the last Tuesday's two-hour episode of the FYI-channel reality show, 29-year-old Ryan happily agreed to marry Jaclyn, but the episode ended in a cliffhanger when she admitted she had doubts about her arranged marriage. 'I first see Ryan, my gut just says: ""Oh man, like this is him?""' she told the cameras. 'The initial physical attraction really isn't there right now.’ She continued: 'When I saw him face-to-face, I felt a little disappointed. It just doesn't feel like this is the man who is my husband. I don't know if I can do this.' But Ryan, a Long Island real estate agent, did not have to think twice when it came to his betrothed's appearance, and Jaclyn's Today show interview confirmed that she would eventually say 'I do'. Unhappy camper: The sales rep, who had been single for seven years, said she thought there were going to be sparks when she saw Ryan at the altar for the first time . Not my fault! Jaclyn, who can be seen with Ryan on their wedding day, blamed her thinking on being single for so long and watching 'too many rom-coms' Full house: Jaclyn had appeared on the Today show with fellow Married at First Sight participants Davina Kullar and Jessica Castro, as well as Dr Joseph Cilona, who helped arrange the pairings . After watching the clip from the episode, Hoda said that Ryan looked like he had won the jackpot when he saw Jaclyn walk through the door but noted that her initial reaction was filled with a lot of expletives that had to be bleeped out during the episode. Both she and Kathie Lee were stunned that Jaclyn thought that it would be love at first sight. 'Why would you think that?' they both asked her. Jaclyn, who hadn't been serious with any man in the past seven years, said: 'Because I was single for so long. I watched too many rom-coms.’ Being honest: During her appearance on the morning show, Davina, 34, said she respected her mother's decision to skip her reality TV show wedding . Hard work: Dr Cilona explained the scientific process behind the matchmaking on Married at First Sight, revealing that he had given each contestant five psychological personality tests . And while she knew it sounded silly, Jaclyn said she really thought her soul was going to recognize its counterpart in him. '[I thought] we were just going to light it up and it was going to be perfect,' she said of her pre-conceived notions of their first meeting. 'The reality was that he was a stranger, and I didn't know anything about him.' Jaclyn had appeared on the Today show with fellow Married at First Sight participants Davina Kullar, 34, and Jessica Castro, 30, as well as the show's licensed clinical psychologist Dr Joseph Cilona, who helped arrange the pairings. Unlike Jaclyn, Davina was pleased with her groom Sean Varricchio's physical appearance, but her reality show nuptials were missing her mother, who disapproved of her doing the show. Big step: Jessica, 30, spoke about being able to trust her new husband after her former fiance cheated on her . High hopes: Jessica, who can be seen with her husband Ryan DeNiro on their wedding day, told Kathie Lee and Hoda and she won't let her past define her . 'In my family, I have always been the risk taker...' the 34-year-old sales rep explained. 'I took the risk. Another piece of this is that my family is from the West Coast and I wasn't able to sit down and look them in the eye and tell them [about the wedding].' Davina maintained that she respected her family's decision and noted that she was still speaking to her mom throughout the process. 'She was still there in the way that she could be,' she said of her mother. I don’t? Jaclyn couldn’t bring herself to say 'I do' to Ryan, whom she met for the first time at the altar on Tuesday's season two premiere of Married at First Sight . Seconds thoughts: Jaclyn began to have doubts about marrying a perfect stranger after seeing him for the first time. Meanwhile, Ryan said he was a 'happy camper' when he saw his bride walk down the aisle . Awkward: The bride-to-be couldn’t look Ryan in the eye during their wedding. She noted that she was 'disappointed' by his physical appearance . Tick tock: After Ryan said 'I do', he was left awkwardly waiting while Jaclyn had second thoughts . As to whether or not her mom has come around to her new husband, Davina said viewers will have to 'stay tuned'. Kathie Lee and Hoda were also curious to see if Jessica, 30, was afraid of trusting a stranger after her former fiance cheated on her. 'I wasn't going to let my past define me,' she told them. 'I wasn't going to just assume that I couldn't trust this person. The receptionist said she is optimistic about her future with 29-year-old Ryan DeNino because two of the three couples from season one of the show are still happily married. Unlucky in love: Jaclyn, a sales rep for Tito’s Handmade Vodka from Union, New Jersey, had been single for past seven years and hadn't had sex in two years . Confident: Ryan, a Long Island real estate agent, had been single for eight months. After a string of long-distance relationships, he finally felt ready to settle down . Agreeing to marry a complete stranger may seem strange, but Dr Cilona told Kathie Lee and Hoda that during the matchmaking process he administered five psychological personality tests, as well as an in-depth questionnaire that he created. Dr Cilona explained that the amount of compiled research this past season alone resulted in 3,800 pages. In addition to Dr Cilona, three other specialists – sexologist, Dr Logan Levkoff; sociologist, Dr Pepper Schwartz; and spiritual advisor, Greg Epstein – took the three women's needs and created what they believe are three perfect couples, based on scientific matchmaking. Helping hand: Davina, a biopharmaceutical sales rep from Manhattan's Upper East Side, is one of the show's 'singles' Over the course of several weeks, viewers will be able to watch as the couples go from wedding, to honeymoon, to 'early nesting', and then to the daily struggle of marriage. But before they walked down the aisle, the show's participants shared what they were looking for in an ideal match. Jaclyn admitted that she hadn't had sex in two years and confessed that she hoped her new husband would be 'personable, secure and confident', while her new husband Ryan said his perfect wife was loyal, dedicated and family-oriented. He had been single for eight months. After a string of long-distance relationships, he explained that he finally felt ready to settle down. Great expectations: Sean Varricchio, 35, an ER/trauma nurse from Jackson, New Jersey said he was looking for a wife who is 'athletic, intelligent, motivated and professional, with a good heart, and good family values' Davina, who is from Manhattan's Upper East Side, said she wanted to get married at first sight because she has 'dated so many different types of men' that she 'started to doubt whether I was even looking for the right qualities’. Meanwhile, her new husband Sean, 35, an ER/trauma nurse from Jackson, New Jersey was on the lookout for a wife who is 'athletic, intelligent, motivated and professional, with a good heart, and good family values'. 'I have a science background, I'm very analytical and I thought there's got to be something to this,' he said. And Jessica, who also lives in Manhattan, confessed that she is 'finally at a place in her life where she feels she is ready to settle down and get married,' after learning that her former fiance was unfaithful. Moving on: Jessica, a receptionist at a law firm in Manhattan, said she is 'finally at a place in her life where she feels she is ready to settle down and get married,' after her fiance cheated on her . Searching for his soulmate: Ryan DeNino, 29, from Staten Island. Mr DeNino owns his own consulting business said he has been single for one year after he and his girlfriend of five years broke up . She had been single for two years and explained that she wants a husband who is 'close with family (especially his mother), independent, strong work ethic, loving and affectionate'. On this week's season premiere she married Ryan, from Staten Island, who owns his own consulting business. He explained to the cameras that he has been single for one year after he and his girlfriend of five years broke up. Why did he want to get married at first sight? 'Knowing there were experts that would… get to know who I am, hopefully find me a match that would be compatible for me,' he said.","Jaclyn Methuen, 30, was last seen having second thoughts about marrying the stranger she just met on Tuesday's premiere of Married at First Sight .

"An undercover investigation in China has revealed a shocking underground butchery in central China where protected animal species are slaughtered on-site and sold to restaurants. The illegal meat market in the town of Liurenba in Hubei Province - a mountainous area known for its diversity of wild animal species - is reported to be less than 50 metres from the local governmental office, according to the People’s Daily Online. The investigation was prompted after local residents alerted the media to a complex supply chain from surrounding forests to restaurant dining tables. Shock: Wild animals are killed and skinned in an underground butchery in Liurenba town in Hubei Province . Precious: Many of the wild animals being processed are protected species such as wild goats . Bloody: More than 40 pieces of wild goat's skin are hung over the balcony at the butchery, which is largest wild animal meat supplier in the area . Around a dozen types of wild animals, including hares, boars, pheasants and goats, were seen on the butcher’s table around the two-storey slaughterhouse. More than 40 hides of wild goat, a protected animal in Hubei Province, were also seen to be hung over the balcony. Behind a chopping block, which had freshly slaughtered wild boar, the butchery put up a sign saying ‘wholesale and retail’. Street market: An earlier probe found a mobile vendor is seen selling wild animal meats by a highway in Hebei Province near China's capital, Beijing . Pick and choose: Passers-by pick their favourite among a selection of wild hares and pheasants . Illegal dish: Wild hares are a protected animal species in Hebei . According to nearby residents, this meat market has operated for years and is home to the largest wild animal meat suppliers in the region. More similar wild animal butchers were spotted by the investigators in nearby towns and counties, selling crates of dead goats, hog badgers, wild pheasants, civets and wild hares, many protected by local government. Anonymous insiders revealed that some residents in the area considered wild creatures a threat to their crops. In addition, they hunt them to earn extra money for their families. Local delicacy: Pheasants are caged and sold by the highway . Supply and demand: Poaching in China is illegal, but with restaurants paying top money for the animals which are sold as delicacies, a huge underground chain has been created . Poaching in China is illegal, but with restaurants paying top money for the animals which are sold as delicacies, a huge underground chain has been created. A wild chicken is sold for around 40 yuan (£4.30) and 1kg of wild goat meat is priced at around 40 yuan. Local restaurants bill wild animal meats as 'speciality dishes'. Their prices are normally twice as much as normal meat dishes. An earlier article on People’s Daily Online revealed similar trade in Hubei Province near Beijing. In the article, a mobile butchery sold wild animals including pheasants, hares and boars by a highway to passers-by who were looking to purchase food ingredients for the Chinese New Year.","Investigation exposed the largest wild animal butchery in Liurenba town .

"A Canadian woman has claimed that she was lured to an Italian police officer's home with three other women via a couch-surfing website, before being drugged and sexually assaulted by him. The woman, who has not been identified for legal reasons, is among more than a dozen women to have alleged they were attacked by Dino Maglio after using the travel website, Couchsurfing.com. In a victim statement, she recalled trying and failing to rouse the three other female visitors after discovering them passed out in Maglio's house. However, she shortly fell unconscious herself. She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by the officer during her visit. But she said she was unable to protest to the alleged sexual assault due to her 'drugged-up' state. Accused: A Canadian woman has claimed that she was lured to Italian police officer Dino Maglio's (right) home with three other women via a couch-surfing website, before being drugged and sexually assaulted by him . Maglio, 35, is currently on trial in Padua after being charged with drugging a 16-year-old Australian girl with a tranquilizer. He had allegedly enticed the teen via Couchsurfing.com, before raping her. Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year-prison term for the defendant, who has reportedly admitted to drugging the teenager and having sexual relations with her even though he knew she was a minor. Boris Dubini, who represents the unnamed girl, says Maglio's claim that the sex was consensual was nonsense. He says the tranquilizer he gave the victim turned her into a 'rag doll' with no resistance. The Australian teen was traveling with her mother and sister at the time, The Guardian reported. Maglio, who is being held in a military prison, was not present for Tuesday's hearing. He is accused of using the the name Leonardo on his Couchsurfing.com profile to entice  his alleged victims. Since the 16-year-old girl made her allegations against Maglio, up to a further 15 women have come forward claiming they were assaulted by him after making arrangements to stay at his Padua home. Numerous claims: The woman, who has not been identified for legal reasons, is among more than a dozen women to have alleged they were attacked by Maglio (right) after using the travel website, Couchsurfing.com . Popular: Maglio, 35, is currently on trial in Padua after being charged with drugging a 16-year-old Australian girl with a tranquilizer after striking up a conversation on Couchsurfing.com (pictured), before raping her . The case has raised safety concerns surrounding Couchsurfing.com, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their home-towns for free. The site's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told The Guardian that users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. However, Couchsurfing.com has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, England, according to the newspaper. It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim that he had closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one. The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO), which carried out a year-long investigation, said that 14 testimonies collected revealed a man who seemed like a fun and fast-living host. On trial: In a victim statement, the Canadian woman recalled trying and failing to rouse the three other female visitors after discovering them passed out in Maglio's house. Above, the officer is pictured in a family photo . Some claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine. They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'. Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liqueur belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason', it is alleged. He reportedly told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing.com to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career. In victim statements, some women said they feated they had been slipped drugs and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out. Three young woman from Czech Republic said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine, it is reported. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveler from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol. She later posted a negative review on the officer's couch-surfing profile. The next day, he allegedly sent the unidentified woman a threatening message over Facebook, demanding she remove it. He said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe, it is alleged. City: Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year-prison term for the defendant, who has reportedly admitted to drugging the teenager and having sexual relations with her at his home in picturesque Padua (pictured), Italy . 'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore.' She added: 'I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.' The alleged attacks came to light after the women connected on the website to share their experiences. When Maglio's home was searched officers found a gun and a large amount of pornography and child abuse images, according to the Guardian. Court papers showed he was also hosting two other Couchsurfing.com tourists at the time - with one showing the same 'sickness' as other alleged victims. Maglio is being held in the military prison for his own protection and police chiefs say he has been suspended from duty. The next hearing in the fast-track trial is April 14.","Dino Maglio, 35, reportedly lured unnamed woman via Couchsurfing.com .

Suicide notes were found in the student's room and he had previously asked fellow residents if he should kill himself. Mr Millgate, 20, of Crowborough, East Sussex, died of devastating multiple injuries from the fall - just days after breaking up with Aleasha Istead. Before his death, he messaged Ms Istead saying 'my life is not worth living' before sending pictures taken from the window that he jumped from. He had started drinking heavily in the days leading up to his death and leapt from the building while flatmates were having a party in another room. Witnesses said his body was visible from many of the 400 flats in the halls of residence. The windows in the building are designed to only open at a tilt. But an inquest at Bournemouth Coroner's Court heard that the window's lock had been over-ridden by a previous resident who bought a special key from the internet to open it fully. Coroner Mr Payne reached a verdict of suicide. He said: 'It is my conclusion that he did deliberately take himself out of the window and sadly ended up on the ground below having jumped from the 10th floor. 'This could never have been a cry for help. He must have realised that by jumping out of there, there was only one result and that would have been his death.' A police officer who responded to the incident spoke of her shock at having to try to stop university students taking photos, the inquest heard. PC Emily Rowberry said she was confronted by lots of students looking out of their windows taking photos and videos of the 20-year-old's body and expressed fears they would appear on social media before his family were informed of his death. In a statement read out at the inquest, PC Rowberry said: 'He was pronounced dead at 00.28am. Window tampered with: An inquest heard that the window's lock (appartment block pictured, left) had been over-ridden by a previous resident who bought a special key from the internet to open it fully . 'The location was very prominent. I was concerned for the onlookers' wellbeing and the casualty's dignity. I could see a lot of people were watching from their windows. 'I shouted for people to move away from the windows and close their curtains. I was shocked to see cameras flashing as people then took pictures and video. 'I was worried pictures might appear on social media before we had time to inform the family so I shouted again for people to go inside.' Mr Millgate had been in a relationship with Ms Istead for a year and four months. She told the Bournemouth inquest: 'I asked if we could have a break but he just pestered me constantly. Devastated after break-up: In the days leading up to his death, Mr Millgate was drinking heavily and had asked other residents in his accommodation block if he should kill himself . 'The weekend before he died I told him I didn't want a relationship, I wanted to focus on my exams. 'We were both upset, he said something like ""my life isn't worth living"" and he had said before ""if we ever break up I will kill myself"" but I thought it was just words. 'He bombarded me with messages on text, Snapchat and Facebook. He sent me photos taken out of his bedroom window and one showing him with a noose round his neck. 'I thought the messages were sent for attention, he had never harmed himself before. 'I ended up blocking his number and deleting him on Facebook and Snapchat, I just tried to stay away from any interaction.' She also contacted one of Mr Millgate's flatmates and asked them to keep an eye on him. Wrote 'goodbye' notes: The 20-year-old psychology student left messages to his parents and to his ex-girlfriend before ending his own life . His housemate Chloe Cattermole told the inquest Mr Millgate had been drinking frequently in the days before his death but they assumed that was just his way of dealing with the relationship break-up. Miss Cattermole discovered him at 11.30pm on April 4 last year in a drunken state and helped him to the sofa, lay him down and got him a glass of water. When another housemate went to the kitchen 30 minutes later the lights were on and the window was open. The inquest heard the windows were only supposed to tilt open at the top for safety but students had bought keys on the internet to override the locking system so they could fully open the window to smoke. Two notes were found on Mr Millgate's desk - one addressed to his parents and one to Miss Istead. Coroner Mr Sheriff Payne said the letter to his parents was clearly a 'goodbye' note. The inquest heard the note to Miss Isted was generally a nice letter but contained phrases that suggested his intentions, such as 'I hope what I do doesn't hinder your exams' and 'I couldn't go on being without you'. After an inquest into the death, a verdict of suicide was recorded at Bournemouth Coroner's Court, above . Mr Payne said: 'He was upset about the end of his relationship and it's clear he had difficulty accepting it. 'No one actually perceived that he was planning to end his life. He made no declaration to his housemates and his family had been in contact with him and they did not have any serious concerns for his welfare. 'He left letters to Aleasha and his parents in a prominent position and the note to his mother and father is very much a goodbye note.'","Paul Millgate, 20, killed himself days after his 16-month relationship ended .

"They're great at cleaning carpets, but when it comes to getting dust and dirt off a wooden floor vacuum cleaners can leave a lot to be desired. Now engineers at Dyson may have the answer – a new model designed specifically for hard flooring. The firm’s cordless V6 Fluffy vacuum cleaner – which goes on sale today costing £399 – aims to cater for the growing trend for exposed wooden floorboards, ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring. Scroll down for video . The firm’s cordless V6 Fluffy vacuum cleaner – which goes on sale today costing £399 – aims to cater for the growing trend for exposed wooden floorboards, ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring . Engineers have replaced the traditional spinning bristles – which were designed to drive dust out of a carpet – with a large soft nylon brush similar to a paint roller which scoops dust and dirt from hard floors . The key difference between the new technology and Dyson’s traditional bagless vacuums is in the roller bar. Engineers have replaced the traditional spinning bristles – which were designed to drive dust out of a carpet – with a large soft nylon brush similar to a paint roller which scoops dust and dirt from hard floors. Larger pieces of debris such as spilled cornflakes are grabbed by the soft material and passed into the machine’s suction stream, while microscopic grains of dust are brushed up by strips of carbon fibre filaments. Sir James Dyson said previously that the company 'must relentlessly invent' to keep up with changing demand . Dyson claims the V6 Fluffy is particularly good at sucking dirt out of the crevices between floorboards, and is able to pick up a whole 1kg bag of sugar in just four seconds. Powered by the Dyson digital motor V6, and digitally controlled, the motor spins at up to 110,000rpm to create the most powerful cordless vacuum. It gives up to 20 minutes of powerful fade-free suction. The vacuum features a special soft roller cleaner head with soft woven nylon, and rows of anti-static carbon fiber filaments. 15 two-tier Radial™ cyclones, arranged across two tiers, also work in parallel to increase airflow and capture more fine dust. The V6 Fluffy converts for handheld cleaning and features a centre of gravity located towards the grip and hygienic push-button bin emptying. Hard floors have surged in popularity in recent years, driven by a fashion for industrial and ‘shabby chic’ interior design styles. Market researcher The Freedonia Group estimates that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the use of hard flooring in the last two decades. Dyson’s new cleaner, which is being produced in Singapore, runs for 20 minutes between battery charges. It can clean carpets and rugs as well as hard floors with the help of an attachable head. Stephen Courtney, head of new product innovation at Dyson, said: ‘In homes today we see more hard floors, so we set out to solve the age-old problem of conventional cleaners simply snowploughing debris across the floor. 'We wanted a machine that could pick up scattered Cheerios, whilst also capturing fine dust.’","Dyson have created a new vacuum cleaner specifically for hard flooring .

"Democratic senators remain irritated with their GOP colleagues who last week sent a letter to Iranian leaders undercutting President Barack Obama, but they will still back bipartisan legislation that would give Congress final say over a nuclear deal. Enough members of the president's party have signaled support for that bill and another that would impose new sanctions on Iran if it doesn't make an agreement with negotiators that the White House would be powerless to stop the measures from going into effect once passed. The Obama administration and its international partners now have until March 24 to set up the framework for a deal. Scroll down for video . Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Republican, center, is flanked by the committee's ranking member, Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, right, and Sen. James Risch, a Republican, as they listen to Secretary of State John Kerry, center, back to camera, testify on Capitol Hill last week. Corker and Menendez are the chief sponsors of one of the bills that would restrict the executive branch's negotiating authority . After that, a dozen Democratic senators, including Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs committee, have said they will join with the GOP majority to pass bills inserting themselves into the process. One would levy additional sanctions on Iran after June 30 if it doesn't agree to the final terms of a deal, though monthly waivers would be allowed should more time be requested. The other would give the Senate the power to reject within 60 days any pact the executive branch makes with Iran. Democrats who spoke with Politico voiced their displeasure with the 47 GOP senators who wrote a letter to Iran notifying the country's leaders that any contract it makes with the Obama administration would be nullified when a new president takes office in January 2017, whereas most members of the upper chamber would be in office for years to come. But that hasn't changed their position on the core issue, they've said. 'The letter’s incredibly unfortunate and inappropriate,' Heitkamp said.'That doesn’t diminish my support for the legislation that we introduced.' Michigan Sen. Gary Peters similarly said the missive was 'simply unacceptable' and 'brought hyperpartisanship to an issue that we need to maintain our bipartisanship in.' He added: 'That doesn’t change my support for that bill. … I stay firm.' Blumenthal last week called Republicans' actions 'unconscionable' and bemoaned them for disrespecting the president. At the time, he said the bipartisan coalition of senators willing to buck the White House was 'in tatters.' Blumenthal told CNN that he was determined to 'stitch it back together,' though. A week later it appeared that the group was holding strong and that Senate Foreign Relations Bob Corker, one of just seven Republican senators who did not sign the 'open letter,' was correct in predicting last Thursday that the whole thing would blow over. 'Let a couple days go by. We think there’s going to be really ignited momentum,' Corker had told Politico. Nobody’s dropping out. We’ve had reaffirmed commitment.' Democratic senators remain irritated with their GOP colleagues who last week sent a letter to Iranian leaders, but they will still back bipartisan legislation that would give Congress final say over a nuclear deal. Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, pictured here last Wednesday on Capitol Hill, authored the missive to Tehran . Meanwhile, Republicans who did sign the letter triumphantly declared on the Sunday news shows that they had no 'regrets' about sending Tehran the strongly worded message. 'I stand by the letter,' National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rodger Wicker said on NBC's Meet the Press. 'I think it's interesting that we've had so much talk about process, just like we've had talk about process with Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech, rather than dealing with the substance,' the Mississippi Republican asserted, referring to House Republican leadership's end run around the White House earlier this year when it invited Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN he thinks it was 'fair' for Republicans to explain that Congress will be involved in the process one way or another. 'I don’t think it was a mistake,' he said of the message to Tehran. 'The administration would like to have a distraction, but the point is the subject of the matter,' the GOP leader said. 'Apparently, the Obama administration is on the cusp of entering into a very bad deal with one of the worst regimes in the world.' Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, the author of the GOP letter, said on CBS' Face the Nation that 'Iran’s leaders needed to hear the message loud and clear.' 'I can tell you they are not hearing the message from Geneva,' he told show host Bob Schieffer. Secretary of State John Kerry, who has primarily led talks with Tehran on behalf of the U.S., lambasted letter signers on Sunday, saying, 'I’ve never seen anything like this.' Kerry, a former Massachusetts senator, warned that negotiations would likely extend beyond the end of the month. 'We believe very much that there’s not going to be anything that’s going to change in April or May or June that suggests that a decision you can’t make now will be made then,' he said in a separate appearance on Face the Nation. Secretary of State John Kerry, who has primarily led talks with Tehran on behalf of the U.S., warned Sunday that negotiations would likely extend beyond Democrats' deadline for an agreement framework- March 24 . The White House has threatened to veto Senate legislation interfering with the administration's attempt to convince Tehran to put aside its nuclear ambitions. Obama's chief of staff Denis McDonough again told Corker, a sponsor of the 60-day review bill along with predecessor Menendez, in a Saturday note that the president would not sign legislation usurping his ability to unilaterally approve these types of agreements with foreign governments. McDonough said in the letter to Corker that the White House has 'welcomed Congress’ important role' in talks before essentially instructing the legislative branch to butt out. The Corker-Menendez legislation 'goes well beyond ensuring that Congress has a role to play in any deal with Iran,' McDonough contended, and could set a 'potentially damaging precedent.' On Monday, the White House reiterated its stance that Congress has thoroughly been consulted during negotiations and vowed to continue involving the legislature when the time comes to talk about removing sanctions on Iran. Claims to the contrary are 'baloney,' the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said, . Earnest said that legislation giving Congress 60 days to reject a deal would suggest to the Iranians that the United States may not stick to its end of the bargain. 'We can't have a situation where you have people in the Congress back seat driving,' the Obama administration official said. If Democrats and Republicans in the Senate stick together, the White House will not be able undo their work. Supporters of the bills now number in the mid 60s. A vote of 66 lawmakers or more in favor of the measures would tie the president's hands. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said Sunday it was 'unrealistic' for the White House to think that Congress wouldn't have a say in any dealings with Iran, however. 'I have supported the negotiations to this point, but any deal that touches upon the congressional statutory sanctions is gonna get a review of Congress, and the only question is are you going to have a constructive, deliberate bipartisan process, or are you going to be rushed and partisan,' he said on Meet the Press.","The White House would be powerless to stop the measures from going into effect once passed if as many Democrats as expected defect .

"He bought four houses surrounding his multi-million dollar home after discovering that a developer planned to turn one of them into a huge estate that would have 'a direct view into his bedroom'. Now, it has emerged that Mark Zuckerberg is locked in a legal battle with his backdoor neighbor, Mircea Voskerician, who sold the Facebook CEO the property in 2013 instead of fulfilling his plans. Voskerician has claimed Zuckerberg promised him entree into the Silicon Valley elite in exchange for the  house in Palo Alto, California, which the developer then sold the rights to  at a 'discount rate'. He is now suing the 30-year-old billionaire, who lives in his adjacent mansion with his wife, Priscilla Chan, based on allegations including fraud and misrepresentation. Zuckerberg denies the claims. And in new court papers, Voskerician's realtor openly mocks the Facebook founder, who her refers to as 'just a kid.' Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (left) is locked in a legal battle with developer, Mircea Voskerician (right), who sold him the contractual rights to a property in Palo Alto, California, for $1.7million in 2013 . Next-door neighbors: In November 2012, Voskerician reportedly sent Zuckerberg a letter saying he planned to tear down the property behind his home and replace it with a 9,600sq-ft mansion. Above, the two properties . In November 2012, Voskerician reportedly sent Zuckerberg a letter saying he planned to tear down the property behind his home and replace it with a 9,600sq-ft mansion, which he would then sell. 'The real estate developer was going to build a huge house and market the property as being next door to Mark Zuckerberg,' a source told The San Jose Mercury News at the time. In the letter, Voskerician apparently told the tech executive, who is worth an estimated $33billion, that the mansion would have a direct view of his home, including his 'yard and master bedroom'. If 'Mark plans to live there long term, he has 'one shot to ensure his privacy is where it needs to be,' the developer wrote in an email to once of Zuckerberg's people, according to Bloomberg. However, he then made Zuckerberg an unusual offer. Deeming himself a 'good neighbor', he proposed to sell  a slice of the property at '100 per cent premium' to grant him more privacy. Two weeks later, the pair came to the agreement that Zucerkberg would buy Voskerician's contractual rights to the entire house for $1.7million, which the latter described as a 'steep discount'. Billionaire's mansion: In the letter, Voskerician apparently told the tech executive, who is worth an estimated $33billion, that the mansion would have a direct view of his home (pictured), including his 'master bedroom' Disputed properly: If 'Mark plans to live there long term, he has 'one shot to ensure his privacy is where it needs to be,' the developer  told Zuckerberg's people. Above, the property Voskerician sold the rights to . The billionaire subsequently snapped up a further three homes nearby to guarantee his privacy. In a  lawsuit, which is ongoing, Voskerician claims that Zuckerberg promised to introduce him to valuable contacts in Silicon Valley in exchange for the sale of the property, it is reported. In an April 13, 2013, email, the developer, who lives in Palo Alto with his wife, Eva, told Zuckerberg: 'First I am happy that I could maintain your privacy by selling you the Hamilton property. 'Second, I wanted to meet and shake hands for the transaction and discuss your offering of working with you in the future as you stated you have built Facebook on connections that you have with others in Silicon Valley.' He also told Zuckerberg one of the reasons he  sold him the house, aside from privacy, was 'your offering to help me get my homes, development projects, in front of your Facebook employees'. Voskerician says that although both he and Zuckerberg agreed on the deal, nothing was put into writing. However, the Facebook founder's lawyers have strongly denied the claims. Email exchanges suggest that Zuckerberg and his inner circle had no intention of helping Voskerician in anything other than a 'light' way. But the developer's lawyer has disputed this. Unless both parties reach a deal, the case will go to trial. If Voskerician wins, he may be awarded back the property, situated in Hamilton Avenue in the once-ordinary California area. Couple: After paying Voskerician $1.7million for the rights to the property, Zuckerberg reportedly bought the lot from its owners for a total of $4.8million. Above, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, in November . In emails, Makan described Voskerician's offer to maintain Zuckerberg's privacy on his conditions as an 'obscene proposal', while the CEO's wife  said it made her 'sad and angry'. Over several months, Voskerician allegedly kept sending emails to Zuckerg's team, prompting them to worry that he could cause problems from 'either a security or PR standpoint'. In an email, Zuckerberg's assistant, Andrea Besmehn, reportedly told the firm's head of executive protection that the billionaire 'does remember saying that he would help this guy in a ""light"" way.' After paying Voskerician $1.7million for the rights to the disputed property in 2013, Zuckerberg reportedly bought the lot from its owners for a total of $4.8million. Voskerician claims his interest in the property was worth far more than $1.7million, saying the discount was based on the prestigious contacts Zuckeberg had allegedly promised him. Makan's firm later bought  three other homes surrounding Zuckerberg's house - which is less than a 10-minute drive away from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park - to secure his privacy. The houses in Palo Alto, situated 35 miles south of San Francisco and 14 miles north of San Jose, were reportedly snapped up for $10.5million, $14million, and $14.5million. In addition to claims of fraud and misrpresentation, the lawsuit also accuses Zuckerberg of breach of contract.

"Republican presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Scott Walker used their own personal email server, in a similar way to Hillary Clinton, in what critics claim was a bid to control what correspondence was released for public scrutiny. Republicans have attacked Mrs Clinton after it emerged that during her time as Secretary of State she used her own private email account to conduct official business. However an investigation by NBC news has uncovered evidence that Republican front-runner Jeb Bush used his own private email server while Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, who also has White House aspirations, employed a similar system. Scroll down for video . Hillary Clinton, pictured on a C-17 military aircraft using her Blackberry, used a personal email address while Secretary of State provoking criticism that she was attempting to avoid proper scrutiny of her messages . Following the controversy involving Clinton, it has emerged that Jeb Bush and his staff used a private email server for some official correspondence, however many of these messages have been made public . In an effort to reduce the impact of the controversy, Mrs Clinton has released 55,000 email documents from her personal files to the government to determine whether she had sent any classified information using her personal server during her time as Secretary of State. State Department rules insist that non-classified but sensitive national security or diplomatic information can only be transmitted using secure servers. According to CNN, the Florida governor used an email address on his own jeb.org server for official and personal business. However, he has now released hundreds of thousands of emails in an effort to deflect criticism. Mrs Clinton is the 6/5 favourite to become the next resident of 1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue, while Jeb Bush is the most favoured Republican at 5/2 with Scott Walker trailing at 14/1, according to bookmakers Paddy Power. CNN claimed that there is now evidence that Jeb Bush and his staff used his personal email server to communicate while working on official Florida business. Scott Walker's spokeswoman attacked Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server, even though he was forced to admit using a similar system while in office as a Milwaukee County executive. Kirsten Kukowski, who represents Walker's political committee, Our American Revival, said: 'Hillary Clinton's potential evasion of laws is something she should answer questions about . 'Wisconsin has a strong open records law with a broad presumption of access to records and the governor has very specific policies in place in his office to assure that the laws are complied with fully.' Two of Walker's associates were convicted of political campaigning on government time. Fellow Republican presidential hopeful Scott Walker, pictured, has also been embroiled in the scandal . Tens of thousands of pages of emails collected by prosecutors as part of that investigation have been publicly released since the close of the probe. Walker was never charged or convicted as a result of the investigation. Walker's staff has said that no such secret network exists in the governor's office. And Walker said last year that when he became governor in 2011 he created a 'clear distinction between things that are political and official'. He insisted that in November 2011, after almost a year in office he introduced a policy that 'any campaign work should be done away from the Capitol or state office building', with staffers using their 'own phone, computer and personal email'. Clinton's email server, clintonemail.com was used in the aftermath of the 2012 terrorist attack on the US consulate in the Libyan city Benghazi . A House of Representatives Select Committee is investigating the attack and has issued a subpoena for any emails concerning Libya on Clinton's personal servers. According to Jamal D. Ware, spokesman for the Select Committee: 'The Select Committee on Benghazi issued subpoenas for all communications of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to Libya and to the State Department for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation. 'The Committee also has issued preservation letters to internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents.' Later Ware confirmed: 'The Select Committee on Benghazi is in possession of records with two separate and distinct email addresses used by former Secretary Clinton and dated during the time she was Secretary of State. 'Without access to the relevant electronic information and stored data on the server—which was reportedly registered to her home—there is no way the Committee, or anyone else, can fully explain why the Committee uncovered two email addresses. 'As Chairman Gowdy has noted, this is why former Secretary Clinton’s exclusive use of personal emails to conduct official U.S. government business is so problematic and raises significant issues for transparency. The American people have a right to a full accounting of all the former Secretary’s emails, and the Committee is committed to working to uncover all the facts.' Current Secretary of State John Kerry said his department is currently assessing the 55,000 documents released by Clinton vowing  that they  'will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way'. The email server was housed at the Clinton's family home in Cappaqua, New York. After releasing the emails to the State Department, Clinton Tweeted: 'I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them'.","Hillary Clinton has handed over 55,000 emails from her private server .

"Andrew Marr has branded Jeremy Paxman as a ‘genuinely tortured, angry individual’. The BBC presenter said Mr Paxman, 64, was barely able to hide his disdain for those he interviews – and that it had been a mistake to allow him to grill David Cameron and Ed Miliband last Thursday. Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Marr argued the former Newsnight host’s aggressive interviews were ‘not a good replacement’ for debate between the Prime Minister and the Labour leader. Scroll down for video . Andrew Marr (left) has launched an extraordinary personal attack on Jeremy Paxman (right) - branding the former Newsnight host as a ‘genuinely tortured, angry individual’ The interviews, on Channel 4 and Sky, were conducted separately and followed weeks of negotiations between broadcasters and political parties over the format. ‘The thing about Jeremy is that he is a genuinely tortured, angry individual – and you get the real Jeremy,’ Mr Marr said. ‘He looks disdainful and contemptuous and furious with his guests because he by and large is. You can’t fake these things on television.’ However, Mr Marr, 55, suggested Mr Paxman had forgotten why the leader interviews were being televised and had allowed his own ego to get in the way. ‘No disrespect to Jeremy Paxman, but it would have been a lot more interesting had it been head to head,’ he said. ‘Replacing that with a good “Paxmaning” for both of them, while entertaining, was not a good replacement. ‘There is a danger for all of us, as it were, in the interviewer’s chair to forget that we are not the ones standing for election. ‘And I thought Ed Miliband did score [in the interview] when he said, “Jeremy, you’re important, but you’re not that important”.’ Mr Marr, a former colleague of Mr Paxman, said it had been a mistake to allow the former Newsnight presenter to  grill Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband last Thursday for the election debate . A number of television critics said Mr Paxman dominated the show so strongly that viewers might have finished wanting to vote for him rather than either of the party leaders. However, Mr Marr’s comments went down badly with viewers, who accused the BBC political editor of being ‘supine’, ‘sycophantic’ and having an ‘inflated sense of his own importance’. Others speculated Mr Marr’s remarks were driven by jealousy. The two men spent nearly 15 years as colleagues at the BBC, until Mr Paxman quit last year. But they have had relatively little to do with each other. Mr Paxman hosted a series of documentaries and fronted BBC2’s flagship current affairs programme, Newsnight. Mr Marr, who started out as a newspaper journalist, has spent the past decade at the helm of BBC1’s Sunday current affairs programme, The Andrew Marr Show. He also fronts BBC Radio 4’s Start The Week each Monday. Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Marr said Paxman’s aggressive interviews were ‘not a good replacement’ for a debate between the two political leaders . A BBC source said executives were ‘very surprised’ by Mr Marr’s outburst, as the two men never really ‘trod on each other’s toes’ even when they worked together. But Mr Marr made it clear he prefers a friendlier approach than the aggressive line of attack for which Mr Paxman is renowned. ‘I have never believed that the right approach to a political interview is to say to the interviewee, in effect, “You’re a scoundrel, you’re a liar, and I’m going to treat you like that”,’ he said on Friday. ‘The best I can do is to ask intelligent questions, keep eye contact – intelligent, sensible questions that the alert viewer would want to be asked. ‘And if they’re not answered, ask them again. And if they’re not answered then, just make it clear to everybody that X or Y has not answered the question and move on. Viewers have accused Mr Marr, who has hosted BBC1's Sunday-morning current affairs programme for the past decade, of being ‘supine’, ‘sycophantic’ and having an ‘inflated sense of his own importance’ ‘We don’t have to be this kind of really, really aggressive opposition all of the time.’ Mr Paxman is known for doggedly pursuing a line of attack, once asking then home secretary Michael Howard the same question 12 times in a row. That aggression was clear last Thursday when he took Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband to task, in two separate interviews. The Prime Minister was asked to defend soaring immigration, whether he could live on a zero-hours contract, and made to squirm over his close ties with former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson. Mr Miliband’s grilling was so severe the presenter asked him at the end: ‘Are you OK, Ed? Are you all right?’ However, when Mr Paxman told the Labour leader his party would never get a majority, Mr Miliband said the broadcaster does not get to decide who wins.","Marr said it was a mistake to allow Paxman to grill Cameron and Miliband .

The couple bought Rosie and another hen in 2008 because they could not find eggs which were both fresh and organic. But in November last year, she was suddenly grabbed by a fox while she was running free in the garden. Treatment: Rosie has since undergone a new form of avian physiotherapy to help her recover . Stretches: The treatment involves manipulating her limbs to enable her to walk normally again . Mrs Hull said: 'This fox came whizzing down the garden and grabbed her and dashed down the bottom of the garden. I screamed and I just had to try to stop the fox. 'Eventually, the fox did drop her and ran off but Rosie was just laying there bleeding and there were feathers everywhere.' Rosie was rushed to a nearby vet's office, where Tania Parsons carried out emergency surgery to save her. But as the chicken recovered she was having difficulty walking because of the scar tissue which had formed over her wounds. Hale and hearty: The physio has apparently been a success and Rosie is now back to full health . Ms Parsons said: 'Last year, Rosie came in almost split in two and had to have quite major surgery to stitch her back together. 'I had never heard of physiotherapy for chickens but she responded to it really well. 'I've only seen it done on chickens on YouTube videos in America. Rosie is a very special hen and Jean looks after her very well.' Mrs Hull also took Rosie to a pet blessing service as church, which she says helped to speed her recovery.","Rosie was attacked by a fox in the Sussex garden of owner Jean Hull .

'I think, to be acknowledged by Dior is just, it means a lot as a woman to feel beautiful, and elegant, and timeless.' Last week, Dior's decision to cast the chart-topper as the newest face of its spring-inspired Secret Garden campaign, which is currently in its fourth year, was met with an overwhelming amount of support, both from the fashion industry, and from the label's fans. '#HistoRIH @rihanna is gonna be the first BLACK WOMAN to be the face of Dior!!!!!' one person tweeted, while another added: 'Huge news for @rihanna today: she's the first black woman to be the face of Dior.' Dior confirmed that it had signed Rihanna up as its newest campaign star on Friday. According to WWD.com, the French-based brand stated that Rihanna is set to feature in the fourth installment of the video and print series of the Secret Garden campaign, joining models such as Daria Strokus, Melissa Stasiuk and Xiao Wen Ju, all of whom have previously featured in the Secret Garden series. While further details about the campaign have not yet been released, the fashion label confirmed that film and print versions, shot by photographer Steven Klein, 'are scheduled to run this spring'. Big deal: While discussing her soon-to-be-released animated movie Home, Rihanna explained how important she believes her new Dior campaign will be for 'a lot of young girls of any color' Anticipation: The chart-topper added that she was thrilled just to be 'recognized' by the iconic French fashion label . The announcement was made just days after the popstar was spotted filming in the ornate surroundings of the Palace of Versailles in Paris, France, where all of Dior's previous Secret Garden campaigns have been shot. Rihanna was seen strolling through the Palace's luxurious rooms during the late night shoot, while wearing a glamorous sequin gown - and a pair of fluffy slippers. Her thick hair was styled in luxurious waves, swept back off her face to allow her features to shine, while a bold dark lipstick spiced up the look. Rihanna posed among a hallway of gold statues as cameras flashed away. Earlier that day, the star was also seen enjoying some downtime in her trailer, which was located at the Palace. Rihanna was pictured lying down, while having her nails done by an assistant.

The sleeveless dress featured a striking white leather waist belt which of course simply highlighted the singer's slim frame. Adding her own signature style to the ensemble, Rihanna decided to pull down the zip featured down the front of the frock, which revealed a hint of side boob. This new campaign will mark Rihanna's debut as a model for the brand - however she is known to be a great fan of the brand, and is often seen wearing a variety of Dior's latest and greatest designs while frequently featuring on the front row at the label's Paris Fashion Week catwalk shows. And while Rihanna has not previously modeled for Dior, the star does boast plenty of fashion experience, having previously modeled for the likes of Balmain and Emporio Armani, as well as appearing on numerous covers of fashion bible Vogue. She joins the likes of Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, Black Swan actress Natalie Portman and French beauty Marion Cotillard, all of whom have starred in campaigns for Dior in the past.

Making clear the key role that the historical setting plays within the campaign, Dior said of its previous video installment: 'As the eyes open upon the famed perspective of the chateau gardens and their massive geometries, as on the cusp of a dream, the Dior woman draws the spectator with her around the twists and turns of a secret and amazing Versailles.' Known also as the Chateau de Versailles, the extravagant royal residence is located just southwest of Paris. Three French kings lived there, including Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and Louis XV, up until the French revolution in 1789. Each king increased the palace’s splendour by continuing to build upon the premises.","Last week Dior confirmed that the 27-year-old popstar had been chosen to front the latest installment of the fashion label's Secret Garden campaign .

"A British Airways pilot threatened to kill himself by crashing a jumbo jet five years before the Germanwings disaster in the French Alps last week. Robert Brown killed his wife in a horrific attack with a claw hammer, and the next day he considered deliberately crashing his Boeing 747 in order to 'make a statement'. Now his victim's family say they fear that airlines have not learned from the case and are not making enough effort to assess whether pilots are genuinely fit to fly. Scroll down for video . Parallels: Robert Brown, left, threatened to crash a plane full of passengers just like Andreas Lubitz, right . Victim: Brown killed his estranged wife Joanna, pictured, by repeatedly hitting her with a claw hammer . Brown's case has chilling parallels to that of Andreas Lubitz, who last week flew a plane into the Alps, killing 150 people, after suffering from depression. He had told BA that he was suffering from stress as a result of his divorce from wife Joanna, and consulted his GP about his illness, but carried on working anyway. In October 2010, Brown argued with his wife while dropping off their two children at her home in Ascot, Berkshire, and hit her 14 times with a claw hammer. He then buried her body in Windsor Great Park - but he told his murder trial that he had considered crashing a plane the next day after being harassed by Joanna's lawyers. 'I thought something needs to be done,' Brown said. 'I thought I want to fly one last time and crash the aircraft. I wanted them to be held accountable. 'I thought if I got to work I could crash an aircraft, or fly to Lagos and crash it there or hang myself in the hotel room. I wanted to make a statement.' Sporty: Brown, a British Airways pilot, is pictured on a long-distance run in BA-branded kit . Warning: Joanna's mother Diana Parkes, right, says airlines should have learned from the case . Instead, he called in sick and another pilot stepped in to fly the BA jumbo jet to Nigeria. Brown was arrested later the same day, and subsequently convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 26 years. Joanna's mother, Diana Parkes, told the Daily Telegraph that following the case airlines should ahve done more to ensure that pilots cannot endanger their passengers. She said: 'Robert Brown's claim in court that he planned to ditch a commercial flight the day after he killed her was chilling to hear, and yet there has never been any acknowledgement from British Airways that lessons can be learnt from that.' The victim's best friend Hetti Barkworth-Nanton said that there were 'chilling similarities' between Brown's case and that of Lubitz, who were both fitness fanatics. Brown told his BA bosses that he was feeling stressed out, but they did not follow up the conversation to check that he was in a fit mental state to fly, she said. Plane: Brown had been due to fly a British Airways Boeing 747 similar to this one (file photo) Similarly, Lubitz was apparently signed off from work following a struggle with depression, but ripped up the doctors' notes he was given excusing him from flying. Mrs Barkworth-Nanton told the Telegraph: 'Neither should have been allowed to fly and put the lives of their passengers at risk. In both cases there were things the airlines should have picked up on. The warning signs were there. 'Robert's terrible crime resulted in him taking the life of Jo, but it could have been much worse, and myself and Jo's family feel that airlines are not learning the lessons of these tragedies.' Lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot out of the cockpit during Germanwings flight 4U9525 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf last Tuesday, before deliberately crashing into the Alps killing all 149 other people on board. Work to retrieve the bodies of the victims from the crash site high up in the mountains is continuing six days after the disaster.","Robert Brown killed wife Joanna in 2010 and was due to fly a BA Boeing 747 the next day .

"Soaring numbers of people are travelling abroad for treatment to beat NHS waiting lists, experts say. At least 65,000 patients are now going overseas for surgery and other procedures each year – twice as many as a decade ago. One of the most popular destinations is Poland, for cataract treatment, as well as Spain, where couples are going for IVF. Medical professionals also say young women are increasingly travelling to countries such as Thailand and Turkey for cheap cosmetic surgery, including tummy tucks and breast implants. Many are combining the trip with a holiday, so they can recover in the sun while avoiding awkward questions back home. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics estimate that 65,000 patients went abroad for treatment in 2013, paying a combined £129.3million. A decade ago, the figure was around 32,000 a year. The head of one firm, which arranges overseas treatment, said there was a growing demand for those wanting cataract surgery, hip and knee replacements and IVF. All of these procedures are deemed ‘non-urgent’ on the NHS and so have long waiting times or are no longer offered at all. Ugur Samut, chief executive of Medigo, said the number of queries for all types of treatment had trebled in the past six months. ‘We believe demand has increased recently due to longer waiting lists and postcode lotteries for some procedures on the NHS.’ Tuck on the cheap: Medical professionals say young women are increasingly travelling to countries such as Thailand and Turkey for cheap cosmetic surgery, including tummy tucks and breast implants . He said for his patients, Poland was the most popular destination, with many travelling there for cataract surgery. Hungary is the second most common, mainly for dental procedures which are expensive in England and where patients have to pay even for NHS treatment. Spain is popular for couples seeking IVF, Thailand for laser eye surgery and Turkey for liposuction, the removal of body fat. Barry Wilson, 60, from Birmingham, went to a private clinic in Poland last July for cataract surgery after being told he would have to wait eight months on the NHS. The entire trip including flights, hotels and the treatment cost less than £1,000. He said: ‘It’s very daunting to travel to another country for surgery. My surgeon put me at ease at my consultation. I would return again, with no worries.’ But Keith Pollard of website Treatment Abroad, which offers advice to patients going overseas, said the rise was mainly driven by adults wanting cosmetic surgery. He said: ‘One reason is the increase in disposable income. People are prepared to spend more on cosmetic surgery. ‘The other is that it has become more socially acceptable to travel abroad for treatment.’ Nonetheless, hospital waiting lists in England are at a six-year high, with almost 12,000 patients facing delays of at least six months for routine operations. The figures for treatment abroad are from the ONS’s annual International Passenger Survey, in which 250,000 people from England and Wales are interviewed.","Thousands travel abroad for cheaper surgeries to beat waiting lists .

"Lt. Col. Robert Hite, one of the three remaining Doolittle Raiders, died after a battle with Alzheimer's disease on Sunday, aged 95 . One of the last surviving Doolittle Raiders who attacked Japan during a daring World War II mission has died, age 95. Lt. Col. Robert Hite died on Sunday at a nursing home in Nashville after a battle with Alzheimer's disease. He was one of three remaining Doolittle Raiders. Hite was a co-pilot of a crew that flew one of the 16 B-25 bombers that raided Tokyo in April 1942. Led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, the mission saw 80 airmen sent in bombers from a carrier at sea to attack military targets in Japan. Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety. Though the attack only caused scattered damage, it's credited with boosting morale in the United States while shaking Japan's confidence less than five months after the country attacked Pearl Harbor. Tom Casey, a manager for the Doolittle Raiders, said that, despite the risks, 'they all volunteered to go anyway.' The 16 B-25 bombers, each carrying five men, dropped bombs on targets such as factory areas and military installations. Prisoner: Hite, shown here being led blindfolded by his captors, was was taken captive by the Japanese for 40 months after the Doolittle Raid . Veteran: After being liberated in 1945, Hite continued his active-duty service in 1951 during the Korean War. He served until 1955 . They then headed to designated airfields in mainland China realizing that they would run out of fuel, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. Three crew members died as Raiders bailed out or crash-landed their planes in China, but most were helped to safety by Chinese villagers and soldiers. Of the eight Raiders captured by Japanese soldiers, three were executed and another died in captivity, according to Northwest Florida Daily News. Hite was one of the men that was taken by the Japanese and was held captive for 40 months. Take off: Though the air raid only caused scattered damage, it's believed that it boosted American morale and shattered Japan's confidence . Risky: Without enough fuel to reach a safe landing point, the brave crew had to land in China and hope villagers would lead them to safety . After being liberated by American troops in 1945, he returned to active duty six years later, in 1951 During the Korean War. He served until 1955. Hite's son, Wallace Hite, told Fox News that his father would want to be remembered for being patriotic. 'I think he would want two things: that's the attitude we ought to have about our country, and the second is, he was doing his job,' he said. After Hite's passing, there are only two surviving Raiders: Lt. Col. Richard 'Dick' Cole and Staff Sgt. David Thatcher. On April 18, the 73rd anniversary of the raid, the Raiders will present the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force with a Congressional Gold Medal they will be honored with earlier in the week. Ambitious: Led by Lt. Col. James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, the mission saw 80 airmen sent in B-25 bombers from a carrier at sea to attack military targets in Japan . Leader: Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle (pictured above) led the 80 airmen on the daring raid on Tokyo during World War II . The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on 18 April 1942, was an air raid by the United States during World War II. The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, caused negligible material damage to Japan, but helped to boost a wounded nation's morale in the aftermath of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. US Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, with five crewmen on each were launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, took off from the aircraft carrier on less than 500 feet of runway. They had only enough fuel to drop their bombs on military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety. Pilots volunteered and trained in Florida for what they only knew was 'extremely hazardous.' Navigator Griffin, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, got top-secret briefings with pilot David Jones in Washington, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Once at sea, the rest learned targets - factories, plants, military facilities on mainland Japan. They knew the uncertainties: what if the Navy task force was attacked? What defences would they face? And with B-25s unable to land on a carrier decks, could they reach friendly bases in China? Aircraft: The raid, led by Lieutenant Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle, B-25B Mitchell medium bomber launched without fighter escort from an aircraft carrier in the Pacific . The Raiders brushed aside Doolittle's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw. After encountering Japanese patrols, the raid launched ahead of plan, some 200 miles farther from shore for fuel-stretched bombers. Doolittle's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck. They flew low in radio silence, skimming seas and then treetops. Cole recalls the country song 'Wabash Cannonball' running through his head. He tapped his foot in time until Doolittle shot him a questioning look. They were greeted by anti-aircraft guns and puffs of black smoke. Flak shook planes. When they arrived at the target, Col. Doolittle ordered to open up the bomb bay doors. The bombs dropped, and the raiders 'got the heck out of there.' The danger was just beginning. All 16 planes lacked enough fuel to reach bases and either crash-landed or ditched in dark, rough weather along China's coast south of Shanghai. They narrowly stayed ahead of Japanese searchers, who killed villagers suspected of helping the Americans. Eight Raiders were captured, and three executed. A fourth died in captivity. Three had died off the coast of China. In the end, fourteen crews, except for one crewman, returned either to the United States or to American forces. Bird's eye view: The 16 planes, loaded with one-ton bombs, would fly over military targets in Japan and try to land in China with the hope that the Chinese would help them to safety .","Lt. Col.

"The Obama administration has hit out at Britain for developing closer ties with China after the UK applied to join a new $50billion Asian bank. Britain wants to become a founding member of a proposed Chinese-led financial institution that analysts say could rival the World Bank. But in a rare slapdown, the US administration  has criticised one of its closest allies for its 'constant accommodation' of China. Strained: The US administration has hit out at Britain for its 'constant accommodation' of China in a rare public slapdown. Barack Obama and David Cameron are pictured together in Washington in January . Downing Street yesterday acknowledged the rift, saying: 'There will be times when we take a different approach (to the US).' The British Treasury said on Thursday that it will join talks this month on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's structure and governance arrangements. China proposed the bank in 2013 to finance construction of roads and other infrastructure. It has pledged to put up most of its initial $50billion in capital. But the Financial Times has quoted a US administration source as saying Britain took its decision after showing 'virtually no consultation with the US' and as G7 was still discussing how to approach the new bank. The source said: 'We are wary about a trend toward constant accommodation of China, which is not the best way to engage a rising power.' The Financial Times reports that the comments are an apparent breach of the 'special relationship' between Britain and America. It reports that relations between David Cameron's government and Washington were already strained amid concerns over the level of Britain's defence spending. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said the deal was in Britain's 'national interest' and Sir Christopher Hum, a former British ambassador to China, said there were direct benefits potentially for British industry.' The Obama administration has expressed concern the new Asian bank could undercut the World Bank and International Monetary Fund . He said the new bank, which will provide funding for infrastructure projects across Asia, would enable British firms to invest in a string of massive schemes. But Dr Pippa Malmgren, a former adviser to George W Bush, said the US is concerned the bank could be used to further China’s bid to become the world’s leading superpower. There are also fears in Washington that David Cameron’s drive to boost exports and growth is making Britain blind to the risks of dealing with China. In a statement yesterday, the White House said it was concerned about whether the new bank would meet ‘environmental and social safeguards’, adding pointedly: ‘This is the UK’s sovereign decision. We hope and expect that the UK will use its voice to push for adoption of high standards.’ But a senior official went further, telling the Financial Times that the deal appeared to be part of a trend towards ‘constant accommodation’ of China by the UK. Twenty-one other governments including India, New Zealand and Thailand have said they want to join the new bank. For now, the United States and its close allies Japan, South Korea and Australia are not part of the new club. The bank is one of a series of initiatives by Beijing to increase its influence in global finance and expand trade links with its Asian neighbors and developing countries in Africa and Latin America. George Osborne (pictured during a visit to Beijing last year) says joining the bank will help Britain promote commercial ties with Asia . Although Obama's administration has said it is not opposed to the new bank, Washington has expressed concern that it will allow looser lending standards for the environment, labour rights and financial transparency, undercutting the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. China is the top trading partner for most of its neighbors. They want to promote commercial ties but are uneasy about Beijing's strategic ambitions, especially at a time when it is embroiled in territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea and with Vietnam and other Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea. Beijing has tried to soothe security concerns, insisting its initiatives are not aimed at any potential foreign rival. 'The initiatives are not China's solo, but a symphony performed by all relevant countries,' said Foreign Minister Wang Yi this week, according to Chinese state television. The British Treasury's announcement said it would try to ensure the Asian bank 'embodies the best standards in accountability, transparency and governance.' Chancellor George Osborne said in a statement that joining will help Britain promote commercial ties with Asia. 'This government has actively promoted closer political and economic engagement with the Asia-Pacific region and forging links between the UK and Asian economies to give our companies the best opportunity to work and invest in the world’s fastest growing markets is a key part of our long term economic plan. 'Joining the AIIB at the founding stage will create an unrivalled opportunity for the UK and Asia to invest and grow together,' Mr Osborne said. Chinese President Xi Jinping (pictured) has called for the creation of a new Asian structure for security cooperation based on a 24-nation group that excludes the United State . According to the Financial Times, the UK Treasury has denied Britain made the decision out of the blue insisting there was 'at least a month of extensive consultation' at G7 level. The newspaper says US Treasury secretary Jack Lew was involved in these discussions. Britain's announcement was not welcomed in Washington last night. A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said: 'It is important to note that countries that become . prospective members of the AIIB will be responsible for the . standards adopted in the articles of agreement and their . implementation. 'This is the UK's sovereign decision. We hope and expect . that the UK will use its voice to push for adoption of high . standards,' he said. China's Ministry of Finance said it welcomed Britain's . decision, and would consult with the AIIB's existing founding . members on its proposed entry. 'If all goes well, the UK will become a founding member of . the AIIB by the end of March,' it said in a statement on its . website. Other governments joining the bank include Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, Laos, Cambodia, Oman, Uzbekistan, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Malaysia and Myanmar. In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the creation of a new Asian structure for security cooperation based on a 24-nation group that excludes the United States. This morning, it was reported that president of the World Bank welcomed the setting up of the AIIB, a day after Britain . became the first Western nation to embrace the institution. Jim Yong Kim, The president of the World Bank (pictured), has welcomed the setting up of the AIIB . With US interest rates likely to rise later this year, . capital flows to emerging markets and low-income countries will . face greater challenges over time, Jim Yong Kim told a news . conference. 'From the perspective simply of the need for more . infrastructure spending, there's no doubt that from our . perspective, we welcome the entry of the Asian Infrastructure . Investment Bank,' he said. 'As the U.K. just announced today in their statement, they . were very clear in saying that they were going to insist that . the standards of any new bank that they are part of would be . equal to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank,' Kim added. China said earlier this year a total of 26 countries are . founder members, mostly from Asia and the Middle East. 'Generally speaking, the international reaction has been . positive,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in . Beijing. 'The AIIB will abide by the principles of openness, . inclusivity, transparency, responsibility and equality ... and . fully reference the good practices of multilateral banks to . avoid some of the detours they have taken,' he added. While Hong did not respond directly to U.S. concerns about . the bank, China's official Xinhua news agency took a stronger . line. 'The response of the US government exhibited nothing but a . childish paranoia towards China,' it said in an English-language . commentary, slamming what it called 'reflective scepticism'.","Britain looking to become founding member of Chinese-led regional bank .

"A married senior insurance broker and junior employee who were caught having an office affair are understood to no longer work at the firm where their sex romp was filmed by pub patrons from across the road. The 50-year-old regional manager and the 25-year-old woman are no longer employees at the Marsh Ltd insurance firm in Christchurch and have not returned since the incident on January 30 made international headlines,The New Zealand Herald reports. However it is understood that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees, a source told The New Zealand Herald. The man and woman involved in the office sex scandal in Christchurch have lost their jobs . The 50-year-old regional manager and the 25-year-old junior employee have not returned to the Marsh Ltd insurance firm (pictured) since the incident took place on January 30 . An employment investigation was instigated following the scandal and all parties are now prohibited from speaking due to a confidentiality agreement. It comes after reports that the man, who is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter, was fighting to keep his job while appearing to live at home alone, according to The New Zealand Herald. It is still unclear if his wife is standing by him. The steamy encounter between the two took place in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action. Video footage and photographs taken by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide. It is understood that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees . Patrons at the Carlton Bar and Eatery (pictured) captured the scandalous behaviour and the footage went viral . Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man's wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook. The 25-year-old junior office employee involved in the scandal is understood to also be avoiding attention and has since moved from her home. Her fiancé spoke to a local radio station following the event to defend his former partner, revealing they had ended their relationship six months earlier, according to The New Zealand Herald.

The  secretary's ex-fiancé spoke to a local radio station following the event to defend his former partner, revealing they had ended their relationship six months earlier . Last month the Daily Mail revealed that a friend of the man's brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved. 'When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,' the friend said. 'After he didn't reply he even asked, 'It's not you is it?' He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.' When the Daily Mail Australia called at the regional manager's house in the affluent Christchurch suburb of Sumner to speak with him, the man refused to open his door or answer any questions. The man was revealed as a husband and father of two. His wife found out about the incident after she saw it on Facebook .

"Swaggering away from court: Lee Cairns, 43, and his daughter Kelly Lamb (pictured), 23, left a man aged 79 unconscious in an unprovoked attack . This is the shameless swagger of a father walking free from court despite knocking a 79-year-old man unconscious after his daughter attacked the victim's car. Lee Cairns, 43, of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, took a ‘running leap’ at Stan Roberts and punched him in the face in an unprovoked attack in nearby North Shields. Mr Roberts, who suffered cuts to his nose and cheek and required treatment from an ambulance crew after the attack, said he had ‘never been punched so hard in my life’. The attack happened last July at the home of his ex-wife, 38-year-old trainee nurse Yejide, North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court was told. There had been an earlier clash between the couple and Cairns’s daughter Kelly Lamb, 23, a mother with a one-year-old child, which resulted in damage caused to Mrs Roberts’s car. Minutes later, Cairns stormed to the home and attacked Mr Roberts, punching him once to the face with such force that it knocked him out. When police arrived to arrest Cairns at his home, he snatched a baton from one officer and threatened to ‘take his head off’. Cairns, who admitted assault, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer, will be sentenced later this month. Lamb admitted  criminal damage and was given an 18-month conditional discharge, as well as being fined more than £400 in compensation and costs. Maimuna Bappa, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr Roberts was visiting his ex-wife at her property when they heard a loud knock on the door. He went to the door and found a young lady, identified as Kelly Lamb. She was asking for them to move their motor vehicle from outside their address. ‘After the verbal altercation, he did move the car. There was some aggression but, after they moved it, they sat down to watch TV. Twenty minutes later, some people came to the door again.’ Cairns hurled abuse at Mr and Mrs Roberts, before entering the house and attacking Mr Roberts. Attacked: Stan Roberts (above), who suffered cuts to his nose and cheek and required treatment from an ambulance crew after the attack, said he had 'never been punched so hard in my life' Mr Bappa added: ‘He saw him draw his right fist back and punch him in the face. He was bleeding heavily from his face as a result and collapsed by the living room door.’ Cairns and Lamb each then kicked the door of Mrs Roberts’s car, leaving a dent. Mr Roberts was treated in hospital before he discharged himself. He said: ‘He said he punched me once but he knocked me out, so I don’t actually know how many times I was hit. ‘Cairns saw me and took a running leap towards me and punched me so hard he split my nose and cheek. I went down and I was on the floor. Location: The attack happened last July at the home of Mr Roberts's ex-wife, 38-year-old trainee nurse Yejide, on this road (file picture) in North Shields, Tyne and Wear . ‘I’m 79 and not used to being bashed like that. I was knocked out then I was in a haze and all I could see was the floor and an increasing pool of red blood around me.’ The incident left Nigerian-born Mrs Roberts so terrified she was forced to leave her home. She said: ‘It’s affected me so badly. I had to move house and I hardly ever leave the house now in case I bump into them in the street. ‘It has left me a nervous wreck and affected my career as a student nurse. I hope they get punished.’ Referring to the assault on the police officer, Ms Bappa said: ‘The officer went to arrest the defendant and he attempted to walk away. Sentenced: Lamb was given an 18-month conditional discharge at North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court (above), as well as being fined more than £400 in compensation and costs. Cairns will be sentenced later this month . ‘He became aggressive and, after he had one hand cuffed, he used his other hand to pull the baton from the officer’s belt and raised it above his head and threatened to hit the officer. 'He said he would “take the officer’s head off” with the baton.’ Richard Haswell, defending Lamb, said: ‘She’s a young lady with a one-year-old child. She’s in work. She’s got involved and lost her temper and kicked the door.’ She was ordered to pay £255 compensation, £150 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Mr Haswell, also representing Cairns, said his case should be adjourned for the preparation of pre-sentence reports. District Judge Bernard Begley said: ‘This was a serious and nasty incident. An elderly man was injured.’","Lee Cairns took 'running leap' at Stan Roberts and punched him in face .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has defended himself against the suggestion in a live radio interview that he is guilty of bullying behaviour. ABC radio host Jon Faine probed Tony Abbott while the prime minister was on his way an anti-bullying conference in Melbourne on Friday morning. Mr Faine questioned Mr Abbott's credibility on speaking about the topic when he had been accused of being a bully himself. Prime Minister Tony Abbott 9left) has been grilled in a scathing radio interview with ABC radio host Jon Faine (right) Mr Abbott released a video this week addressing Australian youths and pledging his allegiance to victims of bullying. 'What credibility do you have on bullying - you've been accused of it so often yourself?' Mr Faine asked. 'You yourself admit you have an aggressive streak - isn't that the core of bullying?' Mr Abbott responded by saying the comment was 'without foundation.' 'Obviously when I feel strongly about things I argue strongly for them but of the things I've always tried to do is give credit where it's due,' Mr Abbott told Mr Faine. In another segment, the broadcaster asked the prime minister about a string of controversial comments. He mentioned Mr Abbott's recent comment about Aboriginal people living in remote communities as being 'lifestyle choices' and his comparing of Labor leader Bill Shorten to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebells. 'Mr Abbott, for a Rhodes scholar, how come you say so many stupid things?' he asked. Mr Faine questioned the Prime Ministers credibility in adressing bullying, being an accused bully himself . In another segment, the Prime Minister was asked why he continues to make ill-advised comments despite his esteemed education . 'All of us from time to time in the heat of debate, and you know how heated the Parliament can get, sometimes can go too far,' Mr Abbott said. It comes after Mr Abbott sparked outcry on Thursday when he likened Labour Party leader Bill Shorten to the Germany WWII propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. One month earlier, Abbott had referenced the Nazi's another time when he claimed job losses in the Defence industry under the former Labor government amounted to a 'Holocaust of jobs'. Last week, Mr Abbott prompted furore for indigenous communities when he backed a plan in to close more than 100 remote communities saying 'what we can't do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'.","ABC broadcaster interviewed Mr Abbott before an anti-bullying conference .

"The University of Melbourne has been named the most prestigious university in Australia for the second year in a row, according to a global study. With five institutions in the top 100 Australia is ranked equal fourth in the Times Higher Education world-wide reputation rankings. Unlike the university rankings released in October which is based on 13 objective performance indicators, this list interestingly focuses on research and teaching reputation. It is based on the subjective opinions of 10,000 senior academics who are scattered across 142 countries. Scroll down for video . Melbourne University made the top 50 two years in a row with a ranking of 41 . With research initiatives looking at creating a bionic eye and pushing the boundaries of stem cell research, Melbourne, which is the second oldest university in Australia, climbed two places from last year to lead the nation at number 43. University of Melbourne #41 . Australian National University #51-60 . University of Sydney #51-60 . University of Queensland #81-90 . Monash University #91-100 . Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Susan Elliott, said she was thankful to the global education community who had recognised the hard work put in by those at the university. “We’re pleased to again measure up so highly against some of the best institutions in the world. These results reflect a global awareness of the University’s activity by many of our academic peers.” “The result highlights the strong international connections staff at the University have made over an extended period of time, and is a wonderful endorsement of the significant work our staff are doing to tackle many of the global challenges facing our world today.” Just missing the cut for the top 50 is Australian National University and the University of Sydney, who both placed in the 51-60 grouping. Australian National University made the 51-61 grouping beating University of Queensland . University of Sydney also made the top 100 in the 51-61 grouping . The University of Queensland has stayed in the 81-90 bracket with Monash University clawing back to the top 100 taking a spot in the 91-100 bracket. Looking internationally,there are no surprises that Harvard took out the top spot with Cambridge and Oxford following in third and fourth positions respectively. Rounding out the top five the US took a hit as MIT and Stanford dropped from the top three to fourth and fifth. Harvard has been number one since 2011 when the reputation survey started . University of Cambridge moved up from 4th place to 2nd in the 2015 reputation rankings . 1. Harvard University (US) 2. University of Cambridge (UK) 3. University of Oxford (UK) 4.

California Institute of Technology (US) 10. Columbia University (US) Rankings editor Phil Baty said over the past 5 years we have seen a fairly stable ranking for Australian universities, ignoring a slight dip last year. He argued last year’s poor performance could have been partly due to the announcement of budget cuts that could have directly influenced universities research capabilities. Although he claims the current deregulation debate may have boosted the country’s position in 2015. “Talking about the kind of fees they could potentially charge may have raised awareness of the top Australian universities,” he said. Australian institutions also work closely with Asian universities which he claims are less well known by European and US academics. China gained ground in the 2015 reputation rankings, with Tsinghua University rising ten places to 26 and Peking rising from 41 to 32.","Australian universities ranked fourth overall in reputation .

"Heartwarming pictures of students in Vanuatu laying books out in the sun to dry so they can return to school have emerged. The pictures show hundreds of books from the Central School library, which was blown away in the storm, littered across the schoolyard. Reportedly, students, teachers and school headmaster Paul Alexander Hatyay  went to the effort of putting the books out so that they can be put to good use in the classroom again as soon as possible. Students and teachers at Vanuatu's Central School in Port Vila have put hundreds of books out to dry in the sunshine . The school's library was flooded after the roof was blown away in last week's cyclone . International aid agencies ramped up appeals for cyclone-hit Vanuatu on Wednesday, warning that the powerful storm that affected more than two-thirds of the South Pacific island nation . However, the desperate search is still on for people lost in the storm, included an Australian teenager who sent few parents a text message as the storm was about to hit. It was a typically loving message from a daughter to her mother: 'I love you more than most things'. It was also the last time Australian parents Alison Abernethy and Rob Marshall have heard from their daughter Zoe, 18, since Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu five days ago. The Canberra couple are worried sick about Zoe - a 'really good kid' who often makes her parents laugh - who is volunteering in a  school near Namaram on the island of Pentecost. 'She would have tried to contact us,' Ms Abernethy told Daily Mail Australia. 'She would have known that we're really worried about her.' Zoe Marshall (pictured on the day she left for Vanuatu) is volunteering for the charity Latitude near Namaram on the island of Pentecost . Tens of thousands of children are in urgent need of assistance in Vanuatu after tropical Cyclone Pam ripped through the island . Devastation:Cyclone Pam has hit South Pacific islands on Saturday with hurricane force winds, huge ocean swells and flash flooding and has caused severe damage to housing . 'I love you more than most things': This is last text message Alison Abernethy has received from her daughter, Zoe Marshall, since Cyclone Pam struck . But communications are down on the island and it does not help that she is staying in an 'incredibly remote' location, her mother said. 'If you find her just hand her a SatPhone or take a photo so that we know she's alive,' Mr Marshall wrote in a blog post titled 'Where's my girl?' on Wednesday. In her last messages, the aspiring engineering student had told her parents that the village was well-prepared and that it 'should be fine'. 'Sorry for the early text but don't know when phone will work. We've got cat 5 warning. Should hit us tonight. Should be all good,' she said. She said a rat had chewed part of her sandal and, to her parents' amusement, she pledged to fill the rat's nest with rocks after the storm passed. Zoe - who was working with 18 other volunteers for the charity Lattitude - is not missing, her family said, but she and her fellow volunteers not been accounted for in the wake of enormous storm. She has donated her time to young people on the island, living in a village with'limited electricity, no running water and pit toilets.

"Known for its innovation, Dubai is set to ramp it up even further with the building of a Museum of the Future. The flashy Gulf city with a skyline that looks like something out of a science fiction film is embracing its love of all things new with its now customary ambitious plans. The £89 million ($136 million) museum in Dubai will showcase innovations in design and technology in fields such as transportation, health and education, said Emirati minister of cabinet affairs Mohammed Gergawi. Dubai's new plans for the Museum of the Future is set to cost around £90 million to erect and will be opened in 2017 . The venue is expected to open in 2017. The curving, oblong - and of course futuristic-looking - building will feature poetry written by the Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is also the Emirati prime minister. Mr Gergawi said the museum aims to change its exhibits every six months to keep pace with changing technology, with a goal 'to always be 10 years ahead of today'. It will play the part of attraction and research facility, decked throughout with the latest in technology including 3D elements. There will also be poetry within the walls by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. The ring represents what we know today, while the hole represents all that is unknown, according to architect Shaun Killa . The £89 million museum in Dubai will showcase innovations in design and technology in fields such as transportation, health and education . Lifts in the building resemble futuristic time capsules, and there isn't expected to be any windows in the venue, meaning air conditioning will be extensive. The design has been constructed by architect Shaun Killa, who is based in Dubai. The Dubai Chronicle describes how Killa states the 'ring like solid element of the structure represents what we know today while the hole stands for the unknown. The project is set to cost around £89million ($136 million) and is part of the development of investments on innovation and technology. Emirati Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammed al-Gergawi talks to reporters during a presentation for 'Museum of the Future' Shaun Killa, who won the competition for the design, describes the concept of Museum of the Future in front of the project's model at the UAE Prime Minister Office in Dubai, United Arab Emirates . The authorities in Dubai are already finalising plans on the development of 'Aladdin City.' Comprising six towers, all connected by moving walkways, the development is inspired by the tales of Aladdin from the Middle Eastern folk Tale The Arabian Nights and the more modern Disney blockbuster. The towers are said to be similar in design to the genie lamp, and are set to shimmer golden in the . The highest of the towers will measure 34 storeys; the development will spread some 1,500 feet along Dubai Creek, encompassing 4,000 acres in total. The area is a popular spot for old wooden fishing boats, and maintains an air of tradition about it; the new plans will fall outside the area set to be named a UNESCO World Heritage site.

"Bosses at the Harry Potter studio tour have been accused of mistreating owls. Animal rights campaigners said camera flashes were extremely distressing for the birds, which have highly sensitive eyes. They are also kept in small cages for long periods and forced to perform ‘demeaning’ tricks, a report added. Undercover footage shows birds chewing at their tethers and shaking their heads, apparently in alarm. A Harry Potter tour that keeps owls in cages and allows fans to touch them is 'cruel' and 'demeaning', animal rights campaigners have claimed . Secret footage obtained by the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) at the end of February shows how the owls are treated at The Making of Harry Potter tour . The owls are part of Warner Brothers’ Making of Harry Potter tour in Leavesden, Hertfordshire. In the books and films, Harry Potter has a pet snowy owl called Hedwig that was given to him as a birthday gift by gamekeeper Hagrid. Among its tasks was to fly into Hogwarts School to deliver Harry’s letters. At the studio tour, which costs £33 for an adult ticket, fans can meet ‘Hedwig’ as well as other animals from the franchise. The owls are a hit with visitors, many of whom take pictures with the birds to post on social media. But People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said flashes from cameras terrified the owls, while trainers encouraging people to stroke the birds left them agitated. The owls also perform tricks - like picking up a 'passport' with their beak - in front of crowds . The charity launched an undercover investigation after receiving complaints from concerned visitors to the attraction. It has called for the tour to stop using live animals. In a letter to Warner Brothers, Peta’s Yvonne Taylor said: ‘The “trainers” supervising the tour showed gross negligence both in handling the birds and in ensuring public safety. As well as the tricks, they actively encouraged flash photography. ‘Owls have especially acute vision and find blinding camera flashes extremely distressing – this can be seen in Peta’s footage as they respond by desperately chewing at their tethers and shaking their heads. ‘A trainer cajoled people to touch the frightened birds, ignoring signs telling people not to ... as well as being stressful for the owls this also interferes with the natural oils in their feathers that keep them warm.’ A lot of the owls at the tour are tethered to posts. The findings have prompted PETA to send a letter to Warner Brothers, which runs the tour, calling on the company to commit to a ban on using live animals . A tour spokesman said: 'The owls' welfare is of paramount importance to us and they are exclusively handled by the experts at Birds & Animals which owns and trains them' Harry Potter author JK Rowling has previously warned against keeping owls, saying: ‘If anybody has been influenced by my books to think an owl would be happiest shut in a small cage and kept in a house, I would like to say as forcefully as I can, you are wrong.’ A Harry Potter tour spokesman said the owls’ welfare ‘is of paramount importance to us and they are exclusively handled by the experts at Birds & Animals, which owns and trains them’. A spokesman for Birds & Animals, which provides animals for the entertainment industry, added: ‘During their appearance at the studio tour the owls were given regular breaks, they were not exposed to any situations that would make them distressed and they were checked by a vet.’","Owls also lined up on posts at The Making of Harry Potter tour .

"Con Edison found a 'hazardous situation' in August in one of the three buildings that was destroyed in an explosion and fire in Manhattan's East Village last week. Utility workers dispatched in August found 'dangerous gas line connections' after a Con Edison worker reading gas meters smelled gas, according to a Con Edison spokesman. The worker smelled gas on August 6 in the basement of the building that exploded at 121 Second Avenue on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Photographs show the three buildings that entirely collapsed following the East Village explosion last week . Firefighters kept blasting water at pockets of flames among the rubble on Friday as it continued to smoulder . Cars were flattened by the debris as the three buildings collapsed overnight following the explosion . When they were at the building in August, the utility workers found 'multiple leaks' in hoses that were connected to the gas line, the New York Times reported. The company spokesman said Con Edison shut off the building's gas for about ten days, until it was determined to be safe. The owner of Sushi Park, the restaurant where the explosion occurred, told the  Times that utility workers determined that gas intended for his restaurant was being siphoned off illegally for use in newly-renovated apartments upstairs. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that the blast was possibly tied to someone 'inappropriately' tapping into a gas line. An hour before the blast, Con Edison utility inspectors had been at the scene and determined that pre-existing work was not satisfactory, but the problems were not safety related, the mayor said. A general contractor who went to check out the gas leak report as Sushi Park was one of 50 people arrested in February in a sweep of the city by building and housing inspectors. Dilber Kukic was accused of bribing an undercover investigator to dismiss violations at two properties, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. He is hospitalized and could not be reached for comment. In all 11 buildings were evacuated after the blast, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay . New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could take up to a week for rubble to be cleared from the explosion site . Firefighters have gone through the rubble but Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Luconare, 26, are stil missing . Twenty-two people were injured - four critically - and Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Lucon, 26, remain unaccounted for after the explosion. On Saturday, rescue crews with cadaver dogs clawed through smoldering rubble in the search for Figueroa and Lucon. Authorities said it could take a week of careful digging through twisted debris, bricks and splintered wood before the basement is reached. In all 11 buildings were evacuated, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay. Con-Ed said they may return to their homes as soon as Sunday. The Manhattan district attorney's office and the NYC Department of Investigation are looking into whether gas and plumbing work being done privately in one building led to the explosion.

After the war Coffey stayed in Japan for 13 years, working as an Army civilian in Okinawa before she moved back to Texas. Coffey worked in a procurement office at an air force base in San Antonio and retired in 1971. Last summer Coffey was able to take an Honor flight to Washington, D.C. and visit the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to the San Antonio Express News. Coffey said she wanted to visit the nation's capital to see things 'that were not there before'. 'It's been a long time since I've been in Washington,' she said. 'But I would like to go to see the things that are there.' Coffey (pictured in 2014) looks at a picture of her taken in Okinawa. After the war Coffey stayed in Japan for 13 years and worked as an Army civilian . Honor flights are organized by non-profit organizations to help bring US military veterans for a free trip to visit memorials commemorating the wars they fought in. While in the capital Coffey also sat down with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. Obama gave Coffey one of his presidential command coins, saying 'I only give that to my good friends.' After he left Biden told the veteran he was reminded of 'every time I had a good-looking date.' 'There's be some better looking guy coming along,' he said. 'Trying to take her.' Coffey's friend Queta Marquez, a veterans service officer, memorialized her best. 'She was truly a pioneer,' Marquez said. 'Full of life and spunk.' Coffey will be laid to rest with her family in Indiana.","Lucy Coffle died in her sleep in San Antonio on Thursday .

"The completed stone tomb of Richard III is to go on public display after being lowered into position overnight - 530 years after his death in battle. A special service marking the end of the king's journey from his forgotten grave under a council car park to a place of honour in Leicester Cathedral is being held today. The 2.3-ton tombstone, with its Christian cross carved on the top, was lifted carefully into place overnight, sealing the king beneath. Scroll down for video . Final resting place: The completed stone tomb (pictured) of Richard III is to go on public display after being lowered in to position . A special 'service or reveal' marking the end of the king's journey to the cathedral will take place today . The 2.3-ton tombstone, which features a Christian cross carved on the top, was lifted  into place overnight at Leicester Cathedral . The setting of the great slab of Yorkshire Swaledale stone marks the end of a week in which the king was reinterred in a ceremony that included a poetry reading by actor Benedict Cumberbatch. The Queen called yesterday's service a moment of 'great national significance'. Organisers aimed to rebury the king with the 'dignity and honour' he was denied in death, after his original burial in a hastily-dug grave in the old Greyfriars church following his death at Bosworth field. The cathedral said it was expecting 'a considerable number of visitors from all over the world' to come and see the king's completed memorial. The king was reinterred in a ceremony at Leicester Cathedral yesterday in a service described by The Queen as a moment of 'great national significance' Actor Benedict Cumberbatch (pictured), Downton Abbey creator and writer Julian Fellowes attended the service, alongside the Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Glouceste . Today's 'service or reveal' will include interpretative dance charting the rediscovery of Richard's grave, the science behind identifying his remains and his reburial. A banner with the king's coat of arms, provided by the Richard III Society, will also be hung over the tomb in the ambulatory during the service. Liz Hudson, the cathedral's communications director, said: 'King Richard III's tomb is now a permanent feature in Leicester Cathedral. Archaeologists discovered the king under a council car park not far from the cathedral in August 2012 . 'However, there are still a considerable number of visitors from all over the world in Leicester who we expect will want to take a last opportunity to see it before returning home. 'We anticipate a great deal of interest and suggest that people who live locally may find it easier to plan a visit to see the tomb at a slightly later date.' Last Sunday, more than 35,000 lined the streets for a procession of the king's coffin from the University of Leicester, whose archaeologists discovered his grave, to Bosworth and finally on to Leicester. Throughout the week, thousands waited in line for hours to see Richard's coffin as it lay in repose in the cathedral, before yesterday's reinterment presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Downton Abbey creator and writer Julian Fellowes and historical novelist Philippa Gregory attended the service, alongside the Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. Archaeologists discovered the king under a council car park not far from the cathedral in August 2012, after a campaign to find him led by Philippa Langley. An extensive series of scientific tests established that the skeleton, found in a grave too short for his body, was that of the last Yorkist king. His final rest was delayed by months after distant relatives brought an unsuccessful legal challenge through the courts, arguing he should be reburied in York.","The completed stone tomb of Richard III was lifted into position overnight .

Scroll down for video . Bellslea Hills Pet Hotel and Spa in Ayrshire has 28 suites starting from the price of £29.40  per night . Each room comes with a webcam so pets can enjoy their favourite tv show, or feel cosy with a warm crackling fire on screen . The exclusive retreat offers 38 five-star rooms, which are able to house multiple dogs from the same family if owners wish. Will Aitken, managing director, said: 'Bellslea Hills Pet Hotel and Spa is the first of its kind in the UK; the only comparable facilities are located in Beverley Hills and Hollywood. 'Many dog owners put on a TV for their pet when they leave the home for any period of time during the day, which is why all our suites feature TVs for dogs to watch and listen to their favourite daytime show or, alternatively, the TVs can screen an image of a crackling log fire to give the suite a warm, homely feel.' The TVs are also equipped with webcams which have 360 degree rotation and are able to be controlled by a smart phone. Owners are able to talk to their pets, wherever they are in the world, with the in-built dual audio system. There is also an infrared function with the webcam to give 24/7 vision on the pets, which owners can watch from around the world.

When pets are not relaxing in their suites, they can take advantage of the bone-shaped splash pool, or play in the indoor state-of-the-art hygienic artificial grass play area. Mr Aitken said: 'As a dog lover, I know what level of care I would want for my own pets and that is precisely what we have designed Bellslea Hills to deliver. 'I'm convinced that, like me, rather than a standard kennel, pet owners would much rather place their beloved dogs in a facility offering the highest possible quality and providing exceptional levels of care and comfort.' Rooms can be booked so more than one of your dogs can stay in the stay suite for company . Pets will be pampered from the moment they arrive, and you can observe all their antics on the webcams in their room.

"The parents of two 'best friend' sisters who were killed in a car crash while on holiday in Morocco will never know what caused the accident. British representatives in Morocco were unable to obtain any information or evidence from local agencies into the deaths of Pippa and Tara Darlington, two 'best friends' who died on the 'adventure of a lifetime', an inquest has heard. A senior coroner today criticised foreign governments and agencies for making it increasingly difficult to obtain evidence into British citizens dying abroad. The two 'beautiful' and dynamic' sisters were killed in a horrific road accident while on holiday. The parents of two 'best friend' sisters Pippa and Tara Darlington, who were killed in a car crash while on holiday in Morocco, will never know what caused the accident after British agents were unable to find any information from Moroccan authorities . Pippa (left) and Tara (right) were both students at university. A senior coroner today criticised foreign governments and agencies for making it increasingly difficult to obtain evidence into British citizens dying abroad . Pippa Darlington, a 21-year-old law student at Newcastle University, was driving a VW Golf northbound on the N1, just 14km south of the town of Tarfaya. She and her elder sister Tara, a 23-year-old media student at Goldsmiths College in London who was sitting in the front passenger seat, died at the scene from multiple traumatic injuries. The inquest, at Salisbury Coroner's Court, Wiltshire, heard their car lost control and veered across the carriageway at around 5am local time. Their friend Joshua Stump, then 21, was a backseat passenger in the car when it struck a Renault Clio coming in the opposite direction and spun into a head-on collision with a 4x4. Mr Stump was seriously injured in the collision along with four other people, while five people were treated for minor injuries. Pippa, Tara and Joshua had arrived in Morocco together two days earlier on September 15 2012 on their travels through Africa, where they also visited Mauritania. The sisters, from from Whiteparish near Salisbury, were described as 'each other's soulmates' in moving family statements at the time of their death. Mr Ridley today said that despite attempts to ascertain why Pippa lost control, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were unable to produce evidence for the inquest. The pair (Tara, left, and Pippa, right)  had been travelling across Africa before they were tragically killed . He added the Moroccan authorities may not have even conducted any investigation at all and that Joshua was unable to help with evidence because he was asleep at the time. He added that during his time as a coroner, his investigations have been hampered because he has encountered such problems more regularly in recent years. Resuming an inquest into their deaths in southern Morocco on September 17 2012, Mr Ridley today said: 'This has taken two and a half years to get to this stage. 'The reason it's taken such a long time is the efforts of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to liaise through diplomatic channels with the Moroccan government. 'A state representative said there have been numerous attempts to secure results of investigations carried out. 'While there is a responsibility on a coroner to carry out an investigation the trouble is we don't always get evidence from crime scenes in relation to that investigation. 'We rely on the corporations, foreign governments and the agencies in those foreign countries to assist and sadly in this case the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's attempts to get evidence into the deaths of both Pippa and Tara has failed. 'This happens, sadly, and the problem is increasing in recent years. I'm not going to say anything further on the subject but it makes our ability to carry out investigations very difficult.' Trip of a lifetime: The sisters and their friend had been holidaying in Morocco when the accident happened near Rabat (pictured) Recording verdicts of death by road traffic collision, he added: 'I'm sorry our efforts to produce more information in relation to their deaths and perhaps to how Pippa came to lose control of the vehicle have not produced results. 'It may be the case there was no investigation as would have normally been the case if an incident occurred in England and Wales. We have bespoke road traffic collision investigators. 'They were driving to this remote location of this particular incident and that may be why our efforts have not produced anything more substantial.' He continued: 'I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends and on that note I bring the inquest finally to a close.' Their heartbroken parents Patrick and Emma Darlington parents told of their 'complete devastation' and said their daughters had brought 'light and laughter to whoever met them' in statements released at the time of their deaths. Former wine merchant Patrick and his life coach wife Emma said: 'We are as a family completely devastated at the loss of both our daughters. Their friend Joshua Stump, then 21, was a backseat passenger in the car when it struck a Renault Clio coming in the opposite direction and spun into a head-on collision with a 4x4 . 'They were two of the most beautiful, dynamic, energetic and fun-loving girls who brought light and laughter to whoever met them. 'They made a difference to so many lives and they lit up every room on entering. 'This trip was to be an adventure of a lifetime for which they had planned, worked hard and saved together for months to be able to do.' Both girls were about to enter their final years at university with Tara, who had been offered a job in New York, looking at a career in journalism and Pippa in law. The devastated Darlingtons described Tara as 'beautiful, charming and vivacious' and Pippa, who obtained three As at A Level, as 'off-the-wall, fun, thoughtful and loyal'. The Darlingtons added: 'They were having the time of their life and promised to be home in ten days.' The girls' younger brother Oscar, then 15, added: 'They are my darling sisters and I love them very much. I was just reaching an age where we could do things together. 'Gone so soon but will never be forgotten and always in my heart.' The family chose not to attend today's inquest.","British agents unable to obtain any information into the deaths of Pippa and Tara Darlington, two 'best friends' who died on 'adventure of a lifetime'

"Shamed: Rolf Harris was jailed for 12 indecent assaults against four girls between 1968 and 1986 . Shamed former children's entertainer Rolf Harris has received tax and VAT rebates amounting to almost £200,000. The paedophile, 84, placed two of his companies - Rolf Harris Enterprises and Rhel Holdings into liquidation - and accounts reveal he and his wife were left with a windfall of £1.2 million. This included a £148,000 tax refund, plus they were entitled to an additional £48,000 in the form of a VAT refund, it has been reported. The total figure is £196,000 and it's believed Harris will give the majority of his fortune to his wife Alwen and his daughter Bindi, according to The Sun. Harris was jailed in July last year for 12 indecent assaults against four girls between 1968 and 1986. Last month it was revealed Harris could be earning as much as £1,300 a day from his prison cell thanks to his shrewd investments. ‘He is a convicted paedophile and yet he is ­making a large sum of money,’ a source close to his finances told the Sunday People. Harris invested much of his multi-million pound earnings from his long-running career as a TV star, musician and artist. At the time of his sentencing, his companies were worth £8.5 million, the Sunday People reported. New figures suggest his earnings have shot by £290,000, according to the newspaper. Harris also owns a home on the River Thames and his total assets could be worth more than £15 million. His oldest company, Rolf Harris Enterprises, was launched in 1963 and Rhel Holdings was set up in January 2012. Earlier this week, Harris was stripped of the CBE that was awarded to him by the Queen. The move came eight months after he was jailed for nearly six years for the attacks. The former children's star had his honour annulled at the order of the Queen, days after being stripped of his Australian honours. Officials at the Cabinet Office had been accused of dragging their feet over the issue, but sources insisted they had to follow established procedures before removing the gong. Rebates: Rolf Harris is expected to give most of his fortune to his wife Alwen (right) and his daughter Bindi . Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006. Harris was the second person to be convicted under a wide-ranging police investigation set up in the wake of revelations that the late Jimmy Savile, a fellow BBC star, was a prolific abuser.","Rolf Harris is said to have received rebates amounting to almost £200k .

"Consumers may be eager to get their hands on Samsung’s Galaxy S6 Edge with its curved screen. But a report hints that the South Korean firm is already working on its next-level displays for a fully foldable smartphone. Unlike the curved models available now, such as the S6 Edge and LG’s Flex 2, Samsung's Galaxy S7 could be flexible and bendy. A report hints that a fully foldable smartphone by Samsung could be ready as soon as next year. This image shows prototype curved screens unveiled last year . A spokesman for Samsung Display told Business Korea: ‘The industry believes that the commercialisation of foldable smartphones will be possible in 2016.’ A number of the curved screens, including those created by LG and Samsung, use high molecular substance-based polyimide film. This forms the backplane of the flexible panel and is used as an alternative to plastic. The material makes it possible to achieve the maximum curvature radius, which in Semiconductor Energy Laboratroy's display is 0.7-inches (2mm). Polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility. However, until other components such as batteries and processors are made to be flexible too, the dream of a roll-up smartphone will remain on the horizon. It is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment, as bendy displays could have many uses, such as in smartbands and laptops, for example. A spokesman from the industry said: ‘When flexible display technology is being used in e-books and laptops, which are substituted for publications, the concept of tiny portable PCs and e-books will be realised in reality.’ Rumours that Samsung was working on a bendable and virtually unbreakable version of its Galaxy handset first surfaced in 2012. The false rumour said that the handset, codenamed 'Project J' could be released in April 2013. Last year, LG demonstrated a 5.9-inch display that can be bent more than 100,000 times without being damaged, at an exhibition in Tokyo. It is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment, as bendy displays could have many uses, such as in smartbands (illustrated) and laptops, for example . The foldable display is made of layers of lights using organic light emitting diodes (OLED). It features touch sensors, meaning it works as a touchscreen at all angles and curvatures, and was demonstrated at the Display Innovation exhibition in Yokohama. In July, LG unveiled an 18-inch screen that can be rolled up and it hopes to expand the technology to work with 60-inch displays in the future. Earlier this month, Samsung revealed its next generation of Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S6 Edge, which features a curved 5.1 inch display. On the S6 Edge, notifications appear on either the right or left-hand side, depending on which hand the owner uses. Up to five contacts can be programmed to appear on this edge, and each contact is assigned a colour. Earlier this month, Samsung revealed its next generation of Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S6 Edge (pictured), which features a curved 5.1 inch display . To access a contact, users swipe the relevant colour and this reveals recent interactions and details about that person. Conversely, swiping the long edge of the screen shows the time, weather or other customised notifications. And when the phone is placed face down, the edge glows to show a phone call, text or email has been received. If these messages are from a saved contact, the edge will glow the relevant colour. Plus the curved screen increases the viewing width and height of videos and photos to make them appear 3D. Both the 6 Edge and the Galaxy 6 have metal cases and are the first to feature dual-standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets. People will need to pay extra for a Samsung non-slip wireless charger, but because it supports other standards both phones will work with any compatible charging dock. This image also shows the curvature of the phone's screen . David Kang, vice president of online at Samsung Mobile, told MailOnline: 'We've created not only what's next for the industry but set a new standard for smartphones.' 'We believe consumers and business alike will be impressed by the design but equally they'll be taken by the power and performance. 'What we've accomplished is an elegant balance between design and technology.' The S6 and S6 Edge will be available from 10 April in colours White Pearl, Black Sapphire. Gold Platinum and Blue Topaz. The S6 Edge will additionally be available in Green Emerald.","Next-generation model is expected to be flexible and bendy .

"One hundred years after the Battle of Gallipoli, a new Hollywood film starring and directed by Russell Crowe is poised to generate new interest in a region in Turkey where one of the darkest campaigns of the First World War was waged. The Water Diviner is believed to be the first feature film to shoot scenes inside Istanbul's famous Blue Mosque, which gained its name from its blue tiles. The film visits some of the key battleground areas as well as some of Turkey's beauty spots while telling a fictional tale that is built around the bloody campaign which lasted nearly a year. In  The Water Diviner, Russell Crowe plays a farmer who travels to Turkey to find his three missing sons as a promise to his late wife . The Water Diviner, due in cinemas on April 3, was the first feature film to be given access to film inside Istanbul's Blue Mosque . Much of the film was shot on location in Istanbul, in the bustling markets, as well as Gallipoli itself and the ‘ghost-village’ of Kayakoy . From April 1915 to January 1916, a 70,000 strong Allied army stormed Turkey in an effort to open up a supply route to provide Russia with much-needed supplies. The campaign, a major Allied failure, was seen as one of the greatest Ottoman victories. In Turkey, it is widely regarded as a defining moment in the nation's history; a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. The Water Diviner, a historical fictional drama based on the book of the same name by Andrew Anastasios and Dr Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios, sees Crowe play the role of an Australian farmer who travels to Turkey after the Battle of Gallipoli. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the greatest Ottoman victories during the First World War (pictured: Russell Crowe on location) The film sees Russell Crowe's character, Joshua Connor, travelling to Turkey to find his three sons who fought in the Battle of Gallipoli . Arriving in Istanbul, Russell Crowe's character falls in love with a beguiling Turkish hotelier and travels to the Gallipoli Peninsula . Crowe's character has lost his three sons  who fought for the ANZACS in the conflict, and has promised his late wife he will find them. Arriving in Istanbul, he falls in love with the beguiling Turkish hotelier and travels to the Gallipoli Peninsula. Much of the film was shot on location in Istanbul, in the bustling markets and in the glorious Blue Mosque, and it was reportedly the first time a feature film has been given access to the building. As well as filming in Istanbul and Gallipoli itself, several  scenes from the movie were shot in the ‘ghost-village’ of Kayaköy, which lays partially abandoned as a result of the enforced population exchange between Turkish and Greek citizens in 1923. The film focuses on the  bond of family and tells the story of the Gallipoli campaign  from the Turkish point of view . From April 1915 to January 1916, a 70,000 strong Allied army tried to push Turkey out of the war (pictured: Russell Crowe, right) The bloody Gallipoli campaign was a major Allied failure; but in Turkey, it is widely regarded as a defining moment in the nation's history . The film sees Russell Crowe (right) making his directorial debut  from the screenplay written by Andrew Knight and Andrew Anastasios . The main character, Connor, must travel across the war-torn landscape with the help of a Turkish First World War veteran . As well as Russell Crowe (pictured), the film's co-stars include Olga Kurylenko, Jai Courtney, Cem Yılmaz and Yılmaz Erdoğan . The Water Diviner had its premiere at the State Theatre in Sydney, Australia in December, but isn't being released in the UK until April . Today, Gallipoli and its surrounding areas remain largely unspoilt, due to strict conservation orders on all development. Kaya Valley, pictured . Turkey travel specialist, Exclusive Escapes, has introduced a new Gallipoli Tour to tie-in with the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign . The Water Diviner was filmed in and around Istanbul, including its famous Blue Mosque, which gets its name from its blue tiles . Today, Gallipoli and its surrounding areas remain largely unspoilt, due to strict conservation orders on all development. Around it, untouched forests, scrub and farmland and sunflowers flourish. With the film's anticipated release in the UK, tour operators in Turkey - a popular destination for British holidaymakers - are hoping to see an influx of visitors who are curious to visit the battleground and other key sites. Turkey specialist, Exclusive Escapes, has introduced a brand new Gallipoli tour to tie-in with the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign and the release of The Water Diviner, in UK cinemas from April 3. Guests can  fly into Istanbul, and be escorted by a private driver and a guide to the key sites including the Anzac sector, Cape Helles, the main British section, and well as a side-trip to the Unesco heritage site at Troy. Those wishing to extend the trip can also incorporate Ephesus, staying in nearby Alaçati at the boutique Alavya, the town’s newest luxury hotel.","This April sees the 100th anniversary of Gallopoli, one of the darkest periods of the First World War .

She had left the appliance in a wicker basket just after using it and went downstairs to make breakfast for her sons Patrick, 12, and five-year-old Edenn . After trying to tackle the fire with two buckets of water Ms George grabbed her children and their five-month-old bulldog George and ran from the rented terraced house in Mapperley, Nottinghamshire. Seconds after she fled the force of the blaze blew the window out of the front bedroom. Ms George who is studying access to social sciences at Nottingham Central College, said the blaze left her home looking like 'war-torn Syria'. She added: 'I was getting the kids ready for school and I had turned the hairdryer off. 'But there was a can of hairspray in the basket it was in so that caused the explosion. 'As I walked out of the door, the window went bang and exploded. After trying to tackle the fire with two buckets of water Ms George grabbed her children and their five-month-old bulldog George and ran from the rented terraced house in Mapperley, Nottinghamshire. But their belongings could not be saved, and were destroyed by the fire . Charred possessions, including a cabinet and wicker basket, could be seen scattered outside the home after the blaze over the weekend . 'If I'd gone back in the room I would have gone up with it. It was terrifying how close I was to being in the middle of that fire. 'People have said to me 'at the end of the day you and the kids are alive - you can replace everything else'. 'It did make me think though, how many women have got these hairdryers? 'I'm still in shock now. I've lost everything, all my children's keepsakes, photos, letters and Mother's Day presents were in my room. 'All the kid's clothes was black so we had to throw it out as well. 'The bedroom is completely wrecked, if you are standing in my room it looks like you're in war-torn Syria. 'The upstairs is completely black and downstairs is wet everywhere, it is just ruined.' The fire quickly spread, destroying the bedroom and the furniture inside and blew out a top floor window . Ms George, who moved into the rented property last month, has now been forced into temporary accommodation with her young sons, one of whom has mild cerebral palsy . Firefighters believe the blaze was sparked by the £20 Braun hairdryer which was left in a wicker basket next to a can of hairspray.

The ex-Chief of Defence Staff said he was 'mystified' about why the police had searched his home in Surrey. Detectives from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland have also raided the homes of Tory grandee Leon Brittan and former MP Harvey Proctor. Operation Midland is investigating claims boys senior members of the Establishment abused young men and boys in London and the south of England in the 1970s and 1980s. It includes claims that sex parties involving boys below the age of consent were held at the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment block near the Houses of Parliament. The operation includes detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command. It is also examining allegations three young men were murdered, . At 91, Lord Bramall – the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry – is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals. He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Officers from Operation Midland searched his home last Wednesday. He told the BBC: 'Categorically, never have I had a connection or anything to do with the matters being investigated. It is not in my character or my psyche.' He said: 'I know I have only had sex with someone other than my own sex.' He added that any suggestion he was involved in child abuse was 'absolutely a load of rubbish'. He said he had been to events at Dolphin Square 'four or fives times' but only once went into an apartment there. He has not been arrested, named as a suspect by police or questioned. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together. After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer – and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords – opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed 'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army. He told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you 'have to prepare for the unexpected'. Harvey Proctor insisted he was a 'discreet' man and had never been part of 'any rent boy ring' with Cabinet ministers, MPs or military top brass . The search of Lord Bramall's home took place on the same day as officers searched the Leicestershire home of ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, 68, prompting him to publicly deny any wrongdoing. Proctor, whose Parliamentary career ended in a rent boy 'spanking' scandal, said he was trapped in a 'Kafka-esque fantasy'. More than 1,000 people have been questioned by police investigating claims of historic sex abuse. The huge number, including suspects, victims and witnesses, lays bare the scale of the task facing detectives. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted the wave of allegations is consuming a huge amount of resources. But he pledged to get to the heart of the claims, no matter who was involved. Speaking on LBC Radio, Sir Bernard said his staff were 'determinedly working their way through' all the evidence, adding: 'We've now interviewed at least 1,000 people.' Asked whether the huge amount of resources required could be justified, he said victims deserve answers. 'What we cannot do is ignore people who were ignored 30 years ago,' he said. Sir Bernard added that police 'have to prioritise' but nevertheless have 'put tens of officers into these inquiries'. He said: 'We have got both witnesses and suspects that are scattered to the four winds. They are not grouped geographically like they were 30 years ago. 'But we will get to the bottom of it, I am sure we will, so far as it is possible.'

"Residents have accused a council of painting 'pointless' double yellow lines after two new no-parking zones measuring just 12 inches appeared on a London street. The road markings on Vernon Road in Leytonstone are big enough for a couple of toy cars - but couldn't fit the tyre of a real one. Waltham Forest Council defended the decision, saying the lines are there to separate parking bays for residents from those reserved for hire cars. Tight parking space: Two sets of yellow lines were painted on Vernon Road in Leytonstone, east London . Close-up: The road markings, pictred, barely fit too toy cars - and are far too short for the tyre of a real one . But the road markings don't take the title of Britain's shortest double yellow lines - which are believed to be on Hamilton Road, in Cambridge, and measure just 11 inches. Residents saw the funny side of the London no-parking zones. Emiko Kavanagh-Priest said: 'What pointless double yellow lines. I suppose you can never be too careful though.' While Phil Akell added: 'They must have problems with unicyclists parking there.' A spokesman for Waltham Forest Council said: 'These are installed to highlight the differing parking restrictions to motorists and to avoid any possible confusion as to what sign applies to which bay by providing some form of physical separation between the differing bays. 'Indeed in the past we have found that only providing a bay end markings to differentiate between contrasting parking bays can occasionally be obscured by the overhang of parked vehicles.'

"It looks like any other anonymous office building. But this nondescript garage in Sunnyvale, California, is where Apple is believed to be building its self driving 'Titan' cars. One blog claims the address is the HQ for the project which could one day take on Tesla. Scroll down for video . This office complex is believed to be home to Apple's secret car project. The building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named SixtyEight Research. Claims that Apple is building a car may seem like a leap, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. 'I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' 'Two people with knowledge of the project say Apple has been working on it and receiving shipments related to its development at a building just minutes from 1 Infinite Loop, in the town of Sunnyvale,' wrote AppleInsider. 'We can confirm that Apple does indeed have a large presence at the location, and that numerous automotive-related renovations, including an 'auto work area' and a 'repair garage,' have been constructed on the premises.' The building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named SixtyEight Research. Aside from a sparse website registered through GoDaddy less than a year ago that reveals virtually no information about the company, SixtyEight has no discernible online presence. 'We are experts in market research; helping companies find the relevant market data and industry analysis required to make informed decisions,' its site says. The building is apparently known as SG5 within Apple, and issues visitor passes identical to Apple's - minus the logo. Apple could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020, putting it in direct competition with rivals Tesla Motors and General Motors, according to an industry expert. Evidence is mounting that the tech giant is gearing up to revolutionise the automobile market, just as it did with smartphones and tablets. Images taken over the past few weeks have shown a prototype car that suggests Apple is testing the water - ahead of a release in as little as five years. When AppleInsider visited SixtyEight's headquarters at building '175' earlier this week, its windows were a 'frosted' opaque, and security cameras were visible outside. Bloomberg has claimed that Apple could have a car ready by 2020, based on images of a test car. After the first mysterious camera-mounted car was spotted in California last week, further sightings of Apple's minivans have been posted online, with equipment on top (shown here) According to Tim Higgins from Bloomberg, automakers 'typically spend five to seven years developing a car'. And a 2020 timeframe would underscore Apple's 'aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.' Both of those are planning to release a sub-£26,000 ($40,000) electric car in 2017 that can travel more than 200 miles (320km) on a single charge. Steve LeVine, author of 'The Powerhouse,' a book about the automotive battery industry, said on Bloomberg TV Thursday: 'Was GM really going to be able to match Tesla? Apple can.' This latest speculation follows sightings of mysterious camera-mounted cars registered to Apple in the US last week. At least two videos - one recorded in California, another filmed in Florida - suggest the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought. And rumours range from a Street View-style mapping service to an electric car that will rival Tesla or a self-driving van to rival Google. The Californian footage was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto. The Florida recording was filmed on a highway in Coral Springs and uploaded by Apple Insider. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside. The passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view, while the driver points to the camera and drives off. The Florida recording (pictured) was filmed in Coral Springs. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside and the passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view . Other reports have spotted the vans in Hawaii and Wisconsin. The latest vans haven't officially been confirmed as belonging to Apple, but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are. The far-reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims Apple is developing a mapping service. With 12 cameras on top of the car, however, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View. Plus, reports recently claimed Apple has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. This project has been dubbed 'Titan'. This Apple research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away -  and is being overseen by Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive. Apple could, of course, be using the vans for both projects. The Wall Street Journal added that hundreds of employees are working on the Titan project and boss Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago. The Californian footage (pictured) was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto . These reports followed rumours that Apple was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The claims were made in an email from an unnamed Apple employee. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had considered building a car. An unnamed Apple employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.'  It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California . In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software . The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Alternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The original Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. The blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. Last year, footage emerged of a self-driving Dodge Caravan that looked like the current Apple minivans. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was. With 12 cameras on top of the mysterious Apple car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View (pictured left). Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has refined the technology ever since (Street View screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London pictured right) Alternatively, the vehicles spotted in California and Florida could be self-driving cars. The cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example. If Apple was developing such systems, they would would rival Google's self-driving cars (pictured)","Building registered as home to mysterious SixtyEight Research .

"World powers intensified nuclear talks with Iran yesterday, two days before a deadline for reaching a framework deal. The foreign ministers of the United States, France and Germany cancelled their travel plans for the next few days so they can push for the accord that would lay the foundations for a final settlement with Tehran by the end of June. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's spokeswoman said he would not fly to Boston for a ceremony in honour the late Senator Edward Kennedy, who was his mentor. Officials close to the talks in the Swiss city of Lausanne also confirmed the French and German foreign ministers, Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, had cancelled a planned joint trip to Kazakhstan. Scroll down for video . World powers intensified nuclear talks with Iran yesterday, two days before the deadline for reaching a framework deal. Pictured from left: US Under Secretary for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, US Secretary of State John Kerry, US Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz and British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond . 'We're hopeful, but there is still a lot of work to be done,' Fabius told reporters on Sunday. Iran denies charges from the West and Israel that it wants to build a nuclear weapon, and says its programme is purely peaceful. It wants the removal of international sanctions that are hurting its economy. The remarks from Fabius contrasted to a hostile blast from Israel, which is not a party to the talks between Iran and the six powers also including China, Russia and Britain. 'This deal, as it appears to be emerging, bears out all of our fears, and even more than that,' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his cabinet in Jerusalem. Israel, which is believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal, feels especially threatened by the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran. Netanyahu referred to advances made by Houthi rebels allied to Tehran in Yemen, and accused the Islamic republic of trying to 'conquer the entire Middle East'. 'The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to humanity, and must be stopped,' he said. Strategic Affairs Minister Yuval Steinitz, the Israeli official who has been spearheading efforts to lobby world powers against the Iran deal, voiced cautious hope that the negotiations would collapse as they have in the past. 'There are still great doubts in the United States as well as in France, even in England,' Steinitz told Israel Radio. US Secretary of State John Kerry,(left) will not fly to Boston for a ceremony in honour of his mentor, the late Senator Edward Kennedy . In the past, Israel has threatened to attack Iran if it is not happy with an eventual deal and has long described France as the negotiating power with views closest to its own. The six world powers are seeking a halt to Iran's most sensitive nuclear work, settling a dispute that dates back more than a decade and has threatened at times to trigger a new Middle East war. Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have been in Lausanne for days to try to reach a preliminary deal by a self-imposed deadline of Tuesday. They held several rounds of talks on Saturday and met again on Sunday morning. Fabius and Steinmeier joined the talks on Saturday, and their counterparts from China, Britain and Russia were to take part later on Sunday. Close as the sides have come to the outline of an agreement, they still have deep disagreements on Iran's demands for uranium enrichment research and the immediate removal of all U.N. and key U.S. and . European Union sanctions. Those disagreements could wreck a deal, officials say. Zarif says the six powers are now the ones who must compromise. 'In negotiations, both sides must show flexibility,' Zarif said on Twitter. 'We have, and are ready to make a good deal for all. We await our counterparts' readiness.' Western officials close to the talks said it was up to Iran to compromise on the remaining sticking points. 'The serious but difficult work continues,' a senior U.S. State Department official said. 'We expect the pace to intensify as we assess if an understanding is possible.' A key point in the framework accord the sides are trying to agree by Tuesday is expected to be the duration of the agreement, which officials from the six-power group said would have to be in place for more than 10 years. The framework accord should be followed by a comprehensive deal by June 30 that includes full technical details.","Foreign ministers of the United States, France and Germany cancelled travel plans for the next few days .

"Keith Ambrey (pictured) died after he stumbled into the road and was hit by Joseph Wild’s 4x4 . An elderly driver, who ran over a disabled man, dumped his body at the side of the road and then lied that his victim had been hit by a taxi, has been jailed. Keith Ambrey, who had Motor Neurone Disease, suffered fatal injuries after he stumbled into the road and was hit by Joseph Wild’s 4x4 in the early hours of March 23 last year. Mr Ambrey had missed his train stop after a night out in Manchester and was walking home when he collapsed onto the carriageway at New Mills Newtown in Derbyshire. Derby Crown Court heard other drivers saw an object in their headlights but Wild, 74, who was driving home from a casino in the early hours, hit 61-year-old Mr Ambrey after thinking he was a bin bag. When the farmer and businessman, realised what had happened, he dragged Mr Ambrey’s lifeless body to the side of the road and lied about what happened. Shockingly, Wild made no attempt to seek help before abandoning Mr Ambrey and driving home to bed. He has now been handed a 17-month jail sentence after committing the ‘grotesque act’. The court heard Mr Ambrey, who was the former chief executive of Central Manchester Primary Health Care Trust, suffered from advanced MND. On the night of the tragedy, he had been out with friends in Manchester before making his way home to Hazel Grove, near Stockport, on the last train at 11.10pm. His companions said they did not consider him to be drunk. But after he missed his stop, he waited until Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire, to get off the train. He was seen walking home along the A6 at New Mills Newtown some three miles away. At around 1.30am, a couple had driven past on the other side of the road and saw Mr Ambrey fall and hit his head. But he sat up in the road and appeared to be searching for his glasses. Seconds later, Wild's large Mitsubishi Shogun passed them heading towards him. Another driver flashed his headlights when he saw the vehicle approaching. He thought it would stop, but the driver made no attempt to slow down or steer around the object. The court heard the car drove over it and dragged what looked like 'a dummy' along before it came to a stop and a man got out. Julia King, prosecuting, said said: 'Ultimately and tragically he stumbled into the road and fell and was hit by Wild's car.' Mr Ambrey was walking home after a night out with friends when he collapsed onto the carriageway at New Mills Newtown (pictured) in Derbyshire and was run over by Joseph Wild . Moments later, John Redfearn drove past Wild's 4x4 and after seeing a badly injured man, he quickly turned his car round and went back to the scene. 'He saw Wild standing next to his car,' said Ms King. 'When Mr Redfearn asked what had happened, Wild said he had found the body and dragged it to the side of the road.' Wild had asked Mr Redfearn if he had a phone, who ‘in his panic’ had forgotten he had his mobile with him, she added. But after driving off, he called police to report what he had seen. And by the time another motorist passed the scene and saw the body, Wild was nowhere to be seen. He had stopped for just two-and-a-half minutes before leaving the scene. Police pieced together evidence from witnesses and CCTV footage, tracing Wild to his farmhouse 12 hours later. He told officers he had seen the body in the road and thought it was a bin bag – and added it was only when he stopped that he realised it was a man, who he said was cold so must have been dead for some time. Wild had also falsely claimed a taxi had stopped and he spoke to the driver, who said he would ring 999, before he eventually drove off. Ms King added: 'It's highly improbable he engaged in conversation with any taxi driver. Despite an appeal, no taxi driver ever came forward.' Mr Ambrey was pronounced dead at the scene. A post-mortem examination found he had died instantly from severe head and body injuries. It also emerged that Mr Ambrey was suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition, which was probably what had caused him to collapse into the road. It was established that he could not have been there any longer than 45 seconds. Wild's car was travelling at or just above the 30mph, which investigators said would have given him at least five seconds to stop or take evasive action. The injuries showed that the 4x4 had run right over Mr Ambrey and dragged him just 12 yards down the carriageway. In mitigation, David Toal said neither speed nor alcohol were a factor in the 'sad tragic event', but he admitted Wild's later actions 'aggravated' what had taken place. 'Everyone has made a mistake and almost always they don't result in any consequences let alone the death of an individual,' he said. Derby Crown Court (pictured) heard Wild made no attempt to seek help before abandoning Mr Ambrey and driving home to bed . 'His mistake cost the life of Mr Ambrey and he will have to live with that for the rest of his life. 'He cannot explain what he did afterwards, but he understands it was totally wrong and why Mr Ambrey's family feel like they do.' He said Wild, of Chinley, Derbyshire, was a well-respected member of his local community, who had worked hard all his life running his family's farm and butcher's business. The judge described Mr Ambrey as 'a kind and generous man' who was dealing with advanced MND with 'characteristic courage'. He accepted nothing he could say would bring his family any comfort. Judge Gosling told Wild his actions 'beggared belief'. He said: 'If events had taken a different turn his family could have perhaps forgiven you but they can never come to terms with what you did next. 'There is nothing to suggest you are a callous man, you were in deep shock and now you have expressed your remorse. 'But that cannot excuse what you did. Grotesquely you dragged his body to the side of the road and there you left him.' The judge added: 'You made a conscious decision to drive off, confident that you would not be traced and if you were you could maintain the lie. 'It absolutely beggars belief you could leave Mr Ambrey where he was and you could drive home, make no call to anyone and go to bed. 'You either did not think about or care about who happened upon the scene that you left behind. Those people did what they could to give him some dignity.' Wild, who pleaded guilty to causing Mr Ambrey's death by careless driving on March 23 last year and failing to report an accident, was told he must serve at least half his sentence in jail. Passing sentence, Judge Gosling added: 'You lied and said the body was cold and that you had found it in the road. You also lied about the taxi driver and that you had done what you could, and then left the scene. 'I'm afraid they were all calculated lies.'","Keith Ambrey stumbled into the road and was hit by Joseph Wild’s car .

"A Tory candidate has vowed to clear his name after he was recorded apparently plotting with a far-Right group to win votes by stirring up religious tensions. Afzal Amin, who is standing in a key marginal seat, is accused of asking the English Defence League to say it was organising an inflammatory march against a local 'mega-mosque'. It is claimed he did not intend the march to go ahead, but wanted to hold phoney talks with the group to get it to call off the march, and gain credit for defusing the situation just before the general election. Tory candidate Afzal Amin has vowed to clear his name after he was recorded apparently plotting with a far-Right group to win votes by stirring up religious tensions . Tory ministers yesterday urged him to stand down, but Mr Amin – who has been suspended from the party pending an inquiry – denied the claims and insisted he had been 'grossly misrepresented'. In secret filming, he is heard telling EDL leaders that he would also pay for the group's supporters to canvass on his behalf, and would be their 'unshakeable ally' in Parliament if elected. Defence Minister Anna Soubry said that if the allegations were true, Mr Amin should 'fess up and go now'. She added: 'If this is right, this is dreadful. I mean the EDL is the most appalling organisation'. The party had high hopes for 40-year-old Mr Amin, a Muslim and an ex-Army captain who has done three tours of duty in Afghanistan. The former teacher had become an education officer and was said to have worked with Princes William and Harry. He was filmed  telling EDL leaders that he would also pay for the group's supporters to canvass on his behalf . Former Tory party chairman Baroness Warsi has apparently met Mr Amin on several occasions over the past seven years, and called on his expertise as one of the highest-ranking Muslim soldiers. Mr Amin, who faces a disciplinary hearing tomorrow, was selected two years ago to fight the marginal seat of Dudley North. It is held by Labour's Ian Austin with a majority of only 649. A month ago, a real demonstration about the city's £18million mosque by 600 EDL supporters inflamed tensions and led to 30 arrests. Mr Amin appears to have suggested last week to the EDL's former leader Tommy Robinson and current chairman Steve Eddowes that they announce a 'second march about the mosque'. At restaurant, he is heard telling them: 'We all play our roles, you say, 'Yeah we're going to do a march...' He proposes that after a second meeting with him, and police and Muslim leaders, they hold a press conference 'where you say, 'We were going to do a march. The chief [of] police asked Afzal Amin, members of the Muslim community, we've sat together and... we're going to work closely together'.

He is said to have spoken to the men again later in the week saying he wanted their activists to canvass for him and offering to pay them 'a small salary' – which would be a breach of election rules. Mr Amin hatched a scheme to persuade the English Defence League (pictured) to announce an inflammatory march against a new £18million 'mega-mosque' But Mr Amin claimed last night that he never planned to 'behave in the way that was presented' and that he was using the tactics he learned while negotiating between the US Army and the Taliban 'to improve community relations here in my own country between the EDL and Muslim communities'. The father of two said on the BBC that the idea he would carry out the protest was 'a fantasy'. He said he had held talks with EDL for a year, intending to 'prevent further communal tensions and violence'. He added in a statement: 'During a time of heated tensions between various communities in our country, it's vital that we tackle these problems and take difficult, sometimes uncomfortable, steps. 'I made sure I involved Chief Superintendent Chris Johnson from the start and I made clear, which is evident in the recordings, that I refused to do anything illegal'.

"The war medals of the Normandy veteran who broke out of his care home to attend last year’s D-Day commemorations in France have sold for more than five times their estimated value. Bernard Jordan became known as the Great Escaper after he absconded from his carers, caught a ferry to Caen and turned up in Normandy with his service awards pinned to his blazer. His medals raised £1,650 for the RNLI at Wallis and Wallis in Lewes, East Sussex. The estimate had been £300. Great Escaper: Bernard Jordan absconded from his carers, caught a ferry to Caen and turned up in Normandy with his service awards pinned to his blazer . Mr Jordan died aged 90 on December 30, and a week later his widow Irene passed away. The couple had no immediate family and left £600,000 to the RNLI in their will. Mr Jordan was a 19-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant when on June 6, 1944, he was on a tank-landing craft in the first wave of boats to hit the Normandy beaches. He had already taken part in the Battle of the Atlantic - the cat-and-mouse conflict between Allied ships and German U-boats over the vital supply routes from Europe to the United States. At one stage he was part of the boarding party that captured one of the Enigma coding machines, used by the Nazis to scramble messages, from an enemy submarine. Following the war, Mr Jordan got into local politics and served as a town councillor for 23 years in his hometown of Hove, East Sussex. He was a a city councillor for two years and was mayor of the town from 1995 to 1996. Mr Jordan hit headlines in June last year when he went missing from his care home the day before the 75th anniversary D-Day celebrations. Without telling anyone, including his wife Irene, the plucky pensioner caught a ferry to Caen in Normandy and made his own way to the service. D-Day: Mr Jordan was a 19-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant when on June 6, 1944, he was on a tank-landing craft in the first wave of boats to hit the Normandy beaches . Mr Jordan's medals, sold after his death, comprise the 1939-1945 Star, the Atlantic Star with French and German clasp, the Italy Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal . Police meanwhile had launched a missing persons appeal which was only called off when Mr Jordan called home. On his return, Mr Jordan was made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove and on his 90th birthday he was inundated with 2,500 cards from wellwishers around the world. More than 150 mourners turned out to pay their respects to Mr Jordan at a joint funeral service for him and Irene held in Brighton on January 30. His medals, sold after his death, comprise the 1939-1945 Star, the Atlantic Star with French and German clasp, the Italy Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal. A spokesman for the auction house said: 'Bernard Jordan was a wonderful chap who really embodied the great British bulldog spirit. 'He proudly served his country both during the war as a Navy officer and afterwards as a councillor. 'Medals such as these would normally only fetch a few hundred pounds but Bernard became something of a celebrity following his Normandy adventure.'","Bernard Jordan went missing from his care home before D-Day anniversary .

"Scientists are having extraordinary success treating cancer with new vaccines they believe could be a ‘game-changer’ in the battle against the disease. They have worked out how to teach the body’s immune system to identify cancer cells, allowing patients to be primed to destroy cancer. In one case an American woman given just weeks to live was cleared of advanced blood cancer. She is still alive three years later, and her doctor says she is not a one-off. Scientists are having extraordinary success treating cancer with new vaccines they believe could be a ‘game-changer’ in the battle against the disease . British researchers are now working on a related approach. Both methods involve taking T-cells, which fight infection, and giving them the ability to recognise a special tag on the surface of cancer cells, called the WT1 protein. The research is being carried out on patients with leukaemia. But the scientists hope their vaccines will eventually be used to fight many types of cancer, including that of breast, bowel and prostate – whose cells tend to have WT1 on their surfaces. There is even talk of a ‘universal cancer vaccine’ among some scientists, although the researchers themselves believe that is unlikely. The treatments aim to help the immune system seek out and destroy cancer cells . They do this by giving T-cells the ability to detect a key marker called WT1 . Search and destroy: T-cells can be taught to identify and then kill cancer cells . WT1 is a protein found on the surface of the cells of many types of cancer . T-cells are a type of white blood cell, which fight infections or threats . An infusion of donor stem cells – which can transform into T-cells – may also be used to boost the immune system . Over the past three years, specialist Guenther Koehne, of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, has treated 15 plasma cell leukaemia patients with T-cells taught to recognise cancer. The disease can be treated with chemotherapy-like drugs but it tends to keep returning. All 15 were expected to die within months given normal treatment. But following his regime, Dr Koehne revealed ‘about half’ were still alive. He said: ‘I strongly feel this is a game-changer. Before treatment, I talked to these patients and they said to me: “I have no choice, let’s try this.” They had extremely limited life expectancy. A year later, they call me from work and say they are too busy to see me. That’s really happening.’ His treatment involves taking bone marrow from a donor and splitting it into stem cells and T-cells. The patient receives the stem cells straight away but the T-cells are sensitised to WT1 in the lab by exposing them to fragments of the protein. The T-cells are then given to the patient in a series of injections over several months. Dr Koehne’s first patient, graphic designer Ruth Lacey, 64, underwent the procedure in 2012 after being so ill following a relapse and intensive chemotherapy that she was ‘comatose’. But after receiving the stem cells and four T-cell doses, her cancer was reduced to undetectable levels. Dr Koehne said that seeing her ‘in good health and in complete remission’ was ‘clearly an extraordinary experience’. In the British study, led by Dr Emma Morris – a haematologist at University College London and the Royal Free Hospital, T-cells from up to 20 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or chronic myeloid leukaemia are to be extracted, inserted with DNA so they recognise WT1, and then put back again. ‘Most people have immune cells which can’t recognise cancer cells, which is one of the major problems with tackling the disease,’ Dr Morris explained. ‘We have genetically engineered patients’ immune cells so they develop receptors for the WT1 protein, making them much better at recognising leukaemia cells.’ One patient has already received an infusion containing genetically engineered’ T-cells and there are others whose cells are being prepared. The DNA is transferred into the T-cells using a ‘dummy’ virus that does not cause an infection. These then provide the blueprint to build the WT1 receptor. Three years ago, Ruth Lacey, was on death’s door having relapsed with an aggressive version of myeloma, a form of blood cancer. She was put in touch with Dr Guenther Koehne at New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who suggested the vaccine. First, she was given stem cells from her brother Walter’s bone marrow. Next, his T-cells were exposed to WT1 protein. Finally, she received the cells in a series of injections. At first, recovery was slow. But within two months she began to feel ‘consistently better’ and was allowed home. Ruth Lacey was on death's door with a form of blood cancer when a doctor suggested the vaccine . Book designer Mrs Lacey, 64, from Newburyport, Massachusetts, said the treatment meant she was well enough to garden, walk her dog, and go canoeing. Last summer she did relapse, but she is in remission again thanks to a new drug. Dr Koehne is also considering another T-cell injection. Ms Lacey said: ‘It’s a wonder, a miracle that I’m still here.’ In the short term, doctors are looking to see if these super-immune cells will be powerful enough to stop leukaemia patients from relapsing after chemotherapy. But scientists also hope this approach might work to help treat a range of other cancers too. Dr Morris, whose research with Professor Hans Stauss has been funded by the charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research and government body Cell Therapy Catapult, said: ‘We could potentially use it in ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and patients with prostate or colon cancer too.’ She said the approach should produce less side effects than chemotherapy and provide longer-term protection than drugs, which are flushed out of the body in days or weeks, because immune cells have a ‘memory’, persisting at low levels in case a threat re-emerges. The hope is that the genetically engineered T-cells will do this with cancer, said Dr Morris, ‘multiplying again if needed – like an army ready to be reactivated’. However, Dr Kat Arney of Cancer Research UK, struck a note of caution: ‘These treatments are still in the early stages of clinical trials, and although some people have had great responses, they haven’t worked for everyone.’","Experts find way of teaching body's immune system to identify cancer cells .

"A British Elvis fan was killed in a hit-and-run just a mile from the famous Heartbreak Hotel while on a trip to visit Graceland. Andrea Ahmed died on her 54th birthday moments after watching a tribute act perform in the legendary singer's home city of Memphis. The grandmother, from St Davids, west Wales, had flown to  America for an 'extended trip' and had recently been to meet up with fans at the singer's former home of Graceland. Grandmother Andrea Ahmed (pictured with an Elvis impersonator) died in a hit-and-run moments after watching a tribute act perform in Memphis on her 54th birthday . An inquest heard she went to see her favourite impersonator Joe Kent in May last year, who she had seen perform 'dozens of times over the years'. He had sung a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' to Ms Ahmed, a divorced mother-of-one, and then serenaded her with her favourite song 'Yesterday, When I was Young'. Later, Ms Ahmed, who was staying at the Airport Inn in Memphis, was crossing East Brooks Road when she was knocked down and killed by a driver, who then sped off. Elvis fan Ms Ahmed died during an extended trip to visit the singer's (pictured) home city of Memphis . Mr Kent said: 'We hugged and said our good nights and I left her in the hotel parking lot. 'She evidently went back in the hotel and got on their computer in the lobby. 'Then she must have gone back outside. That's when it happened. She was killed by a hit and run driver. 'It's just so sad - I am just crushed.' Pembrokeshire coroner Mark Layton told the family that very little information, other than that Mrs Ahmed has been struck by a motor vehicle, was available. The court heard US authorities failed to trace the driver has never been traced by authorities in America and a 'lack of information' had slowed down the investigation into the details of Ms Ahmed's death. Matthew Francis, her daughter's partner, told the inquest they knew 'very little' of what happened - because there were no witnesses nor CCTV. He said: 'From what we know she had gone out there to see the home of Elvis. It was Elvis week and she was going to meet friends. 'We know that she had a booking slip for a bus to Orlando, which was due to leave not far from the time she was struck. 'We do not know if she was going back to the hotel or going for the bus.' Recording an open verdict at the inquest in Milford Haven, Mr Layton said: 'It is clear that there was no CCTV, and there were not any witnesses to the collision.' The court heard Ms Ahmed, from St Davids, west Wales, had recently met up with fellow fans at the singer's former home of Graceland (pictured)","Andrea Ahmed died on her 54th birthday moments after watching Joe Kent .

Scotland’s highest court had twice rejected Nadine Montgomery’s claim that medical negligence caused her son’s physical disabilities. But in a landmark legal ruling seven judges of the Supreme Court in London upheld the 40-year-old mother’s claim in what was described as ‘the most significant medical negligence judgment in 30 years’. Nadine Montgomery, whose son suffers from cerebral palsy after he was starved of oxygen during birth, argued she was not properly advised on having a Cesarean by medics at NHS Lanarkshire . Mrs Montgomery expressed delight yesterday that the care of her son, Sam, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was now guaranteed. The biologist from Cumbernauld, Lanarkshire, said: ‘This is an enormous relief after a long legal fight, ensuring Sam receives the best care for the rest of his life.’ First-time mother Mrs Montgomery gave birth to her son in Bellshill Maternity Hospital, run by NHS Lanarkshire, in October 1999. The slightly-built Type 1 diabetic claimed that during her pregnancy she expressed concerns about the birth. Shoulder dystocia occurs when a baby becomes stuck during delivery, potentially starving the infant of oxygen and leading to brain defects. It is particularly common among the children of diabetes sufferers, which are often larger than typical children. Ms Montgomery, a type 1 diabetes sufferer, said the risks of natural delivery, and the prospect of having a Cesarean, were not discussed with her. Her son, Sam, suffered from shoulder dystocia during birth, and now has cerebral palsy. It is recognised that diabetic mothers can deliver larger babies, placing them at higher risk of complications, including the possibility of ‘shoulder dystocia’ where a newborn gets stuck in the pelvis. In her case, Sam’s shoulder stuck after delivery of his head. Staff released the shoulder but during a 12-minute delay he suffered oxygen deprivation. He was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy, caused by permanent brain injury at birth. Mrs Montgomery claimed that had she been advised properly, she would have opted for the alternative of a Caesarean section and Sam would have been born uninjured. But she said her obstetrician Dr Dina McLellan decided not to discuss the risks or suggest a Caesarean. At an earlier hearing, judges heard it was not Dr McLellan’s ‘practice’ to discuss the potential risks of shoulder dystocia, claiming that the risk for the baby was very small, and that Caesareans were not in the ‘maternal interests’ of women. Mrs Montgomery’s case for compensation had twice been rejected by the Court of Session in Edinburgh. But Lord Reed, who delivered the Supreme Court Justices’ decision yesterday said: ‘An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken. Her claim for compensation was twice rejected by Scotland's highest court, but she was yesterday awarded £5.2million after London's Supreme Court overturned the ruling (file image) ‘There can be no doubt it was incumbent on Dr McLellan to advise Mrs Montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia if she were to have her baby by vaginal delivery, and to discuss with her the alternative of delivery by Caesarean. ‘The only conclusion we can reasonably reach is that, had she (the consultant) advised Mrs Montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia and discussed with her dispassionately the potential consequences, Mrs Montgomery would probably have elected to be delivered of her baby by Caesarean section. It is not in dispute that the baby would then have been born unharmed.’ A relieved Mrs Montgomery said: ‘This judgement is an enormous relief after a very long legal fight. I believe that I have a right to know of all the risks surrounding Sam's birth and I am pleased the Supreme Court has recognised that. 'I hope this means other patients will not have to go through what I have gone through. The decision will allow me to ensure Sam receives the best possible care for the rest of his life.' Dr Iain Wallace, Medical Director at NHS Lanarkshire, said: ‘Since this case, practices have changed significantly. Women are more fully informed and advised of the risks and complications of pregnancy. 'We are disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision which has applied retrospectively to the law relating to informed consent and to this case. 'We have only just received this judgement and will need time to consider it fully. We understand, however, that it materially changes the law relating to consent and we, along with other health boards in the UK, will need time to consider very carefully any potential implications for future service provision.'","Nadine Montgomery's son was starved of oxygen during birth in 1999 .

"A year after a mudslide killed 43 people in Washington state, community members gathered on Sunday for a moment of silence and prayer for those lost in worst natural disaster in Snohomish County history. Families, search-and-rescue team members, comfort dogs and other community members gathered on Washington Highway 530 at a ceremony for victims of a mudslide that struck one year ago in Oso, Washington. Names of the deceased were read off one by one as a bell toll marked each one who was killed on March 22, 2014 about 55 miles northeast of Seattle. Scroll down for video . Families, search and rescue team members, comfort dogs, and other community members gather on Washington Highway 530 at a ceremony for victims of a mudslide that struck one year ago in Oso, Washington . A man grieves while reading messages on a highway barrier at the ceremony to honor the 43 killed in last year's mudslide . Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of the devastating mudslide killed 43 and destroyed Washington Highway 530 . Even as the land recovers, however, many of those affected by the mudslide say their nerves continue to be jangled by unresolved lawsuits, pending legislation, difficulties accessing relief funds and a parade of disaster site gawkers and profiteers. Though grass is finally sprouting, Don Young continues to clear his fields of debris, such as home siding and insulation, that is a bitter reminder of the tragedy. 'We should get growth this spring so we don't have to see this scar we've been looking at,' Young, 55, said as he recalled watching the approaching torrent. 'You don't want to keep re-living the damn thing, you know?' Amid an anniversary weekend of prayers, commemorations and a solemn moment of silence, families of victims and survivors say it is hard to reconcile themselves to their losses. 'There is healing that still needs to happen,' Oso Fire Chief Willy Harper said. 'There are a lot of emotions right now, sometimes they are right there on your face, and sometimes they are just below the surface.' The mudslide destroyed much of the area, pictured here, just ten days after on April 2, 2014. Though the land is recovering, residents of the area are still facing challenges . A flag is still present in the area and grass is beginning to grow. But those affected by the mudslide say their nerves continue to be jangled by unresolved lawsuits, pending legislation, difficulties accessing relief funds and a parade of disaster site gawkers and profiteers . The Washington state legislature is considering a transport package that includes funds of $36million over 12 years for laser mapping of landslide-prone areas. Bills would require the state to build a public database of laser-mapped areas and hazards, and tweak state law to let firefighters respond to all kinds of catastrophes, including landslides. A December 2014 report found the Washington State Patrol was unable to send in firefighters following the slide after a state lawyer said dispatching them would violate state law. At the epicenter of the disaster, a street sign marking the road that led to a subdivision where a cluster of homes was obliterated now offers a lookout point for motorists to take photos of the hillside gash. Forty-three small cedar trees, memorials to the dead, many decorated with multi-colored ribbons, heart-shaped wreaths and name tags, have been planted on the side of the re-built highway. Debris in the area is only partially cleaned up, as residents in the area continue to find home siding and insulation in their fields, bitter reminders of the tragedy . Representatives of the Washington State Patrol, Bellevue Fire Department, and other agencies march during a ceremony for victims of a mudslide . Members of the King County Firefighters Pipes and Drums prepare to perform at a ceremony that marks one year since the mudslide that killed 43 people . Several families still live in houses perched around the mile-wide debris area. Some complain visitors have let their dogs defecate on their property. Others felt it was insensitive when a company briefly put up a 'for sale' sign on the property of a bankrupt owner. Others were angered over river raft tours a company offered site visitors for $90. Those have now been suspended. Victims' families have complained in wrongful death suits that the state, county and hill landowner were aware of the disaster risk but made no efforts to divert the river or relocate homes. They also say logging added to the hill's instability. The landowner, Grandy Lake Forest Associates, has denied wrongdoing, and sought to dismiss the case, still in preliminary stages. Forty-three small cedar trees, memorials to the dead, many decorated with multi-colored ribbons, heart-shaped wreaths and name tags, have been planted on the side of the re-built highway . People left flowers, photos and cards in trees alongside other decorations to honor those who were victims of the mudslide . Major relief group American Red Cross, and charities United Way of Snohomish County, and Cascade Valley Hospital Foundation have handed out, or committed to disburse, roughly $8million from donations of more than $9.4million for aid such as housing stipends, grief counseling, food and clothing. Some families say they have faced delays when seeking help from relief agencies. For example, the parents of Summer Raffo, who was swept away while driving, had their electricity shut off when a six-month needs-based financial plan arranged with relief funds by a county case worker was changed by a new case manager. Representatives for Snohomish County and the Salvation Army did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 'The frustration is not just with my family, it's every family,' said Summer's brother, Dayn Brunner, 43. 'The amount of money they have raised, versus what has gone directly to the families, is two different stories.' The highway, pictured above as a truck drives along, had to be rebuilt in the aftermath of the mudslide.  it was closed until June 2014 .

"A left-wing ‘super-union’ with almost 1.8million members could be created by a controversial merger of Labour’s biggest donor Unite and the biggest civil service union after the election, senior Conservatives fear. They warn that a merger between the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) and the Unite union would threaten the impartiality of Whitehall. Half of all civil servants are members of the PCS, which is not currently politically affiliated. If the two unions merged, they would effectively be subsumed into a union which is Labour’s biggest financial supporter. Unite, which has donated millions to Labour since Ed Miliband became leader of the party, could be set to merge with the Public and Commercial Services Union . Unite is at least five times larger than PCS, which claims a membership of 270,000. Unite, which has made £14.3million in donations to Labour since Ed Miliband became leader in 2010, has 1.42million members. A Conservative source said: ‘A takeover of PCS by Labour’s biggest donor, Unite, would make over half of all civil servants members of a Labour-affiliated union. ‘PCS and Unite must come clean about their secret plans. No takeover can be permitted to imperil the perceived impartiality of the civil service.’ The PCS has been in financial difficulty following cuts to the civil service, as well as an end to a system where Government departments automatically deducted union dues from the payroll. A leaked document suggests it plans to sell its headquarters to a private equity fund and suspend national elections for this year. The union blames its financial crisis on the downsizing of the civil service, now a fifth smaller than it was in 2010. The end of the ‘check off system’, which saw union fees deducted automatically from salaries by many Government departments has also squeezed the PCS. MPs have warned a left-wing merger between the PCS and Unite (Unite protest pictured) would threaten the impartiality of Whitehall . Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has overseen the closure of this scheme at the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HMRC, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence. In addition, the Government has clamped down on so-called ‘facility time’, whereby union officials are paid by the taxpayer to work for a union. The overall cost of such taxpayer-subsidised union officials has fallen by more than two-thirds, while the number of full-time union officials paid for by the public purse has fallen from over 200 to fewer than ten. Last year, the PCS discussed the possibility of a merger with Unite at its annual conference, but the idea was shelved. A source at the PCS played down the prospect of the deal with Unite being revived, saying: ‘It’s no secret that we had informal discussions. These proposals were never driven by finances. Our conference voted against a motion from the national executive saying we should carry on exploring it, and said we should set more formal conditions. So it’s not on the horizon.’ Unite’s general secretary Len McCluskey suggested last year there would be ‘no further progress’ on merger talks with the PCS unless it changed its membership rules. Hinting at the reasons for the breakdown of talks, he told delegates ‘our rules don’t change, our structures don’t change’. PCS members apparently insisted they would not back a new relationship with Unite if their union membership fees contributed to Labour Party coffers.","Merger of Unite and PCS unions could threaten impartiality of Whitehall .

"When confronted with the sight of a charging hippo hungry for meat, most holidaymakers would run a mile. But one snap-happy couple stayed put to capture the beast in all its glory as it bounded towards them through an African swamp. Michael and Jacqueline Tucker were holidaying in Botswana when the animal bore its fangs at them during a safari. Rather than run from the hungry animal, Mr Tucker, 38, whipped out his camera. As his stunning collection of photographs show, the animal changed its mind at the last minute, waddling off in search of food elsewhere as their group's motorboat kicked in. Who's there? An angry hippopotamus made a dash for a group of tourists in Chobe National Park, Botswana, with one of the group able to capture the moment it nearly reached their boat in a swamp . Closing in: The animal moved with 'astonishing' pace said Mr Tucker, a professional photographer in the area with his wife, Jacqueline . Not happy: The beast was far from pleased when the group of tourists brought their boat into its territory of the water . The encounter was not without risk though, he said, with their guide hurriedly trying to start the boat's engine as the hippopotamus closed in. 'It was astonishing the speed the hippo moved and we were definitely in danger. 'Our guide decided to get us up close to a pod of hippos that were resting on a small island. As we were drifting towards them with the motor off, the dominant bull decided we were too close and started charging us. 'It all happened very quickly and as the hippo was gaining valuable ground by the second, we were trying very hard to get the motor boat started. 'After two unsuccessful attempts the motor finally started and we managed to get away. 'Incredibly, I managed to get a few photographs of the charge as we luckily escaped the angry hippo. 'The pictures will always remind us how lucky we were.' Get your own swamp: Mr Tucker was able to capture the beasts' yellowed fangs and tongue in a stunning collection of photographs . Getting closer: The rest of the group remained in their seats as the guide tried to restart the boat, the animal growing ever closer . Off you go: Eventually the tour's boat restarted, with the animal pleased to see them leave just in the nick of time . Don't bother coming back: While Mr Tucker said he was glad to have been able to capture the encounter, he said the images remind him of how much danger they were in at the time .","Michael and Jacqueline Tucker were holidaying in Botswana when they encountered the beast in a swamp .

"David Tuohy, 83, was found dead in the River Thames near his Oxford home just days before he was due to be sentenced for historic sexual assualts . A former headmaster who was found guilty of molesting boys as young as ten at a special needs school in the 1970s has been found dead just days before he was due to be sentenced. The body of David Tuohy, 83, was found floating in the River Thames close to his home in Oxford earlier this week. He was due to be sentenced at Norfolk Crown Court on Monday after earlier being found guilty of 15 counts of sexual assault following a nine-day trial. He was in charge of Eccles Hall School, in Quidenham, Norfolk, in the 1970s when he carried out the indecent and serious sexual assaults against five pupils, who all had special needs and were under 13. Norfolk police confirmed Tuohy had been found dead in the River Thames and said his death was being treated as 'unexplained but not suspicious'. A spokesman said: 'Norfolk Constabulary can confirm 83-year-old David William Tuohy who was due to be sentenced after being found guilty of a string of sexual offences against pupils at an independent school has died.' A Thames Valley Police spokesman said a body was reported in the water at around 6pm on Tuesday and the man was declared dead at the scene after being recovered by police divers. Officers had been called to the Osney Lock area of Oxford after a member of the public reported a bloodstain and a watch. Tuohy's family and victims have been informed of his death, police confirmed. Last month, Norfolk Crown Court heard how Tuohy liked to discipline boys who came to the school from different parts of the UK and found themselves alone, isolated and separated from their families. He was also said to be 'obsessed with spanking' and the prosecution said he had a 'particular deviant sexual fascination with the bottoms of very young boys.' Prosecutor Andrew Shaw added: 'It was a boarding school which catered for children who had not thrived in mainstream education in areas all over the country - in today's language we would say they had special educational or behavioural needs. 'They were separated from their families and plunged in to an unfamiliar environment. 'As one of the people charged with the duty of caring for these children, he abused the trust placed in him and used these children for his own sexual gratification.' Detective Constable Faith Morris, from Norfolk Police, said Tuohy had used a position of 'absolute trust' to abuse his victims. 'The fact Tuohy pleaded not guilty to all counts meant his victims were forced to relive the traumatic events which occurred all those years ago,' she said of his trial. Tuohy was a headmaster at Eccles Hall in Quidenham, Norfolk, (pictured) in the 1970s when he indecently assaulted five pupils - all of whom had special needs and were aged under 13. He was convicted of 15 charges . Tuohy was originally arrested in June last year and charged with four counts of indecent assault and four counts of buggery against one victim. Four further victims then came forward resulting in Tuohy being charged with a further 14 indecent assaults. All of the charges related to five boys, who were aged under 13, between September 1972 and March 1983. He was found not guilty of three of the indecent assault charges and the four buggery charges but convicted of the remaining 15 indecent assaults. The sex abuse came to light when one of the victims reported it to police, prompting other victims to come forward. Eccles Hall, which is now known as the New Eccles Hall School, is an independent day and boarding school in East Anglia for children aged seven to 18.

If that wasn’t enough, the prince got his 400-strong audience in the State Apartments at St James’s Palace to sing a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, accompanied by a trumpeter from the Scots Guards. The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James’s Palace, saying: ‘We are going to do something new this evening. ‘The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it’s her 25th birthday today.’ Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: ‘You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).’ He then turned to the lance corporal and added: ‘If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...’ There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones.

"Two horses used for carriage rides at Queen Victoria's former summer house have been seized by police over fears they were being mistreated. The RSPCA is now caring for the horses which were formerly based at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, and which were said to be so thin they nearly had to be put down. The animals were used to pull carriages around the estate, which was built in the 19th century as a private home for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Probe: Two horses have been seized from Osborne House over fears they were being mistreated (file photo) Claims: The RSPCA intervened after English Heritage staff expressed concern about the horses (file photo) Although the house is now under the care of English Heritage, the horses were owned by an independent contractor. When English Heritage staff noticed the poor health of the horses, they called the RSPCA, and the contractor has now been sacked. A source told Island Echo that the two horses had no body fat whatsoever, and would probably have been put down if they had not been rescued within days. A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'We attended along with the police and an independent vet after a call from a concerned member of the public about the condition of two horses there. 'The police seized the horses and placed them in our care.This is now an ongoing investigation so we cannot comment further.' Historic: Osborne House was the summer home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the 19th century . Rides: The horses were owned by an independent contractor and used as a tourist attraction (file photos) Hampshire Police said that no one has been arrested over the treatment of the horses. The general manager at Osborne House, Rob Flower, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the situation. We were concerned about the treatment of the horses and alerted the RSPCA. 'Our first priority is the welfare of the horses and we are working closely with the RSPCA.' English Heritage said that the contractor was given free use of the house's stables and paddocks to give carriage rides to guests. However, Osborne House did not profit from the arrangement. Care: The horses are now being looked after by the RSPCA following the investigation (file photo) The home was designed by Prince Albert to look like an Italian palazzo, and was built between 1845 and 1851. The couple would spend several months a year at the house, and after Albert's death Victoria continued to pay regular visits, dying there in 1901. Osborne House was used as an officer training college by the Royal Navy after Edward VII gave it to the nation. The house and grounds are now open to the public, while the estate's cricket pavilion can be rented out by holidaymakers.","The horses were used for tourist carriage rides at Osborne House .

Poland borders Ukraine and Russia and the conflict between the two countries has caused anxiety there. Putin, in particular, is seen as the main driving force behind the war, allegedly sending Russian troops to support the rebels in the east who want independence from the Ukrainian government. In just a year, it has cost more than 5,600 lives - and Russia's neighbours have become increasingly concerned Putin will turn his attention to them next. Lithuania, for example, feels the threat from Moscow feels is so real the government plans to reintroduce military conscription. But so far, America and the rest of Europe have refused to show any sort of military might towards the former Soviet Union - while Putin has made sure the rest of the world is in no doubt of the strength of his armed forces. Just this week, Putin boasted of a massive military exercise across his country, involving 80,000 troops, about 100 navy ships and more than 220 aircraft, marking the beginning of a series of such drills this year. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin Tuesday that the manoeuvres were aimed at checking the readiness of the newly formed group of forces in the Arctic, as well as the military's capability to quickly field troops to several theatres of operations.

"A snake catcher has shared hilarious images of some of the most bizarre places he has discovered the world's deadliest creatures. For 13 years Richie Gilbert has been removing serpents from unexpected spots such as gyms, wine racks, brothels and even under pillows. Fearless Mr Gilbert has relocated around 600 snakes across Queensland, Australia, since founding his company Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7, which operates 24 hours and seven days a week, in February 2014. Scroll down for video . Snake catcher Richie Gilbert has relocated around 600 snakes across Queensland, Australia, since founding his company Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7 . The brave father-of -two has shared some of the hilarious places he's removed snakes from: A red-bellied black snake made itself at home in a child's shoe (left) and an eastern brown snake waits in a bird feeder patiently for lunch (right) A carpet python guards the toilet paper: Mr Gilbert has been bitten more than 100 bites in his lifetime . He has been bitten more than a dozen times this past season alone - with more than 100 bites in his lifetime. But despite his daring job, Mr Gilbert anticipates turning it into a family business with his five-year-old daughter, Ivory, showing an interest. 'My family have a healthy respect for venomous snakes and while they wouldn't touch them, they certainly do not fear them,' he said. 'My two eldest girls, Zahra and Ivory, absolutely love hearing about my day and will hold non-venomous snakes any chance they get.' A red-bellied black snake curled up under a pillow: Mr Gilbert anticipates turning it into a family business . A 1.5m python loose in Richies car (left) and a 2.7m long coastal carpet python lifting some weights (right) A 1.6m carpet python made itself at home near a toilet: Mr Gilbert caught his first snake at five years old . Mr Gilbert deals with creatures varying from carpet snakes to highly venomous Eastern Brown Snakes, the second-most venomous in the world. He added: 'My mum says I was chasing lizards as soon as I could walk. 'She tells people I caught my first snake, a highly-venomous copperhead, when I was five. 'We were camping in New South Wales and a friend and I came out of the bush with it in a bucket. A snake cuddled up on a wine rack: 'Most people think a snake will chase you and bite but that couldn't be further from the truth,' Mr Gilbert said . A large python helps out in the office (left) and a carpet python pictured coming through a door after chasing a cat (right) Knock, knock: A carpet python waits outside a door . 'Most people think a snake will chase you and bite but that couldn't be further from the truth. 'They also think they are slimy but they really just feel like finger nails.' But that close encounter with disaster didn't deter the boy from the Sunshine Coast from turning his backyard hobby  into a career as a qualified snake catcher. 'A lot of people think it's a dangerous job but to me, I feel like it's not dangerous at all,' Mr Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Gilbert was called to a home this season where he found the large carpet python had devoured chickens . 'There are people risking their lives everyday - like electricians or people parachuting and jumping out of planes - to me that's dangerous but its all relative to risk management. 'But I've been doing it for a long time and I can't put my finger on what attracted me to them but I have always loved chasing snakes since I was little. 'And I love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when I catch them.' Mr Gilbert, who owns the Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7, has been catching snakes since the age of five . Gilbert's colleague Stuart McKenzie recently removed an eastern brown snake on a job. Mr Gilbert added: 'It's the most beautiful one I've ever seen - it's orange incase you didn't notice!' 'It's been quite busy during the summer season and I've been getting a lot of phone calls and text messages for identification or to attend homes to locate and remove snakes if necessary', he said. Despite many years of experience, Mr Gilbert said he has never had any training. 'A lot of people ask me how I've learnt to catch snakes but I can't remember a day where I'm not catching them – I've been doing it for a long time and I guess it was just self-taught. 'Growing up, Steve Irwin played a passion that I had. I remember watching his shows and thinking 'that's what I do too!' and it stirred me on from there.' He was called to this home in the Sunshine Coast to save a pet cat from this python which was waiting to pounce . Mr Gilbert has been quite busy during the summer season, with number phone calls and texts daily . Snake catcher Richie Gilbert came to the rescue when he was called to a home on the Sunshine Coast . While Mr Gilbert makes his job sound too easy, he said he has had some of the scariest moments. 'Just recently, I did something really stupid – I crawled underneath a home and it was just two foot off the ground to catch an eastern brown snake. 'Crawling on my tummy, trying to locate it which in hind sight – I shouldn't have done – but when I looked up, it was right above my head, looking at me like 'what are you doing?' so I slowly backed out. 'The owner passed me a pool stick to try and get it out and it dropped to the ground just two metres from my face and looked straight at me in a defence position – it's what they do when they feel threatened and vulnerable. Despite many years of experience, Mr Gilbert said he has never had any training and was self-taught . The family Labrador alerted the owners when it found a carpet python in its kennel. The owners taped up the door to trap it inside the kennel until Mr Gilbert arrived to remove it . 'It was stupid and dumb – I managed to catch it safely but it wasn't the end of it. The owner's Labrador was coming at me so I had the snake in one hand and trying to scare the dog with my leg – it was crazy.' After Mr Gilbert catches the reptiles, he releases them back into the wild. 'We try to release them in the same geographical area and I don't like to take them too far away from where they were found. But it has to be a far distance away so they don't come back,' he said. 'But if it's a venomous snake, a lot more thought goes into them and we try to release them far away as possible from residential areas.' When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance . The avid snake catcher has been catching snakes at a very young age and hasn't stopped since . Mr Gilbert said the most venomous snakes Australians should be aware of at the moment is the eastern brown snakes, which are the second most venomous snakes in the world. When it doubt about spotting a snake, Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance. 'Send it to us and we can identify it for you and if it's venomous or not and whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them,' he said. 'If the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms, it's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us. 'Be smart about it because 90 percent of the time, people who are bitten are often trying to kill it or scare it away. 'All snakes want to do is get away but if it doesn't feel it can escape, it'll strike – so be sensible when you spot them.' For more information, please visit Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7.

"A British hotelier found shot dead in his burnt out Range Rover on one of the world's most idyllic islands had received death threats over his controversial £5.4million bid to take over another luxury resort, an inquest has heard. Oliver Gobat's body was found in the passenger seat of his car in April last year, burned beyond all recognition on a remote track on St Lucia's exclusive Cap Estate - less than two miles from the luxury hotel his family owned. The popular businessman - who was born on the island, but raised in Surrey - had been shot twice in the head before the car was set alight, in what is thought to have been an attempt to destroy any forensic evidence. Killing: Oliver Gobat was shot twice in the head, before his car was set alight on a quiet road in St Lucia . Shock: Family and friends were stunned by the killing of the popular businessman, born on the island . Jealousy: Mr Gobat, 38, ran the luxury Cap Maison - and was involved in a £5.4million deal for another resort . The killing left family and friends - including Carol Vorderman - stunned, but an inquest into his death has revealed Mr Gobat received death threats in the run up to his murder. The inquest, being held in Working, Surrey, heard that Mr Gobat was helping to organise the £5.4million ($8million) takeover of The Landings, a luxury beach resort on St Lucia which had become insolvent. But a rival bidder organised a 'smear campaign' against Mr Gobat, and the 38-year-old had received death threats - which he hid from his family. Mother Helen Gobat told the hearing: 'He was the victim of a smear campaign. 'There was a blog set up called Pirates of the Caribbean. It was intended to damage his reputation. 'We subsequently learned he had received death threats.' His brother Adam - who said Mr Gobat was a very likeable person - added: 'It transpires that the person who was behind the smear campaign was a rival bidder to buy The Landings. 'That person is a UK citizen.' The victim's brother also revealed that after The Landings deal was completed following Mr Gobat's death, another signatory to the consortium received a death threat. Threats: Mother Helen, pictured with husband Theo, told an inquest there was a smear campaign against him . Success: 'He's a good looking, successful chap in St Lucia and it's a small community so there's a lot of jealousy that goes around,' his mother told the inquest in Woking, Surrey . Anger: The family have also been left frustrated with the lack of progress made by local police into the case . Mrs Gobat told the coroner her son, who had worked on St Lucia for 10 years before his death, had probably never expected anyone to kill him over his business dealings but admitted there was likely to have been 'jealousy' towards his success on the island. Mr Gobat ran the luxury Cap Maison hotel with his brothers Adam and Rufus and was a popular figure on the holiday island, welcoming the likes of Amy Winehouse and model Kelly Brook to the boutique hotel. He grew up in Surrey, where he played cricket for his county junior team, and also lived in Adelaide, Australia, before settling back in St Lucia - an independent state of the Commonwealth - to concentrate on the family business. 'Whatever he did he liked to succeed and he was very close to achieving it,' Mrs Gobat told the inquest. 'Thinking the unthinkable': His family questioned whether he would have taken threats over a legitimate business deal seriously . 'He's a good looking, successful chap in St Lucia and it's a small community so there's a lot of jealousy that goes around. 'There were competitors in property and I guess they didn't want him to be any more successful by putting the deal together that he was putting together. 'It was a case of thinking the unthinkable. Why would he think somebody would knock him off for putting through a legitimate business deal with legitimate business partners?' Mrs Gobat also criticised the police investigation in St Lucia, saying 'basic' errors had been made from the beginning, including moving the Range Rover on the night her son was found dead and failing to cordon off the area. At the time police sources were reported as saying that Mr Gobat's death was 'no ordinary murder' and it had 'all the hallmarks of a professional killing' - yet they have failed to charge anyone in connection with the killing. British police have also appeared to be reticent to get involved in the case, with Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab taking up the families pleas for help last December. The Gobat family - who have a family mansion in Esher, Surrey - has since employed a private investigator to look into the case. 'I hope that his murder wasn't senseless and whoever is behind it is properly dealt with,' she said. Assistant Coroner for Surrey, Dr Karin Englehart, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, saying the 'manner and mechanism' of Mr Gobat's death were clear. Dr Englehart said it was not her place to comment on the possible reasons for his murder. She said: 'The manner of Ollie's death is a terrible, terrible tragedy that no family should have to endure. No-one should die in this way. 'It had to be someone or some others, for whatever reason, and that is the purpose of other courts, a criminal court, to deal with. 'The manner and mechanism of Ollie's death must be unendurable for both Ollie's parents, his brothers and friends and I offer my sincere condolences to you all.' The Gobat family declined to comment following the conclusion of the inquest.","Oliver Gobat's body found in the passenger seat of his car in April 2014 .

'Nowadays the death penalty is inadmissible, no matter how serious the crime committed.' He was referencing teachings by the church that suggest modern prison systems make executions unnecessary. Pope Francis added that capital punishment 'does not render justice to the victims, but rather fosters vengeance'.

'For the rule of law, the death penalty represents a failure, as it obliges the state to kill in the name of justice.'

"A Lingerie Bowl player and personal assistant was forced to go topless in front of her boss's friends and babysit his prostitutes when he passed out, she claims in a lawsuit. Lotti Bluemner, 31, accuses investor Erik Gordon, 41, of coercing her into exposing her bare breasts in front of crowds so he could snort cocaine off them to impress women. His requests did not stop even after she got pregnant, according to court documents seen by the New York Post. Suing Gordon, head of Ergo Media Capital LLC, for unfair dismissal, Bluemner is demanding $13 million in damages. Battle: Lotti Bluemner (right) claims she felt compelled to expose her breasts for Erik Gordon (left) and his A-list friends at drug-fueled parties in order to keep her $90,000-a-year job as his personal assistant in LA . Past career: Bluemner was a kicker for LA Temptation in the 2006 Lingerie Bowl tournament, coming second . Bluemner, from Brookfield, Wisconsin, featured in Lingerie Bowl, which involved women playing full-contact football in their underwear, pads and helmets. A kicker for LA Temptation in the 2006 tournament, she helped secure victory against Dallas Desire in the semi-finals but ultimately lost to New York Euphoria. Her $90,000-a-year job was meant to be an administrative role at Gordon's home in LA, organizing his diary, the Post reported. However, in court documents seen by DailyMail.com, she claims she was used to 'essentially babysit' as Gordon went 'partying, drinking, and consuming various illegal drugs each night... as well as regularly engaging strippers and prostitutes.' Gordon rejects Bluemner's claims and says that she stole $1,200 from his credit card at the Apple store . 'Used': Bluemner's lawsuit claims she was used to help Gordon pick up women . She adds that 'Gordon's modus operandi, consisted of trading upon his father's (one of the founders of Angelo & Gordon) wealth, fame, connections, and political capital by taking meetings during the day with his and his father's wealthy and politically connected friends, celebrities, and politicians' before partying. And she was ordered, she says, to take his new girlfriend on multi-thousand dollar shopping sprees. In papers seen by DailyMail.com, Gordon rejects the accusations and claims Bluemner used his credit card to spend $1,229.51 on personal items from the Apple store. Bluemner denies theft. Now based in Florida, with business in New York, Gordon has filed his counter claim in Manhattan, while Bluemner's case will be heard in California's Federal Court. Gordon told the Post: 'Everyone who knows me and knows Ms. Bluemner has found humor in her bizarre allegations . . . I have countless friends who are women who have faced horrific instances of hostile work environments and quid-pro-quo sexual harassment. Ms. Bluemner's complaint . . . does each of them an injustice.'","Lotti Bluemner, 31, claims investor Erik Gordon, 41, of using her to pick up women .

"It looks like Game Of Thrones. It sounds like Game Of Thrones. But as the camera sweeps across the map, it soon becomes clear that this short film has re-imagined the TV fantasy series to deliver a very modern political message. Titled Game Of Cuts (Winter Is Coming For Councils), it was produced by a campaign group which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern, midland and south-coast regions of England. The production, which cost £11,000, cleverly echoes the drama played out in the hit HBO show. Game Of Thrones spoof Game Of Cuts was produced by campaign group Sigoma, which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern, midland and south-coast regions of England . Made by Sigoma (Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities), it depicts a fictional kingdom where funding cuts have meant some regions cannot fund vital services, while other areas moan about not having luxuries. In the opening scene are characters based on those from the House of Lannister - a rich and powerful dynasty in the south. Among them is a parody of King Joffrey Baratheon, a ruthless ruler, who is informed: 'The seven kingdoms prosper once more. 'We must not jeopardise this by pandering to the whims of the north... Our funding cuts will help to protect the future of the seven kingdoms.' Honourable northerner Lord Ned Starp (played in the actual series by Sean Bean as Ned Stark) is seen right, in the foreground. He says to the evil King Joffrey of the south (left: 'Your grace, what is the meaning of this? The people of the northern cities are already on their knees! Our old and the sick have no one to care for them' In the film, Queen Cersei is seen reinforcing the claims made by her son Joffrey . Enter honourable northerner Lord Ned Starp (played in the actual series by Sean Bean as Ned Stark): 'Your grace, what is the meaning of this? The people of the northern cities are already on their knees! Our old and the sick have no one to care for them.' 'Our children have no places to read and our roads are crumbling.' But at every turn, Starp's entreaties are scoffed at. To join Sigoma, council must pay an initial fee of £3,000. However, the film has been criticised by Conservative party vice-chairman and former local government minister Bob Neill. He said: 'Taxpayers' money shouldn't be used to subsidise the Box Set fantasies of town hall officials. At the end of the short film, the king fires an arrow at Lord Starp, whose pleas for more funding in the north are scoffed at . According to Sigoma, by March 2016, the amount of funding cuts for regions will be: . 'It's a complete waste of money, but also a complete fiction. It's missing the key plot - there's a black hole in the Kingdom's coffers, thanks to the bad old days of King Gordon. 'His hand of the king, Baron Red Ed, may now eye the throne, but he would wind the clock back to same failed old policies of government waste and higher taxes, meaning less money to go around for local services.' Meanwhile, Labour councillor Sir Steve Houghton, chairman of Sigoma said: 'Whilst councils have made every effort to absorb the funding cuts and adapt, the successive rounds of cuts mean that councils are rapidly running out of options for making the savings required. 'Clearly a situation in which some councils are struggling to provide essential services such as care and support for their most vulnerable residents, whilst others have more than enough, is clearly unfair and unsustainable,' he told the Express And Star. He added that the reason the video was made was because national politicians were not listening. According to Sigoma, since 2010, local government in England has lost more than 40 per cent of its core funding. It also said that urban authorities, largely in the North and the Midlands, have lost the most money as a result of these cuts.

But no one was willing to buy the luxurious Sydney apartment where Simon Gittany threw his fiancée fifteen floors to her death when it went to auction on Tuesday. There was only one registered bidder for the two-bedroom property at 1503/157 Liverpool Street in Sydney, which was expected to sell for at least $2 million, despite estate agency Morton & Morton receiving plenty of interest, according to News Corp. Gittany was found guilty of murdering Lisa Cecilia Harnum at the site and was sentenced to 26 years in prison in November 2013 in one of the most high-profile court cases in recent history. On July 30 2011, he threw the former ballerina to her death from the 15th storey apartment. Her fiancé, 40-year-old Gittany, claimed it was suicide and that he had tried to save her life.

Former tenant, 40 year old Gittany, will spend at least 18 years in prison for Ms Harnum's death, making him eligible for parole in 2033.

"It was a deeply disturbing homecoming for Shreya Singhal, then 21. She had returned to India from her astrophysics course at the UK’s Bristol University in 2012, when news of a series of netizens’ arrests spurred by powerful politicians started making headlines. Behind these arrests lurked a relatively young dark law: Section 66A of the Information Technology Act. Shreya decided to file a public interest litigation. A little over two years later, Justice Rohinton Nariman of the Supreme Court got up from his chair after announcing, “Section 66A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, is hereby struck down in its entirety.” Petitioner Shreya Singhal and her mother Manali Singhal were thrilled with the ruling . A packed courtroom noisily greeted the landmark judgment upholding online freedom of speech and expression. The two-judge bench headed by the son of legendary jurist Fali S. Nariman had struck down as “unconstitutional” and “vague” the draconian provision which gave “sweeping and unbridled power” to the police to arrest anyone for offensive posts on social networking websites or sending messages through mobile phones and tablets. For Shreya, daughter of Supreme Court lawyer Manali Singhal and granddaughter of Delhi High Court judge Sunanda Bhandare, a long battle against the might of the state had just ended. Shock and anger . “I was shocked by the arrests, including of a Jadavpur University professor, for circulating a picture spoofing West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her party colleague Mukul Roy; imprisonment of Puducherry businessman Ravi Srinivasan for allegedly posting offensive messages on Twitter about Congress leader P. Chidambaram’s son Karti Chidambaram,” she said. But the trigger for her PIL was the arrest of two girls in Mumbai for a critical online post about the shut-down in the city for Bal Thackarey’s funeral. “I got really angry. The law was blatantly being misused. The provision was extremely vague in its definition of what should go on the Internet,” she said. Shreya’s petition raised an avalanche. Eight other petitioners, including writer Taslima Nasreen, joined her after a year. Section 66A, brought about by a defensive UPA which was increasingly getting cornered and badgered on the social media, surprisingly found a friend in the incumbent government, which defended it in Supreme Court. No definition . The court found merit in Shreya’s argument that the language used in Section 66A is so vague that the accused would not know what the offence was, and nor would the authorities be clear on the charges. It prescribed a three-year jail term for posts which are “grossly offensive” or had a “menacing character” or e-mails which caused “annoyance” or “inconvenience” to the recipient. What is worse is that none of these expressions had been defined. This went against the principles of criminal law which require each and every term to be well-defined, leaving no scope for misinterpretation and possible misuse. “You can’t jail anyone just like that. I am not saying you should defame anyone. But one should not be scared to post anything now as long as public order is respected,” said Shreya. The court noted that the vagueness could be misused by governments with an agenda. In a last ditch effort to save the provision, additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta had submitted that the Centre was ready to amend the law and fervently pleaded against scrapping it. He said it was meant to deter people from uploading grossly offensive material which can lead to lawlessness by inciting public anger and violence. He had also assured it would be administered in a reasonable manner and would not be misused. But the court was not impressed. Freedom . “The section has a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression. The right of viewers is also infringed as it would not give them the benefit of the many shades of grey in terms of various points of view that could be viewed over the Internet,” the bench said in its 122-page judgment. Shreya is still in her third year of law at the Delhi University, with an accomplishment even those with 30 years in practice would cherish.","Section 66A of the Information Technology Act saw Indians arrested simply for sharing their views on Facebook and Twitter .

"A filter-feeding 'lobster' as big as a human took the place of whales 480 million years ago, a new fossil find has shown. The 6.5ft (two-metre) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans, insects and spiders. At this length it would have been comparable in size to athlete Usain Bolt, actor Liam Hemsworth and former wrestler Hulk Hogan.

The 6.5ft (two-metre) prehistoric creature was an early ancestors of modern crustaceans, insects and spiders and at this length would have been comparable in size to athlete Usain Bolt (pictured right) The remains were unearthed in Morocco and it is thought to be the oldest giant filter-feeder ever discovered. But while most of its relatives were shark-like apex predators with circular mouths ringed by sharp teeth, the new species, named Aegirocassis benmoulae, was a 'gentle giant'. The 6.5ft (two-metre) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans, insects and spiders. Like modern-day whales, it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food, using spine-covered 'limbs' on its head. Fossils also show that Aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body. These were likely to be precursors of the unique double-branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans. Like modern-day whales, it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food, using spine-covered 'limbs' on its head. Modern-day lobsters grow to around 19 inches (50cm) and modern-day whales average at around 79ft (25 metres). Dr Allison Daley, from Oxford University, who co-led a team studying Aegirocassis writing in the journal Nature, said: 'This would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time. 'These animals are filling an ecological role that hadn't previously been filled by any other animal. 'While filter-feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food, previous filter-feeders were smaller, and usually attached to the sea-floor. 'We have found the oldest example of gigantism in a freely swimming filter-feeder.' A. benmoulae was named after the Moroccan fossil hunter who discovered it, Mohamed Ben Moula. The 3D fossil, exposed using tiny needle-like tools to chip away the surrounding rock, is exceptionally well preserved.

"A manhunt was underway on Monday after an armed fugitive abducted a woman from a Wisconsin hospital and fled in an exchange of gunfire.

Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said deputies had a description of the man's vehicle and it was spotted about an hour later at a Piggly Wiggly grocery store in nearby Union Grove. As a squad car approached, the 20-year-old man fired several rounds, even with shoppers in the parking lot, Schmaling said. No one was shot. 'The suspect was located, he pulled a gun on my criminal investigator and shot at him,' Schmaling said. 'My investigator returned fire and the suspect fled.' As the man fled, he left the woman he had abducted in the parking lot. She was shaken, but unharmed, Schmaling said.

Her daughter Maayan said: 'One time I even thought it was my mom screaming. It's so loud it's like shrieking noises. It is really scary.' The animals have adapted to living in close quarters with humans and have learned to navigate tasks associated with built-up areas - such as crossing busy roads and avoiding cars. Over the past few years they have spread to nearly every corner of the United States - wreaking havoc by preying on domestic pets and even attacking children.

"The Food and Drug Administration is keeping a bold-letter warning on Pfizer's anti-smoking drug Chantix about suicidal behavior and other psychiatric side effects, after reviewing company findings suggesting the drug does not increase those problems. The twice-a-day tablet has carried the FDA's strongest warning label since 2009, following reports of suicidal tendencies and violent or bizarre behavior among some patients. The FDA on Monday outlined several updates to Chantix's labeling, including a new warning about its potential interaction with alcohol. Some patients have reported unusual or aggressive behavior when drinking while on Chantix. Caution: Anti-smoking drug Chantix has carried the FDA's strongest warning label since 2009, following reports of suicidal tendencies and violent or bizarre behavior among some patients . 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that the prescription smoking cessation medicine Chantix (varenicline) can change the way people react to alcohol,' the agency said. 'In addition, rare accounts of seizures in patients treated with Chantix have been reported. We have approved changes to the Chantix label to warn about these risks. Until patients know how Chantix affects their ability to tolerate alcohol, they should decrease the amount of alcohol they drink. Patients who have a seizure while taking Chantix should stop the medicine and seek medical attention immediately.' The updated labeling also includes information from several studies and analyses conducted by Pfizer that found no difference in psychiatric problems between people taking Chantix and other stop-smoking treatments. 'These studies did not show an increased risk of neuropsychiatric side effects with Chantix; however, they did not examine all types of neuropsychiatric side effects, and they had limitations that prevented us from drawing reliable conclusions,' the FDA said. Last year Pfizer proposed that the FDA remove Chantix's so-called black box warning based on the company's findings and other data. Warning: The FDA on Monday outlined several updates to Chantix's labeling, including a new warning about its potential interaction with alcohol. Some patients have reported unusual or aggressive behavior when drinking while on Chantix . The agency's update follows the recommendation of a panel of outside experts, who voted last October to keep the boxed warning on the drug until it can be reevaluated based on new information. New York-based Pfizer is expected to complete a larger study of Chantix's psychiatric side effects in late 2015. Chantix's safety has been debated in medical journals and courtrooms since 2007, when reports of suicide, agitation and other problems first began streaming into the FDA. The drug's labeling currently tells patients to stop taking Chantix immediately if they experience agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thinking and other behavioral changes. Doctors are advised to weigh the drug's risks against its potential benefits of helping patients quit smoking. Pfizer's drug works by binding to the same spots in the brain that are activated by nicotine when people smoke. The drug, known generically as varenicline, blocks nicotine from binding to those spots and prevents the release of 'feel-good' brain chemicals that make smoking so addictive.","The FDA is keeping a bold-letter warning on Pfizer's anti-smoking drug Chantix about suicidal behavior and other psychiatric side effects .

"A seven-month-old girl was allegedly killed by her grandmother who sliced her throat with a circular saw when she wouldn't stop crying. Officers found the child, identified by family members as Rose Herrera, after being called on Monday morning to a family home on the city's West Side. Police said the 52-year-old relative used a power saw to cut the baby's throat to stop the infant from crying. Cause of death was confirmed on Tuesday by the Cook County Medical Examiner as blunt force injuries to the head and probable suffocation from a sock placed in the child's mouth. Scroll down for video . Police were called to this home in the 2800 block of South Avers Avenue in the Little Village section of Chicago, where they discovered the lifeless body of the infant with her throat cut . The death was declared a homicide, the medical examiner's office said on Tuesday. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the woman is in police custody at a hospital with self-inflicted wounds. Police said both the baby and the woman were found by another relative. Illinois Department of Children and Family Services officials said the agency had no prior contact with the family. Authorities said no other children were present in the home at the time of the incident. Ben Llamas works with the child's father and drove him to the scene. Mr Llamas told the Chicago Tribune the father was upset but did not talk about what happened. His friend had moved in to that house about a year ago with a woman, Llamas said. The couple had a young child. ‘At first, he was reluctant, but when the baby came, he fell in love,’ Llamas said. ‘He shows us pictures of that baby every day.’ Neighbors said several people live in the home where the baby was found. ‘They were really good people,’ Francisco Arreola told the Chicago Tribune in Spanish. ‘I would always see them and they were very happy. I never heard them fight or anything.’ Police were called at around 9.40am to a multi-family home in the 2800 block of South Avers Avenue in the Little Village section of Chicago, where they discovered the lifeless body of the infant with 'visible trauma'. The child was pronounced dead at the scene. Sources have identified the little girl as Rosie Herrera and told ABC 7 Chicago the 52-year-old woman who allegedly cut her throat may have been her grandmother. Investigators said before the suspect took a circular saw to the child's body, she tried to quiet her down by stuffing something down her throat. Following the  killing, the 52-year-old reportedly attempted to take her own life. She was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in a stable condition.

On their website, the Red Rattler claim that the theatre ‘was set up as a space where racism, homophobia, transphobia and sexism are not welcome on stage, in the audience, at the door, and at the bar.’ ‘We ask you to join us in efforts to make this space welcoming, stimulating, and happiness producing to people regardless of their ethnicity, sexuality or gender.’ Hillel believes that the decision to reject a Jewish theatre group contradicts the company’s ethos. ‘I hope that people working in community service and the not-for-profit sector can acknowledge the common ground we share, especially for events that encourage honest and open creative expression for important cultural or social issues.’ The event series, called ‘Moth’, is a performance evening to ‘encourage people to express themselves in a creative way’. ‘I was shocked and disappointed because I believe that denying a Jewish group the right to make a commercial booking is clearly racial discrimination and, in this case, Antisemitism,’ Ms Mendelvich said . The event series, called ‘Moth’, is a performance evening to ‘encourage people to express themselves in a creative way’ The upcoming event aims to ‘unpack what it means to be the third generation of holocaust survivors.' The NSW Jewish Community have been left ‘shocked and distressed’. The NSW Jewish Board of Deputies chief executive Vic Alhadeff have written to the theatre to express his concern that Hillel have been discriminated ‘based on conflicts taking place far from Australia.’ Mr Alhadeff sent the letter on March 13 and has placed several calls with The Red Rattler but is yet to receive a response. ‘It is disappointing that a theatre group (The Red Rattler Theatre company) let politics get in the way of policies, as they claim their ethos is about equality and acceptance,' Mr Alhadeff told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Alhadeff also reiterated that the group are apolitical and the purpose of the performance would be to explore the impact of the holocaust on modern generations, rather than engaging with the issue of the occupation of Palestine . ‘It is disappointing that a theatre group (The Red Rattler Theatre company) let politics get in the way of policies, as they claim their ethos is about equality and acceptance,' said Mr Alhadeff . Mr Alhadeff also reiterated that the group are apolitical and the purpose of the performance would be to explore the impact of the holocaust on modern generations, rather than engaging with the issue of the occupation of Palestine. ‘These young people have been the subject of discrimination because of an overseas conflict whilst conducting a play which had nothing whatsoever to do with any conflict overseas,' he said. ‘Their focus was on exploring the lessons future generations can learn from the holocaust survivors.’ ‘The Jewish community in Australia are Australians. This is very disappointing as we need to be able to embrace difference and focus on the shared values we have as Australians.' The Hillel theatre group continue to search for a venue for their performance and are looking forward to the series, which will include the spoken word, poetry, acoustic instrumental performances and rap.

"A schoolgirl spent six months with four inflated balloons lodged under her scalp to grow new skin to allow doctors to cover her birthmark. Jessica Brett was born with a mole covering half her head. Specialists warned her parents if it was left untreated, it could ultimately turn cancerous. Medics did not want to leave the nine-year-old with a bald patch, by using a skin graft from elsewhere on her body. And so they decided to grow more skin on her scalp, during two complex operations. In what is thought to be a UK first, surgeons put four balloons under her scalp in a 'mohawk'. Jessica Brett, nine, from Lincoln was born with a huge mole covering a large part of her head. Doctors warned her parents if left untreated, it could become cancerous. And so, they inserted four balloons under her scalp, inflating them to grow excess skin to cover the mole . They then spent six months gently inflating the balloons with more than a pint and a half of saline solution, to stretch Jessica's skin. When enough excess skin had been created, the balloons were removed. Meanwhile surgeons also removed the mole. Then, the team were able to stretch the new skin over the gap, creating a normal scalp. Jessica coped with her unusual 'hairstyle' by drawing inspiration from her short-haired hero Jessie J and didn't complain once throughout the tough ordeal. Her proud mother Becky, 34, said: 'She was really so brave - it just didn't bother her. 'She looked like she had buns on her head, and people used to comment on how they liked her ""hairstyle"". 'It was a long process but Jessica showed us the strength with how brave she has been and her courage. 'She wore a hat but then sometimes she would go out without it. 'Everyone is so proud of her. She just embraced what she has been through. She's ever so brave. Doctors spent six months inflating the balloons, three at first, to create extra skin. They then removed the mole, and used the new scalp to cover the birthmark . Jessica coped with her unusual 'hairstyle' by drawing inspiration from her short-haired hero Jessie J and didn't complain once throughout the tough ordeal, her mother said . 'It's nice now to think that it's all over for her. She looks as perfect as she did before and it's as if it never happened.' In June 2013, three balloons were inserted underneath Jessica's scalp by plastic surgeon Khawaja Gulraiz Rauf at Leicester Royal Infirmary. Gradually over the course of six months he injected saline into the balloons, every two weeks. As the balloons gently expanded they stretched Jessica's scalp. Once they reached a certain size, with almost one and a half pints of saline inside, surgeons operated on Jessica. They removed the balloons and then cut out the mole. Using the excess skin created by the balloons, they were able to cover almost all of Jessica's birthmark. But the excess skin wasn't quite large enough and so doctors inserted a final balloon in October last year. Her parents inflated the balloon at home until it was big enough to create enough new skin to cover the last 10 per cent of Jessica's mole. In January Mr Rauf removed the last part of the birthmark and covered the gap with the remaining new skin. Jessica, from Lincoln, was born with the birthmark - a pigmented melanocytic nevus - which was partially visible under her hair on the left hand side. The condition affects just one per cent of the population and appears on the head or neck in just 15 per cent of cases. The bubbly youngster wasn't phased by the mark, but doctors said it should be removed as soon as she was old enough to avoid it becoming cancerous. 'If it turned cancerous they wouldn't be able to remove it quickly enough because it's such a large area and it takes such a long process,' said Mrs Brett, who runs a data cabling company with husband James, 37. Jessica drew inspiration from her idol Jessie J when she was forced to shave all her hair off. She had the first three silicone balloons inserted in a line down the centre of her scalp in June 2013. Plastic surgery specialist Khawaja Gulraiz Rauf at Leicester Royal Infirmary filled them with saline every two weeks using a syringe. Three months later - when the 'lumps' contained almost one and a half pints - surgeons removed the skin with a mole on, and the balloons, and used her newly stretched scalp to cover it up. But the skin wasn't quite big enough, and she had to have her head shaved again and a final balloon inserted in October last year, with her parents inflating it at home. A first operation to use the excess skin created by three balloons, didn't quite cover the entire mole, and so doctors inserted a fourth balloon in October last year . in January after her final operation Jessica was left with a full head of hair once more. It is thought the procedure has never been carried out in the UK, and has only once been used in the US . The final 10 per cent of the mole - along with the balloon on the side of her head - was removed in January, and now Jessica has a perfect head of growing hair. 'Although Jessica has scars, they are quickly fading and she is looking forward to growing her hair out again,' said her mother. 'She's been amazing throughout this whole journey, taking it all in her stride with a huge smile on her face.' It is believed the procedure has never been done on the scalp in the UK before, and only once before, in America. Mr Rauf of Leicester Royal Infirmary, said: 'The successful outcome of Jessica's procedure is due to help of a wonderful team of anaesthetists, trainee surgeons, paediatric nurses, plastic surgery specialist nurses, play specialist and occupational therapists who help me make the surgical journey for the patients and their families smooth and enjoyable. 'Jessica and her parents were exemplary with way how they complied with all the instructions and kept smiling throughout this difficult time.'","Jessica Brett was born with a huge mole covering half her head .

"A film billed as the most dangerous ever made is making a return to the big screen nearly 35 years after its original release. Noel Marshall’s action-adventure film Roar was originally released in 1981 and its 11-year production is infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew. The film revolves around a wildlife preservationist who lives with his wife and children alongside a number of wild lions, tigers, cheetahs and elephants. The film became infamous for the injuries received by 70 members of the cast and crew during production . Its re-release is due to be shown at a handful of cinemas in the US in April, and will be made available to the wider public on a number of platforms as well. The film features Marshall himself, who plays the starring character of Hank, while his real-life partner Tippi Hedren plays the part of his onscreen wife. Hedren’s daughter, Melanie Griffith, is also featured in the film alongside Marshall’s three sons and a number of animal trainers. Marshall is featured riding on a motorbike at the start of the trailer as one of the lions strikes out at him . The idea of the film arrived when Marshall and Hedren discovered a plantation house overrun by lions . While the plot line for the film itself – two lions putting a family at serious risk by battling for domination – is action-packed, it is in fact the back story that is the most chilling aspect of the tale. The idea for the film came about when Marshall and Hedren discovered an abandoned plantation house overrun by a large pride of lions while touring wildlife preserves in Africa. Hoping to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by big cats in captivity, they approached a number of animal trainers for help make the concept for the film a reality. Marshall and Hedren wanted to raise awareness for the inhumane treatment experienced by cats in captivity . The couple then began adopting and breeding lions in their home in Los Angeles and for six years the family of six lived alongside the pack. They eventually moved to a range north of Los Angeles and began filming. The trailer for the film documents some of the dangers the family put themselves through during production. Noel Marshall was wounded so many times during the course of the film he was hospitalised with gangrene . Tippi Hedren’s daughter, Melanie Griffith, needed facial reconstruction surgery because of her injuries . Marshall is featured on a motorbike at the start of a film trailer, riding through a pack of lions as one of them strikes out at him as he passes by. Later he is tackled to the ground by another lion as a humorous review from HitFix appears on the screen: ‘It’s like Walt Disney went insane and shot a snuff version of Swiss Family Robinson’. Genuine fear can be seen etched onto the faces of the various crew members as they are confronted on numerous occasions by the pack. The film's trailer documents some of the dangers the family put themselves through during production . Seventy members of cast and crew were injured during the course of the film, but the lions were unharmed . The video concludes with the credits and the various injuries sustained by the cast members. Hedren suffered a broken leg, Griffith needed facial reconstruction surgery and Noel Marshall was gored so many times he was eventually hospitalised with gangrene. The film’s cinematographer, Jan de Bont – who later went on to direct Die Hard – required 220 stitches after he was scalped by a lion. The film will be re-released 34 years after it debuted in 1981 and will be shown at a handful of US cinemas . No lions were harmed during the making of the film, however. Drafthouse Films partnered with Olive Films to re-release the film, which will be available on numerous platforms later in the summer.","Roar took 11 years to create and was originally released in cinemas 1981 .

"The family of a three-year-old boy killed in a Missouri house fire while police used a stun gun on his stepfather as the man tried to save the child are now suing for city of Louisiana for wrongful death. Riley Rieser was killed in the early hours of October 31, 2013. As his stepfather, Ryan Miller, attempted to enter the burning house, a police officer tasered Mr Miller three times and handcuffed him to stop him going inside. 'I was hysterical, yes, because I wanted to save my son,' Mr Miller told the Louisiana Press Journal. Scroll down for video . Riley Rieser, 3, was tragically killed in a house fire on October 31, 2013, in Louisiana, Missouri. His family are now suing the city after the boy's stepfather, Ryan Miller, was tasered and handcuffed by police . Grandmother Lori Miller said she witnessed two officers use the stun gun three times, twice after Ryan Miller had been handcuffed. Mr Miller suffered chest burns and was taken to the city jail, although he was later released without being charged. City Administrator Bob Jenne called the police response a 'judgment call'. However the family say it was the wrong judgement, and are now suing on the grounds of excessive, negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful death and false imprisonment. The lawsuit was filed March 12 and was obtained by Courthouse News. The family are seeking unspecified damages . 'Officers Jeffrey Salois and William Harrison prevented Ryan Miller from entering the home to save his stepson Riley Rieser by forcibly moving and by repeatedly Tasing Ryan Miller, including once in the police cruiser as Riley Rieser was being removed from the home,' the lawsuit reads. Police used a stun gun three times on step-father Ryan Miller (left) and handcuffed him so he couldn't run into his burning home in an attempt to save young Riley (right) Riley Miller's aunt Emily has described the actions of the police as 'heartless' and she doesn't think they handled the situation correctly . The original 911 call for the fire came in at 12.58am and firefighters arrived at the scene at 1.03am. Both of Riley's parents were taken to Memorial Medical Center's burn unit in Springfield, Ill. by family members for treatment. Cathy Miller suffered a burn to the cornea in one of her eyes. Both she and her husband were released from hospital on Thursday night. Lori Miller said police stunned her son Ryan as he tried to get back in the house. 'He tried to get back in the house to get the baby,' she told KHQA. 'They took my son to jail because he tried to save his son.' Riley's aunt Emily Miller has publicly criticized how police handled the situation. Mom Cathy Miller (right) is mourning the loss of her youngest son Riley, pictured on the right in the blue pool . 'It's just heartless. How could they be so heartless? And while they all just stood around and waited for the fire department, what kind of police officer wouldn't try and save a three-year-old burning in a house?' she told KHQA. 'We've been going through pictures and he's just smiling in every picture. He was just a happy, go-lucky kid.' The fire started in a recreation room at the rear of the house. The official cause was faulty wiring, according to the complaint. The parents had fallen asleep watching television, but were woken by the smoke alarm and managed to get out of the building via a rear door in the same room. They then called 911. Wreck: A city police officer fired his stun gun at Ryan Miller as he tried to re-enter his burning home, which was destroyed . Riley was asleep in his bedroom and so Ryan Miller ran to the front of the house and kicked in the front door. Police arrived as he was about to enter and an officer stunned him with a Taser.

"Japan marked the fourth anniversary today of a quake-tsunami disaster that swept away thousands of people and sparked a nuclear crisis that continues to wreak misery for many. Remembrance ceremonies were held around the disaster zone and in Tokyo, where Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko led tributes to those who died in Japan's worst peace-time disaster. TV footage showed victims and volunteers joining hands in prayer near the shell of a tsunami-hit building in the port town of Minamisanriku, one of the many stark reminders of the destruction.

Crippled: Smoke is seen coming from the No. 3 reactor of the Fukushima Dai'ichi nuclear power plant in Tomioka, Fukushima Prefecture ten days after the tsunami destroyed the complex, forcing thousands to flee the radiation zone . Its gigantic force unleashed a towering wall of water that travelled at the speed of a jet plane to the coast. Within minutes, communities were turned to matchwood and whole families drowned. 'The situation surrounding disaster victims remains severe,' the emperor told the ceremony. 'It is important to continue making efforts to build a safer land without forgetting this lesson.' The National Police Agency said a total of 15,891 people are confirmed to have died in the disaster, with another 2,584 listed as missing. Human remains are still occasionally found. For thousands of relatives, the absence of a body to mourn makes the process of moving on much harder and some continue to carry out their own physical search. 'Somebody needs to do this, walking along the shore,' said Takayuki Ueno, who at the weekend combed a desolate winter beach for the bones of his three-year-old son. In the central coastal town of Shichigahama, 28 police and coastguard officers offered a silent prayer this morning before they began their search for the bodies of two people still missing.

'We still hope to find (the bodies) for the sake of their families,' he told AFP. The nuclear disaster that the tsunami caused at the Fukushima plant continues to haunt Japan and fuel national debate. The crippled plant remains volatile and the complicated decommissioning process is expected to last for decades. After successfully removing spent fuel rods from a storage pool at Fukushima, plant operator Tokyo Electric Power is still struggling to handle an ever-increasing amount of contaminated water. Japan's entire stable of nuclear reactors were gradually switched off after the disaster.

Although Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government and much of industry is keen to get back to atomic generation - largely because of the high costs of dollar-denominated fossil fuels to an economy with a plunging currency - the public is unconvinced. A nuclear watchdog has so far given the green light to refiring four reactors at two plants, but the actual restarts will be delayed until a months-long public consultation is finished and local authorities give their blessing. In the shadow of the Fukushima Daiichi plant on Wednesday, former residents of the nearby evacuated town of Namie placed flowers at a temporary altar and bowed toward the sea.

Fears persist among Japan's population over the effect on health of the radioactive leaks, despite repeated calls from scientists for judgements to be based on evidence. Gerry Thomas, a specialist in thyroid cancer at Imperial College London, who also conducted research on health effects of the 1992 Chernobyl accident, told reporters in Tokyo the worries were disproportionate. 'The health effects caused by the radiation itself were very small, but the health effects that were caused by worrying about the radiation were much, much greater,' she said in Tokyo, referring to post-Chernobyl studies. Despite government pledges of billions of dollars in reconstruction aid, progress in disaster-hit regions has been slow.

"A Chinese restaurant in Kenya that barred black customers from entering after 5pm has been shut down. The owners of the Chongqing Chinese in Nairobi only let taxi drivers or Africans accompanied by Chinese, European or Indian patrons in to eat. They have now been summoned before authorities after it emerged they did not have the proper licence. A Chinese restaurant in Nairobi,  which barred black customers after 5pm, has been shut down with its owners summoned before authorities . The restaurant's rule was brought into place after a robbery in 2013 and was not meant to cause offence, the owners said. 'We don't admit Africans that we don't know because you never know who is Al-Shabaab and who isn't,' restaurant relations manager Esther Zhao told the Daily Nation. But Otiende Amollo, the Ombudsman, said it was both illegal and unconstitutional to discriminate against an individual on the grounds of their race, gender or ethnicity. He said: 'That amounts to racial and ethnic profiling, which is unconstitutional. 'It has in it the inherent assumption that Africans are inevitably pre-disposed to be robbers.' Residents took to social media to express their anger at being banned from the Chinese using the hashtags #RacistRestaurant, #NoBlacksHere and #TheChineseInvasion. One user Anita Munyasya tweeted: 'Soon we'll be banned from our own country... #RacistRestaurant' Another with the name @kaytrixx wrote: 'It's like a visitor at your house ordered you to go and eat in the loo instead of dining table (sic). Who owns the house? #NoBlacksHere' And one known just as Ken added: 'Discrimination of any kind is evil may it be based on RACE, ETHNICITY, TRIBE, RELIGION, OPINION or otherwise. #NoBlacksHere' Residents took to social media to express their anger at being banned from the restaurant using the hashtags #RacistRestaurant, #NoBlacksHere and #TheChineseInvasion . One Kenyan MP even asked the Parliamentary Committee on Security to carry out its own investigation. Nairobi governor Evans Kidero said the restaurant was shut because it did not have the proper licences. He said: 'We have established that the restaurant did not have the licences and I have ordered it closed until the management complies. 'The owners of the restaurant have no change of user from residential to commercial which is a requirement to operate a business in Nairobi. 'As of now the restaurant will remain closed until they comply with all set rules and regulations. We have deployed security officers around the premises.' But he added: 'All business and service providers must ensure that all customers and clients are treated with respect and dignity, irrespective of race, colour, sex, tribe and religion.' China's relationship with Kenya and much of Africa has been seen as being at an all-time high - notably with huge investments in major infrastructure projects. Up to two million Chinese people have moved to Africa in the last 15 years.","Owners of the Chongqing Chinese barred black customers after 5pm .

"Lloyd Wilce, 86, is Britain's longest-serving councillor after 66 years in office . Britain's longest-serving councillor is hoping to be re-elected for the 16th time – after 66 years in office. Lloyd Wilce, 86, was first elected in 1949 and has run unopposed for more than 20 years because of a lack of candidates. This year the Labour member will have to defend his seat on Cinderford Town Council in Gloucestershire on May 7, but is yet to find out how many candidates will run against him. The authority has changed name three times since he was first elected and he has seen countless mayors and leaders. He counts his biggest political victories as securing a bigger swimming pool for the Gloucestershire town and raising enough money to erect a bronze statue of a miner. Great-grandfather Mr Wilce said: 'All those years ago I never thought for a second I would last this long as a councillor. 'In fact, around three years ago I had a spell of poor health and I didn't think I would last much longer. 'But here I am, and I enjoy just being part of the community. I've always liked joining in with things and being part of what is going on in the area.' His interest in politics began when he joined the Labour League of Youth as a teenager and became their regional chairman aged 16. He was listed to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers for two years, serving around the UK, where he was the army's top middle distance runner. This year the Labour member (pictured meeting locals) will have to defend his seat on Cinderford Town Council for the first time on May 7 . Lloyd Wilce was first elected in 1949 after serving in the army (pictured left, in the army in 1947) for two years. Right, with his son Adrian in 1960 . Following his national service he got a job at Debenhams in Gloucester in 1949 and won his first seat on what was then called East Dean Parish Council. He joined in a bid to improve Cinderford's sports facilities and one of his early political achievements was raising enough money to increase the size of the town's swimming pool. 'I had been on a proper running track and we had nothing like that in Cinderford - there was no swimming pool or sports facilities. 'When I got demobbed and I had an interest in those things, and there was some councillor making moves and thinking we wanted to have those things, so I got involved. Mr Wilce celebrating his 50 years of service at the council with wife Mary and sons Nigel and Adrian in 1999 . 'I put on a carnival and got the funds to make the pool at the school into a bigger pool than planned and got the support of the council.' Mr Wilce had two sons with wife Mary and after 17 years in the outfitting trade the pair took over the village hall in Steam Mills, Gloucestershire. They applied for a pub licence and ran it as the Old Engine Inn for around 25 years before he retired and Mary passed away four years ago, aged 77. He has met Tony Blair and John Prescott during his tenure, as well as going to the Queen's garden party twice and visiting the House of Commons and the Lords. His proudest achievement in his political career is raising £20,000 through bingo nights for a bronze statue of a miner in Cinderford, to remember the town's history in 2000. Mr Wilce and wife Mary pictured outside Buckingham Palace, where they attended a garden party in 2001 . Lloyd Wilce, wife Mary and children Adrian and Nigel, pictured outside their home in Cinderford, around 1960 . He has registered to stand for election on May 7, but is yet to find out how many people will stand against him. 'I wasn't going to stand but I had my arm twisted - people said I had been doing it so long I might as well keep going,' he said. 'I'm pretty sure with all these other parties like UKIP that there will be an election this year and I'll probably go against someone else. 'I don't know that I'm very happy about UKIP to be honest. 'They promise an awful lot and from what I've seen of Farage I'm not sure their ideas are good ones. 'I wouldn't put myself forward if I didn't think I was going to get in, but I'll have to wait and see I guess.' Speaking of David Cameron's announcement that he would leave after three terms as PM, Mr Wilce remained sceptical. 'He might change his mind,' he said. The local authority has changed name three times since he was first elected and he has seen countless mayors and leaders.

"Bubble baths, poker cards and a strategically placed exercise balls are some of the only things covering up the brave models of an Ohio rest home, who have stripped down for a good cause. It was the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living residents, who are all in their 80s and 90s, who came up with the idea for a charity calendar that showed a little bit of skin. Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, said the residents were inspired by a similar calendar another retirement center nearby had done. Wilma Purvis and Norma Elfrink were the centerfold for the stripped down charity calendar made by residents of the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living facility in Barberton, Ohio . 'They were so cute about it,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'It wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful.' Morris said the only thing her mother, who was Miss July, was worried about was getting her hair done before the shoot. The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an appropriate holiday theme. Miss February, 87-year-old Dottie Rutter, lies in a bubble bath covered in rose petals as she enjoys a box of chocolates to honor Valentine's Day. The 98-year-old Maxine Garden, who  passed away after the shoot, can be seen smiling behind a large exercise ball, happy bare (almost) all in the facility's gym. The calendar's centerfold is Wilma Purvis, 94, and Norma Elfrink, 91, playing a game of poker with some very large cards - not to mention Coronas and cigars. Miss October Jean Genet (right), 90, told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked.'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said . Lifetime Barbertown resident and Miss October Jean Genet, 90, was a housewife before moving into Pleasant Pointe. She told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked. 'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said. She said none of the models said no to the shoot in December and that she 'felt glamorous' after taking off her clothes to pose in a witches hat. Mrs Genet was sad that her husband, who died in November, did not get to see the calendar. However, she said her whole family, which includes five daughters, 14 grandchilden and 30 great-grandchildren, have picked up copies. 'They can't believe that's grandma,' she said. Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, told the Daily Mail Online the calendar 'wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful' The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an appropriate holiday theme . Pleasant Pointe spokesperson Michelle Clapper said the residents were 'very excited' to be a part of the charity calendar, she told the Akron Beacon Journal. She said they were 'like 20-year-olds' on the morning of the big shoot, giggling and 'having the time of their lives'. 'I do not believe the elderly should just sit around staring at each other,' she said. 'I want a fun environment. I love supporting their independence.' 'I wanted them to decide what they wanted to do,' said Morris. 'That's what we're here for.' Proceeds from the calendars, which are selling for $12, will held provide shoes for children who attend schools in the area. The residents recently donated $2,000 to the fund. Pleasant Pointe says that it has had to order more calendars to keep up with demand, according to WKYC. None of the residents had ever done any sort of naked modeling before.

"A politician's push for same-sex marriage to be legalised in Australia has earned him scores of homophobic hate mail and even death threats. One handwritten note sent to Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm on Wednesday calls him a 'filthy animal' and states 'someone should give you a blast of shotgun. Preferably in the stomach'. Senator Leyonhjelm's Freedom To Marry Bill aims to 'prevent the government from stopping two people from getting married on the grounds that they are not a man and a woman'. The vile note sent to him by one anonymous homophobe not only threatens his life but also warns 'there will be a curse on you and your family'. But the politician, who has been together with the woman he calls his 'wife' for 30 years although choosing not to legally marry, has vowed not to be deterred from having his bill debated. 'We actively support freedom of speech, but this does not reflect well on the company people who oppose our Freedom to Marry Bill are keeping,' Senator Leyonhjelm told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm has received homophobic hate mail from some of those opposed to gay marriage . One handwritten note not only threatens his life but also warns 'there will be a curse on you and your family' His office has binned many of the threatening letters and the Senator is concerned that his staff have to deal with this kind of correspondence. Amongst the emails and letters he has received is a 14-page document that claims to be 'evidence indicating the inappropriateness of sponsoring same sex marriages'. The 7,000 word rambling missive that the Senator received also compares homosexuality to 'alcoholism, paedophilia, gambling, raping'. 'If we assume homosexuality is genetically based, it still does not make it desirable or appropriate,' the letter says. One man, calling himself a Liberal supporter, wrote: 'Perhaps you could propose another form of Marriage Act for those who do not want to associate themselves with homosexual (or any other fringe sexuality) union.' Another email says: 'Homosexuals are not born homosexuals... Homosexuality is a choice. Choices are influenced by our inherent sinful nature and the pervertedness of the society in which we live.' Senator Leyonhjelm's Freedom To Marry Bill aims to get the government out of people's bedrooms . One email from someone claiming to be a doctor reads homosexuality can't 'be condoned in our society' Amongst the emails and letters he has received is a 14-page document that claims to be 'evidence indicating the inappropriateness of sponsoring same sex marriages' One email from someone claiming to be a doctor reads: 'How come you are a qualified vet and yet you don't seem to realise that bisexuality, pedophilia and homosexuality are all biological defects of sexual attraction. None of these can be condoned in our society.' Many of the letters warn of a 'harmful' effect on society if the bill is passed. 'All my Freedom to Marry Bill does is prevent the government from stopping two people from getting married on the grounds that they are not a man and a woman,' the senator wrote in an article for the Sydney Morning Herald this week. 'It's based on the view that people ought to have the freedom to choose their own life path. As John Stuart Mill said, ""over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign"".' One man, calling himself a Liberal supporter, wrote: 'Perhaps you could propose another form of Marriage Act for those who do not want to associate themselves with homosexual' Before hoping to present his bill to the Senate on Thursday, Leyonhjelm wrote: 'My bill requires nothing more than tolerance – a decision to stop minding other people's business.' However, the parliamentary debate on legalising same-sex marriage is now on hold for a few months. The Senate was scheduled to debate the private bill on Thursday, only for it to make way for the government's data retention legislation. But Senator Leyonhjelm says any debate would have been 'somewhat artificial' without Liberals being allowed a conscience vote. 'I do have a very good speech ready,' he told reporters in Canberra. It's likely a debate on Leyonhjelm's bill won't take place until mid-June at the earliest.","Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm got the note on Wednesday .

"A Texas hunter who is paying $350,000 (£235,000) to shoot a Black Rhino in Africa has been granted permission to import the animal's carcass to the U.S. as a trophy. Corey Knowlton sparked fury among animal rights activists after bidding for the right to shoot the animal at an auction held by the Dallas Safari Club last year. After news of the auction broke Mr Knowlton received death threats and has had to hire a private security team. Trophy: Texas big game hunter Corey Knowlton has been granted permission to bring the carcass of a Black Rhino back to the U.S. A file picture of two Black Rhinos. The Namibian government issues a small number of licences to hunt the animals with the proceeds used to fund anti-poaching efforts . The number of Black Rhinos left in Africa has fallen from 70,000 fifty years ago to just 5,000. Namibia controversially allows a small number of the animals, normally older male bulls, to be hunted each year with fees going to fund anti-poaching efforts. They claim the strategy has led to their black rhino population doubling between 2001 and 2012. More than 150,000 people signed petitions calling on the US Fish and Wildlife Service not to grant Mr Knowlton a permit to bring the carcass home. Campaign: More than 150,000 people signed petitions calling on the US Fish and Wildlife Service not to grant Mr Knowlton a permit to bring the carcass home . But the agency decided that as the $350,000 was going towards conservation efforts, allowing the carcass to be brought to the U.S. would not breach the endangered species act. Last year they approved a similar permit for another American hunter, Las Vegas-based investor Michael Luzich, who paid $200,000 directly to the Namibian government to kill a Black Rhino. Under Namibia's management plan, which began in 1995, the black rhino population has grown from 2,400 to 4,880 in 15 years. Prior to Namibia's poaching boom in the 1960s, the country had around 70,000 black rhinos. The program allows for the culling of five old male bulls to support younger males in mating and growing the population. There is a high demand for poaching rhino horns, since they are used as traditional Asian medicine in China and Vietnam. The horns can fetch as much as $50,000 per kilogram on the black market. Poachers’ attempts to retrieve the horns have hit news headlines, with some efforts leaving behind gruesome pictures of rhinos bleeding to death. If the poaching continues, estimates by rhinosurvival.org say the rhino will be extinct by 2025. Since publishing the initial request in November, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service received more than 15,000 comments, as well as petitions with about 152,000 signatures demanding that it be denied. 'United States citizens make up a disproportionately large share of foreign hunters who book trophy hunts in Africa,' said Dan Ashe, director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in a statement. 'That gives us a powerful tool to support countries that are managing wildlife populations in a sustainable manner and incentivize others to strengthen their conservation and management programs.' Humane Society of the United States chief executive Wayne Pacelle said the federal agency is sending a 'mixed message,' noting rhino poaching is on the rise. PETA said Thursday that it will file a lawsuit. Dallas Safari Club spokeswoman Jay Ann Cox could not immediately confirm Thursday whether a date has been set for the hunt. In a letter to the agency in December, the club's executive director, Ben Carter, said the money raised from such auctions is 'critical to supporting the Namibian government in their efforts to stem the tide of commercial killing of these animals.' Mr Knowlton, a consultant to a hunting organisation in Virginia, is pictured on his own Facebook page posing with numerous dead animals.

Activists have set up a mock Facebook page using his picture with devil horns drawn over it . Environmentalists say the animals are already being hunted for their prized horns, and that allowing them to be hunted is wrong. 'Kill it to save it is counterintuitive and flawed logic,' said Jeff Flocken, the North American regional director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. 'The fact that some Americans are showing they will pay any price to kill one of the last black rhinos is not going to help the species in the long run but only continue to put a price on its head.'","Corey Knowlton won right to kill the animal at an auction last year .

"Never-before-seen images showing Captain Scott's doomed expedition team setting off on their ill-fated trek to the South Pole have come to light - revealing the harsh conditions the men faced. The archive of 52 celluloid negatives were taken at the expedition base camp of Cape Evans on Ross Island, and show Scott's party preparing to head off during the doomed Terra Nova Expedition of 1912. In some pictures, the herd of ponies the team used to haul the equipment-laden sledges on the 800 mile trek can be seen. The images, now thought to be worth £50,000, also show the team of husky dogs used for part of the journey that would end with the deaths of Scott and the polar party of Edward Wilson, Lawrence Oates, Edgar Evans and Henry Bowers. The animals were to be Scott's downfall as he abandoned the use of the dogs on the final leg of the trek, wrongly believing they would not make the ascent of Beardmore Glacier. Scroll down for video . Captain Scott's team depart pulling a sled in poignant unseen photographs taken by Lt Henry Bowers of Scott's ill-fated 1912 Antarctic expedition. The images also show the beginning of the expedition that would end with the deaths of Scott and the polar party of Edward Wilson, Lawrence Oates, Edgar Evans and Henry Bowers . Bowers perished with Scott on their return from the South Pole, but these photographs taken by him were returned to Britain with expedition photographer Herbert Ponting.

Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen beat Scott to the pole by 34 days, largely because his team used dogs instead of slower ponies. Two of the men featured in the archive were dog handlers Cecil Meares and Dimitri Gerof. Other pictures in the archive show the flimsy-looking pyramid tents that sheltered the men from the bone-chilling temperatures of -70F as well as them trekking in the snow. There are also general shots of the harsh landscape and ice shelves that only a handful of men had visited until that point.

The dog teams at rest as the men contemplate their journey. The photographs were taken by Bowers under the direction of the official photographer Herbert Ponting at the expedition base camp of Cape Evans on Ross Island . The pictures were part of the huge 1,700 image archive gathered by Ponting, who trained Bowers in the art of photography so he could take pictures during the ground-breaking trek to the pole. The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was led by Robert Falcon Scott with the objective of being the first to reach the geographical South Pole. Scott and his four companions reached the pole on 17 January 1912, where they found that a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 33 days. Scott's entire party died on the return journey from the pole. Some of their bodies, journals and photographs were discovered by a search party eight months later. For many years after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few questions were asked about the causes of the disaster which overcame his polar party. The degree of Scott's personal culpability remains a matter of controversy among commentator, but it is thought that exhaustion, extreme cold and starvation definitely led to the men's demise. Ponting brought the negatives back to England with him in preparation for Scott to use for lecture and fundraising tours around the world upon his return. Most of the images are owned by the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University. These negatives were retained by Ponting and were sold by his family to a private collector after his death in 1935. They have been in the family of the collector ever since and are now being sold by Henry Aldridge and Son Auctioneers of Devizes, Wilts, for a pre-sale estimate of between £30,000 and £50,000. Andrew Aldridge said: 'The negatives offer an incredible snapshot into one of the most famous British Antartic expeditions of the 20th century. 'They show the brutal nature of the environment these brave men went on to endure. 'The clarity of the images is truly remarkable and includes previously unseen elements including the polar party marching, pitching tents and them having lunch. 'The vast majority of Ponting's pictures are in the Scott Polar Research Unit. As far as we can tell most of these negatives haven't been published before.' Scott's Terra Nova expedition arrived at Cape Evans on Ross Island in January 1911. After seeing out the austral winter Scott's polar party of 16 men set off in the November 1911 to be the first people to reach the South Pole. The supporting party of 11 men returned as planned at various stages during the 800 mile trek, leaving Scott, Wilson, Oates, Evans and Bowers to reach the pole. The men made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912 only to find Amundsen had beaten them to it. On their return journey, the five men endured dreadful conditions and suffered from a lack of food and frostbite. Evans died on February 17, 1912 and a flagging Oates famously died on March 16 after walking out of the tent into a blizzard to give the remaining three a chance of survival. Scott, Wilson and Bowers died in the tent on or about March 29. Their bodies were found eight months later by a rescue party. The negatives are being sold in Devizes on April 18.

"The scheduled Wednesday execution of a convicted cop killer that would have used up the state's last dose of a lethal injection drug has been halted by the highest criminal appeals court in Texas. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled to stop the scheduled execution of 55-year-old Randall Wayne Mays late on Monday. Mays was convicted of murder after a shootout in 2007 left Henderson County Sheriff's Office Investigator Paul Steven Habelt and Deputy Tony Price Ogburn dead. Scroll down for video . Randall Wayne Mays, 55, was due to be executed on Wednesday but a Texas appeals court put a stop to it . Mays' punishment would have used up the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's last does of pentobarbital . The death chamber where executions take place is located in the Walls Unit in downtown Huntsville, Texas . The court agreed with Mays' lawyers that additional review is needed to determine if he is mentally competent for execution. His punishment would have used up the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's last dose of pentobarbital. The drug is used for lethal injections and it is now difficult to obtain for capital punishment. Thanks to the delay, Texas has enough pentobarbital for its next scheduled execution on April 9. The state has at least three other executions on the calendar for April. Mays was going to receive a lethal injection. The delay means Texas' next execution can go on as planned . As a result of this order, Mays' case will be sent back to Henderson County. An expert will need to determine whether he's competent to receive the death penalty. The Eighth Amendment bars the execution of a person who does not understand that his execution is imminent and does not understand why he are being executed. The state believes Mays was aware of the execution and why it was going to happen. Texas prison officials, like those in other death penalty states, have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use. The state's penultimate portion of pentobarbital was used in the execution of a Mexican hit man who was convicted of beating and strangling a San Antonio woman. Manuel Vasquez killed the woman because she didn't pay a ten per cent tax on her illegal drug sales. Vasquez was executed on March 11 and he was the fourth Texas inmate put to death this year.","Randall Wayne Mays due to die Wednesday for killing two in shootout .

"This terrifying clip shows the moment blood-red fluid began leaking along the walls of a bus - in a scene straight out of horror movie The Shining. As the oozing liquid drips down into a huge puddle on the bus floor, panicked passengers are heard repeatedly urging the driver to stop the vehicle and open the doors. The incident occurred on March 19 on a 99 B-line bus bound for the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Passengers on a Vancouver bus became panicked as a blood-red fluid began dripping down the walls of the vehicle in a scene reminiscent of cult horror movie The Shining . Luka Jason, who posted the video, joked the 'bus might need an exorcism'.  In two days, the 90-second clip has amassed almost 50,000 views. The caption adds: 'A little bit of panic ensued in this packed bus behind me as you can hear from all the voices.' One person is heard speculating the fluid may be hazardous, adding: 'What is that? It stinks.' Commenter EloynAmmillio believes the fluid is 'similar to anti-freeze that is part of the air conditioning system' that sits on top of the rear cab of the bus. 'Apparently a hose burst somewhere and let it all out of the radiator. It is toxic to get into the eyes and mouth and can be irritating to skin if allowed long exposure.' But according to bus company TransLink, it was a non-toxic and non-flammable leak of hydraulic fluid - although some types can cause irritation to the skin and eyes, and be toxic if swallowed. An iconic scene in The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick, shows a river of blood gushing out of an elevator . Bus company TransLink confirmed the leak was of non-toxic and non-flammable leak of hydraulic fluid . Chris Bryan, a spokesperson for the company, told Vancity Buzz: 'TransLink take all leaks very seriously. All incidents are promptly and thoroughly investigated. 'Once repairs are made, our vehicles are road tested prior being returned to service. At no time were passengers in any danger.' The cause of the leak is not known, but the vehicle resumed operation after a two-hour repair. Mr Bryan added the safe steering of the bus was not affected. 'We apologize to any of our passengers who may have been distressed by the incident,' he added.

"A devoted husband who narrowly survived a suicide pact with his wife 12 months ago has killed himself using the same method, a coroner's court has heard. Kenneth Brown, 75, died in his bathroom from carbon monoxide poisoning in the same spot where wife Helen, 71, was found under a blanket the year before. Portsmouth Coroner's Court heard that he had been 'living in misery' since his wife's death, and was found on October 30 last year after sending letters to his sons explaining his decision. Portsmouth Coroner's Court (pictured) heard that Kenneth Brown had been 'living in misery' since the death of his wife, who killed herself in a joint suicide attempt which he narrowly survived . Helen Brown became suicidal due to a severe bout of depression brought on by illness, and had attempted suicide several times before husband Kenneth agreed to help her kill herself. Mr Brown, a former company director, decided he wanted to die alongside his wife to avoid being sent to jail afterwards. He survived the initial attempt after emergency services were called, but Portsmouth coroner's court heard the near miss had brought on a severe bout of depression. Coroner David Horsley (pictured) said it was a 'very sad' case, and told Mr Brown's two sons that he hoped never to see them again . Police rushed to his address in Liss, Hampshire, for a second time on October last year after receiving a signed letter saying he had gassed himself, but were unable to save him. His son James told the hearing how his father had been depressed following the death of his wife and had finally 'got what he wanted.' He said: 'It's an unfortunate turn of events but ultimately I'm happy that he got what he wanted, as he'd only been living there in misery. 'Maybe he would have come out of it in a few years but he wouldn't have seen the point in continuing, he wouldn't have seen the point in going on.' Mr Brown had posted letters to his two sons shortly before killing himself explaining his decision. Portsmouth coroner David Horsley, who presided over the inquest into Mrs Brown's death, recorded a verdict of suicide, noting that retired company director Mr Brown was severely depressed at the time. He told Mr Brown's sons: 'I really hope that I never see anybody from your family in this court again. I'm so, so sorry that you are here. 'The sad story is that basically he had given up since the death of your mother. 'He had chosen to withdraw from things and I think we can understand that really given the circumstances leading up to it including your mother's death. 'All I can say is how terribly sorry I am to you and all of your family that this has happened.

"It's one of the things we whine about most – but it’s actually good to be bored. Studies show that allowing the mind to wander fuels creativity. Researcher Sandi Mann said that far from being a waste of time, being a little bit bored can actually be good for us. And she warned that our modern-day obsession with smartphones and other gadgets could be stifling this creativity because time we would now have spent daydreaming is now taken up with emailing, texting or surfing the internet. Similarly, children could benefit from having some time to themselves, rather than being constantly entertained. Creativity: Children could benefit from getting a bit bored, rather than being constantly entertained . To prove her theory, Dr Mann gave 80 adults two polystyrene cups and asked them to come up with as many uses for them as possible. Half of the men and women got straight to work. The other half spent 15 minutes writing out phone numbers first. As a result, they came up more ideas about how to use the cups, the British Psychological Society magazine, the Psychologist reports. A second experiment showed a repetitive reading task to be even more effective at sparking the imagination. Dr Mann, of the University of Central Lancashire, said this may be because reading requires less concentration than writing, allowing more scope for daydreaming. She said: ‘I am acutely aware that being bored is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. ‘It is good to be bored sometimes. ‘I think up so many ideas when I am commuting to and from work. Daydreaming: Our obsession with gadgets has left little time for getting bored and daydreaming, Dr Sandi Mann (pictured) has warned . ‘This would be dead time, but thanks to the boredom it induces, I come up with all sorts of projects.’ However, she warned that our love phones and other gadgets means we are in danger of forgetting how to be bored. She said: ‘No one ever stands waiting for a bus or train without playing on their phone. Whenever we have got a moment to fill, we get our phone out.’ Dr Mann also believes it is important for children to be bored. She said: ‘We seem to be afraid of our kids being bored but boredom can lead to creativity and if you stifle the boredom, you stifle the creativity. ‘I am quite happy when my kids whine that they are bored. ‘Finding ways to amuse themselves is an important skill.’ However, it is important not to be too bored. Dr Mann has also showed that bored office workers seek solace in chocolate and alcohol. She said: ‘It’s about finding the right balance. ‘Too much boredom can be destructive but too many people just don’t allow a little bit of boredom into their life.’","Dr Sandi Mann found those given boring tasks to do were more creative .

"American low-cost carrier, Spirit Airlines, has just acquired its 69th plane and has found an interesting way to celebrate. Not only has the airline slashed roundtrip fairs to £69 in April and May - including taxes and fees - but they also announced such a drastic price drop with some rather cheeky copy. The emails sent around announcing the sale reference a particular sexual act in very blatant terms, with some customers complaining that the new campaign is in poor taste. Scroll down for video . American budget airline, Spirit Airlines, is celebrating it's 69th plane with low fares and cheeky ad campaign . 'We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,' Spirit's website reads. 'It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). '#69 is perfect: just the right size, with a cockpit that's in your face (because it's bright yellow). 'Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going.' Spirit has long taken a tongue-in-cheek approach to its promotions, calling itself the 'home of the bare fare' The company has already used the provocative slogan, 'Home of the Bare Fare,' when discussing their competitive pricing in the past. In fact, the phrase is currently emblazoned on several of its aircraft. In much the same vein, Spirit spokesman Paul Berry said, in a statement, that the latest campaign was simply a reflection of the airline's unconventional and quirky personality. 'Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be. 'We enjoy being different than other airlines.' Spokesman, Paul Berry, has said that the latest campaign is simply a reflection of Spirit's quirky personality . However, some customers have took to social media to question if the ad campaign has gone a bit too far . 'When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares. 'But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent. 'They get lots of attention. 'The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are.

"The two cross-dressing men who were shot outside the National Security Agency's headquarters on Monday had stolen the SUV they were driving from a hotel they had been partying at, it is claimed. Kevin Fleming, 20, and his friend were allegedly picked up in Baltimore, Maryland, by another man on Sunday night and driven to a hotel in Howard County, where they were said to have 'partied'. But the following morning, the unidentified driver woke up alone and discovered both the men and his Ford Escape SUV had gone, sources told ABC. He reported his vehicle stolen to county police. Shortly after, Fleming and his friend allegedly drove the SUV onto the grounds of the NSA and refused police commands to halt. They were subsequently shot by a guard outside the facility. Scroll down for videos . An NSA officer opened fire, killing one of the suspects and wounding a second during a shootout. A white sheet appears to cover a body outside the the SUV . The 44-year-old officer is pictured here being loaded into an ambulance following the harrowing shootout at one of the nation's most secure military installations . What appears to be a brown wig (circled, lower right) can be seen outside the stolen Ford SUV that the suspects were driving. The men were reportedly disguised as women . Fleming's friend, who is yet to be identified, was killed in shooting, the NSA said in a statement. Fleming was flown to hospital with serious injuries, while a NSA police officer was also wounded. It is unclear how the men ended up at the government building. The incident sparked terrorism fears at the heavily secured area on Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, on Monday morning. On Monday afternoon, authorities said that at Fleming and his friend were suspected robbers who were fleeing the scene of a carjacking nearby when they took a wrong turn off a highway. The men then panicked and refused police commands to stop when they strayed on to the highly secretive government property, police said. They were apparently warned several times to halt. When the SUV accelerated, the guard opened fire - killing one passenger and gravely wounding Fleming. The vehicle slammed into a police SUV blocking the road, injuring the officer, as well. The Washington Post reported that the shooting - which resulted in the president being briefed - was linked to the robbery at the Jessup hotel in the morning, less than five miles from the NSA. The NSA checkpoint where the shooting occurred is directly off the busy Highway 295 between Washington, DC, and Baltimore . This diagram shows where the shooting took place - just outside a gate at Fort Meade in Maryland . After stealing the SUV from outside the unidentified hotel, the suspects fled down Highway 295, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and ended up on Fort Meade, it is reported. As they drove through the gate of the NSA, they accelerated and would not stop, according to the NSA. As they sped through the checkpoint, they slammed into a police SUV. The officer who opened fire was injured in the process. During a later police search of the stolen black Ford, drugs and at least one gun were found in the vehicle, authorities said. It is unknown why the suspects were dressed as women, nor whether their attire was a disguise related to the alleged carjacking or something to with the 'partying' they had apparently done. The 44-year-old NSA police officer and the surviving suspect, 20, were both transported to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore,WTTG-TV reports. Chaos: A black Ford Escape SUV tried to ram through a secure gate near the NSA headquarters on Fort Meade in Maryland about 9am on Monday . A US official told NBC News that the incident appears to be a criminal matter, rather than an act of terrorism . Aerial footage from WRC-TV showed the injured officer being loaded into an ambulance. Other pictures from the scene show what appears to be a crash between the black Ford Escape and a police SUV outside the gates to the military post. A  body can be seen covered by a white sheet next to the black SUV. What appears to be a curly brown wig can be seen beside the SUV, as well . Fort Meade is home to several highly sensitive government agencies, including the NSA - the spy agency responsible for controversial mass surveillance programs - and the US military Cyber Command, which is responsible for military cyber-warfare and defense. The base is home to more than 11,000 military personnel and 29,000 civilian employees.","National Security Agency police guard shot Kevin Fleming, 20, and his friend, who tried to ram through secure entrance on Fort Meade Monday .

"A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice, a study has claimed. Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290 million. Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair. More than four million A&E visits each year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290million, a survey claims . Doctors have even reported patients showing up because their children had headlice, or because their false nails were hurting . The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ‘self-treatable condition’. The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours. Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours. Even the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has admitted taking his children to casualty at the weekend rather than making an appointment with a GP. But the unnecessary visits are adding to the pressures of busy departments and diverting staff from treating patients who are very seriously ill. It all came to a head in January when 13 hospitals declared major internal incidents in a two-day period as they were unable to cope with the numbers coming through the door. Now experts are urging patients to use local pharmacies, where they can be offered advice and treatment. Matthew Speers, from the Proprietary Association of Great Britain – which represents medicine manufacturers and commissioned the research – said: ‘Pharmacists are well placed to provide advice to people with minor conditions, ensuring they get support without diverting NHS resources from people who really need them.’ Figures show that 21.7 million patients attended A&E in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade . But Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors said attempts to divert patients did not work. Dr Mann, an A&E consultant at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Dorset, added that the ‘A&E brand is well-known and trusted’ so ‘patients will continue to attend.’ He said the only solution was to install GP clinics at A&E units so patients with minor ailments could be sent there leaving staff to deal with the more serious cases. Figures show that 21.7 million patients attended A&E in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade. And the NHS has missed its target for ensuring 95 per cent of patients are dealt with within four hours every week for the last six months. In November, Jeremy Hunt admitted in the Commons he had taken his own children to A&E ‘precisely because I didn’t want to wait until later on to take them to a GP.’ ‘If parents have an unwell child who needs medical attention A&E provides a trusted service.’","More than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290m .

"A tiny flat in an exclusive area of London has gone on the market for £500 a month and comes with a shower underneath the bed.

It's also furnished with a table, chair, wardrobe and a chest of drawers - all within easy reach of each other. The tiny flat comes with a bed on a mezzanine level, accessed by a ladder (left) as well as a kitchenette (right) The Zoopla advert, which lists a rent price of £120 a week, boasts that tenants have the perk of a 'personal shower' that can be found stored away beneath the mezzanine bed.

The Zoopla advert describes the flat, which comes with a £520 a month price tag, as 'cosy' 'This property is sure to be a popular choice with, students, working professionals and those looking for a thriving London life but at an affordable rate.'

However, housing campaign groups have blasted landlords for renting out the flat, with one describing it as 'depressing'. David Orr, from the National Housing Federation, told the Evening Standard: 'It's absurd and unfair that people are shelling out around half their incomes to live in homes the size of a shoebox in London. This is one of the many signs of the chronic housing crisis currently facing our capital.'

"She may be seven months pregnant and mother to a toddler, but one look at the Duchess of Cambridge's flawless skin and you would never guess it. So what's the secret behind the 33-year-old's pregnancy glow? An all-natural rosehip oil, apparently. According to US Weekly, Kate has been slathering Trilogy's Rosehip Oil onto her skin while carrying the second royal baby. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge, who is seven months pregnant with her second child, is said to be a fan of Trilogy's £16.50 rosehip oil . 'Kate is very cautious of products and treatments,' a source told the magazine. 'Baby's health comes first. 'Kate continues to use rosehip oil in her daily skincare regiment. She loves the effect is has on her skin. [Her mother] Carole [Middleton] is also a fan.' The oil's description reads: 'Rosehip oil's potent natural actives make it highly effective for a variety of skin concerns including dehydrated and ageing skin. 'Trilogy’s rosehip expertise ensures the finest quality oil with minimum 80 per cent essential fatty acids (omega 3 and 6) and fatty acid (omega 9) content.

A source told the magazine: 'Kate continues to use rosehip oil in her daily skincare regiment. She loves the effect is has on her skin. [Her mother] Carole [Middleton] is also a fan' Derived from the wild rose bushes that grow high in the Chilean Andes, where the altitude and pollutant-free environment produce the highest quality rosehips, the oil’s benefits have been known by the indigenous population for hundreds of years. Not only is it rich in vitamin C and high in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, known to heal scar tissue, it’s also a great source of retinoic acid, which studies show reduces the appearance of wrinkles and brightens skin.

Aaron Bridgeman smashed into his step-sister Vicky, 40, who was riding pillion passenger on a motorbike driven by a friend but was flung into the road after hitting a puddle. Bridgeman, 35, who does not have a driving licence, could not stop his Peugeot in time and ran his step-sister over before she was hit by another car. Scroll down for video . Aaron Bridgeman (left) killed his step-sister Vicky (right) in an illegal drag race after she was thrown off a motorbike she was riding and landed in the path of his car . Biker Jason Szalkowski, 32, was thrown from the motorcycle and left 'badly injured' after hitting floodwater on the lane near Caerphilly, south Wales. Bridgeman then fled the scene because he did not want to be caught driving a borrowed car without insurance. Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said: 'Bridgeman had been racing the motorcycle and was literally right behind it the car was unable to stop or get out of the way. 'Bridgeman simply wasn't able to avoid his own step-sister as she went over the front of his car.' Newport Crown Court heard how Bridgeman briefly stopped his car before fleeing the scene of the accident in December, 2013. Mr Bennett added: 'He looked briefly at Jason Szalkowski, who he knew well, and at the body of his own step-sister. 'He then got promptly back into his car and drove off.' Ms Bridgeman was riding on the back of Jason Szalkowski's (pictured) motorbike when it hit a puddle, flinging her off the bike and into the road . Ms Bridgeman was run over by another car as she lay in the road. The driver thought he had hit a sheep because of her white jumper. Mr Bennett said it was 'impossible' to say which impact killed Ms Bridgeman - also known as Claire - but that she died as a result of the race. Mr Szalkowski could have faced prosecution but it was decided it was 'not in the public interest' because he was so seriously injured. Bridgeman, from Caerphilly, was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and admitted to driving without a licence and insurance, fleeing the scene of a crime and failing to report an accident. In interview he told police he had left the scene because he did not want to be caught driving a borrowed car without insurance. Jeffery Jones, defending, said: 'He accepts a severe sentence will follow from such a conviction.'

"Despite their creepy claws and bright yellow eyes, vampire crabs are increasingly popular pets. Now, experts have discovered two new species of the spooky crustaceans - Geosesarma dennerle and Geosesarma hagen - have been lurking in home aquariums for years. They traced the freshwater crabs' origins back to their wild source - finding that they live in rivers on the island of Java, Indonesia. Scientists have discovered two new species of the spooky crustaceans - Geosesarma dennerle (pictured) and Geosesarma hagen - which are found in many home aquariums . 'These crabs are kind of special because they've been around in the pet trade for ten years, but no one knew where they come from,' said Christian Lukhaup, a professional aquarist in Waiblingen, Germany, who was speaking to National Geographic. While scientists have identified a number of vampire crab species before – so called because of their yellow eyes and sometimes purple bodies –  the two new species are the most common pets. They may appeal because of their diminutive size, measuring just one inch (3cm) across. While scientists have identified a number of vampire crab species before – so called because of their yellow eyes and sometimes purple bodies – but the two new species are the most common pets. G. hagen is shown . G. dennerle is purple in colour with a cream patch on its back, while G. hagen has a bright orange shell and claws which stand out against the rest of its dark body, according to the study published in the Raffles Bulletin of Zoology. Vampire crabs are so-called because of their spooky yellow eyes, which are the same colour as fictional vampires' who drink the blood of animals/ . Before being identified as new species, the two types of crabs were known to have originally come from somewhere in Southeast Asia. A site selling vampire crabs says they thrive in aquariums with rocks to climb on and like to sit on Java moss. Females dig down into sand to have their offspring and both sexes are more active in warmer water - typically between 21°C and 27°C (70°F and 80°F). They are apparently easy to care for and are quite sociable, getting along well with one another and seldom fight. The crabs grow up to one inch wide (3cm) and live for up to three years. Christoph Schubart, co-author of the study from Resenburg University, Germany, said dealers look for bright specimens in areas which may not have been explored by scientists. 'Suddenly the market is formed with some animals that no one has ever given a name,' he said. Lukhaup, who is from Transylvania, the fabled home of Dracula, used contacts in the aquarium trade to find out where dealers were getting the colourful crabs from and after several false leads, found they come from central Java. He suspects there are more vampire crab species to be uncovered on Indonesia's islands, because the crabs tend to stay put, meaning different species could exist in different places. However, while this may be exciting for scientists, there are concerns that wild populations could dwindle if too many crabs are collected for pets. They sell for around $25 (£17) each. It's hoped that commercial breeding could prevent this problem. The crabs are amphibious, which Lukhaup thinks may explain why they are brightly coloured- because visual cues are important for communicating on land, while chemical cues reign supreme underwater. Christoph Schubart, co-author of the study from Resenburg University, Germany, said dealers look for bright specimens in areas which may not have been explored by scientists. This image shows the bright purple colouring of G. dennerle, which has striking yellow eyes like some fictional vampires - hence its nickname .","Geosesarma dennerle and Geosesarma hagen are popularly sold as pets .

"You could say that Luke Sharples has followed in his father’s flight path. The 24-year-old became an airline pilot just like his father, John, and the pair achieved a major milestone today they flew their first commercial flight together. It was a proud moment for the father-son duo, who work for Luton-based Monarch Airlines and were behind the controls as they flew passengers from Birmingham to Turin, Italy. John Sharples (left) and son Luke flew their first commercial flight together with Monarch Airlines . John served as captain and Luke as first officer on the flight, which was made even more special by the fact that it coincided with John’s 56th birthday. Thanks to his father’s job Luke was given access to places that most children can only dream of, and it led him on a path towards becoming a pilot. He said: ‘Dad really is my inspiration when it comes to flying. Aviation was all I knew from a young age. ‘The house was full of books that were either flying related or an aviation manual of some kind. I started logging flying hours towards my pilot’s license from the age of 14 and I was flying before I could drive.’ John Sharples (right) served as captain while his son, Luke, was his first officer on the flight . He added: ‘I was very fortunate to have seen so much of the world and industry growing up, going away on trips with dad and back then, before the ""locked flight deck door"" policy, I was sat in the flight deck watching it all first hand. 'I’ve tried other jobs in different industries but nothing compares to flying.’ Luke Sharples wears a pilot's uniform as a boy . The father-son flight occurred nearly 25 years to the day that Luke was born. That night, John was a pilot on a Monarch flight from Madrid to London’s Gatwick Airport and joined his wife at the hospital just 15 minutes before Luke arrived. During the flight he received a call from operations staff, who asked him when the aircraft would be landing. He thought the question was unusual until he landed at Gatwick and learned that his wife, Liz, was in labour. John said: ‘Unbeknown to me operations had kindly arranged for a taxi to be waiting to whisk me to the hospital where Luke was born 15 minutes after I arrived.’ John joined Monarch from British Midland in 1986 and has flown its fleet of Boeing 757s and 767s. When Monarch’s 757s were retired last year, he flew one of the final three planes remaining from Mallorca to Birmingham. Luke obtained his private pilot licence in 2007 at the age of 17 and later studied in New Zealand before he joined Monarch as a cadet on its Airbus A320 and 321 fleet in 2012. They were able to fly together after John retrained on the British carrier's Airbus fleet. The pair's first commercial flight together, from Birmingham to Turin, coincided with John's 56th birthday . John said: ‘What a unique and wonderful way to celebrate my 56th birthday. This flight will be a little strange for me in that I am still quite new to this type of aircraft, although I have over 21,000 flying hours. ‘Luke will be the more experienced pilot on the Airbus. I will be expecting some constructive criticism.’ Luke added: ’It has been an aspiration to be able to fly with him. It has taken a long time and a lot of luck but finally I can tick off one of my major life goals. ‘Knowing how hard and long I have worked for this opportunity to fly with my dad makes it very exciting.’","John Sharples and son Luke flew their first commercial flight together .

The life peer, who is Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s diversity adviser, now faces being investigated by police under the 1971 Immigration Act. But the 58-year-old, from Luton, insists that although it was legally wrong ‘morally it was the right thing to do’. Lord Hussain, pictured with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, realises what he did was 'legally wrong' but insists it was the 'morally right'. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party is looking into the matter . The Sunday Mirror revealed Lord Hussain told officials the boy, who was born in Pakistan in 1990, had the right to British citizenship as he was the father. The boy, now 23, was flown to the UK at the age of two – and given a British passport soon after. ‘I know now it is illegal. I realise it was legally wrong but morally it was the right thing to do,’ he told the Mirror. Lord Hussain explained he and his wife had ‘adopted’ the child to save him from a life of poverty, but had never filed the correct paperwork. Lord Qurban Hussain admits he illegally brought the boy to the UK by telling officials he was the father . He said: ‘The child’s mother begged my wife to take him. You have never seen levels of poverty like this family lived in.’ He added his ‘son’ is a university graduate and he and his wife are ‘very proud’. But the father-of-four, who has been outspoken of the dangers of illegal immigration, admitted that he didn’t realise it would come back to haunt him and his action were ‘a shame’ on him. Despite calls to resign from Labour MP John Mann, he has reportedly vowed not to quit his peerage as his ‘conscience was clear’. Lord Hussain has informed Lib Dem officials of the actions, but believes his actions were right. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said the party are investigating the matter. He said: ‘The party is aware of this and looking into it.’ Rules dictate that peers can be suspended or disciplined, but cannot be excluded from the House of Lords unless they have a conviction for an offence that carries a jail sentence of a year or more. Lord Hussain became a prominent figure in the Lib Dems after Mr Clegg approached him to represent the party in the Upper House. He was made a life peer in January 2011. His first act in Parliament was to discuss immigration and the risks of breaching immigration law. The Deputy Prime Minister recently vowed to remain tough on immigration after dramatically admitting he was wrong to offer amnesty to illegal immigrants in 2013. Lord Qurban Hussain was made a life peer in 2011 . Born in Kashmir, Qurban Hussain came to live in England in 1971 as a teenager. After moving to Luton in 1993, he joined the Trade Union Movement and served as a secretary for Luton TUC from 1994 until 1996. He was a member of the Labour Party from 1996, but joined the Liberal Democrats on March 20, 2003 - the day the war in Iraq began and campaigned against the conflict. He was subsequently elected a Lib Dem councillor on Luton Borough Council. As a member of the council's executive, he held the portfolios of citizenship, community, youth and leisure services as well as Equalities and Social Inclusion from 2003 to 2007. He was the deputy leader of the Luton Borough Council from 2005 to 2007. Lord Hussain was unsuccessful as a Parliamentary candidate for Luton South in 2005 and 2010, although he doubled the Liberal Democrat Party vote when he stood in 2005. After being awarded his peerage in 2011, he said: 'I now see this appointment as an opportunity to represent Luton in a major national forum. 'An opportunity to promote Luton’s cause and to work for resources to advance Luton’s regeneration and to enhance education, employment, training and life chances for young people in our town.' Source: Liberal Democrats . He ditched the party’s policy of allowing foreigners to ‘earn’ British citizenship by living in the UK for a decade without being caught by the authorities – claiming it risked ‘undermining public confidence’ in the entire immigration system. Last month, he blasted the Conservatives for failing to deliver on their promise of slashing migration figures. He said: ‘What we need to do and get on with - something I've been getting on with during my time in government - is, for instance, re-establishing the proper border controls at our borders so that we not only count people in, but we count people out.’ MailOnline has contacted Lord Hussain for comment.","Qurban Hussain admits he lied to British High Commission in Islamabad .

"The woman who fell 70 foot to her death when a San Francisco beauty spot collapsed into the sea on Saturday has been named as 58-year-old Nancy Blum. Authorites said on Monday that Blum, together with an unnamed companion, had been hiking about 6:30 p.m. ‘when a structural collapse of the rock occurred’ at Point Reyes National Seashore. After emergency personnel reached Blum and her companion, she was flown to Bear Valley Ranger Station, where she was pronounced dead. Nancy Blum, 58, of San Francisco died on Saturday after falling 70 foot to her death when the Arch Rock at Point Reyes National Seashore collapsed into the sea . Authorites said on Monday that Blum, together with an unnamed companion, had been hiking about 6:30 p.m.  on Saturday ‘when a structural collapse of the rock occurred’ at Point Reyes National Seashore . The National Park Service and the county coroner's office are investigating the cause of Blum's death, reports SFGate. 'The cause of death will be pending the completion of toxicology studies,' the sheriff's office said in a statement. Blum’s hiking companion continues to be treated for life-threatening injuries. The two visitors were standing on the Arch Rock lookout point when the bluff gave way and the pair fell about 70 feet, winding up covered with rocks and debris. The National Park Service had posted signs at the site on Thursday warning hikers that a fissure along the top of Arch Rock may have weakened the cliff and that walking along the edge was potentially dangerous. The park did not close the trail and in spite of the warnings, one hiker who visited the park  told the San Francisco Chronicle that she had seen dozens of people walking in the area.

"The gangster who supplied the murder weapon which killed Rhys Jones has attempted to return to the area where the late boy’s family live, it was claimed today. James Yates, who provided the First World War Smith & Wesson revolver used to kill the 11-year-old child, cannot enter the Croxteth Park neighbourhood of Liverpool where the murder took place. But the 27-year-old applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative - meaning he could have been in the area where Rhys’s parents Steve and Melanie Jones still live. Gangster: James Yates (left), who provided the First World War Smith & Wesson revolver used to kill Rhys Jones (right), cannot enter the Croxteth Park neighbourhood of Liverpool where the murder took place . Mrs Jones, 49, said it was ‘awful’ to learn of his application in a letter last Saturday - the day before Mother’s Day, which she described as an ‘emotional occasion’. ‘I’m so upset,’ she said. ‘I’ve barely got words to describe how angry I am. I had to come home from work as it was so emotional. ‘How can they be allowed to apply for dropping the exclusion zone? This is the third time this has happened now. The whole system is a farce.’ The Probation Service said Yates would be dropped off by his father Francis - who was jailed for more than four years for trying to cover up the murder - and later picked up on an agreed route. However, the Ministry of Justice was said to have revealed yesterday that Yates's request had been denied. Reacting to this decision, Mrs Jones said: ‘At last, common sense prevails.’ But she added the continual and brazen appeals by the gang members to enter their neighbourhood were emotionally draining and unfair. Yates was released last April - leaving just one of the seven-strong gang in prison. Rhys was shot by Sean Mercer, 16, aided by six others, on his way home from football practice in 2007. Shooting location: Rhys died on August 22, 2007, outside The Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park. Yates applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative . After Yates walked free it meant only Mercer, who was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years, was left behind bars after seven people were convicted over their involvement in the horrific crime. Following his release, Mrs Jones called Yates the ‘most evil of them all’. Nathan Quinn, Dean Kelly, Gary Kays, Melvin Coy and a 16-year-old who cannot be named have all served sentences. Grief: If Yates had been successful in his bid, he could have been in the area where Rhys’s parents Steve and Melanie Jones (pictured) still live . Yates was 21 when he was jailed for just seven years for supplying the gun used to kill Rhys and helping Mercer cover his tracks. He and two other members of the Croxteth Crew - Quinn, 18, and Kelly, 17 - winked, smiled, smirked and cheered in the dock as they were handed sentences blasted as 'disgusting' by Rhys's family. The trial judge, Mr Justice Irwin, told Yates: 'There is strong evidence you were an active gang member. I have no doubt you were a willing assistant helping in any way you could.' Yates' term was later increased to 12 years by the Lord Chief Justice, who attacked the 'modern pestilence' of gun crime. But because Yates spent almost a year in prison awaiting trial, that time counted towards his final sentence. That means he spent just over five years behind bars since being found guilty of assisting the schoolboy's murderer. He was released on licence midway through his sentence, as is commonplace, and will be monitored outside prison for the remainder of the 12 years. Rhys died on August 22, 2007, when Mercer, armed with a revolver, cycled to his estate to try to shoot members of the rival Strand Gang. Rhys was struck by his second bullet. The 'wall of silence' faced by police meant that while Mercer's name swiftly emerged as the prime suspect in the shooting outside The Fir Tree pub, months of painstaking detective work was required to charge him with murder. The gun itself, a .455 calibre Smith and Wesson revolver with a six-inch barrel, may have been handed down through generations of Liverpool criminals. It was made during the First World War in about 1915, but remained in good working order. The rifling in the barrel was worn and the bullets fired by Mercer were slightly undersized, causing them to tumble end-over-end. That meant the round which hit Rhys was side-on when it struck him in the back of the neck, splintering vertebrae and destroying his windpipe before exiting through his throat. The Croxeth Crew also had an imitation Walther PPK converted to fire live rounds, a British Army Webley revolver and a Russian 7.62 handgun.","James Yates provided Smith & Wesson revolver used to kill boy in 2007 .

"Police are hunting for a 'dangerous' convicted killer who absconded from the accommodation where he was living while on probation. William Kerr, 53, was jailed for life in 1998 for the murder of 43-year-old Maureen Comfort, whose body was found in a cupboard in her flat in Leeds. He was released on licence from HMP Stocken, Rutland, on January 23 this year and moved to approved accommodation in Hull. On the run: Convicted killer William Kerr, 53, pictured, was jailed for life in 1998 for the murder of 43-year-old Maureen Comfort, whose body was found in a cupboard in her flat in Leeds . Kerr now needs to be arrested and returned to prison as 'a matter of urgency', police said, after he breached his licence conditions by absconding from his residence. Members of public are being asked not to approach Kerr if they see them, and instead to call the police immediately on 999. Kerr was jailed along with co-defendant Christopher Moody. According to court papers, Ms Comfort was last seen alive on December 4 1995. Relatives found her strangled body  on January 8 1996. Victim: The strangled body of Maureen Comfort, pictured, was found in a cupboard in her Leeds flat . The National Offender Management Service contacted North Yorkshire Police for assistance after Kerr absconded from approved premises in Hull. North Yorkshire Police are leading the search for Kerr as his probation officer is based in Selby, North Yorkshire, but a spokesman said there is no evidence to suggest he is in the county. Kerr is also known to have links to the Humberside, West Yorkshire and London areas, police said. Detective Inspector Eamonn Clarke, of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'To assist our already extensive efforts to trace William Kerr, I am urging people to keep an eye out for the man in the photographs. 'We ask that you do not approach Kerr, as he is considered dangerous. You should contact the police straight away on 999 and officers will be despatched to arrest him or investigate the sighting.' Mr Clarke said he is also appealing directly to Kerr. The officer said: 'William, you know you have breached your licence conditions, and by continuing to do so you are only making things worse. 'It is now time to do the right thing and hand yourself in to the police.' He urged anyone with information to call 999 and pass details to North Yorkshire Police stating the 'William Kerr appeal'. He said people could also contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, quoting North Yorkshire Police reference number 12150049525 and saying it is 'urgent'.","William Kerr was jailed for life for the murder of Maureen Comfort in 1998 .

"A small girl kneeling on the floor of an old mental asylum ward, the shadowy figure of a prison guard standing near a cell and a man lurking in the corner of a hotel basement. These are the spine-tingling images that have emerged from some of Australia's most haunted destinations. Together, medium Rayleen Kable and ghost hunter Allen Tiller have travelled around Australia visiting these sites on a mission to prove the existence of supernatural beings – and to help ghosts stuck in limbo 'move onto the afterlife'. Scroll down for video . Ghost hunters capture what they believe is the spirit of a girl in the Grevillia wing, Beechworth Lunatic Asylum . The cast of TV show Haunting: Australia said that while on tour earlier this year a guest captured this image of what he thought was a male ghost in the basement of the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia . And while most people may be sceptical that they are finding real evidence of the supernatural Tiller says that's precisely why he does it. In January this year, Kable and Tiller led a group on a tour around Australia collecting photographs, electromagnetic readings and sound recordings of what they believe are the spirits of figures from decades past. The pair make up the local contingent of the cast of TV show Haunting: Australia, which is currently being replayed on 4METV and is due to premier on SYFY in the U.S. later this month. While filming their eight-part series they visited some of Australia's most notorious haunted sites, but they say one of the spookiest visits they ever made was to Beechworth Lunatic Asylum in north-east Victoria in January this year. A member of their tour group captured a haunting image of what appears to be a small girl kneeling on the floor in the darkness of the most notorious wing of the old mental asylum. Haunting: Australia cast member Gaurav Tiwari captured an image of what he believes to be a prison guard standing near the stairs at Geelong Gaol in Victoria . Ghost hunter Allen Tiller (left) and medium Rayleen Kable (right) travelled around Australia visiting haunted sites on a mission to prove the existence of supernatural beings . They say one of the spookiest visits they ever made was to Beechworth Lunatic Asylum (pictured) in north-east Victoria in January this year . The ghost hunters collect photographs, electromagnetic readings and sound recordings of what they believe are spirits . The Grevillia wing of Beechworth was where patients were given electric shock treatments and kept in strait jackets at the institution, which was operational between 1867 and 1995. Visitors to the wing have often reported sightings of the ghost of a male doctor and also of a female matron. But Tiller said some of the female patients of Beechworth had children with them – providing an explanation as to what he believes is captured in the photograph. Tiller said he also had his own personal haunting experience while at Beechworth, in a section of the asylum known as the 'bull pen'. 'It used to house aggressive youths from 18 to 25, and in there I heard a door slamming, and I audibly hear footsteps go up the hallway,' he said. 'Then we had clear EVPs [electronic voice phenomena] of a couple of people say 'Get out.' Tiller – who says he is not a psychic or medium - uses a whole range of gadgets including full spectrum cameras, electromagnetic field detectors and voice recorders to gather 'evidence' of the spirit world. Kable - who is both a psychic and a medium – said her experience at Beechworth was 'amazing'. 'It's definitely got activity and lots of it,' she said. For Kable, the most disturbing experience she has ever had was at the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia . A disgruntled male spirit tried to attach itself to her in the 'Hallway of Hell' (pictured) For Tiller the most interesting experience was catching what he believes is evidence of the spirit of a young girl called 'Sarah'. The hotel once served as a brothel, and legend has it that when a prostitute was murdered inside the hotel her young daughter 'Sarah' was taken in by the hotel's madam . 'We got some really Class A 'EVPs'– and basically what that is is a recording of a spirit so you actually hear it on a recorder. 'I actually got this disgruntled spirit that said my name clearly… you just hear this spirit screaming down my recorder.' For Kable, the most disturbing experience she has ever had was at the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia when a disgruntled male spirit tried to attach itself to her in the 'Hallway of Hell'. 'It was definitely a male spirit, but I wouldn't say a happy male spirit,' she said. Tiller said he and other tour guests had their own encounters with ghosts while at Kapunda. One guest captured an image of what he believes is a man standing the corner of the hotel's basement. For Tiller the most interesting experience was catching what he believes is evidence of the spirit of a young girl called 'Sarah'. The hotel once served as a brothel, and legend has it that when a prostitute was murdered inside the hotel her young daughter 'Sarah' was taken in by the hotel's madam. 'I was closing up the top of hotel after a tour and I saw a little girl standing in hallway,' he said. 'She ran down the hall to take her out of the hotel and she looked solid… she was laughing. Tiller said he had another haunting experience while at Geelong Gaol in Victoria . He was in a section upstairs on the third level when he says he heard a 'low whispery growl' 'She's been seen multiple times. 'You can say ""Are you here Sarah?"" and she'll light up different devices.' Tiller said he had another haunting experience while at Geelong Gaol in Victoria. 'I was in a section upstairs on the third level and I had a psychic tell me there was something evil in the corner,' he said. 'While I was waiting I actually heard a low whispery growl in there, and there was no way an animal could get in there. 'That was pretty spooky.' At the same site fellow Haunting: Australia cast member Gaurav Tiwari captured an image of what he believes to be a prison guard standing near the stairs. The image appears red and purple because it is taken with a full spectrum camera – a favourite among ghost hunters who say it is like a video camera that has filters removed meaning it shows light spectrums the human eye can't see. Kable says she does the work she does in order to help spirits that are 'stuck'. Kable - a medium - says she does the work she does in order to help spirits that are 'stuck'.

The cast of TV show Haunting: Australia, which is currently being replayed on 4METV and is due to premier on SYFY in the U.S. later this month . 'For me as a medium my objective is if that spirit needs help and wants to move on, I help them,' she said. 'If they don't want to move on my second objective would be to give validation to the spirit world. 'For anybody who's a witness and anybody in that location that really does want to believe and understand the afterlife, that there is a way for them to communicate from whatever realm they're in to our realm.' Tiller accepts that people may be sceptical of the existence of ghosts and supernatural beings, but that doesn't stop him trying to prove they're out there. 'I'm there to record anything that might come up, with the outcome being hopefully that we can prove life after death,' he said. 'A lot of people think dying is the end. 'But if people knew there was a possibility that we move on, stress levels would drop off and people would have peace of mind.'

"A dog has been praised for digging up a veteran's Purple Heart 25 years after the treasured medal went missing. Smuckers, a Labrador-golden retriever, found the award buried in the backyard of his owners' Denver house in 2004. His discovery prompted an 11-year journey to find Korean War veteran Cpl Richmond Litman, who is buried nearby in Colorado's Fort Logan National Cemetery. Hero: Smuckers, a Labrador-golden retriever, being embraced by Leatra Plick after he dug up her father's Purple Heart while playing in the backyard. Her father, Cpl Richmond Litman, was a Korean War veteran . Treasured: This is tiny heart-shaped medallion which is awarded to U.S. servicemen wounded in battle . Decorated: Cpl Litman, who died in 1990, served in South Korea between 1948 and 1950, when he was hit . Finally, after calling every Litman family they could find, Smuckers' owners Steve Jankousky and Tom Unterwagner saw an advert for a veterans reunion which led them to the serviceman's daughter Leatra Plick. On Monday, at a ceremony beside Cpl Litman's white marble headstone, Smuckers presented Plick with the small medal on a purple ribbon. Plick, whose father died in 1990, told the Denver Post: 'I will honor it as much as he honored it when he was alive. I truly appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.' According to the paper, Cpl Litman joined the army in 1948, when he was immediately dispatched to South Korea. Discovery: Smuckers' owner Steve Jankousky has spent 11 years trying to track down the family . Sniffing around: Jankousky was gardening when Smuckers ran up with the award at home in Denver in 2004 . Finally returned: The family got in touch with Purple Hearts Reunited, who helped connect them with Plick . Salute: Members of Purple Hearts Reunited salute Cpl Litman's grave in Denver, Colorado . Two years later he was wounded in battle. He would later receive his Purple Heart for putting himself in the line of danger for his country. Litman relocated to Denver, Colorado, where he lived with his family until his death in 1990. Describing the moment Smuckers discovered the medal, Jankousky told USA Today: 'I was just trying to put the dirt back in the hole, when I saw something shiny and that was it. 'And I went back inside and told [Unterwagner], ""You're not going to believe what she dug up.""' Ret. Col. Jeff Roy, of the Military Order Of The Purple Heart, told the station: 'It is very important to remember the veteran that either gave his life, or shed his blood for his country, and that it remain with the family.' Ceremony: Jankousky gave Smuckers a purple ribbon leash for the occasion on Sunday . Special occasion: Dogs are not normally allowed in the cemetery but the directors made an exemption . Delighted: Leatra Plick, pictured with her husband, told Fox she was delighted to finally receive the medal .","Smuckers dug up the medal in his Denver back yard in 2004 .

"Shon Handrahan, 31, was sentenced to 60 days in jail after he pleaded guilty to sending nude photographs of his estranged wife . A Utah man who pleaded guilty to sending nude photographs of his estranged wife to her acquaintances has been sentenced to 60 days in jail. Shon Handrahan, 31, said he wasn't in his right mind when he sent the graphic images, which were accompanied with the words 'what do you think of your little angel now?', in 2012. Handrahan texted the images after his estranged wife ignored at least 100 text messages from him, some of which were threatening, according to authorities. 'I'm really sorry for what I've done,' Handrahan said in court on Tuesday. 'If I had been in the right mind, I wouldn't have done it.' Handrahan has already served 90 days in jail for the offense. Handrahan's case spurred Utah lawmakers to pass a new revenge porn bill that forbids the sharing of intimate images without the consent of the person pictured. A first offense is considered a misdemeanor, and repeat offenses are felonies. Handrahan was charged under old statutes - before the new law took effect. Handrahan texted numerous images with the tag line 'what do you think of your little angel now?' after his estranged wife ignored at least 100 text messages from him, according to authorities . Prosecutor Nathan Lyon wanted more jail time, saying he didn't see Handrahan 'accepting' much responsibility. 'This wasn't something he did all of a sudden,' Lyon said. 'This was something that had been building up all day long.' Defense attorney Edward Brass argued Handrahan accepted responsibility when he agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors last month. Handrahan pleaded guilty to distributing pornographic material and electronic communication harassment. The couple have since divorced. Handrahan's now ex-wife supported the deal and wanted to revolve the case quickly due to public attention her case was receiving, according to Lyon. Salt Lake City Democratic Representative Marie Poulson  pushed for the revenge porn law, saying the practice most often targets women and can cause some to lose their jobs. ‘These things are used to harm the other individual, to ruin their life or destroy them personally with their jobs or their families,' she told the Salt Lake Tribune. Thirteen states, including Utah, have passed laws to punish revenge porn in the past two years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.","Shon Handrahan, 31, sent the graphic images after his now ex-wife ignored at least 100 text messages he sent her, according to authorities .

"Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen admitted recruiting three female officers into a prostitution ring . An army officer whose role was to advocate for victims of sexual abuse has been dishonorably discharged and sentenced to two years in prison for organizing a prostitution ring at an army base. Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen recruited the female soldiers to serve as prostitutes for high ranking officers at Fort Hood in Texas - one of the biggest bases in the country. As his court-martial was about to open earlier this week, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts that included charges of pandering and conspiracy to solicit prostitution. One female officer was told she could make lots of money at swinger and stripper parties, while another claimed McQueen arranged for her to have sex with an officer for $100. Two soldiers testified last year that McQueen recruited them and other cash-strapped female soldiers to join the prostitution ring. A military judge sentenced him to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge while leading a sexual abuse prevention program at the sprawling Central Texas post. However, he pleaded not guilty to sexual assault. One of the female soldiers had previously testified that McQueen arranged for her to have sex for $100 with an officer, Master Sergeant Brad Grimes. But prosecutors told Judge Lieutenant Colonel Rebecca Connally that while there were plans for a tryst, the two never had sex. The woman had told investigators she was 20 when she confided in McQueen about money problems after her husband left her and her three-year-old son and drained the couple's bank account. She also testified that McQueen had sex with her and took photos of her naked to show potential clients. Grimes has already been demoted and reprimanded after he was found guilty by a jury conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery. Initial charges were filed against McQueen in March 2014. Fort Hood officials haven't indicated whether anyone involved in the conspiracy actually had sex, according to the San Antonio Express-News. In addition to trying to recruit the young female soldiers, McQueen admitted trying to get two higher ranking officers to agree to have sex with junior female officers. McQueen admitted breaching his role as an advocate for sexual abuse by encouraging the prostitution ring at Fort Hood army base .","Sergeant Gregory McQueen organized prostitutes for high-ranking officials .

Three young brothers aged 1, 5 and 12 were stabbed to death and two other family members were hurt in an attack at a home in eastern North Carolina. Officers were called to a report of a person with a 'machete-like' knife around 11pm Tuesday and took a suspect into custody, New Bern Police Lt. Ronda Allen said. The officers entered the home and found two dead boys along with one still-breathing brother. They then subdued and arrested 18-year-old neighbor 18-year-old Eh Lar Doh Htoo, who they found still at the scene. The third boy was taken to a North Carolina East hospital, where he died. Their mother and 14-year-old sister were also injured in the stabbing. Allen said they had been treated and released. The father was at work when the horrific attack occurred, police said. 'He's crazy,' neighbor Ner Wah said Wednesday. 'I told my wife: 'Be careful. Don't answer the door.'' The victims were Burmese and had entered the United States via Thailand, according to New Bern Police Chief Toussaint Summers, Jr. New Bern is a coastal town and home to about 1,900 Burmese refugees, who resettled in the area after fleeing persecution from the country once called Burma. 'Anytime this happens in any community, any part of town, it's surprising,' the police chief said. The stabbings happened on a street of about 10 row-like homes that face a railroad track and several dilapidated commercial buildings. The mother jumped out the second-floor window of her home after she was attacked, according to neighbor A Lay, who was awakened when she knocked on his door. Her back was bloody. 'She said she needed help and she needed the police,' said A Lay's wife, A Bu. Police did not release the victims' names. Triple homicide: Police arrived to the home around 11pm Tuesday to find two of the boys dead. A third died at a hospital while their sister and mother survived the gruesome attack and were released from the hospital . Investigators work, Wednesday in the backyard of a home where a triple homicide took place late Tuesday, in New Bern, North Carolina. Neighbors say the mother leaped from a bedroom window, her back covered in blood, to get away from the killer . Wah said that like him, Htoo was a member of the Karen ethnic group, an oppressed people whose language has been banned back home. Htoo once came to Wah's house during the day to ask him to help translate documents, but Wah said they weren't friends. 'We felt very scared of him,' Wah said. Susan Husson, executive director of the Interfaith Refugee Ministry in New Bern, said the victims' family and the suspect's family likely came through her office before settling in New Bern, but she didn't know them personally. She said the first Burmese refugee came to New Bern around 1999. 'It's just really hard right now,' she said. 'It's been really horrific.' A neighbor who lives about five houses away said he heard sirens late Tuesday night and decided to stay inside. Horrific: Three brothers who lived in of these New Bern, North Carolina homes were slashed to death with a machete Tuesday night by their 18-year-old neighbor Eh Lar Doh Htoo . 'We were scared. We just locked the door,' said 23-year-old Yyoch Rmah, who moved to the U.S. from Vietnam in 2006. He said there were a lot of Burmese refugees in the neighborhood, and people from other countries. Htoo's first court appearance was scheduled for Friday. Chief Summers told WITN the Htoo is now charged with assault with a deadly weapon and intent to kill inflicting serious injury. The suspect and the victims knew each other, although the suspect was not a member of the victims' family, Allen said. Allen did not release any potential motive in the stabbings. She said police planned to release more information about the stabbing later Wednesday. But, Chief Summers said, 'This wasn't a random event.' Other charges were also pending against Htoo. He was being held Wednesday on $1 million bond. He was slated to first appear before a judge the morning of March 19. The State Bureau of Investigation was assisting New Bern police. New Bern is a coastal town and home to about 1,900 Burmese refugees, who resettled in the area after fleeing persecution from the country once called Burma .","Eh Lar Doh Htoo allegedly stabbed to death the three brothers and injured their mother and sister around 11pm Tuesday while their father was at work .

"The mother of a teenager who was almost killed when he was thrown from a fairground ride has spoken of her relief that the manufacturers have finally been brought to justice. Kizzy Nee, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said she thought Reece, 14, was dead when he was flung from the Orbitor Extreme at Stevenage's Sonisphere Knebworth music festival. The ride was only on its third outing when Reece was injured, after being thrown through a steel fence panel, suffering internal bleeding and having to be taken into intensive care. Reece, left, pictured with his mum Kizzy, right, is lucky to be alive after suffering horrendous injuries . He suffered severe life-threatening injuries after the incident in 2009, and still struggles from the effects to this day. Mother-of-three Kizzy, who is now launching a civil case against the ride manufacturers who were fined after pleading guilty to safety breaches in 2014, said her son doesn’t leave the house, and won’t travel in a car without her. She said: ‘It should have been a lovely family day. It was the first festival we had been to and we were both excited. ‘But what happened has changed our family forever. Reece is not the same boy he once was. I went through horrendous trauma, watching him in intensive care, not knowing if he would live or die.’ Kizzy had been saving for months for her and her partner, John, to visit the Knebworth festival in August 2009. Reece, pictured in hospital, suffered internal bleeding after his fall from a fairground ride at Sonisphere festival . Reece fell off the ride pictured above during a family day out in 2009 . Then just a week before, she discovered she had won two festival tickets in a competition - and decided to take her eldest son, Reece, and his girlfriend along too. Kizzy said: ‘It was a real treat. It was my first festival - and Reece's too - so we were both excited. ‘We pitched our tent on the Friday night and the following day, we went off to watch the bands. ‘Reece asked me for some money to go on a fairground ride. He met up with a couple of school friends too. He loved rides, so I knew he would be having fun.’ But a short time later, one of Reece's friends raced back to say he had fallen from a ride. Kizzy said: ‘My first thought was that he was dead. I was hysterical. But, when I reached him, he was awake and talking, though his ankle was badly smashed. ‘I really thought it was just a case of a broken ankle. Though I was worried, I was glad that at least it wasn't as serious as I'd feared. ‘Reece lay on the ground, as we waited for an ambulance and I saw the fairground workers, picking up broken parts from the ride.’ Reece spent five days in a coma and a further ten days in hospital and missed his 15th birthday . In hospital, doctors found Reece was bleeding internally from his main artery. They warned Kizzy his life was in danger. She said: ‘They took me in a little room like a scene from Holby City, and I felt as though it was happening to someone else. ‘They explained if they didn't operate he would bleed to death. ‘I was hysterical, pacing the hospital corridors for hours waiting for news.’ Reece finally came out of surgery in the early hours of the morning. Doctors confirmed they had managed to repair a ripped aorta. His condition was still critical and he was taken into intensive care. Reece was rushed back into surgery following complications and then taken to a specialist children's hospital, where he was placed in an induced coma. Again, Kizzy was warned he faced a fight for life. She said: ‘I didn't leave the hospital for a week. I was a mess. I thought I was going to lose him and it was horrific.’ Reece spent five days in a coma and a further ten days in hospital. His 15th birthday passed him by. Even at home, he needed a wheelchair and was unable to look after himself. Kizzy said: ‘We had to bring his bed downstairs. He was like an old man. He had major surgery on his upper body and his ankle was in pieces too, so he just couldn't move.’ Reece was in a wheelchair and it was five months before he returned to school. Kizzy said: ‘Physically, he healed well, but he was never the same child again. Reece had always been a typical boy; blind to danger, a real fun lover and thrill seeker. ‘But he became too scared to even go in a car. ‘To this day, he rarely goes out alone and won't go in a car without me. He has pain in his ankle and his ribs, but the main after effects of the accident are psychological. After his accident Reece was in a wheelchair and it was five months before he returned to school . ‘He has become anxious and old before his time. He can't walk past a fairground, let alone go on a ride again.’ In July 2014, those responsible for Reece's accident were finally brought to justice. The Health and Safety Executive investigated the incident and found a number of serious defects which had not been picked up at either the design, testing or sign-off stages. The HSE confirmed that the accident had been preventable if the guilty parties had followed the proper procedures. The ride manufacturer Perrin Stevens and examiners Dr Martyn Lacey and Frederick Meakin were all prosecuted after pleading guilty to the safety breaches at Cambridge Crown Court. Stevens was fined £3,000 and the same amount in costs after pleading guilty to breaching Section 6 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, while his company Perrin Stevens Ltd was fined a further £2,000 and £3,000 costs. Lacey and Meakin were each fined £8,000 and both ordered to pay costs of £10,000 after pleading guilty to breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Kizzy said:’ I am still very bitter and angry that due to their negligence I nearly lost my son. ‘I understand that the judge can only fine the guilty party based on their means but I am shocked that they can carry on trading in the business after showing such incompetence, especially when a safety inspector’s job is so important to the safety of the public. Reece, pictured above with a friend, 'can't walk past a fairground, let alone go on a ride again.' ‘I am actually disgusted that they can carry on in the same line of work and can only hope that they realise that they cannot play with people's lives. ‘I had to go through two weeks of hell not knowing if my son was going to come out of the operating room alive and then watching him as he lay in a coma. ‘After all this not a single apology has been offered our way. ‘I would like the public to know the dangers of travelling fairgrounds, and that despite having safety checks carried out rogue inspectors do exist. The could and should have been prevented.’ Kizzy is now pursuing a civil case against those responsible. Her solicitor, Melanie Neale, of Pictons Law Firm, said: ‘Although the HSE secured these convictions it does not provide any justice for Reece so we have launched a civil claim on his behalf. ‘We have a very strong case, especially as all three defendants pleaded guilty as charged. ‘Had the guilty parties been responsible and had done what they are supposed to do the accident would never have happened. ‘It’s too easy for fairground owners and designers of rides to cut corners and this presents a terrible danger to the public. ‘Reece was lucky not to have been killed, but he and his mother are still suffering from the effects of this terrible accident and I am determined, along with his mother, to get him the justice her deserves while warning other fairground operators – and the general public who find these rides so popular – that they can’t take risks with people's lives in order to make more money.’","Reece Nee, 14, was thrown off ride at Sonisphere festival near Stevenage .

"When nature calls in downtown Denver...well, though luck. Residents in the city has been complaining to the local government over a lack of public restrooms, leading downtown alleys and side streets to become rank with the smell of urination. Just last year, local police issued 550 misdemeanor citations for public urination and only 40 per cent were given to the homeless. Scroll down for video . Rude: Denver residents are complaining over a lack of public restrooms in the downtown area. In addition to a lack of public restrooms, many business only open up their bathrooms to paying customers. Above, a stern sign outside one downtown business . The issue is not only because of a lack of public restrooms, but also businesses who only open up their bathrooms to paying customers - going so far as to hang up stern signs like 'No pay. No poop. No pee.' In an op-ed for the Denver Post, retired journalist Dennis Ryerson cites suburbanization for the lack of free toilets. He says that when immigrants were first moving to downtown Denver a century ago, the city installed several 'comfort stations'. But as new building codes required businesses to provide restrooms for workers, and more people began to move to the suburbs, the restrooms were closed. No place to go: A Denver Public Works spokesman said the city is looking into solutions for the public restrooms issue . Heather Burke of Denver Public Works says the city is aware of the issue and is looking to rectify it. 'It's definitely on the city's radar; we have a working group that's looking at different options for public restrooms,' she told KDVR. 'There hasn't been a big need for it in the past but we're looking into it now because we've heard from the community that there is a big need for it,' she added. However, the speed of addressing the issue has Ryerson concerned. 'Denver has installed dog parks in my neighborhood and others. We are taking care of the dogs. Why can't we address a basic element of human health and sanitation?' he writes. 'Other cities, from San Francisco to New York, Calgary to El Paso, Victoria, B.C., to Philadelphia, are beginning to address the issue. Not Denver. Here, we pretend it's not a problem, or that it's somebody else's problem,' Ryerson adds.","Only 40 per cent of the citations were issued to the homeless .

"A brother has been praised by police for saving his sister's life after she was stabbed repeatedly by a jilted gamer who flew to the UK to attack her. Baby-faced Shane Coffey travelled from his home in Boston, Massachusetts to Farha Dowlut's house in Epsom, Surrey, after she ended their online relationship. The 20-year-old smashed through her bedroom window and began stabbing Miss Dowlut, 19, in her bed with a hunting knife which he had smuggled into his luggage through customs. Mohammad Dowlut, 22, (left) saved his sister's life after she was attacked by baby-faced Shane Coffey (right) But luckily, Miss Dowlut's brother Mohammad heard her anguished screams and ran to her rescue. The 22-year-old wrestled Coffey away from his sister, also sustaining several wounds in the process. Even as the intruder continued to lash out, Mr Dowlut kept on pulling the attacker away from the bed. He then hit Coffey three times around the head with a metal pole before he finally dropped the knife, saying 'stop, enough, I'm done.' This week, Mr Dowlut was honoured for his bravery at Surrey Police's annual Chief Constable's Commendation Ceremony held at Guildford Cathedral. Surrey Police said: 'Mohammed Dowlut tackled an armed offender who viciously attacked his sister in their home with a hunting knife. 'Mohammed sustained serious injuries in saving his sister's life. The offender was sentenced to life imprisonment for his attack.' The 20-year-old flew from the U.S to London Heathrow Airport (pictured) so he could carry out the frenzied attack on Farha Dowlut at her home in Epsom, Surrey . Coffey was jailed for life with a minimum term of eight-and-a-half years in November after pleading guilty at Guildford Crown Court to one count of attempted murder and another of grievous bodily harm. The court had heard how Coffey and Miss Dowlut had first started chatting when she was aged 14, having met through the online gaming community. The pair had regularly spoken online but had stopped chatting after Coffey remotely hacked into Miss Dowlut's computer and read her chat logs with other people. When they started talking again in November 2013, the pair discussed Coffey visiting Miss Dowlut at home. They exchanged Christmas gifts, which gave Coffey the family's address. The gamer even checked into a Premier Inn (pictured) near to her home before scoping out the area, prior to the attack. Miss Dowlut's brother suffered injuries during the incident . Coffey, who has been jailed for more than eight years, smuggled this hunting knife through customs . In March, after a big argument, Miss Dowlut told Coffey to 'get out of her life.' But Coffey then secretly booked a flight to the UK. He arrived in April last year, having smuggled a Schrade combat and hunting knife in through customs, along with cable ties, tape and gloves. He then scoped out Miss Dowlut's home after getting a taxi to the area. He then launched the frenzied attack. Following the sentencing last November, Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Antony Archibald said: 'This was an extremely frightening incident for the family, carried out by a troubled man who carefully planned the attack with disturbing precision. 'We have no doubt that Coffey intended to kill that night and he may have done had it not been for the brave and courageous actions of the family members who stopped him.'","Shane Coffey, 20, from Boston, U.S, flew to the UK to carry out the attack .

"For identical twins, their lives could hardly be more different. Jalila Henry, 21, is described as a ‘party girl’ who drinks and smokes, wears revealing outfits and enjoys watching The Only Way is Essex. In stark contrast, her Muslim convert sister, Jamila, is teetotal, wears a traditional headscarf and spends her spare time studying the Koran. Jamila Henry, left, who has been detained in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join ISIS. Her twin sister Jalila in stark contrast is described as a party girl who smokes and drinks . But this week they were involved in an extraordinary case of mistaken identity after Jamila was seized by Turkish security services allegedly en route to join jihadi group Islamic State – travelling on her twin’s passport. Confusion arose in Britain after Turkish authorities named the arrested woman as Jalila – prompting one relative to joke that she was more likely to have ended up in the country after getting carried away after a night of partying. Jamila remained in Turkey last night awaiting deportation hearings to get her back to the UK, where she could face arrest on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. British authorities are not believed to have played any part in her arrest and the decision to arrest her was made by Turkish agents. Daughters of a painter and decorator father and council housing officer mother, the Henry twins were described as ‘popular and polite’ in their youth. It has been claimed that Jamila tried to travel to Syria using her sister's passport, pictured . A fellow pupil at Sellincourt Primary School in Wandsworth, South London, said: ‘They were very nice, friendly, hard-working girls. I can’t imagine one of them ever wanting to join Islamic State.’ But as the twins grew up, they began to head in very different directions. Pictures on Jalila’s Facebook page show her smoking – with joking comments from friends about being a ‘weed head’. Other photos show her in a bar clutching two bottles of drink and going out wearing short skirts and a bikini tops. Her ‘likes’ include reality TV shows and modern musicians and rap stars, including Eminem. In contrast, the only pictures of Jamila show her dressed in a head scarf. Relatives said she converted to Islam a few years ago and they have had little contact with her since. One said: ‘They are identical twins. If it is the Muslim one, it is Jamila. The one who is not Muslim is Jalila. ‘She is definitely not religious and drinks and smokes. Frankly, she’s a bit of a party girl. She’s the kind of person who would get drunk and end up in Turkey.’ Jamila was arrested by Turkish security services as she prepared to board a bus in the capital Ankara. Agents suspect she was trying to travel to the border with Syria. Turkish officials said authorities apprehended the woman based on local intelligence and were not tipped off by British authorities. Messages and images on her mobile phone suggested she was planning to head to Islamic State territory, they alleged. Messages and images on Jamila's mobile phone suggested she was planning to head to Islamic State territory. Pictured is an ISIS member in the Syrian city of Raqqa . At her flat in Balham, South London, yesterday, Jalila would say only that she had ‘loads to sort out’. At her £500,000 home in nearby Streatham, the twins’ mother, Patricia Henry, 50, said she was ‘getting together with her relatives’ to discuss how to respond to the arrest. Their Guyanan-born father, Kirk Ramsammy, has recently been treated in hospital and was not at his South London home yesterday. Security services estimate 600 Britons have gone to Syria or Iraq to join militant groups.","Jamila and Jalila Henry, 21, are identical twin sisters from south London .

"A 21-year-old woman has been arrested by counter terror police at Luton Airport after landing on a flight from Istanbul. The woman, a British national, remains in the custody of Scotland Yard officers after being detained this morning. Her arrest comes days after three teenage boys were stopped by police as they tried to enter Syria from the Turkish capital. A 21-year-old woman was arrested at Luton Airport this morning as she landed on a flight from Istanbul . 'This morning at 11.15am officers from the Counter Terrorism Unit SO15 arrested a 21-year-old woman at Luton Airport on suspicion of preparation of acts of terrorism under section 5 of the terrorism act,' a Scotland Yard spokesman said. 'The woman, a British national, was arrested as she entered the UK having landed on a flight from Istanbul. She is currently in custody.' It is not clear whether the woman had been in Syria before leaving Turkey. Earlier this week three teenage boys were stopped as they tried to join jihadis in the war-ravaged country. The youngsters, described as 'naive' sixth form students, were caught by officials when their parents phoned police to report concerns. They were put on a flight back to London last week and questioned by counter terrorism police. Three London schoolgirls have also fled the UK to join extremists in the Middle East.

"Nuisance calls: More than 90million numbers were reportedly held by the firm – the equivalent of more than one for every person in the UK (file image) A company on an industrial estate is believed to make up to six million nuisance phone calls a day. The call centre used sophisticated technology to leave ‘millions upon millions’ of anonymous recorded messages on mobiles and landlines. More than 90million numbers were reportedly held by the firm – the equivalent of more than one for every person in the UK. The Information Commissioner’s Office, which carried out a raid on the company, said it appeared to have ‘cornered’ a sizeable proportion of the cold-call market. The small office, in Hove, East Sussex, is said to have bombarded people with offers to consolidate their debts or help them pursue a compensation claim for mis-sold payment protection insurance. The business apparently made between four and six million approaches a day – equivalent to calling every member of the population two to three times a month. The ICO launched an investigation after it received ‘hundreds’ of complaints about nuisance calls from multiple numbers linked to the firm. Many complaints came from vulnerable and elderly people ‘frightened’ by the barrage of calls. Investigators said the centre would routinely call every number in its database via an automatic computer system, and – after exhausting the list – would restart the process. The call centre, which has not been named, technically ‘does not exist’ in records, but is believed to be linked to an offshore firm registered in the British Virgin Islands. It is not clear how long it has been operating. The ICO said it was a complex operation on an ‘astounding’ scale. Anyone who expressed an interest in the service offered – by pressing the number 9 on their phone – was called back by one of 50 call centre workers, it is claimed. It is believed the firm may have then sold the details of these customers to other companies, some of which appear to have shared directors and staff with the centre. Communications Minister Ed Vaizey said last night that such raids ‘show the kind of menace we are dealing with’. The ICO’s David Clancy, who carried out a month-long investigation into the call centre, said: ‘Our intelligence has identified this address as being responsible for making millions upon millions of recorded messages. The office, which is run from Gemini Business Centre in Hove, East Sussex, above, is said to have bombarded people with offers to consolidate debts or help them pursue compensation claim for mis-sold PPI . ‘It is astounding to think this one small company has the ability to pester millions of people with unwanted calls on a huge scale.’ It comes a month after ministers vowed to clamp down on rogue cold-call firms and make it easier to punish offenders. Watchdogs must currently prove that victims suffered ‘substantial harm or distress’ for a civil prosecution. But that threshold will be scrapped from April 6 when a single complaint will be enough for legal action. They will be able to fine bosses of such companies as much as £500,000. The existing penalty is £5,000. The Government introduced the tougher measures after hearing evidence that six in ten households are reluctant to answer the phone because of nuisance calling. The ICO said the company invited victims to press nine to speak to a call handler regarding a PPI claim, or five to stop the calls. But there is evidence those who pressed five continued to be harassed, Mr Clancy said. It is not known how the centre obtained the 90million numbers. If it emerges the firm was passing on the details it held without being authorised, a criminal rather than civil investigation can be launched. Mr Clancy said: ‘I have never seen an operation of this size. Those targeted will have included the elderly or people vulnerable for other reasons. We received a vast number of complaints from hundreds of people who were frightened by these calls.’ He added that it is not known how much profit the company made, but that these sorts of operations tend to make at least six-figure sums. It is unclear whether the firm, which is run from Gemini Business Centre in Hove, alongside 30 other businesses, will continue to operate during the investigation. Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price, of the all-party group on nuisance calls, urged authorities to ‘name and shame’ firms using the call centre.

"Today, the President will commemorate the hundreds of people brutally attacked on a bridge in Selma 50 years ago during a peaceful protest for racial equality. But just this week, a billboard was erected within sight of the historic location in memory of a Ku Klux Klan founder Nathan Bedford Forrest. It has prompted outrage in the Alabama city as many claim it demonstrates underlying racial tensions that linger half a century after the march. The sign, bearing a portrait of Forrest on horseback and a Confederate flag, stands at the foot of Edmund Pettus Bridge - which is named after a former KKK Grand Wizard. Scroll down for video .

On the reverse, it reads: 'SelmaPostHerald.com welcomes President Barack Obama And You To Selma.' Beneath his image, Forrest's rallying cry urging men to frighten their enemies is printed: 'Keep the skeer [scare] on 'em!' Forrest was the first Grand Wizard of the KKK soon after the anti-black group formed in Tennessee in 1866. According to Andrew Ward, author of the Civil War account River Run Red, Forrest was part of an off-shoot of the clan that opted for violence when they found black people would not voluntarily return to a state of slavery. 'In the spring of 1867,' Ward writes, 'Forrest and his dragoons launched a campaign of midnight parades; ""ghost"" masquerades; and ""whipping"" and even ""killing Negro voters and white Republicans, to scare blacks off voting and running for office.""' Horrific: Police beat scores of people (pictured) who were marching from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, the state capital, to protest against their lack of voting rights . Commemoration: State troopers were pictures using clubs to beat pro-civil rights protesters at the march . March: In this March 21, 1965 file photo, Dr. Martin Luther King, foreground row, fifth from right, is seen waving as marchers stream across the Alabama River on the first of a 5-day march to the state capitol, Montgomery . Forrest was one of the richest men in the South before America's Civil War. He owned a cotton plantation and numerous slaves, trafficked via his own slave-trading business in Memphis. During the war he was hailed as a 'brilliant strategist' for leading 1,600 Confederate soldiers to attack Fort Pillow in Tennessee. After winning the battle, he selected 200 black soldiers to be slaughtered. All white soldiers were allowed to surrender and survive. When the war ended, he joined the KKK and became its first leader. The tribute was erected by the group Friends Of Forrest, run by 'wizardess' Pat Goodwin, who refers to the Selma march as 'the mother of all orgies,' according to the LA Times. With hours until the Bloody Sunday commemorations begin in Selma, people have taken to social media in outrage at the billboard. One Twitter user wrote: 'Disgusting! Take the billboard down immediately.' Another said: 'That billboard has to come DOWN. Despicable!' In a statement to the New York Daily News, Goodwin said: 'That billboard was put there with positive intent to ask people who come to Selma to explore and enjoy our 19th century history. 'Does it say anything in the Constitution where a certain faction of people cannot be offended? 'I'm offended by all these people walking around with their pants hanging around their knees.' During a speech at at South Carolina's Benedict College on Friday, the President also hinted at what he will speak about on Edmund Pettus Bridge tomorrow, which is the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march. He said the commemoration is as much about stirring young people to change as it is about honoring past legends - and about 'the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things'. 'Selma is not just about commemorating the past, it's about honoring the legends who helped change this country through your actions today, in the here and now,' Obama said. 'Selma is about the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things because they believe they can change the country, they can shape our nation's destiny. President Barack Obama (pictured on Friday) is going to Selma to mark a half-century since 'Bloody Sunday' Damning report: 'It turns out they weren't just making it up. This was happening,' Obama said, making reference to the Justice Department's damning report on blacks-targeted racial bias in the St Louis suburb . 'Selma's about each of us asking ourselves what we can do to make America better. And historically, it's been young people like you who help lead that march.' He added: 'It was young people who stubbornly insisted on justice', noting that one of the most famous leaders of the Selma march - now Georgia Rep. John Lewis - was just 23 at the time. '[They] stubbornly refused to accept the world as it is that transformed not just the country but transformed the world,' he concluded. The visit was Obama's first to South Carolina as President. South Dakota and Utah are now the only states he has not traveled to while in office. In a radio interview broadcast earlier today, Obama said improving civil rights and liberties with police is an area that 'requires collective action and mobilization'.","Billboard of KKK founder Nathan Bedford Forrest put up this week .

"An Ohio 17-year-old girl has been arrested after she allegedly pulled a prank by tying herself up and covering her mouth with duct tape before having a boy drive her to a Taco Bell drive thru. The teenager was seen by the Akron Taco Bell workers as she sat bound with duct tape inside a Ford Explorer a friend was driving. Concerned staff member Ashley Boyer, 19, called the police just before midnight on Wednesday and alerted them of what looked to be a kidnapping because 'the female passenger gave her a look like she needed help'. A 17-year-old girl and a male friend were arrested after faking a kidnapping in a Taco Bell drive through and later told the police they did the prank because 'they were bored' Police spent several hours trying to find the SUV, according the the Beacon Journal. The questioned the couple, who told the police that they were 'bored and just playing around'. Concerned Taco Bell staff member Ashley Boyer called the police  'the female passenger gave her a look like she needed help' The girl and the driver have not been identified because they are juveniles each facing a misdemeanor charge of delinquency by means of inducing panic. This comes after Akron Police announced earlier this week that a man who has relieved himself on nearly 20 cars over a period of two years is being sought by the city. The latest incident took place in Akron early on Wednesday morning. The culprit was photographed by a resident who happened to see the man in action. Last month a group of people were arrested after a mother, grandmother, aunt and her co-worker were arrested for staging the kidnapping of the mother's six-year-old son to teach him a lesson about stranger danger. The incident took place Troy, Missouri, where Lincoln County sheriff’s deputies say the child was lured into a pickup truck by the co-worker while he was walking home from school. Once inside the truck, Firoved told him he would never ‘see his mommy again’, and he would be ‘nailed to the wall of a shed’ Fox 2 reported. The crying child was then shown a gun and threats were made to hurt him if he did not stop crying. The boy’s hands and feet were then bound with plastic bags and he was blindfolded with a jacket. His aunt then removed the boy’s pants, told him he could be sold into sex slavery and shouted at him for not resisting either her or Firoved.","The 17-year-old girl and her friend were arrested after midnight Thursday .

"The captivating motion of various satellites orbiting our planet has been revealed in a fascinating Nasa video. Created by the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, it shows their entire Earth-observation fleet and the paths they take around Earth. While the ISS sweeps across ‘diagonally’, in the video at least, others like the Landsat series are seen travelling from pole to pole. Scroll down for video . Nasa scientists in Maryland, US have created a satellite visualisation (shown). It shows dozens of Earth-observing satellites currently orbiting our planet. They include Landsat 7 and 8, part of Nasa's long-serving series. And the ISS can also be seen sweeping diagonally across Earth . The animation solely shows Nasa's Earth-observing satellites, and not any run by other space agencies or private organisations. The satellites measure rainfall, solar irradiance, clouds, sea surface height, ocean salinity and other aspects of the global environment. ‘Together, they provide a picture of the Earth as a system,’ said Nasa. The animation shows the day of 16 February 2015 from 00.00 GMT to 12.00 GMT. While the satellites might look close together, the amount of space in Earth orbit is vast, and there is little to no chance of any colliding. In fact, they are all placed on specific orbits within their orbital bands that ensure the minimal chance possible of colliding with another satellite. This doesn't always go to plan, though. In 2009, a US Iridium satellite and a defunct Russian Cosmos satellite collided, creating hundreds of new pieces of debris in orbit. But the precision of modern satellites is best seen by a quartet of satellites known as the ‘A-train’ - Aqua, Aura, CloudSat and Calipso - which follow each other closely in their orbits. The two closest, Cloudsat and Calipso, are just 12.5 seconds apart, but this equates to 58 miles (93km) in distance. The four satellites work together to provide even better observations of Earth. ‘It’s acting like one satellite with 15 instruments onboard,’ Ernie Wright, an animator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre, told Wired, referring to the 15 instruments shared between them. The Landsat series of satellites have, since 1972, been used to measure Earth’s continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored. Shown is an illustration of Landsat 8, which launched on 11 February 2013 . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. Some satellites, like Landsat 7 and 8, orbit from pole to pole, known as a polar orbit. This allows them to see almost the entirety of Earth as the globe rotates underneath them. The Landsat series of satellites have, since 1972, been used to measure Earth’s continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored. The ISS, meanwhile, has a diagonal orbit that keeps it relatively near the equator, which enables various command centres across the world to stay in contact with the crew. Recently launched satellites on the animation include the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, which measures the surface soil moisture on Earth, and was launched on 31 January 2015. A full list of the satellites and their missions is available at Nasa’s Scientific Visualisation Studio website. The ISS has a diagonal orbit that keeps it relatively near the equator (shown), which enables various command centres across the world to stay in contact with the crew. As the Earth rotates underneath, the ISS appears to move up and down in curves, although in reality it is always moving in one direction .","Nasa scientists in Maryland, US have created a satellite visualisation .

"Professor Patrick Pullicino, a leading neurologist who has criticised plans to ask every ill or elderly person if they want to die at home or in hospital . A plan to draw up a ‘death list’ of how every ill or elderly person wants to die has been criticised as a dangerous and worrying idea. The influential Commons Health Select Committee yesterday called for a new database listing whether people would prefer to die at home or in hospital. They said two-thirds want to spend their final days at home – but half still die in hospital. A register of preferred options would help to stop this happening, MPs on the committee said. But Professor Patrick Pullicino, a leading neurologist, said the plan simply perpetuates the ‘central flaw’ of the discredited Liverpool Care Pathway. The professor, who was the first senior doctor to expose the failures of the LCP three years ago, said such a register carried huge risks. Those who wished to die at home might be denied essential care, said Professor Pullicino, a consultant neurologist with East Kent Universities NHS Foundation Trust. He also said it was not possible to know when a person will die. The LCP was abolished last July following several examples of ‘shocking’ abuse, many of them unveiled by the Daily Mail. Many families complained that their relatives were sedated with a ‘chemical cosh’ then killed by the removal of food and fluids, leading Care Services Minister Norman Lamb to denounce the LCP as a ‘national disgrace’. Professor Pullicino said the latest plan risked making the same mistakes. ‘This predication of a specific line of treatment on a prognostication of imminent death that is not evidence-based was the central flaw of the LCP and is perpetuated in this report.’ Research into the question of how to diagnose imminent death accurately was ‘completely absent from the list’ of priorities in the report, he added. The doctor said the danger was particularly acute for those with dementia. Around two-thirds of people want to spend their final days at home – but half still die in hospital (file picture) The report was also criticised by Dr Tony Cole, chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance, a pro-life group of medical organisations. ‘There have always been difficulties in predicting imminent death,’ he said. ‘A patient at the end of life may also have a treatable condition which could be relieved. People making their own end of life plan may not have foreseen this.’ The MPs’ report says most people who express a preference say they would like to die at home but this was made difficult by disparate community palliative care services. Sarah Wootton, of Dignity in Dying, the assisted suicide lobby group, said there was ‘a real need for greater information and support for people approaching the end of life to enable them to plan ahead’.","Plans will let every ill and elderly person say how they will want to die .

"The Gulf Stream, the ocean current that brings mild weather to northern Europe and balmy conditions to the south east of the US, is slowing at its fastest rate in  1,000 years. New research has revealed that the enormous currents that circulate warm and cold water around the Atlantic ocean has slowed by 15-20 per cent over the past century. Scientists say that the increasing flow of fresh water from melting Greenland ice sheets may be driving the slowdown. The graphic above shows the sea in the North Atlantic is cooler than the surrounding ocean due to the influx of fresh water from the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which has slowed the gulf stream, say scientists . Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, an oceans physicist at the Potsdam Insittute for Climate Impact Research, said: 'It is conspicuous that one specific area in the North Atlantic has been cooling in the past hundred years while the rest of the world heats up. 'Now we have detected strong evidence that the global conveyor has indeed been weakening in the past hundred years, particularly since 1970. Climate change could make the food we eat taste worse, according to recent research. A major report on the impact of global warming on food has predicted that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase. The researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common, meat like chicken and beef will become stringier and tougher. Carrots are likely to lose their flavour and develop a less pleasant texture. Beetroots and onions will become smaller while milk will contain less protein needed to make cheese. A separate study by marine biologists has also shown that  shellfish will take on a sour flavour as our oceans acidify. They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising. Shrimp raised in water with a lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting, while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. The findings suggest that as global temperatures rise due to climate change, areas that are warmed by the Gulf Stream could see temperatures fall, particularly in the winter. The Gulf Stream is a powerful current that forms part of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This is a system of currents that are driven by the rising and sinking of water in different regions of the Atlantic. Warm water from the equator is driven north towards the Artic where it cools, increases in salinity and sinks to the ocean depths. This drives deep sea currents that pump water back to the equator, where it is warmed, rising to the surface and feeding the currents towards the pole. In the Arctic, cold salty water sinks to the ocean depths, driving deep sea currents down to the equator where warmer water then rises to the surface and feeds the Gulf Stream. The influx of warm water from the equator, which travels up through the Gulf of Mexico, past Maine and then up the west side of Britain and Norway, helps to warm weather systems in Northern Europe. It makes winter conditions in much of northern Europe far milder than they normally would be, keeping Britain and the west coast of Norway largely snow and ice free through the winter months. The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the sea in the northern Atlantic is colder than predicted by computer models. They estimate that 8,000 cubic kilometres of fresh melt water haver flowed into the northern Atlantic from Greenland's icesheets between 1900 and 1970. The North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is the northwards flow of warm surface water (shown in red by in the graphic above) and the southwards flow of cold water in the deep ocean (shown in blue) They say between 1970 and 2000 an additional 13,000 cubic kilometres of fresh water has poured into the Atlantic from Greenland. This fresh water is less dense than the salty water of the ocean and tends to float on the surface, disturbing the balance that causes cold water to sink in that region. Usually freezing sea ice in the arctic causes the salinity of the ocean water to increase and so become more dense. Adding fresh water dilutes this effect. Using recent sea surface and atmospheric temperature data, along with data from ice-cores, tree rings and sediments, they found that the changes in the ocean currents are unprecedented since the year 900AD. However, the researchers also found that the cooling above the Northern Atlantic may also help to slightly reduce the effect of warming on the continents due to climate change. The melting of Greenland's ice sheets (above) is leading to an influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic . They warn, however, that if the circulation weakens too much it could even break down completely. Professor Ramhmstorf said: 'If the slowdown of the Atlantic overturning continues, the impacts might be substantial. 'Disturbing the circulation will likely have a negative effect on the ocean ecosystem, and thereby fisheries and the associated livelihoods of many people in coastal areas. 'A slowdown also adds to the regional sea-level rise affecting cities like New York and Boston. 'Finally, temperature changes in that region can also influence weather systems on both sides of the Atlantic, in North America as well as Europe.' Professor Jason Box, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, said it appeared man-made climate change was responsible for the slow down of the Gulf Stream and may worsen as global temperatures increase. He said: 'The human-caused mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet appears to be slowing down the Atlantic overturning – and this effect might increase if temperatures are allowed to rise further.'","Scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research found the sea in the North Atlantic ocean is far colder than computer models predict .
They say ocean currents that drive the Gulf Stream has slowed by 15-20% .
The researchers claim fresh water from melting ice sheets may be to blame .
They say flow of melt water has accelerated recently due to climate change .
Weakened Gulf Stream may mean more severe winters in northern Europe .
Water temperatures around Florida and east coast of US could also suffer ."
"Australia Day, summer festivals and our myriad of sporting events are all seen as signs that Australians are happy and joyful, but we aren't as positive as we may think. On International Happiness Day it has become apparent that Australian's really aren't all that cheery, with the nation rating a shocking 43rd out of 143 countries on a world happiness scale. Gallup's Positive Experience Index shows that Latin Americans are the most happy people on the planet, taking up the winning ten spots in the poll. The people of Paraguay were found the be the happiest in the world with an Index rating of 89, 18 points above the mean . Australia has ranked lower on the Positive Experience Index than the African country Rwanda, . Australia however, ranks lower than Argentina, Bhutan, Rwanda, the United States, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Mexico, Kenya, Nigeria and 34 others. According to the poll, Australia has the same happiness level (index) as Austria, China, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Telephone and face-to-face interviews with 1000 adults from each country are used to collect the data through questions asked about their happiness levels from the previous day. The rankings are decided after gathering the answers to a series of questions such as did you feel well-rested yesterday? Were you treated with respect? Did you smile and laugh a lot? Bringing up the rear was Sudan with a score of more than 20 points lower than the mean . The top ten countries were all from Latin America which is the first time in ten years of global tracking this has occured . Mexico ranked 40th in the poll, three spots above Australia and reported more positive experiences . Apparently Australian didn't laugh a lot the previous day. Although we are ranked lower than perhaps expected, the overall score from the poll has remained fairly consistent to previous years with a world index score of 71. Australia is placed just four points above this mean with a score of 75. According to the poll, at least 70 percent of people around the world laugh and smile whilst experiencing enjoyment in their everyday lives and 50 percent said they learnt or did something interesting the previous day. This is the first time in ten years of global tracking that all of the top countries on the index are in Latin America. The countries experiencing dampened spirits and the lowest positive emotions worldwide were Afghanistan, Nepal, Lithuania, Georgia, Bosnia, Turkey, Serbia, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Sudan bringing up the rear. Telephone and face-to-face interviews with 1000 adults from each country are used to collect the data through questions asked about their happiness levels from the previous day . Through International Day of Happiness, the United Nations stress the importance of connections with others . The entire Middle East and North Africa (except Saudi Arabia) have scores lower than the global mean. However, it is surprising that conflict-torn Afghanistan documented that they laughed and smiled a lot the day before the interview. Through the third annual International Day of Happiness, the United Nations  stress the importance of connections with others, especially in vibrant and crowded cities which incites social isolation. The aim of the day is to share positive messages with others through all mediums.","Australia ranked lower than 42 other countries in a world happiness scale .

"The missing Philae space probe that bumped down onto the surface of a comet 284 million miles from Earth could wake up from today. Scientists at the European Space Agency have restarted efforts to listen for a signal from the stricken lander on comet 67p/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. They lost contact with the washing-machine sized spacecraft in November last year after it bounced several times before landing in a hollow below a cliff. Starved of the sunlight it needed to power its suite of experiments, the lander's batteries went flat after around just 60 hours on the surface. ESA scientists have renewed efforts to contact the Philae lander on Comet 67p, shown in the illustration above . However, as the comet has travelled closer to the sun in its journey through the solar system, researchers hope Philae will get enough light to come back to life. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. The European Space Agency has now turned on the communication unit on the Rosetta spacecraft that is orbiting the comet. Stephen Ulamec, lander project manager at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), said: 'Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year. 'It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.' Comet 67p is now 186 million miles (300 million km) from the sun. Scientists hope that as the comet rotates and gets closer to the sun, Philae's solar panels will move out of the shade of the cliff it is resting under. Philae touched down on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November, but rather than landing softly, the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice. It first bounced to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then 65ft (20 metres) before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground. Blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air. Scientists described the comet's surface as being more like a trampoline, causing the probe to rebound so far. It is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site. The Rosetta orbiter took a number of images of Philae as it bounced, with its final suspected resting place in the top right. However, further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe . The duck-shaped comet 67p/Churyumove-Geraismenko is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does . This image sent back by the Philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face . Scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership Rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe. Philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander. Before its batteries finally ran out, Philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images. Among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet's surface appears to be made of a very hard 'sintered' ice. This graphic shows how Philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet . Researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life. From several miles above the comet, Rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived. But there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander's solar panels. This would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board. The image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the Rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the Philea lander . Comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in August this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander. Philae requires its internal temperature to reach at least -45 degrees C before it can wake up. It will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up. Once awake, Philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the Rosetta orbiter. Koen Guerts, part of the Philae lander team at the DLR Control Centre, said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home. He said: 'Philae is designed so that, since November 2014, it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up.' 'At this time, we do not yet know that the lander is awake.To send us an answer, Philae must also turn its transmitter – and that requires additional power.' This blurry image captures the moment Philae bounced from the comet's surface after failing to anchor itself . Rosetta captured a mothership's view of Philae as it descended to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface . Philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two-way communication. Over the next eight days the Rosetta orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 flybys. Engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to optimise the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with Earth. Once Philae wakes up and can also transmit, it will first send data about its 'health' to Earth. The scientific work with the 10 instruments on board Philae also depends on these results. If sufficient energy cannot be stored in the battery, the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed. Currently, scientists believe that Philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys. Mr Ulamec added: 'Once we can communicate with Philae again, the scientific work can begin.'","European Space Agency has begun attempting to contact the lost probe .

"It's complicated, but there I was in a Sandals resort in Grenada, not with my wife Gillian but with my best friend from university, Charlotte Metcalf. By coincidence we had pitched up together to review the 14th in the Sandals chain. Neither of us had been before, but Couples Only? Weddings on the beach? Charlotte and I, both hard-bitten travellers, were set to sneer. Sandals La Source has 225 suites spread over three ‘villages’ in a small sandy bay. On arrival Ritchie, the manager, tells me his philosophy is ‘to give guests more than they expect’, and at first glance it’s hard to tell who’s happier – the 350 guests or the 500 staff. Certainly everyone appears to be grinning constantly, as if part of a cult - the Sandalistas. Among Sandals LaSource Grenada's 225 suites is the Skypool, with this stunning private infinity pool . The three 'village' luxury all-inclusive resort hosts 350 guests with 500 staff . Our personal butlers, trained by the Guild of Professional English Butlers, take us to our (separate) rooms. Charlotte’s giant suite features a black marble bath and a terrace with plunge pool and Jacuzzi. Meanwhile, I follow my butler, Marcus, up to my Oceanview Skypool Penthouse. Marcus hands me a mobile telephone and says: ‘Anything you need, I’m a phone call away.’ From my private infinity pool, I look out over the fort, and reflect on what I know about Grenada. It is mountainous, measuring just 12 miles by 21, with a population of 110,000, a high level of literacy and land ownership, and one of the lowest crime figures in the Caribbean. The island’s recent peaceful history has emerged from two tempests. One was a natural phenomenon, Hurricane Ivan, that struck in September 2004 and destroyed 85 per cent of houses and vegetation, including Grenada’s precious nutmeg trees. Sandals La Source is situated on a sandy bay on mountainous Grenada, an island just 12 by 21 miles . Among the resort's shared facilities is three freshwater swimming pools including this in the 'Pink Gin' village . The second was political: the 1983 Marxist coup in which Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was killed – a move that prompted Ronald Reagan to land 6,000 US troops on what was part of the Commonwealth. My father was a Foreign Office diplomat at the time, and he recalls meeting the Queen shortly after the invasion. She was furious. Charlotte and I find the scale of the resort overwhelming. There are nine restaurants, several bars, and even an English pub. After some fishing, during which I catch and release a 200lb blue marlin, I land an audience with the island’s popular Prime Minister. Dr Keith Mitchell greets us barefoot at his official residence, where we chat about Grenada’s future as an eco-tourist centre and its current peace and stability, which he ascribes to his people’s inherently cheerful nature. The Sandals resort occupies the heart of Grenada's exclusive Pink Gin Beach . Writer Nicholas Shakespeare enjoys a pedalo ride with his friend Charlotte Metcalf . The South Seas Butler Suite's living room opens up to a trellised veranda with a private plunge pool . Back at La Source, Charlotte and I attend a beach ‘Re-Tie The Knot’ ceremony. Two couples, from Halifax and Leicester, both married for more than 20 years, arrive for a moving service conducted with palpable delight by Baptist pastor Stanford Simon, looking splendid in lime-green linen. Sandals (0800 597 0002) offers seven nights at Sandals LaSource Grenada Resort & Spa from £1,629pp. This includes Luxury Included (all-inclusive) accommodation in a South Seas Hideaway Junior Suite with Balcony Tranquility Soaking Tub, return flights from London and resort transfers. Valid for travel between September 1 and October 20, 2015. There are tears of joy as well as laughter as Karen and Jenny, both in full-length cream and carrying white orchids, walk up the jetty to a small pavilion hanging over the sea to repledge their love to husbands Phil and Kieron respectively. The staff are in white waistcoats and ties for the occasion. The couples have prepared statements to read to each other, giving thanks for the love and lives they share. It is the simplest, most genuine and therefore the most profoundly moving service I’ve been to… well, since my own wedding. Charlotte and I weep openly. Sandals is victorious – cynicism is slain.","Sandals La Source in Grenada has 225 suites spread over three ‘villages’
